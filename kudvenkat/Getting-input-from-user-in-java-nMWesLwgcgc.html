tutorial onwards we are going to do some
serious programming and we will use
Eclipse IDE for writing our programs in
our previous tutorials you have learned
how to setup Eclipse IDE I hope you have
setup Eclipse IDE and install java on
your local machine so in this tutorial
we are going to understand first of all
what are Java packages we have discussed
this in brief in our previous tutorial
but in this tutorial we are going to go
little bit deep into packages then we
will understand the main theme of this
tutorial how do we take input from users
so far we have been assigning the values
directly to variables however wouldn't
it be good if we asked user to input
some values so that the our program acts
on them in order to understand how to
take input from user streams and
scanners will the utilities that we will
be going to use so let's get started
first of all we will create a sample
project in Eclipse you go to file new
Java project and let's say I call my
project sample project you will see that
this project is created with just one
directory una source I would like to
show you here your so sample project has
one dot project file one dot class path
file and one dot settings folder these
three things are particularly for
Eclipse projects so you can ignore them
then you have a source folder in which
we will be creating our source code once
that code is compiled you will see the
output in bin directory right now both
are empty
now I come back to eclipse on the source
folder I right-click and I add a package
note that packages are used in Java in
order to prevent the naming conflicts or
to control the searching of location of
various kind of classes you can
understand package as some kind of
grouping of related classes and the
naming conventions of package is such
that is my complete name is dr. octo
amazon.com then I will try to keep my
package name as reverse of the that
shrink like com dot Amazon something for
example here I can write calm dot
training dot Java it is just a
convention but people smoothly use that
calm dot company name dot and then you
add your further specifications so note
that after writing calm door training
your Java when I click finish a package
was created here an inside package I can
right click and I can create a simple
class let's say I call my project sample
class and then in sample class if I type
mean and I press control space a clip
shows that I think you need public
static void main string er yes I just
press ENTER and Eclipse IDE is helping
me out by writing a code for me and then
here I want to write system dot out dot
println hello world so I write this out
again I press control space and it lips
helps me by completing that to system
dot out dot println here I write hello
world
right and I save the program by pressing
ctrl s when I click on run on this
toolbar you will see that the output
appears in console window at bottom of
the Eclipse now let's do some analysis
in our folder structure so what package
name did we create comm dot training dot
java so when I go inside source I see a
folder comm then I see a folder training
then I see a folder Java and then I see
the class sample class store Java got it
and then when you compile it it then
inside bin folder you will see the
similar hierarchy comm training Java
sample class dot class that means when
that class was compiled when the Java
file was compiled we got a dot class
file in the scribbler folder structure
that is defined by the package I hope
this is clear now let's move on to
understanding streams this streams are
simply objects that represent source or
destination of data in Java either we
take input from some source or we put
data to some destination most of most
often when you are writing simple
programs or you're participating in
competitive programming competitions you
will read input from console in such
scenarios system dot in becomes the
de-facto input input channel and this
represents the order sequence of bytes
in in Java we essentially have three
main streams which are initialized by
the Java Runtime when the JVM starts up
so you don't have to instantiate any of
these strings yourselves you can expect
them to be available system dot in is
the input stream which is typically
connected to keyboard input so whatever
you type from the keyboard that though
that input in the form of tokens comes
wire system dot in system dot out is the
print stream where system dot out
normally outputs the data to the console
now system dot error is a interesting
stream which is similar to system got
out except that it is you so put the
error text some of the ID is play
Eclipse will show the output will show
the output sent to systems of error in
red text to make it more obvious that
this is an error right now let's write
some example so I come back to this this
place and here I want to use some stream
so input stream is a class provided by
Java and after I write Eclipse save that
it doesn't recognize this class so I
press control space Eclipse shows me
that you can import string input strings
so I press ENTER and you will observe
that import Java I Oh dot inputs in
package gets imported once the package
that's imported you can use the classes
in that package so I write import shrimp
input is equal to new
let's say I have a file in my sample
project I have a file called twin which
I have written ABCDE and I save it as I
inside my sample project I save this as
a hello dot txt now what I want is I
want to read this file hello dot txt
I would like to import file input stream
also and now you will observe that
Eclipse still shows an error that what
if this file does not exist
I want to show the error or throw an
exception whenever I am not able to do
something so we will just hover on this
and it will so shows that you can throw
the error in case something is having a
problem I add throws
filenotfoundexception note that we will
learn about exception different type of
exceptions and how to handle them in
detail in separate tutorial for now just
assume that we are trying to read a file
using input stream right now if I write
system dot out dot println
file open now let's run this program you
will find that this our program prints
hello world and file open because this
file was found if this file was not
found instead of hello if I right world
dot txt which is a file which I don't
have then in the scenario it will throw
an exception file not found exception it
says that world dot txt is not found
same way if I mean if I put it back to
hello dot txt and instead of system dot
out dot println if I write system dot e
RR that is error dot println then let's
see what happens you will see that
anything which is written to error
stream is written in red color so as to
tell you as something is wrong I hope
this clarifies the basic idea of system
dot grr error stream and now let's go
back to our main theme of the project
how do we read the input in order to
read the input we are going to use a
special utility class called scanner now
scanner is a very interesting class
which breaks the input into tokens using
a delimiter so what happens is from this
input stream whatever input is coming it
is broken into token the tokens are
separated to each other by the default
delimiter which is whitespace you can
change the delimiter if you want by
using the delimiter function so let's
get started what I will do is I will
create a scanner
I create a scanner instance I pass it
system got in I am trying to say that
create a scanner object by reading the
input from system not in once you have
this you can start reading it for
example retaining
so I write enter your name and once
someone will enter the name I want to
read it out I can say string name is
equal to scanner dot scanner dot next
and then I can say your name it is name
so let's execute this on console you
will see enter your name I enter my name
and it prints out back your name is
Deepak now if you want to enter
something else like enter your age
instead of next you can have int 8 is
equal to scanner dot next Inc that means
I am expecting the next token to be
passed and read as integer you will have
similar functions for all the primitive
data types you will have next int you
have you will have next byte next short
next and so on here I am showing you
next int so then I can write your ages
fine let's execute this program again
your age is 30 years right now let's
come back
apart from next you have functions like
mix line which returns the next line is
a string you also have functions like
next byte which returns the next token
is byte you also have next integer make
short and so on I would encourage you to
open up your IDE all yours notepad and
start writing some programs in Java
which takes input from user one of the
simple program that I would suggest you
to try is take two numbers from user and
add them and print the result
so in this tutorial we learnt about
packages how they define the hierarchy
of classes and the output output binary
folder we also learned how to use the
scanner to read the input we also
realized that streams are of three types
system dot out system dot in in system
no tiara these three streams are
instantiated or initialized by your java
virtual machine Java Runtime and the
Jigen starts up and you do not have to
instantiate any of these strings
yourself but you can just use them and
that was it for this tutorial
stay tuned thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
