rancor this is part 19 introduction to
classes in this session we will learn
what it classes purpose of a class
constructor overloading class
constructors understanding this keyword
and destructors so what is a class so
far in this video tutorial we have seen
very simple data types like individual
flu double boolean etc now if you want
to create a complex custom type then we
can make use of classes what do we mean
by a complex custom type let's say for
example if I want to student number I
can do that using an integer variable
but if I want to do my customer
information then I can make use of
classes what kind of information this
customer has has first name last name
date of birth email etc now using the
buildin feels we can create a class and
also not only a customer class you know
it not only contains data it can also do
certain things like save the customer to
the database print the customer full
name so essentially a class consists of
data represented by its fields and
behavior represented by the methods ok
so a class has state and behavior status
nothing with the data behavior is
nothing but what is the class capable of
doing for example if we can save a
customer to a database we can print his
full name etc let's look at an example
you know which will make things clearer
okay so how do we create a class to
create a class we use the class keyword
followed by the name of the class so
class customer and all of us know
customer will have first name and last
name so let's create them string first
name actually we will use an underscore
string first name string last name so
these two fields represent the state the
data that this class is having okay the
first name and last name okay now to
initialize these fields a class can also
have a constructor so how does a
constructor look like a constructor will
have the same name as that of your class
okay
so public public is nothing but the
access modifier we will be talking about
access modifiers in a later session in a
great detail so access modifier and then
the name of the class public customer
and what is the purpose of constructors
in life constructors are basically used
to initialize your class fields okay we
will later understand and embed how we
use this constructor okay so for now I
am passing two parameters into this
constructor string first name string
last name okay so this is the
constructor it's having the same name as
that of your class okay and it can take
parameters but a constructor does not
return a value whereas a method can have
a return type and if your method doesn't
return anything you know the return type
is void otherwise you can have any
return type like int float double
boolean etc but a constructor you know
the way you can identify this as a
constructor is by looking at its name it
will have the same name as that of class
and it will not have a return type but a
construct
can take parameters now I am actually
using this constructor to initialize
these two class fields first name and
last name so I can simply say underscore
so this field is equal to the parameter
that we are passing it in to this
constructor similarly underscore last
name is equal to the parameter that we
are passing in to this constructor okay
now you can refer to this this class
field and I'll just play its name or you
can say this dot and look at this the
moment I say this dot the intellisense
choose both the class fields underscore
first name underscore last name okay so
now this keyword actually refers to an
instance of this class to an object of
this class okay
so you can either say you know
underscore first name or you know for
better readability you can use this
keyword this dot last name okay so
basically we are using this constructor
to initialize both of these class fields
with these parameters that we are
passing in to this constructor and this
constructor will get called
automatically when we create an instance
of this class we'll have a look at that
in a bit okay so so far we have two
fields and a constructor to initialize
those two fields so a class has some
state right now represented by these two
fields let's say I want to add some
behavior in the sense the class should
be capable of doing something for
example I want this class to be in a
position to print the full name of a
customer okay so for that let's have a
function let's have a method and the
return type of the method is void public
void and I'm going to call this method
print full name so what is this method
going to do this method is going to pray
the full name of this customer okay so
how do we do that
console dot write line full name is
equal to underscore first name have its
place in between first name and last
name underscore last name again if you
want to refer to this class Fields you
can just you know type in the fields
just like this or for better readability
you can use the disk keyword and as we
know this keyword refers to an instance
of this class to an institution to an
object of this class okay so if you look
at our class now it has got two wheels a
constructor and a method apart from that
a class can also have destructors and
destructors will have the same name as
that of your class but they don't take
parameters they cannot have written type
and they have it tilled in front of them
now usually in c-sharp we don't require
destructors and the objects you know
basically we use destructors to clean up
the resources to clean up any resources
your class was holding on to during its
lifetime okay so any code to clean up
those resources goes in this destructor
and these destructors we don't have to
call them these destructors are called
automatically by the garbage collector
you know when it when it kind of tries
to clean objects from the memory we will
be talking about destructors and garbage
collection in a very great detail in a
later session for now just understand
that a destructor will have the same
name as that of your class it cannot
take parameters and it has a tilde
symbol in front of that and destructors
are basically used to clean up any
resources that your class was holding on
to during its lifetime and these are
automatically called by the garbage
collector when
turns up to clean your objects from the
memory okay so your cleanup core goes
here and this is your method you know
which represents the behavior this is
your constructor you know basically use
to initialize your class fields now if I
want to use this class I can do that in
our main method okay so we can go ahead
and create it an instance of this class
customer c1 is equal to new customer now
look at this I am creating c1 is nothing
but an instance of this class so I'm
creating an instance of customer class
using the new keyword this instance is
also called s object object an instance
these terms are used interchangeable so
I'm creating a new customer object now
look at this the moment I open up this
paranthesis it shows up our constructor
this constructor which takes in first
name and last name and let's say for
example I am passing in the first name
is praveen and the last name as
technologies so what's going to happen
now this Pragya will be passed into this
parameter technologies will be passed
into this type parameter and these
parameters are then used to initialize
these two class wheels so understand
that you know this is the constructor
which is getting called automatically
when we are creating an instance of this
customer class okay so what our
constructors constructors are called
automatically when you create an
instance with your class and what is the
purpose of this constructor it is
basically used to initialize your class
fields you know this dot first name this
dot last name
will now be initialized to first name to
regime and last name to technologies so
that you know makes it clear the
definition of
a constructor is called automatically
when you create an instance of this
class and the constructor is basically
used to initialize that those class
members okay and then if you want to
print the customer full name you just
say c1 dot print full name and if you
look at this you know after we create
this object we are calling the print
full name so now in this customer object
the state which is the first name and
last name fields are initialized to
presume and technologies and your print
full name is actually concatenating them
together and writing them out to the
console okay so your constructor is
ensuring that this fields are populated
before we actually use those fields in
this method okay so that proves that a
constructor is used to initialize your
class fields and it's automatically
called and you try to create an instance
with your class okay so if we go ahead
and run this program as you might expect
full name is equal to present
technologies now is it mandatory that we
have to provide a constructor every time
we create a class not necessarily for
example let's comment this in our
constructor and you can do that by
clicking that button so once I comment
that obviously you know since we don't
have that constructor you know it gives
an error there is no you know if you
look at the error customer does not
contain a constructor that takes two
arguments
there is no constructor which takes two
arguments so now we can't do that but
what I can do is look at this when I say
new customer automatically I am getting
a constructor without any parameters if
you look at this customer open
parentheses close balances it doesn't
take any parameters so what does that
mean if you do not write a constructor
if you do not provide a constructor for
your class dotnet framework will provide
one for you for free okay and it is a
default parameter less constructor okay
there are no parameters the default
constructor
whether by dotnet framework is a
parameter less default constructor okay
and this default constructor what it
does is basically walks through all the
fields in the class and initialize them
to their defaults now look at this when
I call this default customer this first
name and last name they are not
initialized to anything okay they are
basically empty so now if I go ahead and
run this application look at what's
going to happen full name is equal to
empty and now somebody is able to use
you know call this method in spite of
those fields not being initialized
that's why you have that full name is
equal to empty okay so this default
parameter les constructor is not really
that useful and if you want to make that
a little more useful what you can do is
basically you can you can provide you
know let's say I have this constructor
but another thing to keep in mind look
at this the moment I provide a
constructor and I have provided a
constructor for my own class and the
moment I have done that look at look at
what happens to the default parameter
les constructor no customer does not
contain a constructor that takes zero
arguments so what's happening here is
that once we provide our own constructor
to this class you know dotnet takes away
the default parameter les constructor
which it has provided when your class
doesn't have any constructor okay so so
it's taking away that constructor that's
why it says the data message customer
does not contain a constructor that
takes zero arguments okay so now let's
say we want to provide that capability
you know somebody should be able to
create a customer object without passing
in any parameters to the constructor so
how do you do that okay you can actually
write a constructor which does not take
any arguments something like this public
customer and then what you can basically
do is when you call this customer I mean
when somebody calls that constructor
I want basically I want basically the
constructor which takes two parameters
to be called but then I'm going to
initialize them to their defaults like
you know no first name provide it and
similarly for the last name we will say
no last name provided okay so what we
are doing here is basically okay if
somebody calls this default you know if
somebody wants to create a customer
object without passing in parameters
that's fine they can do that like this
okay
customer c1 is equal to new customer now
when this if you right-click on that and
when you say koutou definition comes to
this constructor but if you look at this
constructor it's calling this customer
this constructor this refers to this
instance of the class so this here
refers to this particular constructor
and passing in no first name provided
first name and no last name provided for
last name properties and these are then
used to initialize these class fields so
obviously now if somebody is creating a
customer object like this and if you go
ahead and run that look at that no first
name provided is the first name no last
name provided is the last name okay so
if you want to make that default
parameter less constructor a little more
useful and you want to make sure that
your class fields are initialized to
something before you know somebody calls
methods and do something in that class
then you can provide an implementation
for that parameter less constructor and
look any of the you know parameter to
construct any of the constructors with
parameters to initialize your class
fields the way you want them okay but on
the other hand you know if somebody else
wants to create a customer another
customer object they can do customer c2
is equal to new customer and now look at
this there are two constructors now one
constructor which does not if you look
at this one of two constructors one
constructor if you look on the right
side no parameters a parameter less
constructed there is no need to pass
parameters I can do that or there is
another constructor which takes first
name and last name so there are two
constructors with the same name now
differing by just a number of parameters
so this is called as overloading
constructors so this class has two
constructors one which does not take
parameters at all another one which
takes two parameters okay basically we
can overload a constructor you know on
the number and type of parameters okay
say for example P is my first name and
maybe T is my last name and if I say c2
dot print full name so for the second
customer it will say PT P is the first
name T is the last name so that's it
let's go back to the slides
so bubbles of a class constructor the
purpose of a class constructor is to
initialize your class fields a class
constructor is automatically called when
an instance of a class is created
constructors do not have written values
and always have the same name as that of
your class yeah that's that's one
important difference to keep between a
constructor and a class methods I'm
sorry constructor and methods methods
will have written type it as your
constructor it doesn't have your doesn't
have any return type and they have the
same name as that of your class
constructors are mandatory if we do not
provide a constructor a default
parameter less constructor is
automatically provided by dot net
framework but once we provide an
implementation you know of a constructor
the default parameter less constructor a
constructor provided by dotnet framework
is taken away and constructors can be
overloaded by the number and type of
parameters and we have seen an example
of that as well
so what our destructors destructors have
the same name as that of your class with
a tilde symbol in front of them they
don't take any parameters and they don't
have written values as well
destructors are places where you put
could release any resources your class
was holding on to during its lifetime we
will actually talk about destructors and
the process of garbage collection in a
later session that's it for today thank
you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
