services in this video we'll discuss
creating a simple asp.net web service
we'll also discuss the technologies that
are used with asp.net web services but
please note that these asp.net
SMX web services are a legacy technology
most of the companies are now using WCF
that is windows communication foundation
to build XML Web Services and XML web
service clients however this course will
be useful for those who are searching
for a job as a.net developer as there
are some companies still using a SMX web
services today and an interviewer could
ask interview questions related to them
in our upcoming WCF video series we will
discuss building XML web services and
clients using WCF so what are web
services and why should we use them Web
Services are a standardized way for
developing interoperable applications
that is enabling an application to
invoke a method of another application
these applications can either be on the
same computer or on different computers
as long as they are connected by a
network web services enable these
applications to communicate with each
other web services use open standards
and protocols like HTTP XML and soap
since these are open and well-known
protocols applications built on any
platform can interoperate with web
services for example a java application
can interoperate with a web service
built using a dotnet similarly a web
service built using java can be consumed
by a dotnet application let's now look
at a building an asp.net web service
let's flip to visual studio click on
file new project let's create an empty
asp.net web application let's call this
web services demo click OK so this
should add an empty asp.net web
application project to this project
let's add a web service and to do that
right-click on the project name add new
item make sure you have web selected
under installed templates and then if
you scroll all the way down
you should find web service there but if
you have large number of templates here
instead of manually looking for web
service you can also use the search
feature so simply type web service and
the search feature should bring it up
for you
so select web service and notice the
extension of web service its dot ASM X
and for this reason these are also
called as a SMX web services and let's
call a web service calculator web
service click Add so basically as part
of this web service we are going to
expose a method which is going to take
two numbers add them together and then
return their sum but before we do that
let's examine the code that is
auto-generated for us now the web
service that we have added is actually a
class look at this calculator web
service it's nothing but a class but
this class is decorated with web service
attribute basically this attribute tells
that this class contains web service
code and look at this this web service
attribute has got this namespace
property so what are these web service
namespaces basically this namespaces are
used to uniquely identify your web
service from the other web services that
are already there on the web for example
now we have this calculator web service
now after we have done building this you
know we publish it on the Internet now
let's say for example there is another
person who has developed a web service
with the same name calculator web
service so basically to uniquely
identify your web service from the other
web services that are already there on
the web we use this namespace our
property basically this namespace our
look at the intelligence it's actually a
string mean
you can set it to any string but it is
common for the namespace to be you know
something like a company internet domain
name something like for example regime
tech comm and if you want you can give
something like web services so please
empty comm web services now this
namespace is going to ensure you know
that our web service is uniquely
identified okay so a web service is
decorated this with this web service
attribute and if you look at here the
web service class is also inheriting
from this class that is system dot web
dot services dot web service class now
is it mandatory for a web service to
inherit from that class not really but
if at all if the web service has to use
something like asp.net sessions data
application state objects then in order
for the web service to have direct
access to those objects you know we make
it inherit from that web service class
all right and if you look at this web
service it has got a one method hello
world and if you look at this method it
is decorated with web method attribute
so what is this attribute basically if
you want to expose a method as part of
the web service to a client that is a
calling application then that method
needs to be decorated with web method
attribute if you don't decorate it with
web method attribute then the client
application cannot see that method so if
you want your method to be exposed to a
client then that method needs to be
decorated with web method attribute and
that method needs to be public as well
okay now instead of this method and
another thing this attribute has got
several properties like buffer response
cache duration description etc now these
properties of this attribute are
basically used to customize the behavior
of your web service will discuss these
properties in detail in our upcoming
video session but for now understand
that if at all if you want to expose a
method as part of your
servers then that method needs to be
decorated with web method attribute but
let's change the return type of this
method to integer and let's call this
method as ad and let's pass two
parameters to this function let's call
the first one as first number and the
second parameter as second number and
all we want to do is add those two
numbers together and return their sum so
first number plus second number all
right so at this point we have a working
web service let's build that and notice
that within the solution I mean status
bar you can see build succeeded now to
run the web service you can simply run
it by pressing control f5 or you can
right click on the web service name in
the solution Explorer and then select
this option view in browser so look at
this we are invoking the calculator web
service that we have just created now
I'm using Google Chrome here so that's
the reason why you can't see the
protocol that we are using but then if
you copy the URL and paste it with the
notepad look at that they are using HTTP
protocol and in order to access a web
application we use HTTP protocol in a
similar fashion to access web services
we use HTTP protocol
so basically hypertext Transfer Protocol
is the protocol widely used by web
services to send and receive messages
you know web services can also use other
protocols like SMTP but the most widely
used protocol is HTTP and the messaging
protocol is soap soap stands for simple
object access protocol soap messages are
an XML format in a bit we will see how a
soap request and response message look
like and we have already seen that web
services have thought a SMX extension
and for these reason web services are
also often called as SMX web services
now so this is the web service page and
look at this here I have a linker called
service description now if I click on
this link look at that within the URL it
says wstr WSDL stands for web service
description language we'll discuss in
detail about this Vistal document in our
upcoming video session where we will
discuss how to consume this web web
service from a client application like
an asp.net web application or a Windows
application basically this Vistal
document is used by the clients to
generate the proxy classes however we'll
talk in detail about this one in a later
video session but for now understand
that when we click on this service
description link it takes us to that
Vistal page and notice here we have that
method add and if you recollect we have
decorated the method with web method
attribute now what's going to happen if
we get rid of that attribute and then if
we run this web service let's look at
what's going to happen look at that we
don't see that ad method so that's why
if you want to expose your method as
part of that web service then decorate
it with web method attribute now when we
click on this ad method look at that it
takes us to a page where we can test our
web service method so look at this the
parameters first number and second
number let's pass for example 10 and 20
and click on this invoke button look at
that we get a result of 30 now apart
from having an interface to test the web
service method on this page you also
have the sample request and response
soap messages look at this first of all
this is the request message here so if
you look at this message it's an XML
format so basically this is an XML
format but it is formatted according to
the soup protocol that is simple object
access
all so silk specification states that
you know there needs to be a soap
envelope and within soap envelope there
will be a soap header and a soup body
since we are not using soap headers it's
not displayed here but you know look at
that there's a soap body here and this
body contains first number and second
number okay those are the parameters of
our add method and then if you look at
the response message what are we going
to get back we are going to get an
integer back you know which is nothing
for the sum of those two numbers again
look at that within the response we have
a soap envelope and a soap body and the
response of that add method is this
present here as an integer okay so
basically this is how a soap request and
response a message looks like now for an
application to invoke the add method the
application should create a soap request
message like this and then invoke the
web service method and then the web
service is going to send response in
this format so the client application
has to parse that and then use it in the
way it has to but do we really have to
manually generate these soap request and
response messages not really we will
develop proxy classes which is going to
do all the hard work for us we will
discuss that if that is consuming a web
service from a client application in our
next video session and if you look at
these soap messages here there are two
versions that is soap 1.1 and soap 1.2
so what are these two versions basically
soap 1.2 is later version and obviously
there are several changes from soap 1.1
if you want to look at the details
detail differences between soap 1.1 and
1.2 I have a URL here so basically visit
this URL all right so let's quickly go
over these points so we discussed that a
web services is a class that is
decorated with web service attribute and
it also can inherit from a base class
that is system dot web dot services tour
service-based class the webservice
attribute tells that this class contains
the code for web service web service
namespaces used to uniquely identify
your web service on the internet from
other services that are already there on
the web web service namespace can be any
string but it is common to give it a
company's Internet domain name as they
are usually unique something like
protect or calm slash web services it's
not mandatory for a web service class to
inherit from system dot web dot services
that web service based class however if
the web service has to use asp.net
session or application state objects
then inheriting from that base class
will provide direct access to those
asp.net objects to allow the web service
to be called from JavaScript now if you
look at the commented out code here look
at that
this line is commented basically this
attribute system dot web dot script dot
services start script service now if you
want this web service to be callable
from JavaScript you know using asp.net
Ajax then that web service needs to be
decorated with that attribute you know
there's a comment as well here that
state said in our upcoming video session
we'll see how to invoke a web service
using asp.net Ajax and if you want a
method to be exposed as part of the web
service then the method must be public
and it should be decorated with web
method attribute this attribute has got
several properties which can be used to
configure the behavior of the back XML
web service method all right so in our
next video we'll discuss consuming this
web service from a client application
that is from an asp.net web application
that's it for today thank you for
listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
