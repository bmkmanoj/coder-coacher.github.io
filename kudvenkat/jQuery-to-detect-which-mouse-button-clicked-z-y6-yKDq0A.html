this video we'll discuss how to detect
which mouse button is clicked using
jQuery when a mouse button is clicked
there are two events that are
automatically triggered
behind-the-scenes Mouse town and mouse
hop when these events occur the event
object is automatically passed to the
respective event handler method now when
we talk about event object there are two
flavors of it we've got the raw
JavaScript event object and the jQuery
event object when we are using the raw
JavaScript event object and if the
browser is ie8 our earlier version then
we use the button property of the event
object to determine which mouse button
is clicked so this button property is
going to return one of these three
values one for R - one for left 4 for
middle and 2 for right so with IE 8 of
earlier versions we use even dot button
property to determine which mouse button
is clicked with IE 9 and later version
and almost any other browser we use
which property of the event object to
determine which mouse button is clicked
so the switch property is going to
return one of these three cords one two
or three one for left two for middle and
three for right so with IE 9 and later
versions we use event dot which I ate in
the earlier version we use event dot
button so keeping this in mind if we
have to write some JavaScript code that
works across all browsers then this is
how the code would look like so
basically here we have a function which
mouse button clicked and to this
function we are passing the event object
so basically this is raw JavaScript and
this event object is the raw JavaScript
event object and within this function we
have a variable which button and look at
the check here event dot which so if the
browser supports which property of the
event object then we know it's got to be
IE 9 a later version or any other modern
browser in that case we are going to use
the which property of the event object
to determine which mouse button is
clicked so if it's I mean I in a later
version or any of the modern browser
switch on that property and we know this
which property is going to return these
three values one of these three values 1
2 or 3 is its 1 then in this which way
do
which button variable restoring this
message left button click and then we
are breaking out of that case statement
if it is 2 then it's a middle button 3
right button if it's not any of those
three values then it comes to this
default in which case we are
initializing that variable to invalid
button collect okay so basically this
block of code is for IE 9 a later
version or any other modern browser if
the browser does not support which
property of the event object then we
know it is IE 8 or earlier version in
that case it's going to come to this
else part and we know that ie8 our
earlier version support button property
of the event object so that's the reason
here within the else section we are
switching on button property of the
event object and we know this button
property is going to return one of these
three values one for or two one for left
so for middle two four right and if it's
not any of those three values it falls
onto this default in which case we are
initializing this variable to invalid
button clicked okay so this section is
for IE 8 or earlier version this section
is for IE 9 or later version and on any
other browser okay so finally what we
are doing we are finding the development
in which we want to display the message
div result is the ID and we are using
the inner HTML property to basically
display the value within that
development okay so let's flip to visual
studio so I have this function right
here so the same function that we have
seen on the slide and then here we have
the button element and the development
to display the result so when we click
you know when a mouse click event occurs
there are two events mouse down and
mouse up so I'm going to make use of
mouse up event here so on Mouse up what
we want to do is call this function what
is the name of the function which mouse
button click and that function we are
passing the event object the raw
JavaScript event object so let's call
that function and to that let's pass the
event object so let's save the changes
and let's go and run this so this is
Internet Explorer look at this
when I left click left button click
middle click right click so it's 11 it's
working here let's actually change the
browser mode to IE 7 and see if it's
going to work so IE 7 the browser is now
running in IE 7 mode now look at this
left middle right alright so this piece
of code is working across all browsers
but quite a bit of code just to check
which mouse button is clicked now let's
see how to rewrite this using javascript
event object okay so I'm going to
actually cut the switch statement
because we need that and this is Raju
our script code so I'm going to delete
all of this and since we don't have that
function anymore I'm going to remove
this as well on mouse up attribute okay
so within the scripts section we are
going to now write some jQuery code so
dollar document dot ready so when the
document is ready you want to execute a
function alright so when the document is
ready what do we want to do we want to
associate first on you know Mouse up
event with this button element so button
has got an ID so let's use the ID
selector the ID of the button is BTN and
let's associate mouse up event and then
mouse up event occurs
you know this the function that will be
that will be called this anonymous
function so this is the even Handler and
this even handler the event object is
automatically passed right so we are
passing that event object so the event
object that's passed here is the jQuery
event object all right so now we are
actually going to switch on jQuery event
object so the advantage of using this
jQuery event object is that jQuery has
normalized this property which of the
event object so this which property is
now going to work across all the
browsers so you know within our jQuery
code we used that which property and
behind-the-scenes jQuery
is going to check in our for if it's ie8
or earlier version then it's going to
use that button property so all that
heavy lifting is done by jQuery for us
so but in our jQuery code we just use
the which property and this code is
going to work across all browsers okay
so let's actually save these changes and
what else we have to do we have to
create this variable which button so
let's copy that so out of the switch
statement let's create that variable and
initialize that to an empty string okay
so finally what we want to do is find
this development and display the result
within that again the development has
got ID so let's use the ID selector and
the ID of the div element asset of
result and let's use the HTML method and
pass our variable which button all right
so let's save the changes let's go ahead
and run this okay so at the moment we
are running in IE 11 mode so left click
middle flag right click all works now
let's change the browser mode to IE 7
all right so the browser now is running
an IE seven mode like this left middle
right it still works
and look at the amount of code that we
have to write with jQuery okay a lot
less so that's because jQuery normalizes
this which property of the event object
and jQuery is going to ensure that this
code is going to work across all
browsers and here is that example which
we just discussed thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
