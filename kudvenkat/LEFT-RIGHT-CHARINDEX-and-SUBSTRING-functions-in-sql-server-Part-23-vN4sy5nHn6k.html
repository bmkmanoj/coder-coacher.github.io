blanket this is part 23 of sequel server
in this session we'll talk about a few
more commonly used building string
functions available in sequel server
specifically we will talk about left
right care index and substring functions
and we'll also look at a real-time
example of using these string functions
now before continuing with this session
I strongly recommend to watch parts 11
and 22 of this video series okay so what
is left function left function returns
the specified number of characters from
the left hand side of the given
character expression let's understand
what we mean by this
so select let's say I have a string
called ABCDE F okay now what I want to
do is I want to retrieve the first three
characters from the left hand side of
the string okay so I can use the left
function for that okay so select left
and if you look at the intellisense that
is available in sequence over it is
expecting an expression of type and
webcam so let's pass this there okay and
then the next parameter is the number of
characters that you want from the
left-hand side of this expression let's
say i want three characters so when we
try that we should get ABC on the other
hand if you want maybe four characters
just pass in four you should get also I
mean get D as well okay now so right is
the inverse of left okay left function
returns the specified number of
characters from the left-hand side of
the given character expression whereas
right returns the specified number of
characters from the right-hand side of
the given character expression okay so
if you want let's say de F okay then all
you do is instead of left you will say
right and from the right side let's say
I want only three characters so you get
the last three characters which is de f
so we get that
okay so those are left and right
functions in sequel server now another
very useful function in sequel server is
the care index function at first it may
it may sound you know a little
complicated to use that but it's pretty
simple okay if you look at this function
it has got three parameters okay the
expression to find expression to search
and start location let's look at an
example which makes it clear now let's
say I have an email address something
like this maybe Sarah at a a a.com so a
a a.com is the domain now let's say
within this email I want to find the
index of this @ symbol how do I do that
I can make use of the care index
function okay so select I can use the
care index function and if you look at
the care index function it expects three
parameters you know the first parameter
is the expression that you want to
search for it could be a string or a
character now in our case it's a
character we want to search the app
symbol so I want to search the app
symbol and then the next parameter is
another expression of type fair care
this is nothing but the expression which
you want to search so I want to search
for this at symbol I want to find the
index of this at symbol within this
given expression okay and then the third
optional parameter is the starting
position so if you look at that the
third parameter is the start location
now do you want to start at the
beginning of this expression or
somewhere in between
okay now let's assume that you have
maybe two or three at symbols in that
given expression and you want to find
the last one okay so in those
circumstances you can use you know the
starting position okay
so let's say in our case the starting
position is 1 and that's optional if you
don't specify that parameter it's going
to anyway started you know position one
of the string so now when we execute
this we should get the index of the at
symbol
which is five so if you look at this one
two three four five so the index of at
symbol you know is at the fifth location
okay so we get the index of that letter
so care index is basically used to
return the starting position of the
specified expression a character string
and keep in mind start location is
optional all right now another very
useful function is substring as the name
itself says sub string I want a part of
the string so substring basically
returns part of the string from the
given expression now look at this if you
want a part of a string from the given
string then obviously you will have to
tell okay the string itself from which
you want that part and then where you
want to start and how many characters
you want okay so those are the three
parameters here the the actual
expression where do you want to start
and and how many characters you want
okay let's see that in action now let's
say if you look at this you know email
address Ericom what I want this I want
only the domain part okay here the
domain is a a a.com I want just the
domain part how do I do that I can use
substring okay so select I can say
substring of the expression the
expression is nothing but this email and
then you you want to specify the
starting position the starting position
is 1 2 3 4 5 okay
so you don't want anything until here
you want you know starting at position 6
so I want starting at position 6 and
then how many characters 3 4 5 6 7
characters so 7 so what is this going to
do this is going to give us that
substring from this entire email so when
we execute this we should get only the
domain path ok so these two functions
are extensively used care index and sub
strings especially when you want to
manipulate strings so substring function
returns substring part from the given
expression ok now if you look at the way
we have used this function
we have hard-coded these values you know
at which position do you want to start
and how many characters do you want now
if you remember we want to start it I
mean how did you say that we want to
start at position six you know because
the @ symbol starts there we have
counted that and then we specified okay
after the @ symbol position you know
from that position onwards we want the
substring okay but this is a little
dangerous let's assume you know an email
address is of like something like maybe
Pam which is only three characters Pam
at BBB calm so if you look at this email
address it has got only three four
records now if I pass this any pass this
email address to this substring function
look at what's going to happen it
doesn't give us exactly what we want
we only got B be calm it knocked off one
letter that's because you want to start
you know you want the substring from one
two three four from the fifth location
okay but here it's the sixth location
that we have specified now when we do
this we get that correctly so that's the
issue with hard coding so instead of
hard coding what you can do basically
you can use this cat index function
which will calculate you know the index
dynamically so you want the cat index of
whatever so I want the care index here
it is time at BBB calm so instead of
hard-coding that we can just pass the
email address and now when we execute
this we should get the same result
except that okay and another thing look
at this since we have hard-coded that
okay and if you look at this one we are
actually getting rid of M and we got
this extra letter at symbol there and to
get that because we don't want to start
at that position instead we want to add
one because the care index of that
symbol will give you one two three four
but you don't want to start at fourth
location you want to start it
location so add one to that so now when
you execute this you should get what you
expect okay and similarly you can also
you know dynamically calculate the
number of characters you want how can
you calculate the number of characters
you want fit in that string look at this
you know in this string I want to start
at this location okay and that you have
specified using care index okay and the
next thing that you have to tell okay
from this location how many characters
do you want okay now if you want to get
the total number of characters that are
available here don't you think if you
get the total length of this string and
then subtract the care index of that
symbol because the care index of that
symbol what will it give you it will
give you one two three four and the
total length four plus seven eleven okay
from eleven subtract four okay which
will give us seven so we can say okay I
want the care index of this one which
will give us the cat index of this
symbol and I want the total length of
the string so if you want the total
length of the string what you can do you
can use length function and we have
spoken about this in the previous
session so length function of what is
that of the email and then from that
length we want to subtract the care
index of the @ symbol
okay so now if we execute this now we
don't have those values hard-coded now
this select statement should work with
any emails look at that we get the exact
same output now at beginning it may
sound a little complex okay there are a
lot of function calls here and it sounds
a lot of confusing but trust me it's
very simple if you understand how care
index substring and length function
works it's just that instead of
hard-coding the values we are calling
one function inside another function
okay now this forms the basis for the
simple real time example that we have
let's say I have our employees like this
the first name last name and their email
and I want but you know the tutor by
domain okay for example in gmail.com how
many how many users are there with
gmail.com domain how many users are
there with a while calm okay I want to
find that and to do that we use exactly
the same logic that we have done here
but instead of you know hard coding the
email address like this we will be
passing in the email column from our
table okay so let's see how to do that
so when we execute this query we have
all the employees here all we want is an
output like this okay totally me I mean
email domain and the total count all
right so what do we want in our output
we want the email domain first so select
so we want the email column in the
output but we don't want the complete
email we just want the domain part okay
and remember to get the domain part we
have already written the substring
function so this will give you the
domain part so copy that but then
wherever you have hard-coded this email
we want to pass in the name of the
column it's as simple as that so email
column
pass it there
okay so from where we want from TBL
employee table okay so when we execute
that we should get all the domains and
you want to give a meaningful name for
that as email domain maybe so when we
execute that we get the email domain but
we are getting all of the domains now if
you have watched part you know 11 of
this video series where we have spoken
about group by now it should be pretty
simple to group those emails by the
domain right now you can just group them
by this particular column and you're
done so the next thing that we want is
the count of employees count off maybe
email as total and then since you are
using count aggregate function you want
to use group by so I want to group by by
this expression
okay
invalid column name count of email okay
so you should get the output that we
expect email domain and the total okay
and there are the other ways of
achieving this one but since we are
talking about string functions I thought
it's better to use those functions and
achieve this output on this slide you
can find resources for asp.net and C
sharp interview questions that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
