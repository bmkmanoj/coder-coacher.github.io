this video we'll discus binding asp.net
menu control to an XML file using XML
data source control this is continuation
to part 154 so please watch part 154
from the asp.net tutorial before
proceeding at the moment data for this
menu control is hard-coded within the
menu control itself as you can see here
the disadvantage of hard-coding menu
items within menu control like this is
that later if we have to add or remove
menu items then we will have to change
the application code changing
application code means we will have to
rebuild and redeploy our application to
all the production servers in this video
we'll discuss storing menu items in an
XML file and then binding that XML file
to the menu control the advantage that
we get is that later if we have to add
or remove items from the menu we don't
have to change the application code
simply change the application or XML
file and the application is going to
automatically pick up those changes so
we don't have to rebuild and redeploy
our application so let's see how to bind
an XML file to the menu control the
first step here is to get rid of these
hard-coded menu items so at the moment
we don't have any menu items hard-coded
within the menu control the next step is
to add an XML file so let's add a new
item let's call this menu items dot XML
you can give it any meaningful name you
want now we need to include our menu
items here to speed things up I have
already implemented the required XML so
let's copy and paste that XML right here
and this XML is straightforward notice
that we have a root element called items
you can give this root element any name
you want and within this root element we
have got menu items menu elements and
again you can give this element any name
that you want along the same lines the
attributes also can have any name
basically what this XML element means
here is that when we click home menu
item we want the user to go to home.aspx
page okay and here we have employee menu
item so when we click this we want the
user to go to employee dot aspx and if
you recollect from the previous session
under employee we have these three menu
items so to achieve that you know within
that XML element we have these three XML
elements so basically under employee
these three menu items will be displayed
along the same lines under employer
these three menu items and under admin
these three menu items so
straightforward XML the next step is to
include an XML data source control on
the master page so this XML data source
control is going to read the XML data
from the XML file so let's drag and drop
the XML data source control onto our
master page so XML data source control
is present under data tab within tool
box now we need to tell this XML data
source control the path for the file
that contains our XML data and to do
that we are going to use data file
attribute and where is the menu XML file
present in the root directory of our
project and to indicate the root
directory we used till the character so
till the four slash and what is the name
of the file menu items dot XML so let's
copy the name of the file and paste it
here so at this point XML data source
control knows where to read data from
okay so we are done with the first two
steps we added an XML file specified our
menu items and second we added an XML
data source control and associated this
XML data source control with this XML
file using data file attribute here if
you notice we are also using XPath
attribute we'll discuss that in just a
bit now the final step is basically
associate this XML data source control
with menu control and how
we do that using data source ID
attribute so we have the menu control
here so we need to associate this with
the XML data source control using data
source ID attribute and what is the ID
of the XML data source control XML data
source one so now everything is linked
up so we have the menu data within the
XML file XML data source control knows
how to read the data and then we have
associated that XML data source control
with the menu control so the menu
control has the menu data right now but
then one more thing that we need to
specify is that so what is the data
member that contains menu data so if you
look at our XML file so what's the data
member that we have specified here menu
item so menu item element within the XML
hai file has got menu data okay and this
XML element can contain any number of
attributes but then we want a text to be
displayed on the menu and then once we
click the link we want the user to go to
this page you know may be home dot aspx
when we click on home link so which
element of which attribute in the XML
element contains you know text and
navigate URL so text field is pointing
to text attribute and navigate URL field
is pointing to navigate URL attribute so
let's specify data bindings within the
menu control data bindings ASP menu data
binding the first thing is data member
so what's the data member menu item so
this XML element and text field is text
that's the name of the attribute within
the XML
and navigate URL field so navigate URL
field is navigate URL attribute let's
copy the name of the attribute paste it
there alright we're done
so let's run this and see if we get the
output that we expect look at that now
we expected home employee employer and
admin to be displayed but look at this
it's actually displaying items and what
is this items this is nothing but the
root element within the XML file we
don't want the menu to start from this
root we wanted to start from you know
menu item okay and to tell that to the
menu control what we need to do is
basically we need to specify XPath
okay so basically read menu item within
the items root element that's what this
XPath is for okay so let's go and
specify the XPath within the XML data
source control
so with an item's root element look for
menu item all right with this change
let's run this one more time and see if
we get the output that we expect look at
that we get the output as expected all
right now let's actually specify
selected styles for the menu control we
discussed you know selected style in the
previous session let's specify selected
style and see if that style get applied
look at this at the moment level menu
styles are applied we discuss these in
our previous session so the first level
we want in a local ax and that we get
the second level we want in red color
and we get that as well we don't have a
third level so we can get rid of this if
we want to now let's specify level
selected styles let's say for the first
level when we select an item we want
black background color to be applied
similarly for the second level also we
want black color alright but these
changes let's run this once more and
check if the selected styles are applied
look at that we're on the home page but
home is not selected let's click on
employee is employee menu item selected
no it's not so basically the selected
style that we have specified you know
it's not working and to make it work
within the code-behind file of the
master page if you remember you know we
discussed this code in the previous
session of this video series so
basically we need to move this code to
the pre-render event of the menu control
so first we need to generate the
pre-render event handler for the menu
control so this is our menu control + f4
to get to the properties and click on
this lightning bolt symbol and there we
have pre-render event double click that
so there is an event handler for
prerender event what i'm going to do
here is move this for each loop from
page load to pre-render even
all right so let's run this and see if
selected styles get applied
look at that we are on the home page and
home is already selected
let's select edit resume so edit resume
page and look at that that's is selected
alright that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
