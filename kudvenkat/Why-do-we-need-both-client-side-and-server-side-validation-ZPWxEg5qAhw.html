this video we'll discuss why do we need
both client-side and server-side
validation this is a very common
interview question as well
this is continuation to part 1 so please
watch part 1 before proceeding if you
recollect the example that we worked
with in part 1 of this video series
we've got both client-side and
server-side validation this javascript
function right here is providing the
client-side validation and this c-sharp
function within the code-behind file is
providing the server-side validation so
now when we click the submit button on
this form without entering any data
client-side validation kicks in and we
are presented with these validation
error messages right away now what do
you think is going to happen if we
disable JavaScript support in the
browser at the moment I'm using Google
Chrome browser and to disable JavaScript
in Google Chrome click on this little
button on the top right hand corner of
the browser window and then select
settings from the context menu on this
settings page within this search
settings text box type JavaScript and
then click on this content settings
button and within this content settings
window notice that they've got a section
called JavaScript and here we have got a
radio button which says to not allow any
sites to run JavaScript select that
radio button and click down so now we
have disabled JavaScript support in the
browser
now let's go ahead and rerun the
application now when we click the submit
button the client-side JavaScript
validation function is not going to run
but if you look at our application we
have caught server-side validation
function so this function will still be
executed which means the form will still
be validated this also means that we
don't end up storing invalid data within
this users table so if you look at this
table notice that we don't have any rows
there now let us go ahead and comment
the line that calls our suicide
validation function so on the summit
click even handler method we are calling
the validate form validation function
so let's go ahead and comment that line
and this closing brace as well so now at
the moment we have disabled JavaScript
that means the client-side validation
function will not run and we don't have
any server-side validation function so
now when we click the submit button what
do you think is going to happen we will
end up storing invalid data within this
users table look at this now we have got
one row this ID column value is
auto-generated but look at the values
for first name last name and email they
are basically empty strings okay so that
is why it is very important to always
have server-side validation function now
there are several ways we can issue
requests to a web application one way is
by using a browser within the browser
window when we type the URL and then
plus Enter key we are issuing a get
request to the web application and when
we click the submit button
we're actually issuing a post request
now we can also use tools like fiddler
to issue requests to a web application
at the moment I already have fiddler
installed on my machine this is a free
tool to install this just Google
download they executable and then double
click it and follow the on-screen
instructions to install it once you have
filter installed open it and then you
know you should have a similar interface
depending on the version you install at
the moment the Cal the traffic is being
captured by this tool so let's clear all
this traffic by clicking on this remove
all button now let's go back and then
actually submit this form so that
traffic is captured in fiddler vendor so
notice that the this is our post request
now what I'm going to do is drag and
drop this request on to this composer
tab so now there is a request here once
I click this execute button you know
this request will be issued to the web
application which means you know it's
the same as clicking on the submit
button here but I'm issuing the request
now using filler tool now let's go back
to sequel server and look at the number
of rows we have got here notice that at
the moment we have got two rows because
we click the submit button once again
now let's go back to fiddler and click
on this execute button so request
executed now let's go back to sequel
server and look at that there is a third
row there now if we had the suicide
validation function you know this would
have validated the data before inserting
that into the users table that's why we
should always have server-side
validation function so if javascript is
disabled and if we don't have any
server-side validation there could be
different threads ranging from storing
invalid data to security vulnerabilities
client-side validation we know that it
provides better user experience because
it reduces the unnecessary round trips
between the client and the server so
client-side validation is nice to have
however if javascript is disabled or the
users making a request using tools like
fiddler we still want to validate the
form before saving data to the database
tables so server-side validation should
always be there irrespective of whether
we have client-side validation or not
the ideal thing is to have both
client-side validation and server-side
validation because client-side
validation provides better user
experience and suicide validation
provides better security because
server-side validation is guaranteed to
execute whereas client-side validation
it depends on how the user is making the
request thank you for listening and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
