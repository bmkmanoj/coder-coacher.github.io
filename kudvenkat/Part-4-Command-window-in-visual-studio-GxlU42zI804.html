tutorial in this video we'll discuss
command window in visual studio to get
to command window there are two ways
click on View menu other windows and
then command window or you can use the
keyboard shortcut and the keyboard
shortcut is ctrl W a as you can see here
so what does this command window file
command window is used to execute
commands or aliases individual Studio
IDE for example to get to open file
dialog box within the command window
type file dot open file or Oh F here Oh
F is the alias for file dot open file
let's actually look at that in action so
look at that
when I say file look at that the
intellisense shows all the options that
are available so file dot open file once
we have that command there you know once
I press ENTER look at that here we have
the Open File dialog box and then you
can open any file that you want using
visual studio or instead of typing the
full command here you can even use the
ugly ass look at this when I type Oh F
so oh F is the ugly ass for file open
file when I press ENTER we get the Open
File dialog again so this is one way to
get the Open File dialog box within
visual studio to use the commands within
the command window the other way is to
use the menu items so file open file
okay so you can either use your mouse
and navigate to that item or there is a
keyboard shortcut control o so if I type
ctrl o it opens the Open File dialog so
behind the scenes what's happening it's
executing the corresponding command that
is file dot open file
now the command window offers a command
prompt style interaction with DES Visual
Studio IDE but many developers prefer to
use the keyboard shortcuts over typing
commands in the command window as all of
these commands can also be executed
indirectly using the keyboard shortcut
keys and using keyboard shortcut case is
much faster than opening the command
window and then typing the commands in
there that's why a lot of developers
prefer to use the keyboard shortcuts
over using command window but keep in
mind some commands also expects
parameters to be passed for example if
you want to open a specific file then
pass the name of the file as a parameter
to the command for example to open the
program dot C S file
you know you type the command like so
file dot Open File and then specify the
part of the file that you want to open
let's actually look at that in action so
let's say I want to open this program
dot C is file the program dot C is file
is present within the host project so
file dot open file in a press base bar
and then it's present in C colon
backslash this is simple service
solution within that we have the host
project and within that we have program
dot C as file and look at this when we
press ENTER program dot CS file is
automatically opened ok or you can also
type o F and in the path of the file and
it's going to open the file for you
similarly to get to open project dialog
box you know there is a corresponding
command for that file open project or
you can simply use the sally as opie or
you can use the keyboard shortcut ctrl
shift o so if you go to file open
project so that's the keyboard shortcut
ctrl shift o when we select this menu
item what's happening behind the scenes
it's executing the corresponding command
file open project and if you want to
clear all these items within the command
window use CLS
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
