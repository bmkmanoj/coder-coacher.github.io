am venket this is part 27 properties in
c-sharp in this session we'll be looking
at read write read only and write only
properties we'll also be looking at Auto
implemented properties which are
introduced in c-sharp 3.0 in the
previous session we have seen how to
protect class files using public getter
and setter methods in this session we
will do the same thing using properties
if you haven't watched my video session
on why properties are required I would
strongly encourage you to do so before
continuing with the session because
we'll be using examples from our
previous session so let's look at that
example in the previous session we have
designed the student class with three
private fields and to protect and then
capsulate these fields we have used the
respective public get and set methods
okay for example to read and write this
private field ID we are making use of
set ID and get ID methods okay so now
how do we do that using properties in
c-sharp okay to do that there is a
slight modification that we have to do
we know that ID field is actually an
integer so public end and you don't have
to have a parameter passed N and what
you need to have instead is a get and
set accessor since this is set you're
going to call this set and a get
accessor so what does the get axis are
going to do it is simply going to return
the ID so this under school ID and look
at this so public and instead of calling
it a set ID will call it as if you know
ID so the property name is ID and we are
saying okay if somebody sets the value
let's say for example how do they set it
something like
see one dot ID look at that it's
appearing as if it's a field ID let's
say if somebody sets it to one zero one
what's going to happen this one zero one
gets passed into this property and the
set accessor will be called because we
are setting the value and then how will
it be check there is a built-in keyword
called value okay so this value will
contain one zero one which are which we
are assigning to this property so this
one zero one actually gets passed into
this keyword so if 1 0 1 is 1 0 1 less
than or equal to 0 that's false so it
comes here and this dot ID equal to
again value so this is what is the
disconnect that you have to understand
the value keyword is the one which will
receive the value that we set to this
property okay so in this example we are
setting the ID to 1 0 1 so this 1 0 1
value gets passed into this keyword okay
so we use that if somebody passes 500
that gets passed again to this and since
we are setting the value the set
accessor gets invoked and similarly if
somebody is trying to print the value
how they would do that console.writeline
c1 dot you don't have to use cat ID
anymore c1 dot ID so now the c-sharp
will automatically understand that okay
somebody is trying to pull the value out
of this property so what happens is it
invokes this ID property and somebody is
trying to read the value so it invokes
the get accessor of this property and
returns the value which is there in that
private fear so pretty simple right and
the advantage of using this property is
look at this it's not like a method you
use the properties as if they are fears
but on the other hand when we had set ID
we had to call it like a method so
there's no need to make use of the set
ID or get ID methods anymore
instead we use this property public and
tidy and the same is the case we do for
name okay so what we do since name is of
type string
so public string and give it a
meaningful name maybe a name is the
property and we get rid of that
parameter and a property will have a set
and a get accessor so set access and a
get accessor so what will the get
accessor do it will simply return the
value that is present in the field now
it doesn't simply return that it has to
do this check so what we can do in the
get accessor will have this logic if you
remember this is the ternary operator we
are checking okay if this dot name is
null or empty then return no name else
return whatever is there in that name
feel okay so we can get rid of this cat
name now so what we are doing is we are
getting rid of the getter and setter
methods which were which we introduced
and we are using properties instead okay
so now we have to make use of that value
keyword because that's what receives the
value which people set to this property
all right so that's about name and then
this is interesting now look at this
this name property it has got both set
and get accessors meaning this is a
read/write property somebody can assign
a value to this property which in turn
will assign that value to the field and
somebody can read the value from this
property so it's a read/write property
God would get and set accessors it's a
read/write property but if you remember
from a previous example we wanted the
Pathmark field to be a read-only fear
okay so if you want a field to be
read-only you want your property also to
be read-only so what you do you only
have the get accessor you will not have
the set accessor so in that case it
becomes a read-only feel okay so how do
I do that again get past mark instead of
that we will just say past mark and we
don't have to have that parenthesis
because this is a property and all we
will have is a get accessor that's it
and we return that so now what we have
done in this example is we replaced all
the getter and setter methods with
properties with get and set accessors
and if you look at this example we have
to read right property's name and ID or
readwrite properties because they have
got get and set accessors whereas past
mark is a read-only property because it
has got only the get accessor okay so
let's go ahead and see how to use that
so we don't have to have set name
anymore instead c1 dot name is equal to
maybe mark and past mark I I will not be
able to set look at that if I try to set
past mark to maybe 35 or 34 whatever
look at this I get a compilation error
immediately and if you hover the mouse
over that you see property student that
Pathmark cannot be assigned to it is
read-only because why when we try to
assign a value pass mark property right
click on that and when you say go to
definition look at this property it has
got only the get accessor it doesn't
have the set accessor so you can't set a
value to that you can only read value
from that feel so that's why this is a
read-only feel so very simple to make a
property read-only just have the get
accessor remove
the set accessor that makes it read-only
and similarly if you want to make a
property right only then you knock off
the get accessor and have only the set
accessor that makes it right only you
can only you know write a value or set a
value but you cannot read value from
that property so that's that so now if I
want to go ahead and print that look at
that get name is like a method we don't
have to rely on getter and setter
methods anymore instead we use the
properties and look at this properties I
use them as if they are feels and
similarly if I want to use the pass mark
dot pass mark and look at this now I
don't get a compile error because the
run time is is good enough to understand
okay somebody is trying to read a value
no because it doesn't have an equal to
here it has an equal which means we are
trying to set a value so I think it
makes you know that decision based on
that and it's trying to read the pass
mark value here and since the pass my
property has a get accessor it will be
able to do that so when we go ahead and
run that the program works exactly the
same except that we using C shaft
properties instead of the getter and
setter methods okay so if we go back to
the slides
in c-sharp encapsulate and protect
fields we use properties instead of the
getter and setter methods we use getting
set accessors to implement properties a
property with both get and set accessor
is a readwrite property a property with
only get accessor is a read-only and a
property with only a write with the set
X is a write only property and the
advantage of using properties with
traditional get and set methods is that
you can access them as if they were
public fields and another important
concept that got introduced in c-sharp
3.0 is auto implemented properties
because many a times you know you may
not have any logic like this for example
here we are valid
in the name field and here we are
validating you know the student ID
should not be negative but many a times
let's say for example maybe I have
private strength maybe under school city
where the customer is living and maybe
private string under school email etc
now if I have to implement properties
for this then I have to type public
string and maybe city and then I get
accessor get returned this dot under
school city and similarly we need to
have the set accessor it will set in or
maybe this dot underscore city is equal
to value okay and if I have to implement
the email then I have to do public since
that is also a string public string
email and then we need to have a get and
a set accessor in the get accessor we
will say return this dot underscore
email and then the set X serve will say
this dot underscore email is equal to
value so I mean for any properties that
hasn't got any logic in the get or set
accessor you know this is a lot of code
and in reality you know the objects are
huge you know they will have city state
gender etc and most of them could be
optional and we don't have to have any
kind of validation happening so in those
cases this is a lot of code which we
have to write so that's why what they
have done is in c-sharp 3.0 they have
actually implemented or - implemented
properties let's look at an example of
how to do that
so so for the city private feel and for
this email private feel if we have to
convert them to properties I need to
have you know these many lines of code
but what we can do with Auto implemented
properties is you don't have to have two
private fields and then implement the
properties simply what you can do you
can get rid of those two fields and
obviously when you get rid of them you
get this warnings and then what you can
do is you can get rid of all this
implementation and you can simply say
get and set
similarly get and set so what's going to
happen behind the scenes is that you
know the compiler will create for us
automatically a private field and then
this property will be used to read and
write to that problem that private field
okay so if you have you know 50
properties which doesn't have any logic
with them with the get and set accessors
you can make use of the author
implemented properties which will reduce
the amount of food that you have to
write and for all the implemented
properties the compiler will
automatically create the backing private
fields for us okay so if you want to get
the size even reduced you can actually
format that you know something like that
yep and everything comes you know in one
line anyway so just like that you can
format this as well so it's just one
line
so if there is no additional logic in
the property accessors then we can make
use of order implemented properties
introduced in c-sharp 3.0 all the
implemented properties reduce the amount
of code that we have to write when you
use auto implemented properties the
compiler will create a private anonymous
field that can only be accessed through
properties get and set accessors that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
