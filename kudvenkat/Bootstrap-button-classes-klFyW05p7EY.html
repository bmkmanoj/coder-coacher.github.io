this video well discus bootstrap button
classes bootstrap button classes can be
used on any of these elements we can use
them on an anchor element but an element
input type equals button and input type
equals submit let's look at an example
now on this page right here we have a
button element input type equals button
and input type equals submit at the
moment we haven't applied any of the
bootstrap classes on these three
elements so if we view this page in the
browser this is how those three buttons
look like notice at the moment they're
using browser defaults let's now apply
one of the bootstrap button classes
which is BTN on all these three elements
and see what we get
let's apply this button class on the
rest of the two elements that is input
type equals button and input type equals
submit notice the styles of the buttons
now with that BTN class applied in
addition to the BTN class bootstrap also
has few other button classes as you can
see here we have BTN default BTN primary
etc let's use these classes in an
example and see what we get let's flip
to visual studio here is an example
that's making use of all the classes
that we have just seen on the slide
notice we have buttons here and in
addition to the BTN class we're using
all those classes that we have seen on
the slide median default bTW and primary
etc let's save these changes and when we
reload the page notice the look and feel
of the button depending on the class
that we are using we get a different
look and feel this is the button on
which we have applied BTN default class
this is the button with PT and primary
class so on and so forth look at this
button especially on this button we have
applied this class BTN link this is
going to display the button as if it's a
hyperlink but the behavior is still
going to be the button behavior so let's
look at when we actually use these
classes so if you want a standard button
you use PT and default class this BTN
primary indicates the primary actions in
a set of buttons BTN sucks
indicates a successful a positive action
BTN info indicates a button for
informational alert messages BTN warning
indicates caution should be taken with
this action BTN danger indicates a
dangerous or potentially negative action
BTN link D emphasizes a button by making
it look like a link while maintaining
button behavior button classes can also
be used on an anchor element let's use
these button classes with an anchor
element and see what we get
let's flip to visual studio here we have
an anchor element notice at the moment
we are not using any of the button
classes by default this is how the
hyperlink element is styled let's apply
one of the button classes let's first
apply the BTN class and see what we get
so with the BTN class applied this is
how the hyperlink is styled there is a
small difference in its style in
addition to the BTN class let's apply
one of these button classes let's apply
BTN primary class so in addition to the
BTN class
I am also applying BTN primary class so
with BTN primary class applied notice
the hyperlink element is now styled as a
button element but the behavior is still
going to be that of a hyperlink let's
now discuss creating buttons with
different sizes in bootstrap we have got
three different classes for that purpose
to create a large button like this use
button energy class for a small button
but an SM and for extra small button
button XS let's look at an example here
we have three buttons with those three
classes applied button lgsm and XS and
we reload this page we get the buttons
with those three different sizes as
expected to create a button that span
the full width of its parent use median
block class let's understand this with
an example
I'm going to replace this selected HTML
with another piece of HTML notice here
we have got for developments and on each
of the developments
using these four grid classes call LG m
d sm and XS will discuss these classes
with examples in one of our previous
videos in this series what these classes
are going to do is on a large screen
size we are going to get four columns
per row and on a medium screen size
three columns federal and on a small
screen size two columns per row and on
an extra small screen size only one
column parallel and within each
development we have another nested
development and on that development we
using this custom div class and if you
look at what this custom div class is
doing its setting padding to ten pixels
and width to 100% and then inside the
development we've got a button element
and on that button element we using BTN
and BTN primary classes so let's save
these changes and reload this page at
the moment we are on a large screen size
so we see four columns and within each
column we have a button displayed side
by side and on a medium screen size
notice we have three buttons on a small
screen size two buttons and on next row
small screen size in a one button
parallel but then notice the width of
the buttons in all the screen sizes the
width of the button is fixed now what we
want to do is make the width of the
button span you know to the full width
of its parent in this case the parent of
this button is this development and this
development width is 100% meaning you
know it is occupying the full width of
its parent in this case you know the
column that we have here so depending on
the screen size that we are viewing you
know
this HTML and depending on the width of
the column we want the button also to
span to that width we can very easily
achieve that by applying BTN block class
on each of these patterns so let's do
that now so along with median and BTN
primary classes I'm going to apply BTN
block class as well let's do that
for all the button elements let's do it
pattern 3 and finally 4 button 4 let's
save our changes and reload this page
notice now the width of the button you
know I spanning across the full width of
its parent so at the moment we are on a
large screen size let's reduce the size
clear medium screen size again look at
the buttons their size is changing
depending on the width of its parent and
on an extra small screen size look at
the width of these buttons to disable a
button set the disabled attribute of the
button to disabled
let's look at an example here we have a
pattern and we have set the disabled
attribute of the button to disable let's
save the changes reload this page notice
this is a disabled button when I move
the mouse over this button look at the
cursor style it changes to a stop sign
indicating that this button cannot be
clicked to disable a hyperlink use
disabled class let's look at an example
here we have a hyperlink with BTN and
BTN primary classes applied when we
reload this page we get a hyperlink
styled as a button we want this
hyperlink to be disabled to do that all
we have to do is apply disabled class
notice now we get that hyperlink
disabled thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
