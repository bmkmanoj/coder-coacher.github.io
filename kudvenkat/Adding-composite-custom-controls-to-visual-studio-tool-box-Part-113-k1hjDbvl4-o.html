venket this is part 1 1 3 of asp.net
video series in this video we'll discuss
about adding composite custom controls
to visual studio toolbox and in turn
using them in an asp.net web application
project in part 1 1/2 of asp.net video
series we have discussed about building
asp.net composite custom controls if you
haven't watched that video I would
strongly encourage you to do so before
continuing with the session in the
previous session if you remember we have
actually build a composite custom
control called custom calendar in this
session we will see how to add this
custom calendar control to the visual
studio toolbox and in turn use that in
an asp.net web application project but
before that recall that in the previous
session we have built this project as an
asp.net server control project so
obviously when I build it the solution
the project will also get built and then
since this is an asp.net server control
project and assembly will be generated
with a dot DLL extension so if I get
into the bin directory and debug they
should be this custom controls or DLL
and if you remember this project was
created in C Drive C Drive custom
controls is the name of the solution and
this custom controls is the name of the
project and within that bin and debug
which has got this custom control store
tll assembly and within this assembly we
have this custom control custom calendar
which we want to load into visual studio
toolbox ok now I have another project
here this is a simple asp.net web
application project so create an asp.net
web application project now I am on this
waveform waveform 9 dot aspx now I have
this toolbox here so I can simply drag
and drop any asp.net standard control
onto this waveform and use them on this
waveform similarly let's say is it
possible for us to actually load our
composite custom control that's the
custom calendar control into this visual
studio toolbox absolutely another thing
to notice here is that look at this all
the standard asp.net controls are
present under the standard tab and then
all the data related controls like data
list
grid-view etcetera they are present on
the data tab and validation controls and
the validation tab so basically the
controls are grouped according to the
function under their own tabs similarly
is it possible to create my own tab and
put all my custom controls under that
tab absolutely let's see how to create a
tab individual studio toolbox all you
have to do is right click on the toolbox
and select add tab and give a meaningful
name to your tab I'm going to call this
custom controls okay and I'm going to
place all custom controls under this tab
so how do I add items to this tab in the
toolbox simply right click on that and
select choose items ok so visual studio
should bring up this choose toolbox
items dialog box and remember the
assembly that contains our control is
present at this path so now with the
visual studio tool box choose toolbox
items dialog box we have this browse
button click this browse button and
navigate to that path so browse the
project is present in C Drive so C and
the name of the project is custom
controls so navigate the project bin
debug and look at this the name of the
assemblies custom controls or DLL I
select the assembly click open the name
of the assembly was custom controls or
DLL and look at this Visual Studio is
intelligent enough to detect that inside
that assembly there is a custom control
called custom calendar and it has added
that you know to the toolbox I mean it's
going to add that look at that we have a
checkbox next to that meaning this
control is now going to be added to this
toolbox and the custom controls so all
we have to do is click OK and that
should add the control to our toolbox
now all that is left out is stress
simply drag and drop it onto the webform
and use it like any of the standard
asp.net control ok so we have added
these custom calendar control to the
visual studio toolbox now simply drag
and drop it onto the waveform okay look
at that the control is now added to the
waveform and another important point to
keep in mind as soon as I added this
control on to the waveform so we're
going to make use of this control in
this project so as a result of the
behind-the-scenes look at the references
here a reference to the assembly that
contains that composite control is
automatically added here custom controls
assembly okay and let's flip to the
source mode here now when we dragged and
dropped that custom control from the
toolbox on to the visual studio waveform
three things happen the first thing it
has added a reference to the assembly
that contains that control and the
second thing it has automatically
generated data this register directive
for us this register directive is
actually going to register that control
with this waveform okay and this
register directive is having three
important attributes first the Assembly
attribute so the name of the assembly is
custom controls and within that assembly
what is the namespace custom control so
if you remember if we go back to the
custom controls project here look at
that the namespace is actually custom
controls so assembly namespace and tag
prefix look at this it's using a default
tag prefix of CC one now do you want to
have your own customized tag prefix if
that's your choice you can change it to
your choice for example look at this if
I drag and drop a standard text box
control onto the waveform for example or
a button control onto the waveform look
at this the tag prefix is ASP indicating
that this is an asp.net button control
okay now similarly let's say all the
controls or custom controls that are
developed by prism I need to have a
prism of prefix is that possible
absolutely so I'm changing that to
Praveen so along the same lines when you
change the tag prefix wherever you use
the custom calendar control you need to
change the tag prefix wherever it's
referenced as well so the tag prefix is
presume just so just by looking at the
tag I can say okay this is a prism
control not a standard asp.net control
okay so that's the register directly on
the third step is it automatically
generated this control declaration for
me look at that it has this custom
calendar and then ID is equal to
whatever is that the default ID you can
again change it to a meaningful name and
is equal to silver attribute okay now if
you remember in the previous session
when we are building this asp.net custom
control we skipped up you know this
attribute we we said that we are going
to discuss about this in this video
session when we actually use this custom
calendar control so what is this toolbox
data attribute this is the one which
controls the generation of the tag you
know when you actually drag-and-drop
that control on the waveform so when I
dragged and drop the custom calendar
control from the toolbox on to this
waveform this tag is generated okay
now the tag name okay is actually
specified within discuss you know within
the custom control here using this
toolbox data attribute to look at this
the tag name is actually custom calendar
look at this here we have an opening
angle bracket and then a placeholder
that placeholder is for the tag prefix
so on our waveform if you look at that
the tag prefix is pledging so opening
angle bracket tag prefix and then colon
and then the tag name so if you look at
that so opening angle bracket a
placeholder for the tag prefix : and
then our tag name is custom calendar
control and then run it is equal to
server attribute which is what we have
next so run at is equal to server and
then this is a self closing tag so we
are closing that with custom calendar
again so since that is a self closing
it's just closed there okay
all right so let's get rid of that one
there so here until now we have just
done two simple things we have loaded
the custom calendar control into the
tool box and then next we have actually
dragged and dropped it onto the waveform
which generated us which generated the
stag the register directive and the
reference automatically and the
generation of this directive is
controlled by the toolbox data attribute
okay so now let's build the solution at
this moment so build solution you should
see build succeeded now let me go ahead
and run this okay now this calendar
Sol is going to have some issues at the
moment because we have not fully
implemented that control so if you look
at the design of the webform here while
that page is loading up okay the first
problem is this one there is no image
associated with the image button right
so there is no image associated with the
image button here and then the next
problem is that the calendar is always
visible but remember our goal was
initially when this control loads up we
want only that calendar I mean that text
box and the image button to be visible
when the user clicks on that image
button that's when this calendar should
be visible and as soon as I select a
date from the calendar the selected date
should be populated with in the text box
control and the calendar should become
invisible but nothing of that is
happening at the moment so we have all
these problems here ok we will discuss
about how to solve these problems one by
one in the upcoming videos first we will
see how to actually associate an image
with this image button and then upon
clicking that image that's when we want
to show this calendar and if I click on
that image again it should actually hide
that calendar and obviously when I
select a date the selected date should
be populated with in the text box
control will discuss about how to solve
these problems one by one in our
upcoming videos on this slide you can
find resources for asp.net c-sharp and
sequel server interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
