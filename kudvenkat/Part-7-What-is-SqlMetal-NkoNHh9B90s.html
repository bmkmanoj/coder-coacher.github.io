tutorial in this video we'll discuss
what a sequel metal and how to use it
so what sequel matter sequel metal is
command-line code generation tool used
to generate link to sequel classes there
are two ways we can generate link to
sequel classes we can either use Visual
Studio or sequel metal you know previous
video sessions we discussed how to use
Visual Studio to generate into sequel
classes in this video we'll discuss how
to use sequel metal to generate link the
sequel classes so what's the windows
pathway we can find this tool on my
machine this is the part where this tool
is available I have this path already
typed within the notepad so let's copy
that stick in the run window and press
Enter
here we should find sequel metal dot e
xane so this is a command-line tool so
let's fire up Visual Studio command
prompt and do that click on the start
button all programs Visual Studio 2010
Visual Studio Tools and Visual Studio
command prompt right click on that run
as administrator'
now there are several options that we
can use with this tool and if you want
all the options to be listed simply type
sequel metal dot exe in space four slash
question mark and placenta this is going
to list all these features that we can
use with sequel metal tool now on the
slide we have some of the important
options now the first option here is the
forward slash server option so this is
going to specify the name of the
database server so I have the database
server also installed on my machine so
this server is going to be localhost in
this case and within that database
server what is the name of the database
we specify that using for slash database
option so the name of the database here
is sample and within the sample database
at the moment we've got these two tables
so what is the sequel metal going to do
it's going to generate entities for
those two tables right so now when the
entities are generated where do we want
those entities to be present that is
what name space should they belong to
we specify that using four slash
namespace switch so in this case the
entities are going to belong to demo
namespace and then the generated DB ml
file what should be the name of the file
we specify that using four slash DB ml
option so we want the generated file to
be sample dot DB ml and we want that to
be stored in C colon backslash sequel
metal generated files folder I have this
folder already created so let's navigate
to that folder so sequel metal generated
files at the moment this folder is empty
now you can give any name that you want
for this folder it's just used to store
the generated DB ml file and finally we
are using four slash context switch to
specify the name of the generated data
context class so we want to generate a
data context class to be named sample
data context so I have this command
again already typed within the notepad
so let's copy that and let's go to
visual studio command prompt paste it
there and then press Enter so this
should automatically generate that
sample dot DB ml file and it should
place that within the sequel metal
generated files folder today we have
this sample dot DB ml file now in the
example that we have seen we have only
used a few of the options if you want
the full list of options please check
this MSDN article now let us see how to
use this generated DB ml file in a
dotnet application so let's flip to
visual studio so here I have a new empty
asp.net web application project all I
have done so far is included this
connection string in the web config file
this connection string at the moment is
pointing to the sample database now to
this project let's also add a web form
and on this platform let's drag and drop
a grid we control let's get the code
behind file and what we want to do is
read the connection string from web
config file so let's bring in system
configuration namespace and within the
page load event let's create a variable
of type string and let's use the
configuration manager class to read the
connection string so what's the name of
the connection string here it's called
sample connection string so let's copy
that so we want to retrieve that
connection string and now let's create
an instance of sample data context now
remember you know within the switch we
have specified that we want the name of
the data context class to be sample data
context okay
so within the generated DB ml file we
should have that class as well so now we
need to add this DB ml file to this
project so to do that right click on the
project name add you want to add the
existing item navigate to C colon
backslash sequel metal generated files
folder and we want to add that so it has
added that one and if you go to the
sample dot design of designer dot CS
file you should have all the generated
classes notice that we have the sample
data context class and if we navigate a
bit up look at that it's part of demo
namespace and we should also have the
classes for employee and department all
right now within the code-behind file
let's go and create an instance of the
sample data context class let's call it
sample dbcontext equals new sample data
context and look at this the constructor
now expects a connection string to be
passed and we already have the
connection string so let's pass that and
we can use the DB context and it should
have employees property which is going
to return us all the employees which we
are going to set as the data source for
the grid we control and then invoke the
data bind method
let's run this and see if we cut the
employee is displayed within the grid we
control there we go that's it for today
thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
