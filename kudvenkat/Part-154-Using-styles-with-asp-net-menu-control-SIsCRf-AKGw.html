this video we'll discuss using styles
with menu control this is continuation
to part 153 so please watch but 153
before proceeding to configure styles
for this statically displayed portion of
the menu we can use these styles this is
the menu control that we worked with in
the previous session notice that at the
moment for the statically displayed
portion of the menu we don't have any
background color let's say we want to
apply red background color to achieve
that we can use static menu style let's
see how to use it so this is the master
page that we worked with in the previous
session and here we have the menu
control let's use static menu style and
specify background color to red let's
flip this to the design we'll notice
that we have a red background color
let's actually reload this page look at
that we get red background color but
look at the dynamically displayed
portion of the menu do we have that
background color there no we don't
that's because the styles that we apply
using static menu style are only
applicable for the statically displayed
portion of the menu now here at the
moment we only have one level statically
displayed but we can control how many
levels are statically displayed using
static display levels property of the
menu control that we discussed in the
previous session now let's actually
apply static display levels property and
set that to two so basically we have two
levels within the menu control and we
are displaying all the levels statically
so if that is the case well this static
display style be applied for all the
levels absolutely because you know these
levels are now statically displayed so
the style that we have set using static
menu style will be applicable you know
for the entire statically displayed
portion of the menu and notice that we
have another level but this one is
dynamically displayed portion so that
style is not applied for this one
let's actually flip this back to one so
that we can discuss in a bit how to
apply styles for dynamically displayed
portion of the menu alright now if you
notice here we are using inline styles
using inline styles is not a very good
practice we should always be referencing
styles from an external style sheet so
the first step here is to actually add a
style sheet and let's call it styles dot
CSS and let's specify a style class
let's call this menu style and let's set
background color to red all right now
let's flip to our masturbate we need to
reference this style sheet with an old
master page so let's drag and drop the
style sheet within the head section so
there we have a link tag or to generate
it for us now instead of this inline
style let's set CSS class to the class
that we have in the style sheet let's
save it let's flip this to the design
mode and see if we get that style look
at that we still get that style let's
actually reload this page and verify it
okay so look at that for the statically
displayed portion of the menu
we still have that red background color
all right so static menu item style now
this style is applicable for the
individual menu items in the statically
displayed portion of the menu now let's
say for example for each menu item that
we have here in this statically
displayed portion we want to have a
white border a white solid one pixel
border to achieve that we can use static
menu item style property so
let's flip this to the source mode and
use static menu style static menu item
style and let's say for example we want
to set border color to white and we want
the border width to be 1 pixel and
border style to be solid let's say that
let's reload this one and notice that we
get that border now is there a way to
control styles for the entire menu
control that is statically displayed
potion as well as the dynamically
displayed portion absolutely if that's
the case all you need to do is apply the
style at the menu control level itself
for example let's say we want the font
color you know within the entire menu
control to be white if that's the case I
can set full color property at the menu
control level let's set it to white
let's reload this and look at that you
know statically displayed potion the
font color is white even for the
dynamically displayed potion alright now
we will discuss static selected style in
just a bit let's discuss static hover
style so this style is applicable for
the statically displayed menu item over
which you know we hover the mouse so for
example let's say when we hover the
mouse over the menu item we want that
menu item to be bolded if that is the
case we can use this style static color
style so let's use that style
and let's set font bold too true now you
may be wondering why are we using inline
styles you know we know that it's not a
good practice that is to speed things up
you know but I have just shown you how
to use a style sheet so instead of
specifying the styles here we can simply
specify them within the style sheet and
all we need to do here is set the CSS
class all right now let's run this and
see if the hover style works as expected
look at that as we hover the mouse over
the menu item gets bolded
now let's discuss static selected style
basically this style is applicable for
the selected menu item again it's
applicable only for the statically
displayed portion of the menu because
look at the name it says static selected
style
so let's actually say for example you
know when we select an item a menu item
we want the background color of the
selected menu item to be black so let's
use static selected style and let's
simply set back color to black all right
let's reload this and see if it actually
works let's click on whom look at that
that's what is selected beer on the home
page but the background color change to
black know it then let's click on
employee look at that it didn't change
as well why is that that's basically
because look at this if we actually
remove the navigate URL so look at the
menu item here home let's get rid of
this navigate URL attribute let's save
it let's reload this page once again and
now let me select this look at that it's
working now but when I click on employee
we are an employee dot aspx but that is
not selected when I click on home look
at that we are still on employee dot
aspx but the background color for the
menu for the select
menu item work that's basically because
when you are on the same page you know
the menu control is able to remember
this state but once we redirect the user
to another page somehow we have to tell
it which item within the menu is
selected because it's not remembering
that state okay so let's see how to
achieve that so let's put this navigate
URL back so let's set navigate URL to
the home page all right now within the
code-behind file of the master page in
the page load event let's use a for each
loop now what we are going to do here is
we are going to loop through each item
that we have in the menu control and
then if the navigate URL property of the
menu item matches with the name of the
page in the URL then we know for sure
that's the link the user has clicked on
and we want that menu item to be
selected so that's what we are going to
do so basically we are going to loop
through each menu item within the menu
control so for each menu item so
basically a menu is a collection of menu
items and let's call this item in the ID
of the menu control is menu 1 dot items
is going to return as the menu item
object so if the menu item dot navigate
URL property if that equals so how are
we going to get the page name to get
that we are going to make use of request
object request dot we have this property
app relative current execution file path
which is going to return us the name of
the page so if the navigate URL matches
with the name of the page then we know
we want to set the selected property of
that item to true it's as simple as that
so let's actually run this
so we are on the homepage now when the
menu control loads up home should be
selected look at that it works as
expected let's click on employee and
look at that it works now let's actually
change this employee dot aspx from
capital e to small e and see if that
works
look at that it didn't work okay so you
know it's case sensitive
but we don't want that to be case
sensitive if that is the case this
equals method has got another argument
that we can pass so string comparison we
want to ignore case so in variant
culture ignore case alright the best
change let's once again run this and see
if it works as expected all right now we
are on the home page let's change you
know from capital H to small eight look
at that it works as expected we go to
employee page let's change from capital
e to small e it still works
okay so if we redirect from here if I
type small H home dot aspx so we are
typing the URL directly and hit enter
look at that home is automatically
selected all right so far these styles
are only applicable for this statically
displayed portion of the menu now to
configure the styles for the dynamically
displayed portion of the menu we can use
their dynamic counterparts here look at
this just like how we have static menu
style we have dynamic menu style so
similarly if you want to read a
background color let's go to the master
page and we can use dynamic menu style
so dynamic menu style let's set back
color to red and similarly dynamic menu
item style and we want even for the
dynamic menu to have a No
a white border of one pixel and
similarly dynamic our style we want the
font to be bolded and finally dynamic
selected style to be back background
color alright so let's run this and see
if everything works as expected
ok look at that the dynamically
displayed portion has also got the same
styles and look at this when we select
the item from the dynamically displayed
portion we are in edit trees you may dot
aspx and look at that editor's you may
is that selected no it's not so why is
that that's basically because look at
the menu items how they are so if you
look at this menu at the top level how
many menu items we have we have only 4
menu items and then employee has got 3
menu items okay so basically though
these are menu item objects these are
actually child items now if you actually
run this code and put a breakpoint here
and then if you check the items property
items dot counter property it only
returns 4 items back so which is only
the top-level items now here we have
selected an item you know the child item
so basically what we need to do is loop
through the change items as well and
then compare their navigate URL property
with the URL here the page name and if
the match we want that to be selected so
basically to achieve that we are going
to write that occurs you function in the
code-behind file of the master page now
we discussed recursive functions in
c-sharp interview questions we
you series so if you're new to recursive
functions please watch that video
basically a recursive function is a
function that calls itself so here let's
write a private method and let's call it
maybe check and then let's pass to this
method and menu item object and all this
method is going to do is if the item
basically I'm going to use the same
condition here so let's copy that
condition and pass it right here so if
the item navigate URL equals you know
basically the page name in the URL then
we want that item to be selected so item
dot selected equals true now if that's
not the case and if the item has got
child items and if the child items count
is greater than zero then we know there
are some child items present in which
case we want to loop through each item
and then check if the navigate URL
property of that item matches with the
name of the page in the URL okay so to
do that I'm going to loop through again
each child item that is present in the
item object so for each menu item and
let's call this menu item in item dot
child items so if the count returns
greater than zero we know for sure there
are going to be child items if that's
the case use a for each loop and loop
through all the tail items and then the
cursor relay call this function so when
it calls again what's going to happen
it's going to check for the child items
okay is the navigate URL property
the name of the page in the URL if
that's the case set selected property to
true it's as simple as that
so let's call this check function so
this function is calling itself here so
this is a recursive function all right
so let's run this and see if it works as
expected so we have employee here edit
trees you may so we are on editors you
may look at that for some reason editors
you may it's not selected let's see why
let's click Edit job we're on edit job
employer Edit job is not selected let's
say why is that ok so basically that's
because we have written this function
here but we are not using it in the page
load event we are still using the same
old code so what we need to do here is
get rid of this if block and call this
check function so check and pass the
item okay so let's run this one small
and check if it works so employee let's
go to upload a resume a we are unup load
resume and look at that upload as you
may select it let's select view resume
we are on view resume and beauties you
may selected all right so we can also
configure styles for each level in the
menu control using level menu item
styles or level selected style ok so
here basically within our menu control
we have two levels so you can use menu
item style so the first item here is
going to set the style for the first
level and the second item here is going
to set the style for the second level so
let me explain what I mean let's
actually go to this master page let's
get rid of these static and dynamic
styles and instead of that let's use
new item style so basically we using
level menu item style so level menu item
styles and let's use menu item style
let's Africa for example we want to set
back color here to maybe
hello so that is for the first level
look at that
the background color is there hello now
that will be only for the first level
okay but look at the dynamically
displayed potion it still doesn't have
any background color I mean the second
that's the second level so if you want
to set this tile for the second level
then use another menu item style so
maybe let's set this to our red and
let's reload this once again so for the
second level now we should have red
color look at that and look at the third
level it doesn't have any style if you
want to set it for the third level then
you will use another menu item style
maybe let's set this to green
look at that okay in a similar fashion
you can also set a level selected style
instead of using static selected style
and dynamic selected style we can use
level selected styles and set the
selected styles for different levels
within your menu control alright that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
