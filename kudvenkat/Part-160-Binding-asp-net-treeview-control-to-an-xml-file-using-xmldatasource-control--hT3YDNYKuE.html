this video well disk is binding tree
view control to an XML file using XML
data source control this is continuation
to part 159 so please watch part 159
from the asp.net tutorial before
proceeding with this video at the moment
the data for the tree view controller is
hard-coded within the control itself and
that's what we want to get rid of in
this video instead of hard-coding the
data for the tree view control inside
the control itself we want to move this
data to an XML file and then we want to
bind the tree view control to that XML
file so let's first of all get rid of
this nodes element from the control and
look at that at the moment the tree view
control has got only Styles no data
whatsoever now let's add an XML file to
this project so add new item and we want
to add XML file and let's give it a
meaningful name let's call this tree
view data XML and I have already
implemented the required XML so let's
copy it and paste it right here and if
you look at this XML that's very
straightforward to support the logical
structure of our website so we have this
route element called items you can give
it any meaningful name you want and
directly underneath that route element
we have three tree view items home
employee employer and admin actually for
under employee
we've got three more items similarly on
the employer we have got three more
items and notice that each tree view
item element has got text and navigate
URL attributes in a bit we'll see how we
are going to make use of those
attributes so that's the first tab add
an XML file and the second step is to
drag and drop an XML data source control
and then specify the data file attribute
so what is this data file attribute
going to tell you know this is going to
tell the file that contains the data so
here the data file attribute is
three view data XML in a bit we'll
discuss XPath attribute so first of all
let's drag and drop the XML data source
control onto our waveform and XML data
source control should be present on the
data tab so the first thing here we have
to specify is the data file attribute so
we want to point to this tree view data
dot XML file so let's copy the name of
the file and let's you still the
character here till that specifies the
root directory because this tree view
data that XML file is present within the
root directory of the project so within
the root directory find tree view data
or XML that's the second step and what's
the final step configure the tree view
control itself look at this we need to
set datasource ID attribute and look at
what this data source ID ID attribute is
settle it is set to the ID of the XML
data source control so basically get
data from this XML data source control
and then the important thing is to
specify data bindings okay so within
data bindings we have tree node binding
and what is the data member tree view
item and text field is nothing but the
text attribute navigate URL field is
navigate URL attribute and target equals
blank you know means when we click on
that item within the tree view control
the target page is going to be opened in
a new window so let's specify this on
the tree view control so within the tree
view control itself the first thing is
we need to set datasource ID attribute
and we need to set this to the ID of the
xml data source control in this case
it's XML data source 1 and then we need
to specify data bindings
so three note bindings the first thing
is we need to specify data member so
what's the data member within our XML
file it's nothing but tree view item and
we need to specify text field so text
field is going to be text attribute and
navigate URL field so navigate URL field
is going to be navigate URL and let's
also specify target attribute so target
we want the target page to be opening in
a new window so we are setting it to
underscore blank all right with all this
in place let's go and run this and see
what output we get we should get the
same output in this case we are binding
to an XML file look at that you know for
okay look at this why is the style you
know here we have root node style in a
background color of you know Navy that's
not applied to these nodes here why is
that that's because this employee
employer and admin are no longer root
nodes because we have one root node here
which is items you know in our example
this root node doesn't make any sense
within the tree view so we want to hide
that we actually want you know the
hierarchy to start from home employee
employer and admin levels not from that
items root node so how do we hide that
the simplest way to achieve that is to
basically set this XPath attribute so
basically this XPath is telling read
tree view items that's present directly
underneath this root item items so
that's going to fix that issue and it's
also going to apply the styles that we
have specified for root nodes all right
so let's go ahead
and specify the expert attribute so
x-bar equals so at the root level we
have items and underneath that we have
three view items so read that that's the
X part alright but this change let's run
this look at that we get the same output
as in the previous session
this time we are binding the three we
control to an XML file alright so here
are the three steps that's it for today
thank you for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
