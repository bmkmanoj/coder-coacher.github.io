am Frank it in this video I let you know
about some simple tips and tricks to use
this channel effectively to your
advantage my youtube channel URL is
youtube.com forward slash could bank it
once you type this URL into your browser
vent and then + enter you should land on
my youtube channel page and notice this
here you have link called playlists
click on this link and on this page I
have used YouTube playlist to organize
all the videos into your logical
sequence so here you can find playlists
for asp.net grid-view tutorial video
dotnet asp.net c-sharp dotnet basics and
sequel server let's say for example I
click on asp.net tutorial for beginners
link here so here you can find all the
asp.net videos arranged in a logical
sequence ok now if you are looking for a
specific concept and you can't find it
for some reason then you can use the
search functionality so YouTube channel
has a search functionality so on this
YouTube channel page so here I have the
search channel let's say I'm looking for
a concept on polymorphism I can type it
in there and then click on that
magnifying glass because that the first
video there is on polymorphism so you
can use the youtube search channel
functionality to search for a specific
video that you are looking for you can
also use the browser search
functionality let me tell you what I
mean by that for example let's say there
is a video in asp.net that I am looking
for for example I want to know about I
is so I am in asp.net tutorial playlist
here and then when I am on that plate
lets press ctrl F so that should bring
up the browser you know search
functionality so here I can type let's
say for example I am looking for I is
look at this the moment I type in I is
there are 6 matches so the first one is
Internet Information Services and
asp.net I click on the down arrow look
at that I find the other video on is so
this browser search functionality should
highlight all the videos that has
iis in
their title so you can either use the
browser search functionality or YouTube
channel search functionality to search
for a specific video that you are
looking for all right now all the code
samples that were used in the demos and
if you're looking for text version of
the videos they can be found on my blog
so here is my blog address c-sharp -
video - tutorials dot blog spot.com okay
so on this blog let me go to the blog
c-sharp video tutorials at blogspot.com
now on this blog on the right-hand side
you can see links here for example if
I'm looking for let's say preview video
tutorial I click on that link then on
this page you should find all grid-view
tutorials organized again in a logical
sequence okay but then here you'll find
the text version of the videos okay so
for example I want to know about merging
cells and gridview footer or so I click
on that and notice that I should get you
know the text version of the video okay
so any code that we used in the demo you
should find it there and then look at
this image at the bottom if you click on
that image then this will take you to
youtube playlist where you have all grid
view video videos arranged in a logical
sequence and then you can pick and watch
the video that you are interested in

obviously to teach is to learn for
example if I have to record a video I
will spend you know a lot of time
researching that concept and make sure
you know I am NOT I'm giving the exact
information the right information and
I'm not misguiding people so I will have
to do some research before I can
actually answer
somebody's questions so which means I am
learning just imagine if I answer five
questions a day by the end of the month

means I could have learnt 150 new things
