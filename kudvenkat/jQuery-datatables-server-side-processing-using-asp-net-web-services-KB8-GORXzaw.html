this video we'll discuss implementing
server-side processing for jQuery data
tables plugin using asp.net web services
this is continuation to part 111 in part
111 we discussed implementing
server-side processing using asp.net
generic handler in this video we'll
discuss doing the same using asp.net web
services here is the request response
cycle between those three components the
jQuery data tables plugin is going to
call the asp.net web service the web
service will then call the database
stored procedure retrieves the data
converts the data to JSON format the
jQuery data tables plug-in will then
display that JSON format a data on the
web page so let's look at that in action
let's slip to visual studio so this is
the same example that we worked with in
a previous video session notice here
we've got our asp.net handler employee
data Handler and this is calling or SP
get employee stood procedure and the web
page notice that we have the jQuery data
table plug-in here and this is actually
making a call to our asp.net generic
handler now we want to use asp.net web
service instead of this generic handler
so the first thing to do is implement
that web service so to a project let's
go ahead and add a web service and I'm
going to call this employee service dot
ASM X and let's go ahead and implement
our web method first of all we want this
web service to be called from the script
so I'm going to uncomment this attribute
and let's change the name of the
function to get employees and the
function is not actually going to return
anything instead we will write the JSON
data to the response stream so let's
change the return type to wired now
instead of writing the same code again
within this web method I'm actually
going to copy that code from our asp.net
generic handler so first of all we need
the namespaces so I'm going to copy
these namespaces
and paste them within our web service we
already have system dot fab so I'm going
to remove that and let's also copy the
suicide code from our asp.net generic
handler so I'm going to copy all that
code and paste it within our web service
get employees function and we also need
the private function which gets the
total employee count so let's copy that
as well from the asp.net generic Handler
and paste it in our asp.net web service
all right we have some errors we'll fix
them now look at this if you look at the
asp.net generic handler the process
function here the process request
function here has got the context object
and we are reading you know using that
context object the query string
parameter values now here what we are
using is a web service so the first
thing that we need to do is convert you
know them to function parameters so to
the web method you know we will receive
them as parameters so the jQuery data
tables plugin is going to post the data
to this function okay so let's turn them
into function parameters here so I
display length that's going to be
integer so I'm going to specify that as
and I display length and I display start
and end I sort column sort direction and
search parameters they're going to be of
type string so string sort direction and
string s search
okay now I am simply going to replace
them using these parameters so display
length equals I display length I display
start
and short column equals I sort column
sort Direction equals s sort direction
and finally the search s search okay so
we have initialized these variables
which gets passed to the stored seizure
then we have one more error here so here
we need to change that capital R to
capital letter C
because we're using the HTTP context
object here you know within the asp.net
generic handler that's passed as a
parameter to this process request
function but here by using you know the
asp.net HTTP context object directly
okay all right
so a web service is ready now we don't
have any compilation error so let's
build the solution to make sure so bill
succeeded now let's go to the web page
now at the moment the data table is
actually making a request to the asp.net
generic handler instead we want to make
a request to our web service and the
name of the web service is employee
service so employee service dot ASM X
forward slash and the method name is get
employees so let's call that function
and look at this be suicide so basically
we are telling the agree data tables
that we want to implement server-side
processing this is the URL from where we
need to get the data now we want to post
the data to that get employees function
so we have to tell that to the jQuery
data tables plugin and I do that by
using s server method option s here
specifies that there's a string option
and I'm going to tell it to post the
data so the we want to issue a post
request the data for these parameters
should be posted to this get employees
function that's what we are essentially
telling he
okay so let's save our changes rundas
now we still should get the same data
okay but we are using the web service
now so look at this the paging is
working
search is working sorting is working
right but at the moment we are using web
service so here is the HTML and here is
the jQuery code thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
