this video we'll discuss how to make
Ajax requests using jQuery AJAX function
in jQuery we've got several functions
available to issue Ajax requests we've
got load get and post we have discussed
all these functions in detail in the
previous sessions of this video series
all these methods are actually wrapper
methods and they use ajax method under
the hood let's actually confirm this
let's flip to Zelia now this is the same
example that we worked with in the
previous video session notice that at
the moment we are using the jquery post
function let's right-click on this and
select go to definition so we are in the
jQuery source code now and notice this
post function is actually calling jQuery
AJAX function similarly get also calls
the jquery ajax function under the hood
notice that it's calling again the
jquery ajax function let's quickly check
it for load to call the load function we
need a selector so let's include a dummy
selector here and if we scroll down a
bit further notice that even the load
function issues a call to jQuery AJAX
method so all these functions that is
load get and post under the hood they
actually call the jQuery Ajax function
these wrapper methods are easier to use
but they do not provide much flexibility
if you want to have complete control on
configuring the behavior of the ajax
request then use ajax method here is the
syntax of ajax method we pass a single
javascript object and this object is
going to contain all the options that
define the behavior of the ajax request
if you want to know the complete list of
options available then visit this jQuery
documentation URL so on this page we
have all the options available that we
can use with this jquery ajax function
so for example if you want to specify
the URL to which you want to make a
request then you use this URL option if
you want to specify whether you
they should get up post request then you
have this method option if you want to
issue a get request you know you specify
get if it is post then specify post
similarly if you want to call a function
you know when the request completes
successfully then you have this success
option if there is an error processing
the request and if you want to handle
the error you can specify a callback
function using the error option so now
let's look at an example of using this
jQuery Ajax function let's flip to
visual studio let's actually modify this
example to use the jQuery AJAX function
instead of post function so I'm going to
leave this code here so let's go ahead
and use the jQuery AJAX function and to
this function I'm going to pass a single
actually if you look at this jQuery AJAX
function intellisense notice that it is
showing you know URL and then options
parameter actually this Ajax function
has got two overloads the first overload
is this one where you can specify URL
parameter separately and then all the
options that you want to include and we
have another overload here where you
just pass the javascript object and
specify all the options including the
URL let's go ahead and use the second
overloaded version so we are going to
pass a javascript object and here we are
going to specify all the options so
first we want to specify the URL to
which we want to issue a request so I'm
going to use URL : and then the URL
itself
okay and next we want to specify the
data that we want to pass to the server
so I'm going to use the data option and
we have the object here so let's copy
and paste it so that's the data that we
want to send to the server then we want
to specify the type of request you know
whether you want to issue a get a post
request and to do that I'm going to use
this method option so I want to issue a
post request and I'm I also want to
specify the type of data that we are
going to get back from the server now to
specify that I'm going to use data type
option and we are actually going to get
XML data back so let's specify the data
type as XML now once the request is
processed successfully we want to you
know handle that response and then
display that within the UI elements so
on success I want to call a function so
we can specify a callback function here
so I'm actually going to make a copy of
this one so let's go ahead and paste
that there so that's it
so whatever we are doing here we are now
doing using the Ajax function so we have
specified the URL specify the data that
we want to pass to the server whether we
want to issue a get a post request here
we're using the post method so it's
going to issue a post request that's the
reason we have specified method as post
in case if you want issue a get request
simply change it to get and the return
type that is the type of data that we
are expecting from the server is XML we
have specified that here using the data
type option and here we have the success
callback function and we have that
success callback function here all right
so let's go ahead and delete this bit
from here so let's save the changes
let's go ahead and reload this page now
when the textbox receives focus we
should get the help text and if we view
the request in fiddler it should be
issuing a post
request now if you want to issue a get
request instead of post simply change
the method to get so let's save the
changes reload this page and the last
request should be a get request look at
that it's a get request and notice that
the help text key is actually appended
to the URL and here is that code which
we have just discussed in our next video
we'll discuss how to call and consume
asp.net web service using the jquery
ajax function that's it for today thank
you for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
