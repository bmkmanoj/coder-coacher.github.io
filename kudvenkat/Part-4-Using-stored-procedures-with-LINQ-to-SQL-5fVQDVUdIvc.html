tutorial in this video we'll discuss
retrieving data using stood procedures
with link to sequel this is continuation
to part three so please watch part 3
before proceeding let's slip to visual
studio this is the same example that we
worked with in the previous video
session to keep this example simple
let's remove the login code that we have
here and let's run the application let's
go back to sequel server and then open
sequel profiler let's run a new trace
and let's click this care data button
and if you notice sequel profiler this
is the sequel query that gets executed
against the underlying database now
instead of this ad-hoc sequel statement
we want a select stored procedure to be
executed so let's look at the steps
involved so the first step is to
actually create the stored procedure
itself and if you look at the select
stored procedure here it's pretty
straightforward with a single select
statement so here we are selecting all
the columns from employee's tables and
to speed things up I already have the
stored procedure here so let's go ahead
and execute the sequel and let's refresh
the stored procedures folder so there we
have the get employees store procedure
now let's go back to visual studio and
let's view the server explorer expand
data connections and now let's refresh
the stored procedures folder and we
should see the get employees tour
procedure now when we drag and drop
tables on to the link to sequel designer
you know for every table a class will be
created similarly when we drag and drop
a stored procedure on to this designer
surface an equivalent c-sharp method
will be created so here we have classes
for department and employees tables
let's drag and drop the stored procedure
so look at this we have this get
employees method automatically created
look at the name of the method it
matches with
name of the store procedure okay so all
that is left now is to actually invoke
this method and within the code-behind
file at the moment you know this the
LINQ query that we are issuing instead
of that we have the DB context object so
DB context dot get employees look at
this let's run the application let's
clear this trace and let's click get
data button so we have the employee data
loaded
let's stop this and look at this so if
you look at this trace here notice that
get employees stored procedure is
executed now let's Impa inspect the
c-sharp method that is generated so this
is the method that represents our store
procedure now let's right click on this
and then go to the definition and if you
look at the return type of this method
look at this it is returning something
called I single result of get employee
result so there are two things that we
need to understand here first of all why
single result does not mean this method
is going to return a single employee
record it means it's going to return as
single result set okay it is a single
result set for the list of all employees
and then look at the return type get
employee result now we didn't define
this class so where did this class come
it is auto-generated okay and if you
look at the naming convention it follows
get employees is the name of the stored
procedure and then to that this result
word is appended so get employees result
is the return type now is it possible to
modify the return type of this method
absolutely and there are two ways we can
do that now if you look at this get
employees method what are we actually
expecting this method to return a list
of employees right so we want this
method to return an employee type and to
change the return type one way is if we
go back to the link to sequel class
designer so right click on the method go
to its properties and then look at this
return type here at the moment it is
auto-generated type okay instead of that
let's select this employee type we have
a warning click YES on that and then now
run the application just to make sure it
still returns the data so let's get back
so we still get the data now if we go
back to the skit employees go to the
definition on that look at that now the
result return type is employee so I
single result of employee okay so that's
one way and other ways at the time of
creating the stored procedure we can I
mean we have a way to modify the return
type now if we go to the server Explorer
and if we drag and drop this directly on
the designer surface then by default it
uses the default naming convention that
is the name of the stored procedure plus
result word okay now if I had drag and
drop this on this employee type then the
return type of this stored procedure is
going to be employee so now if we let's
save the changes let's go to get
employees go to definition and look at
that let's return type is employee so in
this video we have seen how to use a
select stored procedure with link to
sequel in our next video we'll discuss
how to perform insert update and delete
using stored procedures that's it for
today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
