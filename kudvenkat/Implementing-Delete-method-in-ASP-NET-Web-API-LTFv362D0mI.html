tutorial in this video we'll disc is
implementing delete method in asp.net
Web API so let's flip to visual studio
within our employees controller let's
include our delete method the method is
going to be public return type is void
let's name the method delete to delete
an employee we will have to pass the ID
of the employee that we want to delete
and first let's create an instance of
our employee dbcontext employee DB
entities let's name it entities equals
new employee DB entities entities dot
employees dot remove and we have to
specify the entity that we want to
remove so entities dot employees dot
first or default where employee employee
dot ID equals the ID that we are passing
to the delete method so this lambda is
going to return an employee that we want
to delete and it removes from the
employee's collection let's finally save
the changes let's build our solution
build succeeded there are two problems
with this delete code let's look at
those two problems first so let's flip
to fiddler at the moment we've got 7
employee records with no employees table
we want to delete this employee with ID
equals 7 so in fiddler let's change the
HTTP verb to delete we want to delete
employee with ID 7 let's execute this
request request completed now let's go
back to sequel server execute the Select
statement notice the employee with ID
equals 7 is deleted now if we look at
the response that we have got notice the
status code within the response header
to 0 for no Content that's because the
return type of our delete method is why
now when the deletion is
successful we should ideally be
returning status code 200 okay and not
to zero for no content that's our first
problem the second problem is this when
we try to delete you know this employee
again so obviously we don't have
employee with ID equals seven so when we
try to delete an employee whose ID does
not exist notice we get an exception so
if you look at the response status code
it is 500 internal server error so
basically it's saying there is an
internal server error and we are getting
this status code because of an exception
and this is the piece of code that is
throwing that exception so this lambda
right here is trying to find an employee
with ID equals 7 which obviously we
don't have so this lambda is going to
return null which is then passed to the
remove method and remove method is
throwing an exception and if you want to
know the exception that is being thrown
click on the JSON tab here notice the
exception type a system dot argument
null exception value cannot be null is
the exception message and as a result of
this exception we are getting this
status code 500 internal server error
when an item that we want to delete is
not found we should be returning status
board for 0 for not found and not 500
internal server error so let's see how
to solve these two problems let's flip
to visual studio now the first thing
that I'm going to do here is change the
return type from void to HTTP response
message and then let's take this lambda
expression right here and then use a
variable let's call this entity equals
whatever the lambda returns if entity
equals now so what does this mean this
means the employee object that we want
to delete is not found so in that case
we want to return status code for 0 4 so
return request dot create
error response
the HTTP status code is going to be not
found and let's also return a message
employee with ID equals whatever is the
ID of the employee ID dot two string and
then to that
let's append not found to delete so
that's the status code and that's the
message on the other hand if entity is
not null then we have found the employee
with a specified ID and we want to go
ahead and delete that employee so let's
move these two lines of code inside of a
else block and we want to remove this
entity that we have found so let's pass
that to the remove method Save Changes
and finally we want to return status
code okay so return Rick let's start
create response HTTP status code dot
okay let's wrap all of this code inside
a try block
you
if there is any problem executing the
code that we have got in the try
blocking exception will be raised we
want to catch the exception and then
return request dot create response
create error response HTTP status code
dot bad request and the exception itself
all right so let's build our solution
build succeeded let's flip to fiddler
and issue a delete request let's try to
delete employee with the ID equals six
we do have employee with ID equals six
let's go ahead and execute this delete
the delete request completed now let's
quickly check the dB notice employee
with ID equals six is deleted and if you
look at the response that we have caught
notice the response status code is 200
okay this is much better than response
code to zero for no content so basically
this is saying the deletion is
successful now let's see what's going to
happen if we try to delete the same
employee again we don't have this
employee with ID equals six anymore in
the database so let's see what's going
to happen when we execute this notice
now we are getting status code four zero
four not found and if you look at the
message that we are getting employee
with ID equals six not found to delete
which is more meaningful than returning
status code 500 internal server error
here is the delete method code thank you
for listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
