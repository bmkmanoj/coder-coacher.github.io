video we'll discuss what anonymous
methods are with an example so what is
an anonymous method in simple terms
anonymous method is a method without a
name they are introduced in c-sharp too
they provide us a way of creating
delegate instances without having to
write a separate method let's understand
what we mean by the statement they
provide us a way of creating delegate
instances without having to write a
separate method let's flip to visual
studio the moment I have this employee
class with two properties that is ID and
name and within the main method we are
creating a list of employees and this
list at the moment contains three
employee objects with IDs 1 0 1 1 0 2
and 1 0 3 now let's say we want to find
the employee who has got an ID of 1 0 2
within this list and in order to achieve
that we have find method and if you look
at this find method what is what is it
expecting as a parameter predicate of
employee let's right-click on this find
method and go to the definition on that
so it is expecting predicate of T so
let's see what this predicate of T is so
let's right click on that and go to the
definition on that look at that this
predicate of T is actually a delegate
and look at the signature of this
delegate it it returns boolean and
expects an object of type T as a
parameter in our case T is employee
because we are invoking the find method
on list of employees look at this the
intelligence tells us that it is
expecting a predicate of employee so we
are going to give an employee object to
the predicate and that predicate is
going to return a boolean ok so
basically this is the delegate instance
that we need to pass as an argument to
this find method now what are delegates
delegates are nothing but function
pointers meaning the pointer a function
now in order for a delegate to be able
to point a function when we create an
instance of a delegate to its
constructor we pass the name of the
function okay so first we need to create
a function that we want that
- point - okay so and the important
decision that we have to make it this
time as what should be the signature of
that method the signature of that method
should match with the signature of this
delegate okay otherwise we'll get a
compiler error that's the reason why
delegates are called as type save
function pointers
okay so delegates are type save function
pointers because the signature of the
function to which they are pointing to
should match with the signature of the
delegate okay so let's go ahead and
create a delegate which we are sorry a
function which returns a boolean and
expects an object of type employee so
let's write that method here
so public let's make it static and this
is going to return boolean and let's
call it find employee and then to this
we give an employee object let's call it
EMP okay now what logic should be have
here now our initial requirement is we
should be able to find an employee who
has got an idea of 1 0 1 or 1 0 2 within
this list okay so what we are going to
do is return mid-17th returns a boolean
and this expression if the passed in
employee objects ID matches with 1:02 it
returns true otherwise false okay now
let's go ahead and create an instance of
you know the predicate delegate so
predicate and in our case it's predicate
of employee and let's call this actually
employee predicate you can give it any
meaningful name you want now to the
constructor of the delegate what we need
to pass we need to pass the name of the
function that we want this delegate to
point to in our case the function is
find the employee look at that the
function you know that we pass returns
boolean and it expects an object of type
employee and if you look at this method
it returns boolean expects an object of
employee so let's go ahead and pass this
as an argument okay and the next step is
to actually pass this you know delegate
to this list okay now you know this list
contains employee object so I'm going to
say employee goes to now we are going to
pass each employee object to this method
so find the employee that's the method
we want to invoke and then pass the
employee object okay so basically what
are we doing here you know the first
step is we have created this function so
that's our step 1 and step 2 we created
an instance of a delegate and that
delegate is pointing to this function
and step 3 we passed the delegate
instance as a parameter to this find
method and then obviously what is this
fine method going to return it's going
to return an employee object so let's do
it in an object of type employee let's
call it employee equals that and then
let's print out the employee ID and name
just to make sure that we have got the
right employee so ID equals and name
equals okay so employee dot ID and
employee dot name all right let's go
ahead and run this and see if we get the
output that we expect look at that we
got the object that we expect so
basically you know what have you done we
have created a function and then we have
created a delegate instance this
delegate is going to point to that
function and then we have passed that
function as a parameter I mean that
delegate is a parameter to the find
function okay now let's see how we can
make use of an anonymous method here
okay
so what did we discuss what is an
anonymous method anonymous methods are
introduced in c-sharp too and they
provide us a way of creating delegate
instances without having to write a
separate method
now what did we do here we wrote a
separate method first and then we
created an instance of a delegate that
delegate is pointing to that method and
then we are passing this delegate as an
argument to this fine method instead of
having all the step one two and three we
can write this code in one line and
eliminate you know all these steps okay
so let's see how to achieve that using
an anonymous method and you have that
here look at that
you know this fine method is actually
expecting a delegate to be passed and we
do that by using a delegate keyword so
this one right here is an anonymous
function so we want to return an
employee object which has got an idea of
one zero two and look at that we are
using delegate keyword here and then we
have employee X and then we are
basically saying return X dot ID well
you know equal to10 - so this is an
anonymous method so we create anonymous
methods using delegate keyword okay and
you know let's actually look at that in
action so let's comment out this part we
don't require that anymore let's comment
out step two as well we don't have to
explicitly create an instance of a
delegate and within step three what are
we going to do we are going to make use
of the delegate keyword so delegate and
this delegate what does it expects it
expects an employee or object so we are
going to pass that and here what are we
going to do so this is like a method
body we are implementing you know the
logic here so what do we want to do we
want to return employees such that
employee ID must be equal to one zero
two and done so all that code is gone so
here this one is an anonymous function
notice that it doesn't have any name it
just has the body okay it's just like a
function so if we knock this out and
look at that this is a function
right let's go and run this and see if
we get the same output look at that the
same output okay so basically a
nonnamous letters provide us a way of
creating delegate instances without
having to write a separate method all
right they're also useful if we are
subscribing for an event handler now to
understand that I have a Windows forms
application here so I have just created
a new windows forms application I have
formed one here now let's view the code
of this form one and within form one
load even what we are going to do is
create control dynamically let's create
a button control so let's call it button
one
okay so button one equals new button and
button one dot text equals let's say the
text on my on that button we want it as
click me and when we click the button
something should happen so button one
dot click so look at this now you know
when we click the button you know there
should be an even handler so to this
click event handler when we click the
button you know this is what is the even
handler method that gets executed okay
and let's say all we want to do is
display hello within a message box so
message box dot show let's say hello you
just clicked me all right so let's go
ahead and run this and make sure it
works as expected and by the way we need
to add that button to the form controls
collection so this this refers to in
this case form one so two its controls
collection property add our button one
control so we are dynamically adding the
button one control here so let's go and
run this click the button look at that
hello you just click me now again look
at this here we are creating an instance
of a delegate and this delegate
constructor is you know taking a method
name here as a parameter so this
delegate is pointing to this one
now do we really have to do that now you
can make use of anonymous method if you
want to if if you don't plan to use this
method let's say for example anywhere
then you know you can you know create
that as an anonymous method here if you
want to okay so let's go ahead and see
how we can replace you know this with an
anonymous method so this is how if you
do it button 1 dot click again look at
that we are using the delegate keyword
and then you know obviously if you look
at this event handler delegate here if
we right click on that and go to the
signature so this even handle a delegate
is returning wired and expecting two
parameters of type object and eventargs
so what we're going to do is and we
create a delegate we specify the
parameters are going to be these two so
right here will simply say delegate and
then pass these two as the parameters
and then there they're going to have
this code
and you know we got a compilation error
here that's basically because you know
with this form load event we already
have parameters with similar names
so let's actually call this as send and
let's call this event args for example
okay so that we don't have that
compliation error all right now we can
get rid of this button one underscore
click method all together now so let's
go and run this click the button notice
that it still works the same way okay
now again here we're using anonymous
methods now look at this this delegate
now is expecting two parameters okay now
do we really have to pass these
parameters here because if you look at
the implementation we are not making use
of those parameters so it doesn't really
make sense to pass them there so what's
going to happen if I get rid of these
parameters let's run this and see if it
works look at that it still works okay
so basically the delegate parameters are
optional and that's what is described
here so with with anonymous methods
delegate parameters are optional okay
which means this code can be returned
like this that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
