this video we'll discuss the single
concurrency mode in the VFC with
examples this is continuation to part 42
so please watch but 42 before proceeding
to understand concurrency better we need
to understand instance context modes in
WCF these are discussed in parts 36 to
42 in the VFC video series
multi-threading concepts discussed in
parts 86 to 97 in c-sharp video series
in addition to these two concepts that's
also understand what we mean by this
term throughput throughput is the amount
of work done in a specified amount of
time now let's understand what we mean
by concurrency multiple threads
executing the application code
simultaneously is called as concurrency
in general with concurrency we get
better throughput that's basically
because we have multiple threads
executing the application code
simultaneously meaning we are
accomplishing tasks parallel e so
obviously with concurrency we get better
throughput however concurrency issues
can occur when multiple threads access
the same resource at the same time in
the VFC service instances a shared
resource
the default concurrency mode in WCF is
single this means only a single thread
can access the service instance at any
given point in time while a request is
being processed by the service instance
an exclusive lock is acquired and all
the other threads will have to wait
until the current request completes and
the lock is released upon releasing the
lock next thread in the queue can access
the service instance concurrency mode
parameter of the service behavior
attribute is what controls the
concurrency setting concurrency mode can
be either single reentrant or multiple
in this video we'll discuss the single
concurrency mode now whether it WCF
service instance in our can handle
client requests concurrently or not
depends on three things as you can see
here service instance context mode
service concurrency mode
and whether if the underlying bindings
supports session or not these three
things determine whether the client
request can be processed by the service
instance concurrently or not let's
understand that with an example let's
flip to visual studio so first let's
create a new WCF service and for that
let's create a class library project
let's call this simple service and let's
get rid of this class 1 dot CS that's
auto-generated let's add a WCF service
to this project and let's name it simple
service now within the service contract
we want to have two operation contracts
the first operation contract is going to
return a list of integers and what this
operation contract going to do it's
going to return even numbers probably
the even numbers between 0 and 10 ok and
let's have another operation contract
and so operation contract is also going
to return list of integers but this one
is going to return the list of odd
numbers between 0 and 10 now let's flip
to the service implementation file and
click on the service contract and then
once we press control dot we get an
option to implement the interface I
simple service so let's get rid of this
to work operation so we need to now
implement this get even numbers
operation so first of all let's create a
variable of type list of integer let's
call this list even numbers equals new
list of integer
and let's use a for loop for into AI is
equal to zero I less than or equal to
ten I plus plus so if I is divisible by
two that is if the reminder is zero then
we know that it is an even number
in which case to this list we are going
to add the value of I okay so once we
are done looping through you know from
zero to ten you know we have all the
even numbers that we need and we are
simply going to return that list back to
whoever is going to call this now let's
make a simple change here whenever a
request comes you know to execute this
method we want to find out what is the
thread that's executing this piece of
code so basically we will say thread
whatever is the thread ID in a bit we'll
see how to retrieve thread ID so thread
started processing what is the name of
the function get even numbers at
whatever is the date and time and let's
put another placeholder here so how do
we get the thread ID you know we can use
the thread class for that to use the
thread class we need to bring in system
dot threading namespace so let's go and
do that thread dot current thread dot
managed thread ID so that's going to
give us the thread ID that you know
that's executing this piece of code and
we also want to spit out the date and
time right here and to do that we can
use date/time dot now not to string all
right so let's copy this one and just
before we return the list of even
numbers we will say okay thread whatever
thread completed processing get even
numbers at whatever date and time
now one more thing that we are going to
do is just to introduce some artificial
processing time we'll make this thread
sleep for 200 milliseconds so that you
know when we execute this method we get
some processing latency all right now we
also want to implement get odd numbers
method so let's copy this code paste it
right here and change it accordingly
first of all in a again we are going to
print the thread that is going to start
executing this piece of code so thread
started processing get odd numbers at
whatever date and time and similarly
thread completed processing get odd
numbers at whatever date and time and
then let's change the variable name here
to list odd numbers so that it's
meaningful now plus control dot and
we'll get an option to change that all
the references of that variable okay and
if I'm or do not equal to zero that
means it is an odd number in which case
we will add the value of I to that list
and then finally we'll return that list
okay so pretty simple methods here
within our service contract
now let's host this WCF service and to
do that we are going to make use of the
console application so the solution
let's add a new project and we want to
add a console application let's call
this host the first thing that we need
to do is to add a reference to this
simple service project itself so let's
add a reference navigate to the projects
tab select simple service click OK and
then we also need to add a reference to
system dot service model assembly so
let's navigate to system dot service
model add a reference to that and now we
need to add an application configuration
file so let's add a new item select
application configuration file and
within this app config file we need to
specify the configuration to host our
WCF service I have typed this
configuration
so let's go then paste it right here we
discuss this configuration several times
in the previous sessions of this video
series so I'm not going to go into the
details of that so basically we are
hosting this simple service that is the
address that's the binding and that's
the contract notice that we are using
basic HTTP binding and keep in mind
basic HTTP binding does not support
sessions and this is the base address
all right and within program dot CS file
we need to write code to host the
service so let's bring in system dot
service model namespace and again to
speed things up I have already typed the
code that is required so let's copy that
and paste it right there now if you need
this configuration and code I will have
it available on my blog so you can copy
and paste it from there all right now
let's go ahead and set our host project
as they start a project and then + ctrl
f5 so this should host our service so
our service is up and running now let's
create a client for this WCF service so
here I have already created a new
windows forms application and so far
what I have done is designed the form
with three button controls as you can
see and two listbox controls basically
so far I have changed the name of the
button control the first button control
- BTN even numbers and in bTW and get
even numbers and the text on that to get
even numbers and similarly for the
second button I have changed the name to
BTN get odd numbers and finally for this
button - BTN clear results and the text
- what you see on the buttons and the
IDs of these two text boxes are also
changed - list works even numbers and
list box odd numbers okay now one more
thing that I'm going to do here is drag
and drop two instances of background
worker so why do we need these
background workers because these are
what are going to call
you know the functions behind this tree
behind the scenes using you know
multiple threads basically so that the
UI thread is free you know to update the
UI okay so now let's go and generate the
event handlers for the button controls
so that is button even numbers button
odd numbers clear results and this
background worker we discussed in detail
about background worker you know in a
video I'll have that link available for
that video in my blog in case you need
it
so that you know if you're new to
background worker please watch that
video first
now this background worker control has
got you know three events in this video
will see will actually implement do work
and run work completed events so let's
go and generate the respective event
handlers we need to do that for
background worker 2 as well so do work
and run work a complete it alright so we
have all the required event handlers now
we need to add a service reference so
right click on the references folder add
service reference and our who our
services host today you know that's the
base address click oh that should
discover a simple service so let's
change the namespace to simple service
click OK alright so at the Forum level
let's create a variable of type simple
service client and within the form
constructor we are going to create a new
instance of our simple service client
all right now we are going to make use
of this background work of one to call
get even numbers function okay so client
dot get even numbers
and what is this function going to
return it's going to return an integer
array that is the list of even numbers
now we are going to store that result
within the result property of this II
object and what is this object nothing
but do work eventargs so you know in the
result property of this object we are
going to store the results meaning what
happens behind the scenes when you know
the background worker completes you know
this even handler fires and at that
point the result will be stored in run
worker completed even two arguments
object so this object has caught result
property and so e dot result and we know
that result is of type integer if you
look actually the return type of result
it is returning you know if you look at
the return type its returning an object
but we know that we are expecting an
integer array so let's typecast that to
integer array and what we want to
basically do is we have list even
numbers list box so we want to set the
data source of that list box in our with
the result that we get back all right
and we are going to do the similar thing
with background worker to background
worker to is going to call get odd
numbers function okay again this is
going to return an array of integers
which we are storing in the result
property of doing omit arguments object
and then we are going to take the
results out typecast that to be of type
integer array and we are going to store
that in list box odd numbers you know we
are basically going to set the data
source okay and what are we going to do
within the button click event so here we
have get even numbers so when we click
that we want to make the background
worker you know invoke the service
method and the way we do that is by
simply saying
background worker 1 dot run worker
asynchronously and similarly when we
click the get odd numbers button we want
to run the background worker 2
okay and then when we click this button
clear results what we want to do we want
to clear the results from the list box
and to do that all we need to do is set
the datasource to none
similarly for list box odd numbers
that's that data source to know ok so at
this point if you look at our WCF
service so we have the service instance
already running let's actually stop the
service now if you look at this table
right here now if the instance context
mode is set to pair call and if the
concurrency mode is set to single and if
the binding does not support session if
you recollect the binding that we are at
the moment using its basic HTTP binding
which does not support sessions now
let's go ahead and specify instance
context mode and concurrency mode
explicitly so that we know what values
we have and we will check if concurrent
calls a process and the impact on the
throughput so let's get to the WCF
service here is our WCF service now to
specify the service instance context
mode we use service behavior attribute
and the service behavior attribute has
got service actually first specify let's
specify concurrency mode it doesn't
matter in which order you specify them
concurrency mode dot look at that there
are three values that you can specify in
this video we'll discuss single so
concurrency mode single and let's
specify instance context mode so let's
set instance context mode to per call
okay so this is what is the situation at
the moment instance context mode set to
pair call concurrency mode a single
binding support session now now with
pair call instance context mode what do
you think is going to happen every
client requests whether that client
request comes from the same client or
from a different line you know we're
going to get a new service instance so
we will typically have only one service
instance you know on the WCF service
server side which is handling the client
request okay so every request results in
a new service instance now let's go
ahead and run our WCF service so the
service is running now let's run the
client okay so the host is running here
is the client click get even numbers so
we should get a message they're saying
you know thread four look at that it
give us the thread four started
processing at that time and it completed
exactly after two seconds because if you
recollect we're making the thread asleep
for 200 milliseconds and we have got ten
numbers to loop through so approximately
around two minutes sorry two seconds now
let's actually click get even numbers
once again and immediately click get odd
numbers look at that the calls are being
processed concurrently it's not waiting
for you know the first request to
complete look at this I click this
button and immediately I click this
thread five started thread four started
at 45 and 46 thread five finished at 47
and thread for finished at 48 okay so
basically right here you know our
concurrent calls processed yes what is
the impact on the throughput since the
calls are being processed concurrently
you know there is a positive impact on
the through port okay so which means we
get better throughput now with the same
situation per call and
remoras lingo and if the binding
supports sessions okay now will the
calls be processed concurrently no one
request will be processed at a time now
while a thread is accessing a service
instance all the other threads will
basically be queued until you know that
request is completed and then it will
allow the other thread to get in so
obviously as calls are not processed
concurrently there is going to be a
negative impact so let's quickly close
the WCF service and the client and let's
flip to our simple service and then if
we go to the app that config file here
at the moment we are using basic HTTP
binding but let's change this to net TCP
binding let's run the WCF service oh the
reason why we get that exception is
basically because they specify net DCP
binding but we don't have a base address
so let's specify the base address here
net dot TCP : localhost let's use a
different port number port 80 90 let's
go ahead and run this now service host
started now let's flip to our Windows
client so here we have the service
reference let's actually delete that and
add the service reference once again
click go that should discover our WCF
service let's change the namespace click
ok and let's go to and run the client
let's bring in our service host instance
window now let's click get even numbers
so there should be a request coming up
now the first request is usually slow ok
thread for started processing let let
let that complete complete it
ok now let's clear the results let's
click that and let's click that look at
that
you know until thread 4 has completed
you know it didn't start processing get
odd numbers let's clear the results
let's you know try it once more look at
this as soon as I click the button and
then I click this button look at that
thread for started completed and then
after that again you know it started
processing get odd numbers so you know
let's clear that lets click get odd
numbers get even numbers look at that
until it completes processing get odd
numbers it's not going to start get even
numbers so only one thread is allowed at
a time ok so if the binding support
session if the concurrency mode is
single and if the instance context mode
is pair called concurrent calls are not
processed meaning you know only one
request is handled at a time so that's
going to have a negative impact on the
throughput ok now per session so let's
change the instance context mode to pair
session in the concurrency mode is going
to remain single we are only going to
change the instance context mode now and
we are going to change the binding let's
actually change the binding to you know
that support sessions ok because at the
moment we already have TCP binding which
support sessions so let's leave it there
and then specify instance context mode s
pair session and see what the behavior
so let's close the
service host and the client and let's
change the instance context mode to pair
session let's go ahead and run the WCF
service and let's run the client now
actually let's close the client let's go
to the client project and let's open the
folder in Windows Explorer
let's open two instances of the client
ok so here we got two instances let's
put the host windows you know next to
them now look at that this is a
situation we are in at the moment the
service instance context mode is
possession
concurrency mode is single that the
binding support sessions yes okay so if
the binding support sessions you know
are concurrent calls process yes between
different client requests so at the
moment we have got two clients ok so
when I click this button and then this
button you know look at that
they started simultaneously ok but then
let's clear the results so between
clients between different clients you
know the calls are processed
concurrently but for the same client
because that I click get even numbers
get odd numbers look at that it doesn't
start until it completes processing even
numbers let's try it once more
so get even numbers get odd numbers look
at that until it completes processing
get even numbers it's not going to start
processing get odd numbers ok so if the
instance context mode is per session
concurrency mode is single and the
binding support session are the
concurrent calls or calls processed
concurrently the answer to that question
is you know yes and now yes between
and client requests no further requests
from the same client and positive impact
you know there will be a positive impact
on the throughput between clients but a
negative impact for the requests from
the same client because requests from
the same client are not processed
concurrently whereas when we set per
session instance context mode single is
the concurrency mode if the binding does
not support sessions then concurrent
calls are processed
between different clients as well as
from the same client okay and we are
going to have positive impact on the
throughput okay you can test that
yourself and the same is the case with
single so when we set the instance
context mode to single you know and if
the concurrency mode is single and if
the binding does not support sessions no
concurrent calls are processed okay
whether the request is from the same
client or from different clients because
in a singleton service we have a single
service instance you know handling all
the requests okay so obviously whether
the request is coming from the same
client or from a different client it's
the same service instance so obviously
it's not going to process the calls
concurrently because the concurrency
mode is single which means they'll have
a negative impact on the throughput but
the requests are from the same client
are from different client okay
and the same is the case even in the
binding support sessions alright that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
