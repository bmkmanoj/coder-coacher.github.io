this video we'll discuss the bootstrap
jumbotron component this component is
used to showcase the key content on your
website creating jumbotron is fairly
straightforward all we need to do is
create a development with class
jumbotron we can then place any valid
HTML within the jumbotron a Jumbotron is
displayed as a gray box with rounded
corners let's see how to create a
Jumbotron that looks like this let's
flip to visual studio so within this
container we are going to create a
development with class Jumbotron let's
save our changes and when we reload this
page notice we get a gray box with
rounded corners within this Jumbotron we
can place any valid HTML that we want
now within our Jumbotron we want a
heading which says bootstrap tutorial so
inside this development with this class
Jumbotron let's include an h1 element
and the heading is going to be bootstrap
tutorial and then we want a paragraph
about bootstrap so let's include a
paragraph element and then finally we
want a button I'm going to place this
button in another paragraph element so
first let's include a paragraph element
and then to create the button I'm going
to use the anchor element and set its
class to BTN we want a large button so
I'm also going to use BTN large class
and let's also use BTN primary
contextual state class and I'm going to
point the href attribute of this button
for YouTube channel which is HTTP colon
four slash four slash youtube.com four
slash good vented and the text on the
button is going to say get started let's
save our changes
and FN very little page notice we get
the jumbotron that we have seen on the
slide at the moment this Jumbotron is
present inside a container and that's
the reason why it does not span across
the entire width of the page if you want
this Jumbotron to span across the entire
width of the page then place this
bouton outside the container let's do
that so I'm going to cut this
development that has this class
jumbotron and place it outside the
container let's save our changes and
when the real raw page notice the
jumbotron spans across the entire width
of the page
finally let's see how to change the
default background color of the
Jumbotron I'm going to right click on
the jumbotron and select inspect from
the context menu notice the CSS class
that is applied is Chimbote Rahn and the
default background color is this first
let's find this Jumbotron class within
our bootstrap dot CSS let's make a copy
of this class within our custom style
sheet we only want to change the
background color style so let's delete
the rest of the styles and let's change
this background color to ìiî ìiî
3d let's save our changes and when we
reload our page notice the background
color changes thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
