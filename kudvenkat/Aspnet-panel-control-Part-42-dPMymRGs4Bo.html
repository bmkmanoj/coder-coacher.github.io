am venket this is part 42 of asp.net
video series in this session we'll
discuss about the panel control in
asp.net the panel control is used as a
container for other controls a panel
control is very handy when we want to
group controls and ensure or hide all
the controls in that group as one unit
panel control is also very useful when
adding controls to the webform
dynamically we will discuss about adding
controls dynamically using panel control
in the next video session in this video
we will discuss about using the panel
control to group controls and then
toggle their visibility using the panel
controls visible property let's flip to
visual studio let's assume that we have
an asp.net web application that is
shared by you know admin users and non
admin users now let's say within that
web application we have a web form where
we have controls for admin users and non
admin users
now when the admin locks into the
application on to that web form then we
want to show only the controls that are
specific to that admin user whereas when
the add non admin user logs and the
control specific to non admin user
should be shown so let's drag and drop a
drop-down list control here and then
this drop down list is going to show
admin user and non admin user options
when we select admin user option show
the controls that are specific to admin
user otherwise show the controls of the
non admin user so let's drag and drop
the drop down list control onto the web
form so we know that a drop down list is
a collection of list item objects so
let's go ahead and add list items so the
text is going to be select user and the
value of this one is going to be minus
one
let's add two more list items one for
admin user and the other one for non
admin user so I'm going to call admin
user is the text and let's say the value
is admin and this one is going to be non
admin user and the value is going to be
non admin okay all right so now if we
flip to the design mode obviously we see
the drop down list with those two
options okay now just to speed things up
I have the HTML already typed here you
know all the controls that are specific
to the admin user are present in this
HTML so let's copy and paste this on the
web form okay so if you look at the HTML
that we have it's pretty simple we have
one two three four label controls and
three text boxes that are specific to
admin user you know the first label
shows this message you are logged in as
an administrator and if you look at that
it's pretty simple we have an HTML table
here and within the table we have a
table draw and within the table draw we
have at TD and the call span attribute
is set to two because every other row
has got two TDs and since this is a
heading and we want that to span across
two tees that's why we have set the call
span to true too and then we have a
label control showing that message you
are logged in as an administrator so
that's the first row and in the second
row we have a label which displays admin
name as the text and then the textbox
which displays Tom as the name of the
user currently this hard-coded button in
real-time applications we will load that
data maybe from a database or an XML
file depending on how you actually store
data for your application
so that's the second TR and then in the
third year we have admin region again a
label for that and a textbox and in the
final tier actions a label for that and
a text box whose text mode is set to
multi-line and all these controls are
present in this HTML
table okay now the next table that we
are going to have is for the non admin
user so the controls specific to non
admin user are present in this table so
let's copy and paste this HTML as well
okay now again if you look at the non
admin user it just says okay welcome it
should actually be welcome Mike because
Mike is the non admin user
so let's correct that so welcome Mike
and it shows the name of the user who is
logged in his region and the city to
which he belongs okay
now what should happen is let's go ahead
and run this as it stands now when the
application renders this waveform it
shows both the admin and non admin user
content but then if I select admin user
here I should only see these things you
know the controls that are specific to
admin user whereas if I select non admin
user then it should show me only these
controls okay now if you remember at the
moment we are not using a panel control
at all all we have is two HTML tables
containing admin and non admin specific
controls okay so what we have to do now
is okay first of all this is the
drop-down list whenever the selection
changes we should automatically post
back to the server so that we can hide
and display the controls that are
specific to the logged in user so double
click that we have the even handler
generated but then we have to set the
auto post back property of the drop-down
list control to true so auto post back
is equal to true and whenever the
selection in the drop-down list changes
if drop-down list 1 dot selected value
okay if the selected value is equal to
minus 1 so when they user first log that
you know loads this waveform you know
obviously the drop-down list selection
will be empty and we don't want to show
any control whatsoever so obviously we
should hide all the controls on that
webform
and just to again speed things up I have
typed this HTML here so I want to hide
the admin labels and text boxes on the
webform so if you look at this code it's
pretty simple and straightforward these
are all the labels and text box controls
I am setting the visibility of all these
controls to phones and similarly we have
non admin controls as well which we have
to hide so let's copy and paste that
code there just look at the amount of
code that we have you know as we have to
hide each and every admin and non admin
user specific control you know there's a
lot of code and since these are not
present in any kind of a container
control we have to do that on a pair of
controlled basis okay this is tedious
number one and also error-prone okay we
have an issue here non admin region
label let's say what's the HTML that's
there for non admin region label non
admin region is this one user region
let's see what's that okay let's correct
that it's going to be non admin region
label okay so now as you might expect
when we run the application when the
page loads
nothing will be shown both of the admin
and non admin users okay actually we
should be doing that in the page load if
it's not a postback as soon as the page
loads we don't want anything to be shown
so if not is postback we want to hide
all the controls and similarly when the
drop-down list selection is -1 which
means the user has not selected a user
in the drop-down list then we want to
hide them ok so on the other hand if the
drop-down list selected value is admin
user then let's say this is unsafe
okay answer if you look at this for the
admin user the selected the value of the
drop-down list is admin so if it is
going to be admin user then you know
what to do you have to hide all non
admin user controls look at the amount
of code it's just growing and growing
and we want to show all admin controls
so just to speed things up I have this
admin controls okay
and on the other hand if the selection
is non admin then what we want to do we
want to show non admin user controls so
that is that non admin user controls we
have to turn the visibility on and then
hide the admin controls and we already
have code for that
so here the admin controls copy and
paste them here okay so as you might
expect now when we run and when the web
form loads none of the controls will be
shown and when we select admin user look
at that when the wave form loads no
controls shown when I select admin user
controls that are specific to
administrator and shown similarly when I
select non admin user controls that are
specific to non admin if I flip to
select user nothing will be shown but
then you know the application is working
as expected but if you look at the
amount of code it's growing
this is unmaintainable especially
tomorrow if you have to add a control to
admin or non admin section then probably
you'll have to change it at so many
places and look at the amount of code
just to hide and display some of the
controls here don't you think it makes
more sense to group them using the panel
control and then control the visibility
of the panel control as one unit so you
will have a lot you know amount of code
that is reduced okay now to
actually make this code a little better
what you can do is you can actually have
different methods here you know
something like maybe private methods but
then this will still be inefficient code
so let's say private void show admin
controls you know that's one method I'm
gonna have along the same lines I'm
going to have you know formal methods
show admin controls hide admin controls
show non admin controls and let's say
hide non admin controls okay so if we
want to show admin controls this is the
code that shows admin controls you know
basically what we are doing is just to
reduce the amount of code we're using
these functions but still this is
inefficient and similarly if I want to
show non admin controls I have this code
which we will copy and paste in this
method and then we have this is hiding
admin control so copy that and paste
that in hide admin controls method and
then finally we have to hide non admin
controls so copy that we have already
hidden shown on HIGH shown on admin
controls hide non admin controls okay
so what we can do now is actually
replace these code blocks with those
method names but still we are
controlling the visibility on a per
control basis so when the webform first
I mean when the selection is minus one
we want to hide both admin and non admin
controls so hide admin controls and hide
non admin controls
but whereas if I select admin user then
we want to show admin controls and hide
non admin controls and we can get rid of
this here and similarly here we can hide
I mean if it's a non admin user we want
to hide admin controls so hide nor admin
controls and show non admin controls and
then we can get rid of these labels here
but however we still have these methods
which are controlling the visibility on
a per control basis so obviously now if
I go ahead and run this as you might
expect the application works in the same
way except that we have used some
private methods so if I say admin user
non admin user and select user ok the
application is working as expected
okay now let us see how to use panel
controls and control the visibility of
the controls as one unit okay so all we
are going to do is you know we have this
table this entire table that's the admin
table so what I'm going to do I'm going
to put that table inside a panel control
so let's drag and drop the panel control
on to the webform just like any other
asp.net server control the panel control
has an ID and then it is equal to server
attribute so I'm going to wrap this
table inside that panel control
similarly I'm going to have another
panel control okay let's give this panel
a meaningful name since the first panel
is the admin panel I'm going to call it
admin panel and since the second panel
is the non admin panel I'm going to call
it non admin panel and then take that
closing tag of the panel of the panel
control and then put then put that after
the table
okay so we're using panel controls now
so since we are using panel controls now
all you need to do is basically we don't
need all these methods so we can get rid
of these methods all too
so a lot of code is gone and then on the
page load event we can even get rid of
this one we should have used methods
there as well so that's gone there so
when the when the page first loads what
we need to do we need to hide the
controls within the admin panel and non
admin panel so admin panel dot visible
is equal to false and similarly we want
to hide non admin panel as well okay and
the same is the case if the user has not
selected anything within the drop-down
list so we are going to hide the
controls there as well but then if the
selection is admin user then we know
that we want to show admin panel but
keep non admin panel invisible whereas
if it if the selection is non admin then
we want to show the non admin panel
that's all just look at the amount of
code it's it's reduced drastically and
it's more maintainable as well so now if
I go ahead and run this the behavior
will exactly be the same except that we
are using panel controls now so when the
page first loads nothing is shown select
admin user content specific to admin
user is shown I select non admin user
and the content specific to non admin
user is shown in the next video session
we will learn how to you know add
controls dynamically using panel control

asp.net c-sharp and sequel server
