venket this is part 9 of a do dotnet
video series in this session we'll learn
about retrieving two or more result sets
using the sequel data reader objects
next result method before continuing
with the session I strongly recommend to
watch part seven and wait of this video
series there are no more slides in this
video session it's going to be
completely demo driven so let's flip to
visual studio so what we basically want
to do is I have two tables here within
sequel server so TBL product inventory
and TBL product categories now what I
basically want to do is I want to
combine these two queries into one
command so if I separate them using
semicolon and then execute both of them
together I get two result sets so this
entire thing now I want to treat as one
command with an ad or dotnet okay so
obviously when we execute this command
we get two result sets and I want to
display these two result sets in a
separate grid view control within an
asp.net web application project so let's
see how to do that so obviously to
connect to this database we need the
connection string so within web config
file I have the connection string the
name of the connection string is DB CS
and obviously it's pointing to the local
server and the database name is sample
where I'm using integrated security
meaning windows authentication so
obviously I need to read this connection
string within my web config file so to
do that we need to use the configuration
manager class and the configuration
manager class is present in system dot
configuration namespace so let's import
that system dot configuration so let's
create a variable to hold the connection
string so string CS is equal to
configuration manager dot connection
strings property and to this connection
strings property you can either read the
connection string using the integral
index ax or this the connection string
name okay
now using connection string names is
much better than you using integral
indexes because it's more readable so
the name of what can I
chin string here is DBC s let's copy
that go back to code behind file copy
the connection string there and use the
connection string property and if you
look at the return type it's going to
return a string which is nothing but
this connection string okay so now we
need to create a sequel connection
object so sequel connection and sequel
connection object is present in system
dot data dot sequel client namespace
okay
so let's create the sequel connection
object sequel connection con is equal to
new sequel connection and the
constructor of the sequel connection
class takes in a connection string as
the parameter so let's pass that okay
now if we want this connection object to
be closed in a timely fashion
either you stripe I mean the finally
block or use the using statement using
statement ensures that the connection
object is automatically closed when the
scope of that object is lost we don't
have to explicitly call the close method
on the connection object so if you want
your application to be scalable and more
more efficient than always close your
connections and the reader objects in a
timely fashion because these connection
objects are actually very valuable and
there are only a limited of them and we
need to ensure they are properly closed
and that too in a timely fashion
alright so we have the sequel connection
object now we need to prepare the sequel
command so sequel command CMD is equal
to new sequel command now look at this
usually we only pass in one query but
what I'm going to do now we are going to
pass both of these two queries that are
separated by semicolon so copy them and
then I'm going to pass that's my command
text and the next parameter that I want
to pass obviously is the connection
object which we have already created
past then so we have the command object
ready now so now let's create the sequel
data reader from the previous session
knew that you cannot create an instance
of a sequel data reader using the new
operator so obviously if you want to
create the reader object you use the
command objects execute reader method
and if you look at that the return type
of execute reader is equal data reader
so we have the sequel data reader object
and if you want that to be closed in a
timely fashion
use the using block or you can also use
try and finally block okay so we have
the reader object now now let's drag and
drop to grid view controls on to this
webform let's flip to the design view so
let's get the grid view control which
should be on the data tab so grid view
and auto format that to look a little
nice so that's one grid view control and
let's put another grid view control okay
let's sort of format that maybe to
something simple okay now let's give
this grid view control some meaningful
name so that we can identify rather than
calling as grid view one and grid view -
let's call this what do we have we have
products and categories so let's call
this products grid view I'm going to
call this category screen view okay so
let's flip to the code behind page now
usually if it is just one result set
that we get back then we say products
grid view dot data source is equal to
Aria okay now we know that when we
execute this query we get two result
sets back and both of the result sets
will be returned back to the sequel data
reader object okay so I'm setting the
trigger object as the data source for
one grid view control and I'm doing that
the same thing for categories grid view
control as well data source is equal to
Rd R and let's call the data bind method
and product
grid-view and do the same thing for
categories grid-view
okay so now let's run this application
and go and and see what's going to
happen so obviously when this command
gets executed we we get two results sets
loaded into so obviously we got an error
because this execute reader connection
requires an open and available
connection the connections current
status is closed so the reason why we
get that is because we haven't opened
the connection so before we execute the
command we need to open the connection
so let's call that okay so now let's run
that once again so obviously when this
command that we have gets executed we
get two result sets back and look at
this I only get the products and why is
that because if you look at that the
first query is TBL product inventory
okay let's do it the other way around
let's put the product categories here
and then product inventory as the second
query okay let's put that within our
application see first time you know we
got only the products now what I'm going
to do I'm going to change the query
order in the sense I'm going to say
first select star from TBL product
categories and then select star from TBL
product inventory so does that show now
only the product categories and not the
inventory absolutely so it's only
showing categories now it's not showing
products so now we know that when this
query gets executed okay we know two
result sets come but then if you look at
the output I have only one shown in the
grid view control okay that's because
you have to tell you know by default
when the result sets are loaded into the
data reader object you know the reader
will have the first result set you know
ready and the cursor will be at that
result set now if you want that cursor
to move to the next result set and you
want to use that next result set as the
data source for your
other grid-view control then you'll have
to tell the reader object to move to the
next result set and how do we do that
using the reader objects next result
method in the previous session we have
actually seen how to loop through
records within a data read object we
have used the sequel data readers read
method okay but then if you want to loop
through the result sets within the data
reader then you use the next
result method so these two are very
important methods within the sequel data
reader object read method loops through
the rules within you know a result set
whereas if you want to loop through
between result sets themselves then you
use the next
result method and just like read method
this next result method is also going to
return a true or false so next result
and if you look at the signature it's
going to return a true or a false
because the return type is boolean so
while while RDR dot next result what I
want to do bind the reader to the
categories grid view so you can loop
through as many result sets as you want
as long as there are more result sets
within that you know it keeps on moving
this method will return true the moment
it reaches the last result set it
returns false and you know that's it so
let's run this now and see if it
correctly binds you know both the result
sets to both the grid view controls that
we have and now we should actually see
that look at that we have the products
and we have the categories as expected
so to loop through records within this
result set use read method to loop
through between the result set
themselves then use next results next
result method on the slide you can find
resources for asp.net c-sharp and sequel
server interview questions that's it for
today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
