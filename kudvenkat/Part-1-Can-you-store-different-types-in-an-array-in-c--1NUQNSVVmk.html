questions video series in this video
will answer this interview question can
use two different types in an array in C
sharp if you're wondering why this video
series we will discuss all the possible
C sharp interview questions in this
series many users have posted several
interview questions on my youtube
channel that they have faced in an
interview so if you have an interview
question that needs to be answered
please feel free to post it either on my
youtube channel or on my blog and I
shall record a video response for you as
soon as I can so let's answer this
interview question can you store
different types in an array in C sharp
and the answer is yes if you create an
object array let's understand this with
an example here I have a console
application let's create an integer
array now let's initialize this array
maybe to two now look at this I can
store an integer within this area
because that is an integer array now if
I try to store a string look at what's
going to happen we will get a
compilation error right way look at that
we have an error cannot implicitly
convert a type string to end so you know
arrays are strongly typed you know so
here this integer array is strongly
typed in the sense that you can only
store integer type within this array but
then if you want to store different data
types within an array create an array of
type object so if I convert this to type
object then look at this I am able to
store an integer I am able to store a
string because object type is the base
type for all types in dotnet so every
types within dotnet directly or
indirectly in help inherit from object
type so we can add any type of object to
this array as an inherited type
including complex styles for example if
I have a class let's say
tomorrow and let's include two
properties so public and ID and let's
include another property of type string
and let's call it maybe name let's
actually bump up the size of the array
to three now let's create an instance of
this customer class
so seedot ID let's say ID is 99c dot
name equals plus G and look at this I
can even store a complex type in this
array so I can assign it see look at
that
now in this array we are storing
different types and we can very easily
retrieve them as well using a for each
loop okay so let's use a for each loop
let's call it for each object obj in our
array and let's use console dot readline
and print the value of the items that we
have within the array okay so what
values do we have we have number one
which is an integer as string and then
we have a customer object so if I run
this look at this I get number one
string and then you know for the
customer object it just prints out the
name of the type that is the name of the
class the name of the class is customer
and since that class is present in
interview questions namespace you know
the complete name of the class including
the namespace is printed you know this
doesn't you know make sense to the
end-user so if you want the output to be
meaningful then we have to override to
string method of the customer class so
let's quickly overwrite that so
overwrite to string method and let's say
you know when to string method of this
customer classes in work we want to
print their name you know the customer
name so in that case we are going to
simply return the name of the customer
okay so let's run this now and look at
that we get the name of the customer
okay
so the straight answer to this question
is yes if you create an object array
then you can store different types in an
array in C sharp and that's because
since all the types in dotnet inherit
from object type so you know we can add
the other types
as an inherited type to that object
array including complex types like
customer employee etc and we may need to
override the tostring method if we want
a meaningful output when the to string
method is invoked on that complex type
and we have just seen an example of
overriding the to string method you know
for this customer class okay
another alternate you basically instead
of using an object array you can also
use a class that is present in that
system lured collections names place so
within systems or collections namespace
we have an ArrayList class you can use
this class as well to store different
types because this ArrayList class
operates on object type so instead of
using an object array let's go to an
import system dot collections namespace
now I can use an ArrayList so ArrayList
let's create an ArrayList and now when
you are using an array list you can use
add method so I can simply say array dot
add and then you can add look at that
when we use that add method you can see
that you can add a value of type object
since array let's operate on object type
you can add any data type to an
ArrayList collection okay so basically I
can add one we can add maybe a string
and similarly we can also add a customer
object
and when we use a for each loop we get
the same output there you go alright
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
