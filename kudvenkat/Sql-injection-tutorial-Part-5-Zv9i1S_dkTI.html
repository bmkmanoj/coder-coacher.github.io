am Venkat this is part 5 of a do dotnet
video series in this video we'll learn
about sequel injection attack and what
can cause it to happen before continuing
with the session I strongly recommend to
watch parts 1 2 &amp;amp; 4 of this video series
so what signal injection attack let's
start with an example
now here you look at the form which is
very simple it has got a text box in
button and a gridview control now we
want to develop an application such a
way that I type in you know the name of
a product you know the name that it
starts with for example iPhone and iPads
start with IP so if I type in the first
two characters or the first character
and then when I say get products we want
to list all the products which start
with that name and display them in the
grid view control okay so obviously when
we want to do that we we have to use the
sequel connection and sequel command
objects and we are spoken about using
sequel connection and sequel command
objects in the previous sessions of this
video series so let's go ahead and
develop you know a web form that is
capable of doing this and then later we
will see how to inject sequel and cause
this application to break and in a later
video session we'll see how to actually
you know solve a sequel injection
problem okay
so I have this table called TBL product
inventory which we'll be using through
our demo which has got some sample data
within that so obviously we want to
retrieve this data from this table which
is present in the sample database so
let's flip to visual studio so obviously
we require a text box control so let's
drag and drop the text box control so I
need a text box text box control and
then a button control so that the user
can click that to trade trip the
products and a grid view control
and autoformat this okay so let's give a
meaningful name to the button control
let's call the scat products
all right so let's double-click that we
get the event handler generated and now
if you look at the web config file I
have the connection string already so
all we have to do is read that read from
that connection string so let's create a
variable string connection string is
equal to and to read from web config
file we use the configuration manager
class so configuration manager dot
connection strings off is we need to
specify the name of the connection
string which is DBC s so let's copy that
dot connection string so once we have
the connection string we need to create
the connection object
so using sequel connection class con is
equal to new sequel connection and
obviously we need to pass in the
connection string to the constructor ok
so now we need to prepare the command
objects and this is what is tricky now
what's our requirement if you look at
our requirement
you know we type in the first one or two
or three letters of a product and I want
all the products that start with that
letter and if you look at sequel to do
that it's pretty simple you know if you
say select star from TBL product
inventory we get every one of them but
whereas I can use where clause and then
filter them you know using the like
operator where product name like you
know let's say if I want all the
products that start with letters IP I
can type IP and use a wild-card
percentage so if we execute this query
we get that so somehow we want to build
this kind of a query and then this part
is going to come from the end user ok so
how is it going to come from the end
user he's going to type that in the text
box so whatever the user types into the
text box we will have to take that and
then build a command object ok so let's
say string CMD let's call it command is
equal to okay so what's the query select
star from TBL product name TBL product
inventory where product name like so we
want all that so let's copy that and
then to that you know we don't want to
hard-code this we want that to be coming
from the user ok so let's take them from
the text box control so text box one dot
text and then what we do we want to put
this percentage symbol and the single
quote we want to append that to that
text so percentage single quote and
that's it
so that's our command that we want to
execute now this is very dangerous we
shouldn't be doing this
okay in a bit we'll understand this
particular piece you know where you're
building the query dynamically using the
strings that user type into the user
interface elements in this case text box
whatever the user types into the text
box we are taking that and appending
that to the command that we are forming
here so we are dynamically building
these queries using the strings that
user has typed into the user interface
elements and this opens the doors to
sequel injection attack we'll see that
in a bit
ok so let's create the sequel command so
sequel command CMD is equal to new
sequel command and this class I mean the
constructor of this class is going to
take two parameters the command itself
and the connection object so let's pass
both of them and then we need to execute
the commands so CMD dot execute reader
it's going to return every sequel data
reader and we are going to set that as
the data source for our grid view one
control so grid v1 dot data source is
equal to whatever the method returns and
then call the data bind method
so very simple example you know whatever
we want we achieved that so let's run
this and see if it's working as expected
so as soon as we run it should show the
text box button control and grid view
control will not be shown because there
is no data so enter IP so this is a good
user who doesn't want to inject sequel
and when I click this button it's going
to work well
okay execute requires okay and look at
this error message it's meaningful
execute reader requires an open and
available connection so obviously be a
calling execute reader method but we
haven't opened the connection yet so we
need to open the connection before we
actually call that method so let's open
the connection so connection dot open
let's run that now enter the product
names in this case let's enter IP and
then click the get products button so IP
get products we should get the products
that start with IP iPhones and iPads
okay so what happened when you entered
IP ok this is what is going to happen so
if you look at this command it's exactly
the same thing select star from TBL
product inventory where product name
like and whatever the user types into
the text box in this case we typed IP so
that is taken and then concatenated with
that which will form the query that you
see here okay so this is good user he
doesn't have any malicious thoughts you
know he is entering whatever he wants
but let's say there is a hacker who want
to you know inject some sequel into your
application just imagine what happens if
he types something into the text box
into this text box if he typed something
like this okay if you look at the query
it's it's very simple I am typing in IP
and then closing the single quote so
what's going to happen so the single
quote is closed here okay so we are
closing the single quote and then
putting a semicolon which will be
treated as one sequel statement and then
into the text box I am typing delete
from TBL product inventory and
I'm using these - you know - - and what
what these does is look at this
if you look at the way we are building
the command what's happening we are
saying select star from this table where
product name like and whatever the user
enters into the textbox
+ - that we are concatenated the
percentage and single quote so somehow
we need to you know ignore them and the
way you can ignore them is by inducing
these you know - - because in sequel
server if you remember if you want to
comment something you use these lines
okay so the moment this part if you look
at this part the percentage and the
single code this is actually being
dynamically concatenated you know we are
concatenated this - you know whatever
the user types so we need to somehow
escape that and to do that we're
actually using the single code so when
we do this that get commented there but
obviously we are putting that there so
if the user types you know whatever you
see here what happens a query like this
will be formed select star from TBL
product inventory where product name
like you know the user is typing this
one IP single quote so IP single quote
and then a semicolon so a semicolon and
then what happens to the rest of this
this is the rest of the statement that
is he is typing they lead from TBL
product inventory so this is like
another query okay
so this entire thing is now within the
command object and look at this in the
end what is he doing he is concatenated
these - why is he is doing this you know
and entering this - - basically -
comment out you know this bit here
percentage and the single chord so to
comment out that so we are commenting
out that piece there so obviously just
imagine what happens if this query gets
executed if this query gets executed
okay it will select something with
products that start with IP and then it
excuse this delete query delete from TBL
product inventory which is going to
delete all the rows from that
okay so here we just did a sequel
injection okay so let's see if that's
what happens now with our application so
if you look at this now you know let's
select all the rows from the table so we
have all the rules let's get rid of this
here now if I run this application it's
already running so if I if I enter IP
and plus get products I get them if I
say let's say I want all the products
that start with letter B I enter that
get products I get them so good user no
problem but let's say he enters you know
maybe be your IP whatever so I want all
the products that start with maybe IP
and then single quote so this will
finish the first command and I'm putting
in a semicolon
and then I'm saying delete from TBL
product inventory let's copy the table
name so that we will we don't have
spelling mistakes TBL product inventor
eh that's it and I am putting - you know
- x' which will comment out the last bit
here this needs to be commented out
otherwise we get you know a sequel
syntax error when this query goes to
execute to be executed at the database
okay so now look at this when I click
this button it doesn't show anything
that's fine because there is no product
that starts with this name but actually
behind the scenes it query like this
would have been constructed because of
the way that we have written the code
and then if I say select star from TBL
product inventory look at what just
happened all the rules are completely
wiped out so this is nothing but sequel
injection and why is this happening this
is happening because of the way that we
have coded this application because of
the way you know we are building these
sequel queries you know building queries
like this we are opening up the doors
for sequel injection attack so you
should never ever dynamically build a
sequel queries by concatenating you know
whatever the user types into the you
into the UI controls in this case text
box now
okay at least we should be doing some
sanity check here okay is he trying to
inject some sequa and the best way to
actually solve the sequel injection
attack is by using parametrized queries
or stored procedures which we will be
talking about in the next session of
this video series
so that's sequel injection attack very
simple on this slide you can find
resources for a suite or net c-sharp and
sequel server interview questions that's
it for today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
