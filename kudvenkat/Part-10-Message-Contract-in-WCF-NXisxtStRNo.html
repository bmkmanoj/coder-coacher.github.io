this video well discus message contracts
interview CF this is continuation to
part nine so please watch part nine
before proceeding with data contracts
we've got very limited control over the
slope XML request and response messages
that are generated use message contracts
if you want full control or degenerated
XML soap messages message contracts can
be extremely handy when we want to
include some custom data in this hope
header for example in general soap
headers are used to pass user
credentials license keys session keys
etc message contracts can also be handy
when we want to change the name of the
wrapper element within the soap message
or to remove that wrapper element
altogether in general use message
contracts only if there is a reason to
treat the structure of the soap XML
message if all this doesn't make sense
at the moment don't worry we're going to
look at an example in a bit which would
make all this clear
we'll be using the same example that we
developed within the previous sessions
of this video series so this service
host is already running and this is the
client that interacts with the employee
WCF service that we have built so let's
request an employee so now a request and
a response soap XML messages should be
automatically generated and they should
be logged as well we discussed logging
the messages in the previous sessions of
this video series so let's get to the
folder way we have these messages logged
and let's open the message log file so
this is the request and this is the
response message let's look at the
request message now for better
visibility I have copied and pasted this
request message on the slide notice that
within the soap message we have got a
soap envelope and within that we have
got a soap header and its whole body
within the soap body section notice that
we have got this element called cat
employee this element is called the
wrapper element look at the name of the
wrapper element it's get employee this
is nothing but the name of the operation
count
right so within our employee WCF servers
get employees the name of the operation
contract so by default the wrapper
element within the soap request message
is getting the name of that operation
contract and then this ID element is
nothing but the name of the parameter
that method expects so ID is the name of
the parameter and that parameter is
present within that wrapper element and
we have passed you know one as the value
for ID if you look at the response
message again we have called a soap
envelope a header and a body and within
the board a look at this we have caught
the scatter employee response again get
employees the name of the operation
contract response is appended at the end
of that word so this is the response
soap message that is sent to the client
and within that we have another element
called get employee and again here
result word is appended at the end and
within that element we have got the
parameters I mean the properties of
employee ID name gender and the rest of
the properties now what we want to do is
we want to treat this request and
response messages and in order to
achieve that we are going to make use of
message contracts and this is how we
want to tweak those requests and
response messages so within the request
object we want to send a license key
let's say for example if somebody wants
to invoke or get employee method they
need to send us a license key and that
license key must be present in the
header and notice that within the body
section we also want to change the name
of the wrapper element now in the
auto-generated request object look at
this the name of the wrapper element is
get employee we want to change that to
employee request object
and within that we want to change the
name of the parameter to something like
employee ID and within the response
message we want to change the name of
the wrapper element to employee info
object and then the employee property
should be inside that wrapper element so
let's see how to achieve this you
message contract attribute let's flip to
visual studio so notice that at the
moment this operation contract has got a
return type of employee and if you look
at this class this is actually a data
contract now we want to customize the
generated soap XML request and response
messages so we are going to make use of
message contract so let's create a class
let's call this employee request and we
want this class to be the message
contract and in order to achieve that
all you need to do is decorate it with
message contract attribute and this
attribute is present in a different
namespace that a system dot service
model so let's bring that in and this
attribute has got several named
parameters is wrapped production level
so production level basically is used to
sign and encrypt messages we'll discuss
this parameter when we discuss about
security and we have wrapper name and
wrapper namespace now we want a wrapper
element with the request so let's set is
wrapped property to true and since we
specify that we want a wrapper element
we can also specify a wrapper name so
let's set wrapper name to something like
look at this we want the wrapper name
within the request object to be employee
request object so let's set the wrapper
name to employee request object and then
let's also set a wrapper namespace
so let's set this to something like HTTP
colon four slash four slash my company
dot-com four slash employee all right
now within the header we want to include
license K so first let's go ahead and
create that property so license K is
going to be of type string and let's
make this an auto implemented property
now if you want a specific property of
the class to get into the header section
all you need to do is decorate that with
message header attribute this message
header attribute has got several named
parameters we're going to make use of
namespace parameter and set a namespace
so let's set namespace to the same thing
as that of the wrapper namespace so
let's copy this and paste it
all right now within the body section we
want the wrapper element
I mean employee ID okay so first we need
to create that employee ID property so
employee ID is of type integer so public
and employee ID and let's make this or
to implement a property and we want this
to get into the body section and if you
want a specific property of the class to
get into the body section all you need
to do is decorate that with bass age
body member attribute again this
attribute has got several parameters
here we are going to make use of
namespace parameter and we'll basically
set it to the same namespace all right
so we are done with the request object
now within the response you know we want
the wrapper name to be employee info
object so let's go ahead and create a
class for employee response so let's
call this employee info and again we
want this class to be a message contract
so let's go and decorate this with
message contract attribute and we want
the wrapper name to be employee info
object so let's change the wrapper name
here to employee info object all right
and now within the response we want to
have these elements within this order ID
name gender DOB you know the rest of the
properties and to speed things up I have
already typed these properties so let's
copy and paste them within that class
and if you look at this this is these
are straightforward auto implemented
properties now we want all these
properties to get into the body section
so if that is the case what we need to
do we need to decorate that with body
message body member attribute and here
we also want to specify the order
okay so we can make use of the order
property so order equals one and let's
also set namespace let's actually copy
namespace from here
okay so in a similar fashion let's set
message body member attribute on the
rest of the properties all right and
let's quickly change the order so name
two to gender two three date of birth to
four employee type five annual salary
six overly pay seven and let's decorate
this attribute as well I'm in this
property as well okay all right so we
have employee request and employee info
plus both of them decorated with message
contract attributes
now let's include two constructors here
one constructor which doesn't take any
parameters in a bit you will understand
how we are going to make use of these
constructors and another constructor
which is going to take an employee
object as a parameter again in a bit
we'll see how to use these two
constructors okay so what is this
constructor going to do it's going to
basically initialize you know all the
property values you know all these
property values from this employee
object so this class dot ID equals
employee ID in a similar fashion this
dot name equals employee dot name this
dot gender equals employee dot gender
and this dot date of birth equals
employee dot date of birth and this dot
type equals employee dot type F
this dot type equals employee type dot
full-time employee so if it's full-time
employee then we know that that employee
object is going to contain annual salary
as well so in which case we are going to
say the annual salary property of this
class is going to be equal to employee
object employee object will not have
full-time I mean annual salary we need
to typecast it to full-time employee and
then access the property so annual
salary else if it is not full-time
employee then we know that it is going
to be part-time employee in which case
we are going to set the other two
properties that is hourly pay equals we
are going to type gasps this employee
object to part-time employee and then
get out hourly pay in a similar fashion
let's initialize hours worked property
all right
okay so straightforward classes
basically all right now let's see how we
are going to make use of these message
contracts so now within our employee
service instead of returning the
employee object we are going to return
employee info object and the parameter
here instead of simply passing integer
ID we are going to pass employee request
object and let's call this request and
save employee is going to receive
employee info object all right now we
need to change the implementation of our
WCF service as well so this method now
is going to get employee info object and
let's call it employee okay
all right so we have employee info
coming in here and look at what the
service is doing it it does the regular
stuff let's go to the database and then
it's going to retrieve the ID that we
are going to have within this employee
info object so we need to set that
employee ID property as the value for
the parameter of the stored procedure so
we are going to basically say let's
actually call this employee info because
we already have a variable here which
says employee so let's set this value of
the parameter here to employee ID
property of to ID property sorry it's
not employee info it's going to be
employee request right and let's call it
request
so here the ID value is going to be
reckless dot employee ID okay all right
we are going to you know get the
employee details from the database so
this code is not going to change in any
way and then finally we don't want to
return an employee object what do we
want to return what should be the return
type of this method this is nothing but
this method right here by implementing
that with an all-service contract so
here the return type is going to be
employee info so now we actually need to
return employee info object from the
implementation okay
and in order to do that I'm going to
create a new employee info object here
and if you recollect we have included
two constructors within that class one
that doesn't take any parameters the
other one which take employee object has
a parameter so we are going to pass that
to this constructor so what is this
going to do this is going to
automatically take all the properties
and then initialize the properties of
this class and then that object that is
employee info will be returned to the
caller all right so that's about you
know get employee now let's look at save
employee so here to this function we are
going to pass employee info and let's
call it employee so now when we pass
employee this employee info object has
got ID name date of gender date of birth
we changed that property name to do B
and then we are setting the employee
type value there and what P basically
can do here is the object that is coming
into this method is employee info okay
and with an employee info we have got
pipe property so we can compare that
type directly to employee type dot
full-time employee so if it's full-time
employee then we can use the employee
object and then retrieve the salary
annual salary property value and set
that as the value for the parameter okay
similarly if it's not a full-time
employee it's going to be part-time
employee in which case we want to simply
retrieve employee dot hourly pay and
populate that as the value for hourly
pay parameter and then retrieve hours
worked okay so that's it we are done
from the service side so let's stop this
service let's rerun it once again so the
host has started now let's get to the
client and then within the client here
is the employee service let's update the
service reference
and let's delete this XML file here I
have created that for some testing
purposes so within our web form one dot
aspx dot CSD code-behind file now we
should have some compliation errors okay
now first let because we you know this
doesn't anymore expects just the ID it
requires employee request object to be
passed in to this get employee method so
let's actually delete this and then
create so employee service so with an
employee service namespace there is AI
employee service interface and if you
look at that interface look at that it
has got get employee method which is
expecting employee request object and
it's going to return an employee info
object back in a similar fashion we have
saved employee method which is expecting
employee info object which will be saved
to the database okay and then we
basically get a voided response back
okay all right so now let's call this
client equals new employee service
within that namespace we should have our
employee service client okay so let's go
ahead and invoke get employee method on
this client and then to this we need to
pass the employee request object so
first let's go in and create employee
request object and that's present an
employee service namespace so employee
request and let's call it request equals
new employee request and you know to
this request object we need to pass a
license key for now let's simply say a
x-g maybe one to zero
ABC some random string and then employee
ID where are we going to get the
employee ID from a text box called txt
ID and let's convert that 20
all right so we have a request object
now let's go ahead and send it to the
client so this get employee now look at
what it is returning it is returning
employee info so let's go to create a
class of type employee info let's call
it employee okay so look at this if
employee type is full-time employee then
we want to simply retrieve this salary
and set it as the text for that text box
else we don't have to typecast anymore
because the employee responds object has
got all the required properties in it
so let's set hours worked and this code
is not going to change and here the
property name is DOB so let's change it
to that all right so we are done with
button get employee click now let's look
at button save click so now again here
declined is going to bei let's change it
to the interface type which is I
employee service and then we need to
invoke the save employee method and if
you look at save employee method it
expects employee info object to be
passed ok so here we actually need to
create employee info object now here we
are going to use the constructor that
doesn't take any parameters if you
recollect the second parameter takes the
properties all the properties of the
employee object which we are basically
using on the service side the first
constructor doesn't take any parameters
okay
so here we are using the parameter less
constructor to create an instance of
that employee info class and then we are
going to populate the properties that
are required okay
so basically we are retrieving the
selected value and if the user has
selected full-time employee from the
drop-down list
in that case ok we are going to move all
the common code that is ID name gender
date of birth and okay let's just move
ID name gender and date of birth outside
of this if block let's actually put it
at the end in a bit we'll change this
code as well
so if if the employee is full-time again
we don't need this brackets here we
don't need this method call and that so
all we are going to do here is set
employee object type property to
full-time employee let's use a semicolon
at the end and then we are going to set
annual salary to whatever is there in
the text box so that is within the if
block and within the else block let's
actually get rid of this if condition
there so if it's part-time employee then
again we are going to get rid of all
this code and this as well we'll move
this code again to the end in a bit it
will be clear what we are going to do
okay so if it is full-time employee we
are populating the type as full-time and
you'll sell it to whatever it is else if
it's the part-time employee or we can
simply say else we don't even have to
check because if it's not going to be
full-time employee it's going to be
part-time employee in which case we are
going to set the employee type to
part-time employee and let's also set
hourly pay whatever is present within
the textbox and hours work to whatever
in that text box okay let's get rid of
this extra white spaces
and
now what we're going to do here is
actually include another if condition if
the selected value within the drop-down
list is equal to minus one meaning if
they didn't select part-time employee or
full-time employee then what we want to
do we want to display in the label
stating that it's required to select an
employee type else if you have selected
a the part-time employee or full-time
employee then we are going to do all
this okay so we can get rid of this else
block here now we need to set the
employee ID
we need to set employee named employee
gender we'll fix these compilation
errors in just a bit
and employee info object doesn't have
date of birth it's called as DOB all
right now let's actually format this
properly so that it's better readable so
let's select that code and then press
ctrl K and D that should format that
let's get rid of those white spaces so
the code should be very clear now
so basically we're creating an employee
info object here and then we are
checking if the selected value within
the drop-down list is minus 1 then we
are saying please select employee type
else if the selected employee type is
full-time employee then set just the
type to full-time employee and annual
salary properties else if it's not going
to be full-time employee then it's going
to be part-time employee in which case
set type hourly pay and hours worth okay
and this is the common code we always
need to set ID name gender date of birth
whether it is full time employee or
part-time employee and then pass that
employee object to save employee method
which is going to save that employee to
the database table and then display the
message within the label control all
right so with all these changes let's go
ahead and run the client and see if it
works as expected so let's get an
employee so we got an employee let's
quickly go back and check the generated
XML messages so let's open the trace
file once again
so look at the request message you know
within the header we have got the
license key whatever we are populating
on the client and within the body look
at the wrapper element it's called
employee request object the namespace is
what we have said - and within that
wrapper Elementary of God employee ID
and here the response look at that
within the response we only have one
wrapper element within the body and
within that we have the properties that
we are expecting okay and let's make
sure the saving works is expected as
well so let's save it as number six save
employee look at that employee saved it
should have been saved to the database
so now here we are using message
contracts so message contracts are
straightforward so if you want a class
to be used as a message contract all you
need to do is decorate a class with
message contract attribute and then use
that class as an operation contract
parameter or return type message
contract attribute has these properties
you know we discussed using the East
wrapped wrap name and wrap wrapper
namespace properties in a later video
session when we discuss security will
discuss production level which basically
enables us to sign and encrypt messages
that are exchanged between the client
and the service and message header
attribute is supplied on a property of
the class that we want to include in
this hope header message header has got
these properties and message body member
attribute is applied on a property of
the class that we want to include in the
soap body section and discard these
properties that's it for today thank you
for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
