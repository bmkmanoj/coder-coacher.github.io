this video we'll discuss jQuery
attribute selector that is selecting
elements that have specified attributes
and our specified attribute values here
is the syntax we specify the name of the
attribute within square brackets and we
pass that to the jQuery dollar function
so this is going to find all elements
that have the specified attribute if you
want to find elements with specific
attribute and with a specific value for
that attribute you would use the second
syntax we have a few examples here the
first example is going to find all
elements that have the title attribute
the second example is going to find all
developments that have the title
attribute the third example is going to
find all elements that have the title
attribute with value div title and the
last example is going to find all
developments that have title attribute
with value div title let's look at these
in action now let's flip to visual
studio so at the moment there are four
elements that have title attribute so
these two divs this paragraph and this
panel iment now what we want to do is
find all those elements that have the
title attribute so within the ready
function so we include the jQuery dollar
function now the name of the attribute
must be within square brackets so we
want to find all elements that have
title attribute so this is going to find
all those elements with title attribute
and what we want to do with them is
include a 5 pixel solid red border
around them so the name of the property
is going to be boarder and we want a 5
pixel solid red border so let's save
those changes and when we reload this
page look at that all those elements
that have the title attribute gets a
solid red border around them now
let's find all developments that have
title attribute so what is this going to
do this is going to find any element
that
as a title attribute whether it is a
span div paragraph it doesn't care as
long as it has a title attribute it's
going to select that okay but now our
requirement is to select only the
developments that have the title
attribute and only these two
developments have the title attribute so
when we save these changes and when we
reload the page look at that both of
those divs are selected now let's find
all elements with title attribute and
the value for the title attribute must
be the one title so we want to find all
the elements so I'm going to remove that
word div so find all elements that have
the title attribute and the value must
be equal to div 1 title okay find all
elements that have title attribute and
the value must be equal to do 1 title
and which elements matches that selector
this matches and this pan matches okay
so let's save those changes and when we
reload both the dev and span should have
a 5 pixel solid red border now if you
look at this entire selector that is
within single quotes and the attribute
value is within double quotes okay now
can I reverse that can I include this
selector itself within double quotes and
the attribute value within single quotes
absolutely you can do that okay it's
purely your coding style you can do a to
this or the other way around but the
behavior is exactly going to be the same
okay or is it possible to use double
quotes everywhere okay yes you can now
when I use double quotes here the
meaning of this is going to change
basically this string begins here and it
is terminating here but that's not our
intention so we need to escape this
double coat with backslash and similarly
here another double quote and we need to
escape that with a backslash and it's
still going to work the same way now you
can do that with single
quotes as well so you can put your
string within single quotes and if you
want to use single quote here you have
to escape that with the backslash and
the same thing here and again it's still
going to work the same way all right now
let's find all developments that have
title attribute and the value of the
title attribute must be Devon title and
to do that we just use div here so
basically we are telling find all
developments that have title attribute
and the value must be equal to div title
okay and at the moment only this element
matches that okay so when we reload this
page only that div must have a five
pixel solid red border around it
now let's find all developments that
have both title and style attributes we
are going to use this HTML for this
example so let's paste that within the
body section so if you look at this HTML
we have four divs here and only these
two divs have both the attributes title
and style so now our requirement is to
find all developments that have title
attribute as well as style attribute so
both the attribute must be there and
these are the two developments that
matches that selector and we want the
five pixel solid black border
okay so let's reload this and look at
that red day when green div which are
these two which has both the title and
style attributes are selected okay now
here it's an and condition select all
those developments which have both title
and style attributes how to specify an
AR condition you know if an element has
a the title or style attribute then we
want to select all those elements if you
want to enforce a No
condition simply include a comma okay so
find all developments with either title
or style attributes and which elements
matches that criteria all these three
matches that criteria okay
so all three of them should have a five
pixel solid black border look at that
now let's say I want to find all
elements that have title attribute and
the value must be equal to div title
okay so how many elements matches this
criteria again these three okay and the
value for style attribute let's say that
must be equal to this one background -
color : green okay now how many elements
matches the selector only you know
basically everything because we are
using all condition here but if I remove
that all condition basically we are
telling find all developments that have
title attribute with this value and
style attribute and the style attribute
must have this value so how many
elements matches this criteria only this
one so only that one should have a
border now let's save those changes and
when we deal ode look at that only that
green div get the black border that's it
for today thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
