this video we'll discuss areas in MVC a
when we create a new asp.net MVC
application we get models views and
controllers folders and notice that
these folders are present within the
root directory of the project now this
structure of the project is fine for
simple applications but as our
applications get bigger and complex
maintaining our models views and
controllers can get complicated the
structure of such complex asp.net MVC
applications can be very easily
maintained using areas let's understand
this with an example let's assume we are
building a job portal side and it's
common for a typical job portal to have
the areas that you can see here it can
have employee area and maybe this
functional area allows a job seeker to
create the profile upload resume and
perform job searches and they could be
employer area and this functional area
allows a job provider or an employer to
create their profile upload jobs and
search for suitable candidates and in a
similar fashion we could have
administrative area and this functional
area allows an administrator to
configure the site and maintain it let's
flip to visual studio and let's create
these areas creating the areas itself is
very straightforward all you need to do
is right-click on the project name add
area and then give you an area a
meaningful name let's add employee area
and look at the moment I do that there
is a folder called alias created and
within that we have employee folder ok
and within that employee folder we have
a set of models views and controllers
let's add another area so I can right
click on the alias folder add area and
then add another area let's add employer
area and look at that employer folder is
added within areas and I have another
set of models views and controllers
similarly I can add another area may be
admin area
okay look at that there are three
folders admin employee and employer all
present in areas folder and then each
folder has got their own set of models
views and controllers and look at that
within each folder there is also a file
called area registration dot C as you
know in admin folder it's named as admin
area employee area registration and
employer area registration now if you
look at the code inside this file
basically this is the code to register
rules for this area look at that anybody
who wants to invoke URLs within this
area they will use this admin word
forward slash and then the name of the
controller name of the action method and
any parameters that they want to pass
similarly for employee area you know
they use employee forward slash and then
the name of the controller action and
parameters okay so we have several
several areas here and to register all
these areas you know when the
application starts up within global dot
a sa X that we have this application and
let's go start even handler so this gets
invoked when the application starts and
look at this we have a method call to
register all areas which is going to
register all these areas you know at the
start of the application alright now
let's go ahead and add a controller
first of all let's add a controller you
know in the root directory in the main
area so let's right click on the
controllers add a controller and let's
call it home controller so we are adding
a home controller to the main area
that's present within the root directory
okay so notice that we have an index
action method there and similarly let's
go ahead and add a controller to admin
area and let's again call it as home
controller similarly let's add a
controller to the employee area and
let's call it again home controller look
at that now I can have in a home
controller in each folder and I can
homecontroller to the employers folder
as well okay now let's go ahead and dad
respect your views as well so let's go
to the home I mean the controller the
home controller that is present in the
main area and let's add a view let's
call it index view so this should be
added to the home folder within the main
area and let's change this HTML there
let's say h2 main area let's call it
homepage so that we know we are on the
main area home page and similarly let's
go to admin area home controller add in
index view so that should be added to
the home folder within views within
admin area and similarly let's do the
same thing that the home controller in
employee area and let's do the same
thing for employer as well
okay and let's change the HTML in the
respective views so this is employer
area homepage and similarly let's change
the HTML here and let's call this
employee area homepage and this one is
Advan area homepage okay so let's go and
build our solution let's fire up the
browser and let's try to navigate to
localhost MVC demo look at that I am NOT
specifying I am at the root of my
project localhost is the server m ec
demo is the name of the project but I
haven't specified the name of the
controller or the name of the area
nothing I'm just at the root of my
project which means you know if we don't
have areas then this URL is going to
invoke by default home controller and
then the index action within the home
controller that's because within the
global dot asex file you have a call to
register routes method so if you go to
definition on that so this is route
config dot C S which is present in app
and let's go start folder so that's the
file so here we have register routes
method look at that if we don't specify
the name of the controller and the name
of the action method then it's going to
use the home controller and index action
okay so it should try to navigate to
this controller look at what's going to
happen look at that look at the error it
says multiple types were found that
match the controller name home so if you
remember we added home controller you
know to all over areas admin
employee-employer and there is a home
controller in the main area as well so
that's what it's saying there are
multiple types that will you know named
home ok so in all this area so it's it
has a confusion which one to pick okay
so now to fix this error all we need to
do is
look at this register out start map
route function this function has got
several overloaded versions so I'm going
to use an overloaded version way we can
specify the namespace as well look at
that there is one overloaded version we
can specify namespaces and look at that
the namespaces it is expecting the
namespaces in the form of a string array
okay so we need to specify the name
spaces so namespaces that's a named
parameter so you have to use the name of
the parameter and then we need to pass a
string array so you can either say new
string and then pass you know the
current the namespace name as a string
or I can simply say new and then pass
the namespace name now this home
controller in the main area so within
this the controllers folder in the main
area and that's the home controller and
what is the namespace button with this
home controller is present MVC demo dot
controllers so pick up that and then
pass it here okay so let's go ahead and
build this
now let's refresh this and see what's
going to happen look at that we are on
the main area home page now if I give
something like this employee now that
means we want to go to the employee area
so within employee area so this is the
employee area folder and within that we
have employee area registration dot C as
file so this route will be used and
notice that here within this register
area function we are specifying the
action method name the default is index
action so if we don't specify an action
method name then it's going to invoke
index action but then here we are not
specifying the controller name as well
so if I don't specify the controller
name we haven't specified a default for
the controller so when I am going to
visit this we
get an error that the source cannot be
found and that's understandable because
you didn't tell me which controller you
want so by default you know it throws
that error and to fix that all you need
to do is specify the default controller
for employee area so what is that going
to be that's going to be home let's
build our solution let's put a comma
there and builder solution let's refresh
this view and now we should be able to
navigate to home I mean index action
within the home controller of employee
area but then we get a compiled Asian
error and this is totally unrelated
error and if you do get this error all
you need to do is you need to run this
command ok and where do we need to run
this command open visual studio click on
tools library package manager and there
is something called package manager
console and within that console window
type that command so basically we are
installing a package for that microsoft
word website optimization so press Enter
so it should install that
so it's attempting to resolve dependency
all right so it's successfully installed
that now let's build a solution and
let's refresh this so we should arrive
at the index action of the home
controller in employee area look at that
so it works as expected all right now
let's provide some links so I want to be
able to look at that from the employee
area so at the moment we are in the home
controller and index action of employee
area so that's employee area home page
now let's say from this I want to go
back to the home page the main home page
so we want to provide a link there so
let's go back to employee area and
that's the index view so let's provide a
link and to provide the links we can use
action link HTML helper let's actually
create a table let's create a table row
let's actually set border for the table
of one and then let's include a TD here
so let's include links for all the areas
ok so we have four TDs I'm in TRS let's
have another PR so here let's say we
want a text which says maybe something
like links now we want to have a link to
the main area so how do we do that HTML
dot action and I want to go to the main
area home page so I'm going to use
action link HTML helper and the first
parameter is the link text so let's say
main area home page and then obviously
which action method you want to invoke I
want to invoke the index action within a
controller so I'm going to use this
overloaded version
so within which controller you want to
invoke the index action within the home
controller okay so now let's do the same
thing here so I want to go to employee
employee area homepage and again with an
employee area with an employee area and
we want to invoke the index action of
the home controller okay
so let's do that for employer as well
and similarly let's do it for admin area
okay so let's build this and let's
refresh this view so we should get the
links so we are currently on the index
action of the home controller of
employee area now I want to go to main
area home page now look at what's going
to happen I am still in employee area
homepage okay so I didn't go to the main
area home page since we are in a
different area and now if you want to go
to a different area then you will have
to specify the area name as well when we
build these action links so from the
employee area I want to go to main area
and if you look at our structure the
main area within our project doesn't
have any name okay so we simply specify
a blank string as the name of the area
okay so this action link again this
action link HTML helper it has got
several overloaded versions I'm going to
use an overloaded version where we can
specify area name as a non Animus type
it's a new area so I'm going to give an
empty string so that takes us back to
the main area home page and similarly
and then there is another parameter that
we need to pass now so let's copy and
then if I want to go to employee home
page then the name of the area is
employee let's copy this entire stuff
and then do the same thing for the other
links so here the area name is going to
be employer and finally we want to go to
the admin area so here the name is going
to be admin ok so let's take this HTML
and put it in other views as well so
let's put it in the admin view
employer view and the view that's
Pleasant in the main area
alright let's save everything let's
build a solution and let's go let's
click on this one ok so we should now go
to the main area home page ok look at
that now we are in the main area home
page let's try to go to employee radio
home page look at that
we are now able to navigate between
areas all right so in short areas are
introduced in asp.net MVC 2 that allow
us to break down a large complex
application into several small sections
called areas and each area can have its
own models views controllers and rules
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
