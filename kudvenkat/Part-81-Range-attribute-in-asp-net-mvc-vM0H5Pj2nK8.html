this video we'll discuss fringe
attribute range attribute checks of the
value of a data field is within a
specified range of values we'll be
working with the example that we started
in Part A T so please watch part 8a
before proceeding at the moment we don't
have any validation in place whatsoever
on this age field and because of that I
can enter a value of 5,000 for age and
then once I click Save look at that it
gets saved to the database and it's
impractical for an employee to have an
age of 5,000 so let's enforce a
validation on this field so that the
end-user can only enter a value between
1 and 100 so how do we enforce that
validation we can very easily do that by
using the range attribute and then
specifying the minimum and maximum
values as you can see here so let's flip
to visual studio first of all let's add
our property so public ages of type
integer so in the age and let's specify
the get and set accessors and then let's
decorate this property with the range
attribute and then this constructor has
got several overloaded versions look at
this there are six of them I'm going to
use the one which takes the minimum and
maximum values as integers so the
minimum range is going to be 1 and the
maximum is going to be 100 so now let's
go and build our solution and let's
reload this view at the moment within
the database we have a value of 5,000 so
that will be reloaded and then look at
this when I click Save we get the
validation message as expected the field
age must be between 1 and 100 but then
if I change it to 30 which is between 1
and 100 and once and I click Save look
at that it should get saved as expected
all right this range attribute can also
be used with date/time datatypes at the
moment this employee doesn't have any
fields of type date/time so first of all
let's go ahead and alter the definition
of the stable TBL employee to include a
column of type date so alter
table TBL employee and we want to add
higher date column of type date
obviously this column will have null
value so let's go ahead and update the
data all right so we have some data to
work with
now we have updated the table but then
we have already generated the area dot
entity data model so let's go ahead and
update our model so that the newly added
column is also included in this data
model so double click on the model and
then right click on this model and
select this option update model from
database so this should connect to the
database and then click on this refresh
tab so which should list the tables that
are already there within our model and
then we can refresh them so click on
refresh tab expand tables select our
table TBL employee look at this at the
moment we don't have higher date
property listed there then once we click
finish it should generate a property for
higher date okay so there we go
and let's build a solution so that this
employee class is compiled all right now
look at this when we click Edit and
navigate to the editor view within the
edit view you know the hire date our
property will not be displayed that's
because we have already generated the
code the HTML within the Edit view okay
so let's go ahead and change this HTML
to include higher date as well so I just
copied those two div tags and pasted
them here and then let's change the
property names so instead of model dot
gender that's going to be model dot
higher date so let's copy and replace
all right so let's build a solution now
and then when we refresh our editor you
should get higher data as well okay so
we get hired it first of all let's fix
this display we don't want time to be
displayed so let's get rid of that time
and to get rid of that time we can use
another attribute that's present so
let's go to our employee class so we can
use display format attribute so let's
first of all include our hire date
property so public and higher date is of
type date time okay so let's go ahead
and use display format attribute and
then specify our look at this this
attribute has got several overloaded
versions I'm going to I mean there are
two overloaded versions I'm going to use
this for loaded version where we can
specify the named parameters so we need
to specify the data format string so
let's go ahead and specify that so since
we want you know short date that is only
the date part of the date time to be
displayed I am going to specify a data
format string of 0 : d and that needs to
be present within the curly braces all
right so let's build this then let's go
and refresh the sphere and see if it
works as expected
look at that it still doesn't work
that's because we need to turn on a flag
there's another name the parameter
called apply format in edit mode and we
need to set that to true so basically we
are telling it to apply this formatting
even in edit mode by default it will not
be applied but we want that to be
applied so apply format in edit mode
equals true so let's build this and
let's refresh this now look at that it
works as expected now I also want a
validation in place you know the higher
date should be between in a11 2001 1
2010 okay so at the moment even if I
include you know something like 2 to 2
and click save it still saves that but I
don't want that I want date
basically to be between 2000 and 2010 so
how do we do that validation again use
range attribute but then we are going to
use a different overloaded constructor
now where we can specify the data type
as well okay so here along with the
display format attribute I'm going to
use range attribute and then look at
this we are going to use this overloaded
constructor wave we can specify the type
the minimum value and the maximum value
so to get the type we use type of
keyword so type of date time and then we
specify the minimum and maximum value so
the minimum value is going to is 0 1 and
0 1 2008 2000
and our maximum value is going to be
2010 right so let's build this and now
let's try to reload this one and then
we'll try to up update that okay
so let's click Save and look at that the
field hire date must be between 1 1 2001
1 to 2010 so it works as expected so if
I gave something like 2002 and click
Save
look at that it gets saved as expected
now look at this hided property it's not
displayed on the index view and to
display that it's straightforward again
include that within you are include that
property within the index view so first
of all we need a header so let's copy
the table header and then specify model
dot higher date for some reason it's not
displayed but let's type that there
and then let's include another TD here
okay
so let's build this and let's refresh
this index view we should see higher
data as well there there we go and this
hided property I mean when the range
attribute is used with date time of
feels the client-side validation doesn't
work as expected we'll discuss this in a
later video session in fact in our
future sessions we'll see how to enable
client-side validation as well at the
moment we only have server-side
validation so all the validations that
are there on this employee class are
happening on the server side at the
moment but in our future sessions we'll
see how to enable client-side
validations and once we do that this
date time feels you know when these day
time fields are used with range
attribute they don't work quite as
expected and we will see how to fix them
at that point of that time that's it for
today thank you for listening
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
