I'm Lincoln this is part su built-in
string type and c-sharp in part three we
have seen the other built-in data types
like boolean integral shooting types and
decimal data type
okay in this session we'll be looking at
string types from part one we have
already seen you know we have already
been working with strings for example we
have printed a string welcome to see
shop training and we also have accepted
some input from the user and then
concatenate that with the hello word and
on to the strain so in this session we
will see you know string type and
various things that we need to keep in
mind when working with strings
okay escape sequences when we're in
literals etc alright let's get into the
demo okay
so NC sharp a string is basically
enclosed within double quotes so double
quotes basically have a special meaning
you know NC sharp they're used to
indicate the beginning and end of the
string for example if I have to store
the name of a person then probably I
will have to use a string variable name
equals whatever is the name of the
person for example let's say Pro Jean so
now this w code here indicates the
beginning of the string this double
booty indicates the end of the string
now if I want to print the string I can
do console.writeline and the name of the
person so what is this going to do it's
going to print that string so if I go
ahead and run that so it prints that
screen now let's say I want this name
okay now when I run this program look at
that word pre-game it's not within
quotes for example I want the word prism
and on even the double quotes to be
printed how do I do that if I put
another double quote here look at this
this indicates the beginning and end of
a string so this is like what is this
project it's outside of them
Quotes now so that's why double-quotes
has a special meaning if you want to
output w code in the sense if you want
to print the double code itself then
there is a separate way to do that using
something called escape sequence NCM the
escape sequence character is backslash
for example you know in this particular
example double code has a special
meaning but I want the W code to be
treated as any other printable character
and to do that we make use of this
escape sequence character which in C
sharp is backslash okay so if I want to
print W code what I need to do is I need
to prepend that with the backslash and
the moment I do that look at that that
red squiggly is R now this backslash
tells to the shop compiler
okay whatever precedes me and I'll treat
that as a regular printable character
even if it has got special meaning
special compiler okay so escape sequence
there are some characters that have
special meaning within c-sharp in that
case we can use this escape sequences to
treat them as normal printable
characters
similarly there are some non-printable
characters for example you know a line
feed or a carriage written okay so if
you want to print or if you want to
specify those non-printable characters
within a string again you make use of
escape sequences okay
let's complete this example first I want
the pledging word to be within double
quotes so what I can do I can escape the
double quote with a backslash and now if
I go ahead and run this program
look at that pregame is in I'm
surrounded by double quotes as expected
so there are different you know escape
sequence characters within c-sharp and
if you want to have a look at them and
I'll look at MSDN article there are
different escape sequence characters for
example if I want a string within single
quotation mark then I would say
backslash
single coat or if I want a new line
character after every word that I print
then I use backslash n let's do an
example with this new line characters
that you understand that better so for
example I have okay I want to print one
two three in three different lines okay
now to do that I can make use of this
backslash n because if you look at this
one
backslash n is the new line character so
what am i doing here I have this string
so instead of you know wasting time in
typing I've already copied base to that
so one backslash n is a newline
character it comes to the next line -
and new line three any line so if I go
ahead and run this program now one two
and three you know will be coming in
their own lines
so do they're in the same line here
backslash n has a special meaning which
means it's a newline character it would
be printed backslash n instead a newline
character will be printed that's why two
comes in second line three comes in the
third line okay so those are the
different escape sequences you have this
chart on MSDN escape if you type in
escape sequences in c-sharp you will get
that as the first article so depending
on your requirement you can use this
chart and use that escape sequence for
example if you want to output backslash
itself you can escape that with another
backslash because again backslash has a
specific meaning it is used as escape
sequence character but if there is a
requirement in your application where
you want to print backslash itself then
you escape that another backslash
okay so for example if I want to print a
valid vendors path then probably I can
make use of this one so okay so I want
to print you know I have written C Drive
regime dotnet folder within the
daughter's the training folder and see
chef fuller if I want to print that look
at that do I have double backslashes
here in the old but I get only Singles
backslash because c-sharp compiler knows
backslash backslash means it's just an
escape case equals character to print a
backslash okay but however you know if
an on program of example looks in this
code it's not that readable this doesn't
look like a valid venues path you know
it's like four five folders here so it's
okay but if there are let's say you know
I'm ten or twenty directories deep then
I have to duplicate all these back
slashes so in order to overcome that you
know NC shop we have something called
verbatim literal okay so what's going
back in literal let's look at an example
and then we'll come back and look at the
definition of that okay now if you look
at this particular string this doesn't
look right you know this doesn't it this
doesn't look in a s passive valid window
spot it's not very much readable okay to
make it more readable what you can do is
put an @ symbol in front of that string
and the moment you do that the only
change that we have done is put the set
symbol here now if I go ahead and run
this program let's use all the other
windows you look at this now it outputs
you know backslash backslash double
backslashes now what you understood by
this when you put an add symbol in front
of a strain that's enclosed with W codes
all the escape sequences with
that string are no longer treated at
escape sequences instead they're treated
as regular printable characters okay so
if you want to treat escape sequences as
regular printable characters then you
can make you super better individual
okay so when you actually use this
verbatim literals and on for example
this is a very good example because you
know if you want your program to be more
readable you know if you want a valid
Windows part look like a valid Windows
part then make use of their bathroom
literals you know now if you you can
actually do it and remove that extra
backslash there and it looks much
readable so if we go ahead and run this
now you know look at this the program is
much readable now okay so that's we're
betting withdrawn so in this session we
have seen the string type you basically
include the string type in double quotes
and there are certain you know special
characters which have special meaning
the teashop contact compiler like single
code w codes etc now if you want to
treat them as regular printable
characters then we make use of escape
sequences nchrp escape sequence
character is backslash okay so if you
want to print a double quote you would
say backslash double quote if you want
to print a single code backslash single
quote if you want to print a double a
backslash itself then you escape that
with another backslash okay so escape
sequences are basically used to print
you know characters that have special
meaning also some non-printable
characters like a new line feed carriage
return etc and we also have seen
something called bear bad in literal and
what's verbatim literal verbatim literal
is a string with an add single prefix
you know as in this example you can see
it on the slide at hello well it
verbatim literals as we have seen in the
example they make escape sequences
translate as normal to blue characters
to enhance readability for example we
have seen the example of a valid vendors
part and this is a practical example
which of course we have just seen now
you know this
is not readable whereas this is better
readable this looks like a valid then
you spot that's it thanks for listening
and for additional resources is always
you can check presenter calm and for
eighth and C sharp interview questions
you can refer to these resources thank
you and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
