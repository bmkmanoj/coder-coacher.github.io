tutorial we are going to learn about
object-oriented programming concepts now
the always object-oriented language and
as a language that has the
object-oriented features Java supports
constructs like objects in classes if
you have never done programming you know
in object-oriented programming language
then it is time to learn two basic
concepts before we write any serious
code in this tutorial we are going to
learn about what is object-oriented
programming we will understand what are
objects and water classes we will
understand what is state and behavior
associated with the classes we will also
see the naming conventions required
while creating classes their behavior
and their state now let's understand
what is object-oriented programming now
object-oriented programming is an
approach to problem solving where we
represent the real-world problem in
terms of objects and classes and then
all these computations and operations
are carried out by the objects these
objects can also pass messages to each
other and therefore achieve a task let's
take an example where you have some
objects in a company representing two
employees Mike and Joe now these Mike
and Joe do all the work in that company
they talk to each other they pass
messages to each other and they
represent the objects let's go deep into
objects look around you will find so
many examples of your world objects like
bicycles lamp
dog etc your lamp has some state it is
either on or off your dog has also some
state it has color it has weight right
and it also has some behavior it can
bark it and eat etc so all these real
world objects have two essential
characteristics they have some state and
they have some behavior if we turn
around back to our employer object that
interrupt
say Mike can say that I have my state as
name equal to Mike and age equal to 25
and my behavior is I can greet I can say
good morning I'm Mike I can also work
Mike is working right now this is
essentially the high level concept of an
object in an object-oriented programming
in software word objects are more or
less similar to real-time objects now
let's put this knowledge into
programming let's say a company called
cups FM International comes to us and
says that case we have to employ today
we can possibly grow 2,000 by next year
and our employees do two things
they either greet all the work these are
the two things they do
can you please model this problem in
Java world for us and create a program
so let's start in order to help them we
should realize one thing it would not be
good to create separate definitions for
each employee because all these
employees have something similar they
have similar state their similar
behavior so why not create a template or
a blueprint out of it and in java
classes exactly represent this classes
are templates or blueprints that
represent similar type of objects in
order to see this in action we will
create a class let's say employer or
Java now this class will represent an
employer in our company first of all we
would create the state of an employee so
what is the state of an employee we can
have two fields let's say string name
and we can have his age
and then let's define behavior of an
employee as we have already learnt
employed us two things one it can greet
so in order to greet the employee simply
say is that good morning I am whatever
its name is similarly there is another
method which represents the behavior of
work and in this scenario what we write
is system dot out dot print and then
whatever his name is so in so it's
working right now understand that when
we created some objects some specific
instances of this class we need to
assign the name and age state of that
object in order to do so there is a
construct called constructor we will
understand constructors in detail but
for sake of simplicity here understand
that constructor is just like a method
it doesn't have any return type and its
name is exactly the same as that of the
class and here we can pass the values
that we want to initialize right
so when someone types employs e is equal
to new employ at that point of time if
we pass here two values like Jo and 30
then in that scenario this method is
called called when right so what happens
here is what it is object which we
denoted using this keyword again this is
this keyword accounts or a separate
tutorial but for the sake of simplicity
understand that this represents the
object that you are creating at that
point of time so this dot name equal to
whatever name you have send me and this
dot age equal to whatever age you have
send me in the method now let's save
this and try to compile this program and
it's got compiled now in order to use
this employee class and create its
object we will create another class
employee employee demo dot class Jahjaga
so let's update this employed in board
or Java and actually create some object
so we will create job jekt and after
some time we will create Mike object and
then we will ask them to greet and then
we will ask them to fork so let's see
how do we create objects we can say
employ joke equal to new employee and
you remember that constructor which we
had two values that we have to pass as
parameters so here Jo and 30 or the
Arkham
values that will part that will be
passed to that method whose parameters
were string name and int age
so let's create the second one also
employ mic equal to new employ mic 25
now we have created two objects one we
have created a Joe object and we have
created of mic object let's ask both of
them to greet Joe dot greet and we can
ask Mike also to create and now we can
also to work we can ask Mike to work
so let's see confirm that we have
compiled over employed or Java and now
we are compiling employed demoed or Java
and it gets compiled now let's execute
this employ demo and what should be the
output is first of all this job object
get created then a mic object gets
created and then joke leads he says that
good morning I am Joe my face good
morning I'm Mike and then when we call
Joe at work
Joe says Joe is working and then Michael
also has to work he says Mike is working
let's executed and this is output right
so what did we learn we learnt that we
create classes in order to define the
blueprint of entities that are similar
to each other and each class defines the
state and behavior of that object right
so now that we have understood class as
an object let's revise it a class
represents a template or blueprint and
an object is called an instance of a
class we can create an instance of a
class using the new keyword something
like employee equal to new employees
before we close this tutorial let's talk
little bit about meaning conventions
when we create classes we should
remember that the name of the class
should start with uppercase letter and
this is pascal case essentially P should
represent the real world entities and
therefore they are usually nouns
some examples are employed person dog
lamp cars etc whenever we define methods
that define the behavior of those
classes we should name the method
starting with lowercase letters
something in mixed case it should be
work you should describe what a method
does example print perform tasks etc
finally the fields that define the state
should also start with lowercase K
letters and which should be mixed case
in case there are constants it should be
all uppercase like max underscore value
right now that we have learnt about
object oriented programming classes and
objects and the naming conventions
associated with them we are all said to
start off setting up our Eclipse IDE for
there was more serious programming and
then we will dive into understanding
Java language constructs and actually do
object oriented programming in Java so
guys stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
