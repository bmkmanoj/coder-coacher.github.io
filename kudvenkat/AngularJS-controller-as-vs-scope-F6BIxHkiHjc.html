this video we'll discuss the difference
between dollar scope and controller as
syntax this is continuation two parts 32
and 33 so please watch these videos
before proceeding controller as syntax
is new and it's officially released in
version 1.2 dot zero dollar scope is the
old technique and it's available since
the initial version of angular is
released you can use either one of these
techniques both have their own uses for
example controller as syntax make your
code more readable when working with
nested scopes we discuss this in detail
with an example in our previous video if
you want to use dollar scope it has to
be injected into the controller function
whereas with controller as syntax there
is no need for such injection unless you
need that dollar scope object for
something else which one to use depends
purely on your personal preference some
prefer using dollar scope while others
prefer using controller s and tags when
you're using controller s and tags
don't be under the impression that
angela is not using dollar scope angular
is still using dollar scope behind the
scenes it's just hiding that let me
explain what I mean so if you look at
this example that we worked with in the
previous video notice that here we are
using controller as syntax so city
controller as City ctrl so this is a
reference variable that is pointing to
an instance of the city controller so
angular is actually taking that
reference and then attaching that to the
dollar scope object and then whatever
properties that you expose in this
controller they will be attached to this
property on the dollar scope object so
for example if you have a name property
then to access this name property from
the city controller you use City
controller dot name the city controller
is actually attached to the dollar scope
object it's just hidden okay so though
you're using controller a syntax you
know keep in mind angular is still using
dollar scope behind the scenes it is
just hiding that so these are some of
the
between dollar scope and controller s
and Dax thank you for listening and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
