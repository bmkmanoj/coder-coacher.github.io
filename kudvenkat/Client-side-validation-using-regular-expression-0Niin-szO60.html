in this video we'll discuss how regular
expressions can be used to perform
client-side validation on most of the
websites it's common to check if the
format of the email is valid a valid
email should have at symbol and the dot
character the dot character should be
present after the @ symbol before and
after the @ symbol there should be some
other characters similarly before and
after the dot character there should be
some other characters it's very easy to
check if the format of the email is
valid or not using a regular expression
it is what we want to achieve as I start
typing the email address in the text box
let's say for example I enter letter a
letter a is not a valid email address at
that point the background color of the
text box should change to red color
immediately indicating that it's an
invalid email so as I keep typing let's
say for example I enter letter ABC even
at that point it's not a valid email
address so the background color should
remain red as I keep typing and the
moment the email address becomes valid
at that point the background color
should automatically change to green
color indicating that it's a valid email
address so let's see how to achieve this
using JavaScript and regular expression
let's flip to visual studio so we need a
text box and let's give this text box an
ID
now let's go ahead and write a
JavaScript function to validate the
email address let's create a variable
let's call this email textbox
let's get the email textbox the ID of
the email text box is txt email let's
create another variable to hold the
email itself and we retrieve the email
using the value property of the email
text box and let's create another
variable to hold the email regular
expression so now we need a regular
expression that can validate you know
whether if an email is valid or not and
I copied this regular expression from
the internet so we are not going to go
into the details of this regular
expression so basically this is going to
check if the format of the email is
valid or not so we have the regular
expression now now look at this on the
red and green background white font
color looks great so let's change the
font color to white so we already have
the email text box so email text box dot
style dot color equals white if I'm
going to use this email regular
expression and the regular expression
object has got test method and we want
to test this email
so if the test method returns true at
that point we want to set the background
color to green else we want to set the
background color to red right so what's
going on here so this test method is
going to check whether if the string
that is present in this variable email
matches the pattern that is specified by
this regular expression if it matches
then the test method is going to return
true in that case we know it's a valid
email and we are setting the background
color of the text box to green otherwise
we are setting it to red so we have this
function validate email now we want to
call this on key up event so when is the
key up event fired as soon as we release
a key so let's say for example when I
type letter A you know key down and key
up events occur so on key up event we
want to call this validate email
alright let's save the changes reload
the page so here we have a text box to
enter our email address notice this as
soon as I type letter a that's not a
valid email address so the background
color is changed to red so I keep typing
ABC at Gmail that is still an invalid
email address dot that is still an email
address look at this the moment I type C
om it becomes you know green so
indicating that it's a valid email
address and look at this after you know
I type the email address if I try to
include any other characters notice that
again the background color becomes red
indicating that it's an invalid email
let's look at this as I keep deleting
the characters now as soon as again it
becomes a valid email the background is
changed to green on this slide because I
don't have enough space I couldn't
include the complete regular expression
but I will have this full regular
expression available on my blog in case
you need it thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
