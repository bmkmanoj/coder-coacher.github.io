in our previous video we discussed how
to get this department dropped down on
our form and here is the HTML for that
drop down list notice within the HTML we
have the options hard-coded for the
select list so in this video what we'll
do is remove those hard-coded options
from the HTML and retrieved them from an
array in the component class so the
first thing that we want to do is create
a type for our department now if we look
at the options of the department notice
each option has got a value which is
nothing but the ID of the department and
the department name itself so let's
create a type and let's do that within
the models folder right click on the
models folder new file since this is
Department model let's call it
department dot model dot TS as you might
have guessed already the department
class is going to have two properties ID
and name next let's import this
department type within our create
employee component so in the create
employee component type script file
let's include the required import
statement now in this class create
employee component let's create
departments property and this property
is going to be of type Department array
remember we have just imported the
department type from this file we know
each department is going to contain two
properties the ID of the department and
the name of the department let's say the
name of the department here to help desk
let's do the same thing for the rest of
the options one important thing to keep
in mind is this departments type
information right here this is not
required for the application to work
we'll actually prove that in just a bit
but having the type information right
here adds great value during development
because it provides intelligence error
checking and type safety at this point
we can remove the hard-coded options
from the HTML so I'm going to remove all
these options
then instead we are going to use ng for
structural directive and loop over the
department objects that we have within
the department's property so on the
option element right here let's use ng
for structural directive since ng for is
a structural directive it has an
asterisk in front of it structural
directives modify the Dom that is they
add or remove elements from the Dom
adding and removing elements is
different from showing and hiding
well discuss the differences in detail
in our upcoming videos
now let's loop over each department that
we have in the department's property so
let dep d so we are creating this
variable d EP d and we are going to
iterate over the department's property
and we know this departments property
contain an array of department objects
as we are looping over that array this
variable is going to point to each
department object that we are currently
iterating over and we want the value of
the option and we want to bind that
property to the department ID remember
this variable right here DEP D contains
a reference to the object that we are
currently iterating over so we know the
department object has got an ID property
and we want that ID value as the value
for the option and we also want the
department name as the text displayed so
again we are going to use this variable
DEP D and since it's a pointer to the
department object we know it has got
name properly and we are using
interpolation right here to display the
name of the department as the option
text so since we are using ng for
structural directive on the option
element each option will be repeated for
each department object that we have in
the department's array within our
component class notice we have the same
set of options displayed within the
Select list and when we select an option
the respective option value is captured
by the angular auto-generated form model
right here
now if we include another department
object within our departments Raa this
object will also be displayed as an
option within the department's drop-down
list notice we have the admin department
as well when we select that its
respective ID value is captured by the
angler generated phone model one
important point to keep in mind is that
this ng for structural directive should
be used on an element that we want to
have repeated in our case we want an
option for each department object that
we have in the department's array so
that's the reason we have included the
ng for structural directive on the
option element now let's see what's
going to happen if we move that ng for
structural directive on to this
development now what's going to happen
is for each department object that we
have in the department's array we are
going to get this entire div element
repeated so since we have five
Department objects within the
department's array we will have five
Department drop-down lists so this
entire there will be repeated for each
department object so if we take a look
at the browser now we will have five
departments drop-down list as you can
see right here and within each drop-down
we have a different option that's not
the behavior we want so let's move that
ng for directive back on to the option
element because that's what we want to
have repeated for each department object
that we have in the department's array
notice now we get one department with
five options as expected another
important point to keep in mind is when
we are binding to a property we will
have to use square brackets as you can
see right here where this case probably
binding in detail in part 9 of angular 2
tutorial so if you're new to property
binding please check out that video now
let's see what's going to happen if we
remove these square brackets if we
remove these square brackets each option
will have a value of this little text
the epd dot ID let's actually confirm
this it
we take a look at the browser right now
and then irrespective of the option that
we select notice the value that is
captured the epd dot ID that literal
text instead of the respective
department ID value notice any option
that we select we have the same value so
that's why it's very important when you
are binding to a property make sure you
use square brackets if you're binding to
a string literal then we don't need
these square brackets now if we take a
look at the department's array right
here notice we have included its type
information now with without this type
information the application is going to
work exactly the same way so now if we
take a look at the browser is going to
work the same way as before when we
select any of the options notice the
respective Department ID value is
captured by the angle I generated for
model so the application is working the
same way but it's great to have this
type information because during
development it provides us great
features like intelligence error
checking and type safety on this slide
we have the code that we just discussed
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
