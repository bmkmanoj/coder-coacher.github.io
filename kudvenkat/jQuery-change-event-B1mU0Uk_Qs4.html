this video well discuss take very change
event change event is fired whenever an
element value changes all these elements
that is input elements text area element
and select element Phi the change event
input elements include text boxes radio
buttons and checkboxes select element
radio buttons and checkboxes Phi the
change event as soon as a selection is
made whereas the other element types
like text boxes and text area elements
they wait until they lose focus to fire
the change event let's understand this
with an example
on this form right here we've got two
text boxes a drop-down list three radio
buttons three checkboxes text area
element a submit button and a
development to display the result
so first let's design a form like this
in the interest of time I have already
implemented the required HTML I'll have
all this HTML available on my blog in
case you need it so here we have the
first name textbox which has got an ID
type is text and class is input required
in a bit we'll understand the purpose of
this class and then we have got this
last name textbox which again has got
the ID type equals text class equals
input required and then we have this CD
select element and notice it also has
that class input required and then we
have the CTO options here and then next
we have the favorite color radio buttons
so we have got three radio buttons red
green and blue so here we have those
three radio buttons all of them have got
an ID type is radio and the class is
input required and if you look at the
name attribute all of these radio
buttons have got the same value and that
is basically to make these radio buttons
mutually exclusive and then we've got
the contact method checkboxes so three
checkboxes all of them have got an ID
type is checkbox and classes input
required and then we have the comments
text area element it also has got an ID
and class is input required and then the
submit button and then the development
to display the result
so that's the HTML and within our script
section we have the ready function wired
up so we want to handle the change event
of the drop-down list so whenever this
selection within the drop-down list
changes we want that selected value to
be displayed within the div element
that's present right here next to the
submit button so we want to handle the
change event of this drop-down list so
let's slip to visual studio so if you
look at that drop down list it's a
select element and the select element
has got an ID DDL city so let's find the
select element by ID so within our
jQuery ready function let's use the ID
selector and ID selector is hash and the
ID of the select element is DD LCA so
this is going to return that select
element and then we want to handle the
change events so we are going to use
this function change and whenever that
event occurs we want to execute some
code so let's make it part of this
anonymous function okay so when change
event is raised this function is going
to handle that and what do we want to do
when that change event occurs we want to
retrieve the value from the drop-down
list the selected value so let's create
a variable let's name it selected value
equals so we want to refer to the
drop-down list element and to do that we
can use this keyword and to retrieve the
selected value we can use Val function
so this is going to give us that
selected value from the drop-down list
and then what we want to do is display
that value within the development and
development also has got an ID and it is
div result so let's copy that so let's
find the development by ID and let's use
the HTML method to set the value that we
want to display within the dev that's it
so let's save the changes and let's
reload this page and look at this as we
select look at that I selected New York
and that's what is displayed on the
development
and Chennai and if I select select it
displays that select for some reason if
you want to validate that if I select
select we want to display a message here
saying please select the city you know
if you want to do something like that
then probably you can add an if
condition here F selected value equals
select then let's actually change
selected value to something like this
please select s city so let's see if
those changes reload this and look at
this when we select London that gets
displayed now if I select select it says
please select the city all right so here
within the ready function we are using
the ID selector so and that IDs of the
Select element so we are only able to
handle the change event of the select
element but we know that even the text
box here you know fires the change event
as soon as you same you know enter some
text here and as soon as the text box
loses focus it's going to raise that
change event and when that happens we
want to display whatever value that we
have typed into the text box in this
development
similarly radio buttons also fire the
change event as soon as you make it
selection we want to display that
selection within the development you
know the same is true for checkboxes and
the text area element okay so let's see
how to achieve that now in order to
achieve that all you have to do is
change your selector here so we are
using the ID selector here instead of ID
selector for example if I use element
selector so I want to find all input
elements and then handle their change
event okay so this is going to handle
the change event of all input elements
but let's slightly change the code that
we have here so we want to be a bit
generic here so we want to retrieve the
selected value so let's create a
variable here outside the change
function let's initialize that when
empty string and then within the change
function what we want to do is if that
result is an empty strain then what we
want to do is result equals dollar this
so it refers to the element that fires
the change event and we want to retrieve
the value from that element okay if it
is not an empty string that means you
know we already change the value in the
textbox so this result has got something
whatever value we have typed into the
textbox now when we type something into
the last name textbox then we want to
append that value you know to this
result variable okay so at that point
result variable will not be an empty
string so it comes to the else part and
when it comes to the else part we want
to concatenate to the variable so I'm
going to use plus equals and then we
want a comma we want to append a comma
and to that we want to append the value
from the element okay and then finally
we want to display that result within
the development so let's use the ID
selector ID selector is hash and they've
resolved and let's use the HTML method
and then pass our result variable
alright and look at the selector that we
are using here we're using the element
selector we want to handle the change
event of all input elements so let's
save the changes reload this page and
look at this as I type so we typed Sam
into the textbox and when I put the
mouse I mean then we tab away look at
that when the textbox loses focus it
raises change event and that event is
handled and we display that value within
the development now let's say for
example here Sam Martin is the last name
and as soon as the textbox loses focus
we handle the change event and the value
displayed within the development okay
and then look at this when the selection
and the drop-down list changes that
event is not handled now why is that
because select element is not an input
element okay it's a select element so
that's the reason why the change event
of the select element is not handle
because here we are using you know input
element selector meaning it's only going
to handle the change event of all input
elements not of the select element and
text area element as well say for
example here you know when I type
something in the text area element even
that change event is not handle but
whereas for the radio button look at
this when I select my favorite color is
green look at that that change event is
handled because radio button is an input
element similarly when I make a
selection from the checkbox even that is
handled but the Select element and text
area element change event is not handled
because they are not input elements so
if you want all these elements change
event to be handled then we could use
this class selector look at this we have
this input required class on all the
form elements so if we want to select
all these elements we can use this class
right so my selector now is going to be
dot and the name of our class so the
class name is input required so let's
pass that here save the changes let's
reload the page and let's type the first
name Sarah look at that as we type we
get you know whatever values within the
text box
those get displayed look at that now
even the select element to change event
is handled similarly radio button
checkboxes and text area elements so all
the change events are handled and look
at the amount of code that we have to
write a lot less that is the power of
jQuery
and here is that example which we just
discussed thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
