this video we'll discuss tiling tables
using bootstrap classes here are the
bootstrap classes available for styling
tables for basic table styling use the
table class let's look at this in action
so here we have a table with a header
and a few data rows at the moment we
haven't applied any of the bootstrap
table classes so if we view this table
in the browser this is how the table
looks like let's apply the bootstrap
table class on this table element and
see what we get
let's save our changes and when we
reload this page notice we get Lite
padding and horizontal lines let's now
look at the rest of the classes
available for zebra striping table
drawers use table stripe the class at
the moment this is how the table rows
are let's apply table striped class and
see what we get
I'm going to apply table striped class
along with the table class let's reload
this page notice the table rules are now
zebra-striped as expected at the moment
we don't have a boarder on all sides of
the table and we also doesn't have
border for the cells for border on all
sides of the table and cells use table
bordered class so let's apply this class
as well along with the other two classes
that we have let's reload this page
notice now we have border on all sides
of the table and cells
now let's discuss table have a class at
the moment nothing happens when I move
the mouse over these rows what we want
is when we move the mouse over a row we
want that specific rule to be
highlighted and that's exactly the
purpose of table have a class to
highlight the row on hahvah let's look
at this in action let's apply this table
hover class along with all the other
classes that we already have notice when
we reload the page and when I move the
mouse over a row that specific row is
highlighted to see the effect of this
class properly let's remove table
striping by removing this table striped
class
as we have removed the table striped
class we shouldn't have table striping
anymore and notice as I move the mouse
over that respective row is highlighted
let's now discuss table condensed class
notice the amount of padding that we
have around every cell what we want to
do is make this table a bit more compact
by reducing that padding that's exactly
the purpose of table condensed class to
make tables more compact by cutting cell
padding in half let's look at this in
action at the moment this is how the
table looks like let's apply table
condense the class and see what we get
look at what happens to the table and
the padding notice the padding is
reduced by half and the table has become
a bit more compact let's now discuss how
to make tables responsive to make tables
responsive use the table responsive
class to understand this class better
I'm going to include last name as well
at the moment we only have first name so
let's change this HTML notice now we
have last name along with first name
let's view this data on a mobile screen
size look at what's going to happen to
these columns as I reduce the screen
size notice especially the name column
look at what happens to last name it
wraps onto a new line as a result the
column width is reduced here we only
have four columns imagine if you have
nine or ten columns and if all of them
start to wrap like this the column
widths become smaller and smaller and as
a result it becomes more and more
difficult to read that data instead what
we want to do is make this table
responsive we're providing a horizontal
scrollbar and that's exactly the purpose
of table responsive class now to use
this class let's place this table
element inside another development so
first let's create a development and I'm
going to move this closing development
just after the closing table element and
on the development I'm going to apply
the
responsive class now applying table
responsive class on the table element
itself will do nothing useful let's save
our changes reload the page notice on a
large screen size we don't get the
horizontal scroll bar because we don't
need that but as we try to reduce the
screen size look at that we now get a
horizontal scroll bar look at the name
column the last name is not wrapped onto
a new line look at that now we have a
horizontal scroll bar but on a large
screen size we don't get that horizontal
scroll bar bootstrap also provides
contextual classes to color table rows
or individual cells there are five of
them let's apply these classes on
individual rows and see what colors we
get let's flip to visual studio now on
this first row right here I'm going to
use the active class on the second row I
am going to use danger glass and on the
third row let's use info class on the
fourth row success and on the final row
let's use one in class let's save our
changes reload the page notice we get
different colors thank you for listening
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
