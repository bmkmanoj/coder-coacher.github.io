in this video we'll discuss mutator
methods in JavaScript first let's
understand what we mean by mutator
methods there are several methods that
can be used with the RA object in
JavaScript some methods modify the RA
object while the others do not the
methods that modify the RA object are
called as mutator methods here we have a
few examples of non mutator methods for
example contains method is going to
check whether if a given array object
contains a given element or not if the
array contains the given element then
this contains method will return true
otherwise false these methods will not
change the array object upon which they
operate but whereas if you look at this
second set of methods here they're
actually going to change the array
object upon which they operate that's
why these methods are called as mutator
methods in part 20 of this video series
we discussed pushpop shift in unshipped
methods in this video we'll discuss
reverse sort and splice functions first
let's look at sort method sort method is
going to sort the elements of an array
by default the sort method sorts the
values by converting them to strings and
then comparing those strings so this
works well for Strings but not for
numbers let's look at a few examples now
here we have an array by name my array
and at the moment this array contains
strings and then we are calling the sort
method on that array object and finally
we are writing the contents of the array
to the document so let's run this
webpage and see if we get the string
sorted notice that the strings are
sorted in ascending order now let's try
to sort numbers so within this my array
instead of strings
let's stone numbers 22 10 1 3 let's run
this and see if these numbers will be
sorted notice that the numbers are not
sorted as expected why is that
that's because here this sort function
is using the default behavior by default
these
values will be converted to strings it
compares those strings and then sorts
them so this is going to work fine for
Strings but not for numbers so in this
case we have to supply an alternate
compare if you look at this sort
function notice that we can pass a
parameter to this function this
parameter is actually optional now when
we don't pass the parameter the sort
function is going to use the default
comparer now as we are sorting numbers
we want to provide an alternate compare
and tell the sort function you know how
we want to compare those numbers okay
so let's pass a function to this sort
method and this function is going to
have two parameters a comma B and all
this function is going to do is subtract
a from B and then return the result now
when we subtract two numbers and return
the result you know we get one of the
three values back we either get a
positive value negative value or a zero
now if we get a positive value back then
we know that a is greater than B when we
get a negative value back we know that a
is small then smaller than B if we get
zero then a is equal to B so this return
value will be used by the sort function
to sort the past in a and B values so at
first twenty and two will be passed to
this function so a will contain 20 B
will contain two so 20 minus two is 18
a positive value is returned so the sort
function knows 2 is smaller than 20 so
it's going to sort them in that order 2
comma 20 and then next time 20 and 10
will be passed to this function so a
will contain 20 B will contain 10 20
minus 10 again we get a positive value
back so it knows that B is less than a
so it's going to you know arrange the
elements in 10 comma 20 order so
first we have to 10:20 and it goes on
until you know the sort method has
sorted all the elements within the array
now let's go and run this and see if we
get these numbers sorted in ascending
order notice that we get the output as
expected now at the moment these numbers
have sorted in ascending order now what
if we want to sort these numbers in
descending order there are two ways we
can do this one way is to actually
reverse the subtraction so instead of
subtracting a from B we can subtract B
from a so since we reverse that the
order in which these numbers will be
sorted will also be reversed so notice
that the numbers are now sorted in
descending order that's one way and the
other way is to actually you know sort
them in ascending order and then use the
reverse function okay so on the result
that we are going to get I'm actually
going to call the reverse method so now
again we should get the numbers sorted
in descending order so this also should
explain you know what the reverse method
actually does reverse method is going to
reverse the order of elements in an
array let's look at this Pleiss method
so what is the splice method going to do
it's going to add or remove elements
from an array and this method has got
three parameters index delete count and
item one two item X so what is this
index parameter you know this parameter
is required and it specifies at what
position within the array do we want to
add or remove items and delete count is
also a required parameter basically this
parameter specifies the number of items
that we want to delete from the given
array object if we set this parameter to
zero then no items will be deleted and
item 1 - item X this parameter is
optional and basically this parameter is
going to specify the new items that we
want to add
Dra so here we have an example we have
three elements 1 comma 2 comma 5 now
what we want to do is you know add 3 &amp;amp; 4
to this array now if you look at the
index position of 2 that is 0 1 index
position of 2 is 1 now at the next
position 2 we want to add two elements
that is 3 comma 4 so the index is going
to be 2 and second parameter is delete
count we don't want to delete any
elements from the array so I am passing
0 there and the third parameter is item
1 2 item X now we want to add 3 &amp;amp; 4 to
this my array object so those are the
items that we want to add and at what
position do we want to add them index
position 2 that is after element 2 we
want to add these two elements 3 comma 4
so what do we get as the output 1 2 3 4
&amp;amp; 5 as you can see here let's look at
another example
now here we know that item 1 2 item X
you know the last parameter that is
optional so we are not using the third
parameter here so if you look at this my
array here we have one two fifty five
sixty seven and three now what I want to
do is remove 55 and 67 from this array
so where is 55 what is the index
position within the array two so that is
the index position where I want to add
or remove elements in this example we
actually want to remove elements
starting from index position two and
from that position how many elements do
we want to remove you want to remove two
elements so it's going to remove 55 and
67 and the result will be 1 comma 2
comma 3 thank you for listening and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
