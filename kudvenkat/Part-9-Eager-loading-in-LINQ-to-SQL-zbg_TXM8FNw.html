tutorial in this video we'll discuss the
concept of eager loading and link to
sequel
this is continuation to part 8 so please
watch part 8 before proceeding
sowhat's eager loading eager loading is
the process way by a query for one type
of entity also loads related entities as
part of the query in link to sequel
there are two ways we can easily load
data we can either use data load options
or projection first let's see how to use
data load options to either load data
let's flip to visual studio this is the
same console application example that we
worked with in the previous video
session at the moment notice that here
the data is lazily loaded first the
department's data is loaded and when we
iterate through the employee entities
belonging to a given department
that's when a subsequent query is issued
to load the related employee entities
and here we have one query to load
departments and three queries to load
the related employee entities so this is
lazy loading now let's see how to turn
this lazy loading into eager loading
we're using data load options this data
load options class is present and system
dot data dot link namespace so let's now
create an instance of data load options
class let's call this load options this
load options class has got load width
method load with Department D such that
d dot employees so basically here we are
telling along with the department
entities also load related employee
entities finally we need to associate
these load options with the data context
object so DB context dot load options
equals load options now let's run the
application now look at this instead of
the four queries we just have one query
now so this one query is going to load
the department and related employee
entity's data note
that there is a left outer join between
employees and departments tables now
let's apply the same logic to our
asp.net web application project as well
now as it is you know when we run the
web application notice that there will
be four queries to load department and
end related employee entities data now
let's paste in the data load options
code so this data load options is
present in system dot data dot linked
namespace so let's bring that in let's
read on the application now we should
have just one query to load both
department and related employee entities
data all right
so one way is to use data load options
the other option is to use projection so
now let's flip to the console
application so instead of using data
load options let's see how to use
projection to either load data so let's
create a variable here let's call this
link very equals from DB T n DB context
dot departments select new so here we
are projecting the data into an
anonymous type so this anonymous type is
going to have a name property and the
value of that property is going to be
the name of the department object and we
are going to end have another property
called employees and that property
equals the employees from the department
object now let's loop through the
results that this query returns now
this query you know is going to return
anonymous types so we can't use
Department or type here so let's change
that to wear right let's go to and run
this now notice that they still have
just one query to load the department
and employee data now let's apply the
same logic to our asp.net web
application project
so let's comment this data load options
code and then instead of binding the
grid view controller to departments
let's use our link very now let's rerun
this and we should still have just one
query to load the department and
employees data so in this video we have
seen how to either load data using data
load options and projection in our next
video we'll discuss the difference
between lazy loading and a loading
that's it for today thank you for
listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
