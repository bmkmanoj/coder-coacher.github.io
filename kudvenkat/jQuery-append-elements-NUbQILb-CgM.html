this video we'll discuss how to append
prepend elements to append elements we
have append or a pen to and to pre
pinned elements we have prepend or
prepend too since all of these methods
modify the Dom they belong to Dom
manipulation category let's understand
these methods one by one with examples
look at the HTML here we've got three
developments and look at this line of
jQuery code look at this selector dollar
there so what is this selector going to
do it's going to return us all these
three developments and on that jQuery
collection object we're calling the
append method and look at what we are
passing is a parameter to the append
method we are passing an HTML structure
as a parameter so this append method is
going to append that content to each of
the developments that this selector is
going to return so when we execute this
line of code on this HTML this is what
is the HTML we get back so look at that
we have the development and to that we
have the content that we have passed as
a parameter to the append method you
know is appended and that happens for
each development so let's look at this
in action let's flip to visual studio so
here we've got those three developments
and if we view this page in the browser
this is how it looks like jQuery c-sharp
asp.net and other three developments are
displayed now let's say we want to
append the word tutorial to all these
three developments and to do that first
we need to find the developments so
dollar dev that's going to give us all
the developments and two that we are
going to append the word tutorial
okay so basically the bold element that
this word tutorial will be appended to
each of the developments because that's
what this selector is going to return
all right so let's save the changes and
when we view the page in the browser
look at that
divert tutorial is appended to all the
developments and let's launch the
developer tools and if you look at the
Dom elements here look at that - the
development this word tutorial is
appended and it happens for all the
three developments so that's the purpose
of a pen method then what is the use of
append to method append to method also
perform the same task if the perform the
same task then what's the difference
between these two methods the main
difference between these two methods is
in the syntax with append method
notice that we first specify the target
elements to which we want to append
something and then we specify the
content that we want to append whereas
with a pen too we first specify the
content that we want to append and then
the target elements to which we want to
append so that's the only difference
between these two methods so let's look
at append to method so with the append
to method we first specify the content
that we want to append so the content
that we want to append is this and then
we call the append to method and then we
specify the target elements so the
target elements are all the developments
so dollar dev
so let's save the changes and when we
reload look at that the output is
exactly the same thing now let's look at
prepending elements to prepend elements
we can either use prepend or prepend -
so now what we want to do is we want to
prep in this word tutorial to each of
the development so we want to find all
the developments and then we are going
to call prepend method and we want to
prepend a bold element with word
tutorial okay so since we are going to
prepend this let's give a space right
here
okay so it will be tutorial jQuery
tutorial c-sharp and tutorial asp.net
with a space in between so let's save
the changes and when we reload this page
look at what we get you know tutorial
jQuery tutorial c-sharp and tutorial
asp.net and if you look at the
developments in the Dom notice that the
bold element that word tutorial is
prepended to each of the developments
and we can also do the same thing using
prepend - again just like a pen and a
pen - with prepend - we first specify
the content that we want to prepend and
then so we have to use this dollar here
otherwise we wouldn't get the jquery
intellisense
so prepend - and we want to peep into
all developments so dollar dev so with
prepend - we specify the content first
and then the target elements to which we
want to prepend so let's save the
changes and when we reload you know we
should have the same output so what's
the difference between prepend and
append method you should have already
realized the difference you know it's
very straightforward prepend method
inserts the specified content to the
beginning of each element in the set of
matched elements whereas
append method inserts the specified
content to the end of each element in
the set of matched elements let's see
how to append existing elements on the
page okay so you know all these methods
append append to pre pin and prepend to
they can select an element on the page
and insert it into another okay so if
you look at the HTML here along with the
three developments we also have a span
element and that the span element has
got an ID my span and the span element
contains this text programming with a
single space and friend okay and look at
the jQuery selector we have here dollar
div so this is going to find all these
developments and then on that we're
calling a pen method and look at what we
are passing as a parameter now we are
passing an existing element as a
parameter so here we are using the ID
selector dollar you know ID selector is
this hash symbol so find element by ID
that is my span and we want to append
that span to each of the div elements so
when we execute this code on this it's
going to append that span element to
each of the developments and this is
what will be the HTML that will be
produced so let's look at this in action
so we've got all the three developments
there so let's include a span element
and let's give it an ID let's call that
in a my span and we are going to have
this word programming with a single
spacing bit of that word and within our
jQuery ready function so we want to find
all the developments and let's use a pen
method so we want to append the span
element to all these developments so
append
now this is an existing element so we
are going to use the ID of this element
so dollar and the ID select in jQuery is
hash so find element by ID and the ID
that we are looking for is my span and
then append that element to each of the
element that the selector is going to
return that's what this basically
so let's save the changes and when we
reload look at what we are going to get
jQuery programming c-sharp programing
asp.net programming and if you look at
these elements in the Dom because that
we have got the development and to each
of the development this pan element is
appended thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
