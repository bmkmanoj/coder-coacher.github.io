name the unit test is very important
make sure the same naming convention is
used for all unit tests a good unit is
named provides all the information about
that test I like Roy a shows naming
strategy for the unit test here it is
unit of work underscore state and the
test under school expected behavior unit
of work is the name of the method being
tested State and the test represent the
input values for the method expected
behavior is what the method returns for
the specified input let's understand
this with an example let's rename this
test underscore divide method to stick
to Roy ourselves naming strategy
according to Ryan or shrubs naming
strategy the first part of the unit
tests name is the unit of work which is
nothing but the name of the method that
we are testing here we are testing the
divide method so unit of work is divide
followed by that underscore and then
state and a test which represents the
input values for the method that we are
testing so if you look at this divide
method right here it has got two input
parameters numerator and denominator and
if you look at the values for those two
parameters both of them are positive
numbers so divide underscore positive
numbers so those are the input parameter
values and the final part of the unit
test name is the expected behavior and
what do you think is going to happen
when we divide two positive numbers we
are going to get positive quotient so
the expected behavior is returns
positive quotient
let's create another unit test let's
actually make a copy of this now let's
divide a positive and a negative number
when we do that we are going to get a
negative quotient so divide positive
numerator and negative denominator what
are we going to get back we are going to
get back negative quotient so the
expected
here is returns negative quotient let's
create one more unit test so let's make
a copy of this method when we divide two
negative numbers what are we going to
get back we are going to get back
positive quotient so divide on the score
negative numbers underscore returns
positive quotient so here we are going
to divide two negative numbers so
numerator is going to be negative
denominator is also going to be negative
we get a positive quotient this unit
test we are passing positive numerator
and negative denominator so numerator is
going to be negative sorry denominator
is going to be negative numerator is
positive and what are we expecting back
we are getting a negative quotient all
right
so now within this calculator test class
we have got three unit tests but look at
the test explorer window we only have
one unit test here for this list to be
updated we will have to build a solution
I'm going to use the keyboard shortcut
control shift B to build a solution as
soon as the build succeeded notice we
have the list updated to run all these
unit tests I'm going to click on this
link run all by just going to run all
the three unit tests so that's the
naming strategy for unit tests so if you
have a method like divide and if you're
dividing two positive numbers you might
have a method name like this divided
underscore positive numbers underscore
returns positive quotient now let's look
at the naming strategy for the test
class so the class that contains our
divide method is calculator so the test
class is usually calculated tests so the
suffix that word test to the same class
name so if you look at the calculator
class here this is present in calculator
dot cs5 and if you look at our unit
testing project the file name is
calculated test notice I have not
pluralized
word test some people like to pluralize
it some people doesn't let's actually
PluralEyes it
so let's rename the file when we rename
the file and when I hit enter look at
this it's prompting me to rename the
class name as well I'm going to click s
so the class name is also calculated
test which makes it makes more sense so
that's the naming strategy for test
classes similar naming strategy for test
projects so if the project name is
calculated library your test project
will be calculator dot library dot tests
so look at the project right here the
project that contains our calculator
class is calculated or to library but
look at the unit test project name I
named it calculator dot test it would
have been more meaningful if I have
named it like calculator dot library dot
tests now since we named the project to
calculate our library test it also makes
more sense to change the namespace name
as well so let's change it to calculator
dot library test the moment we do that
look at that we have caught a
compliation error that's because we are
already within calculator dot the
library name space within which we have
that calculator class so I can simply
remove this calculator dot library from
all the three unit test names and that
should get rid of those compilation
errors let's a build of solution to make
sure the solution still complies and
let's run the unit tests and all of them
succeeds
