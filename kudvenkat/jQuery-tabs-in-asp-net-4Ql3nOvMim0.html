this video we'll discuss how to use
jQuery tabs widget in an asp.net
webforms application so what is tabs
widget it's a single content area with
multiple panels each associated with the
header in a list so here we've got a
header with three tabs in it each tab
has a panel associated with it at the
moment tab one panel is active when we
click on tab to its corresponding panel
is activated similarly when we click on
tab 3 its panel gets activated this tabs
widget is similar to accordion widget
which we discussed in parts 74 and 75 of
this video series to produce this tabs
widget we require two steps the first
step is to write the required HTML and
then the second step is to write
one-liner of jQuery code so look at the
HTML structure here first we have a
container div and we have given this div
an ID ID equals tabs and we have set
this style attribute and set the width
to 400 pixels so that the width of this
widget does not occupy the entire width
of the web form so that's the container
there inside the container there at the
moment we've got unordered lists instead
of unordered lists you can also use
ordered lists so the unordered list
contains three list items so these three
list items represent these three tabs
and notice what we have within the list
item we have an anchor element and
within that anchor element we have the
title of the tab so notice we have tab
one tab to tab three which are displayed
as tabs here and if we look at the
anchor element it also has caught the H
ref attribute and we have set the href
attribute to hash tab one okay so these
three list items within the unordered
list represent the tabs widget headers
okay and these three developments here
they represent the panels that are
associated with each tab header
okay so first div here is the panel four
tab one second div is
the panel for tab two so on and so forth
so the important thing to keep in mind
here is the ID of this div here look at
the ID it is tab one and look at the
value that we have set to the href
attribute hash tab 1 so this ID must be
equal to the hash value here okay
so that way we are timing this
development as the panel to the first
tab so similarly second development is
the panel for second tab because the IDS
match okay so that's the HTML that we
require and we need one liner of jQuery
code so find the container dev the
container div has the ID tabs so find it
using the jQuery ID selector and call
the tabs function so this HTML and this
line of jQuery code is going to produce
this widget I have already typed the
exact HTML and jQuery code here it is so
we have the same HTML that we have seen
on the slide and with our jquery ready
function we are calling the tabs
function on the container development
when we run this it produces this tabs
widget look at this when I click on tab
1 the panel is activated this is tab 2 +
tab tree alright so at the moment the
content is present at design time its
static content on the page so it's very
simple to produce this you know perhaps
widget but what if we have the data in a
database table so we've got countries
table here but the ID name and
description columns and what we want to
do is produce this tabs widget in
asp.net webforms application using this
database data ok the tab headers should
be the name of the countries and the
panels should have the country
description ok so let's see how to
achieve this let's flip to visual studio
so this is the same example that we
worked with in the previous video
session we already have a web service
which retrieves the country data from
the database table we also have added a
service reference to that web service so
I'm going to add a web form to this
project
and the first thing that we need to do
is produce you know this kind of an HTML
so the first thing that we need is a
container div so we already have a
development here let's give it an ID
let's set that to tabs and let's also
set the width of this to 600 pixels all
right
so within the development what do we
need we need an unordered list so I'm
going to include that here unordered
list and within that we need to generate
a list item for every row that we
retrieved from the database table we can
do it two ways we can write the jQuery
code to produce this HTML we can also
write and use the asp.net repeater
control to do that for us that way that
code will be much cleaner so I'm
actually going to drag and drop the
repeater control so this repeater
control is going to generate the list
items okay and then we are going to use
another repeater control to generate
these developments so outside of the
list item I am going to drag and drop
another repeater control okay so we have
two repeater controls here now we'll
come back to this HTML in just a bit now
let's go to the code-behind file call
the web service let leave the country
data and bind it to repeat a1 and
repeater - so let's flip to the
code-behind file so the namespace within
which our service is present is services
so services dot we have the country
service soap client let's create an
instance of that so that's our proxy
class client dot get countries so that
is actually returning you know an array
of country objects services dot country
okay so let's go ahead and store that in
a variable services dot country so we
are going to get an array let's create a
variable of type array so this variable
now contains the country's data now I'm
going to use that as the data source
both for repeater 1 and repeater 2 so
repeater one data source equals
countries and repeat a 1 dot data bind
similarly we need to bind the data to
repeat a to control so let's make a copy
of this and change the IDs
okay so we have binded the database data
to both these repeater controls now
within repeat of one I'm going to use
item template now we already have the
unordered list here after that what do
we need we need a list item so inside
that unordered list for every row in the
database we need a list item so I'm
going to hard-code the list item as well
here okay and within list item we need
anchors element so let's include enter
element and anchor element should have
the href attribute set to hash and we
need to generate an ID here so at the
moment within the database table we have
got 4 rows ok so for each row we should
say generate a list item like this and
we should set HTF attribute to a unique
ID okay now we can use this ID column
but the problem that that is that it's
an integer but if you look at the IDs of
HTML elements they cannot start with a
number they have to start with a letter
ok so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to use letter C underscore and then
append the integer ID that we get from
the database okay 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
okay and we have to bind the integer
value so I'm going to use the data
binding function which is eval so angle
brackets percentage hash I'm going to
call the eval function and we want to
bind the ID value ID column value so for
the first list item it's going to be C
underscore 1 for the second list item
it's going to be C underscore 2 so on
and so forth so that's our anchor
element so let's go ahead and close that
and what do we want as the header we
want the name of the country as the
header right just like how we have tab 1
as the header here in our example we
want this country name to be the header
okay so here I'm going to again use the
eval function angle back it's percentage
hash eval and we want to bind whatever
value we have in the name column that's
going to return us the country name so
this piece of code is going to generate
you know the unordered list with all the
list items okay next we want to generate
the developments so we have another
repeater for that so within this
repeater again let's go ahead and use
the item template and what do we need we
need a development and the ID must match
with what we have set in the href
attribute okay so we want a div element
and we want an ID for that and ID just
like yeah within the href attribute it
should start with C underscore and then
the actual ID value from the DB so I can
actually copy this entire thing and
paste it right here so what are we going
to get C underscore one two three
depending on the row that we are
currently looping over okay so here is
the double quote beginning this is
ending here so let's go ahead and close
the development and within the body of
the development what we need we need to
include the panel content and the panel
content should be the country
description so I'm going to use eval
function one more time so angle brackets
percentage hash eval and we want to bind
this to country description
okay that's it so the first repeater is
going to generate us the unordered list
with the list items and the second
repeater is going to generate us the div
elements okay and that's as far as HTML
is concerned within our head section we
need to include the required jQuery and
CSS files and call the tabs function so
we need the jQuery itself we need jQuery
UI CSS we need jQuery UI javascript and
let's include another scripts section
here so dollar document dot ready
finally container dev so what is the
container David has called this ID tabs
so let's use the jQuery ID selector find
that using the ID tabs and on that let's
call the tabs function right so let's go
and save the changes and let's run this
so country names should be the headers
with that we have India US UK and Canada
at the moment India panel is active and
when we click on us we get its panel
activated similarly UK and Canada
so here we have the HTML and the jQuery
code we are using two repeater controls
to produce the HTML that the jQuery tabs
widget expects now here within the
jQuery code
we also specified couple of options
let's actually discuss these options in
detail
so here we have the code-behind file and
here are the options these options are
similar to jQuery accordion widget so
the first option here is collapsible now
this is similar to jQuery accordion
widget by default at least one panel
need to be active if you want to
collapse all the panels including the
one that is currently active then set
this option to true now at the moment
with in this example we didn't set any
options active I mean we didn't set any
options so look at this when I click on
this panel that is active nothing
happens now if you want to collapse it
then you'll have to set collapsible to
true so let's go ahead and do that so
let's set collapsible to true save the
changes let's go ahead and reload this
and look at this now when I click on
this the panel is collapsed
okay now let's look at active now this
option can be set to a boolean value or
an integer value now if you set this to
a boolean false then it's going to
collapse all panels now look at this
when we load this page by default you
know it shows the first panel okay now
you know when the web page loads you
will want all the panels to be collapsed
then set active to false
just like accordion so let's go ahead
and set this to false save the changes
reload this page look at this you know
we have all the panel's collapsed and
when we click on that the panel gets
activated you can also sad you know this
option to an integer for example if I
set it to one the corresponding panel
gets activated so let's save the changes
reload this page and look at
what's going to happen look at that
United States panelist actor here why is
that why is not the first panel active
that's because you know these panels use
zero based index so India is at zero
index the United States is at first
index UK is at second index since we
have set active to one you know it
activated United States and the last
option that is particularly useful is
event at the moment to activate the
panels we are using click event but if
you want you know to activate the panels
using mouse over event then use event
option the default is cleared so if I
specify the event option and I'm going
to set that to mouse over let's save the
changes look at this let's reload this
now this is going to react to mouse over
event look at this when I mouse over
Canada that panel is activated on Mouse
out and mouse over you know since we
have said collapsible to true you know
it collapses it when I mouse over on it
again
thank you for listening and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
