this video we'll discuss what is a
Windows servers and how do they differ
from regular applications and programs
how to view all the windows services
installed on a Windows machine
what is the use of Windows services and
when would an asp.net developer use a
Windows service so what is a Windows
service and how do they differ from
regular applications and programs a
Windows service is similar to any other
program or an application running on a
Windows machine these are some of the
differences between a Windows service
and a regular application windows
services are run in the background they
can be configured to start automatically
when the system starts and they don't
have any sort of user interface for
example if you look at this calculator
application this has got a user
interface you know we can click on these
buttons and perform some calculations
but if you look at a vendor service it
doesn't have any sort of user interface
and they always run in the background
and they Windows services can also be
configured to start automatically when
the system boots up ok so the next
question is how do we actually view all
the windows services that are installed
on my computer you know that's very
simple all you need to do is click on
start type run and then plus Enter so
that should bring up the run window
within run window type services dot MSE
and click OK so this should open up the
services window which is going to list
all the windows services that are
basically installed on this computer ok
now what is the use of these windows
services you know these windows services
provide core operating system features
such as for example even logging
providing security error reporting and
these are the respective windows
services which provide these features so
they should be Windows Event log service
which provides event logging so if you
look at the services here so notice that
we have Windows Event log Windows
Firewall service which is going to
provide the internet security and
have been dose error reporting service
which is basically going to report
errors okay and there are several other
services as well which provides you know
different features that are required for
the operating system and most of these
services are installed by Microsoft now
sometimes when we download and install a
third-party software even you know those
software may install some services
automatically and those services may
provide the features that are required
by the application that you are
installing ok so basically these windows
services they run in the background you
know they don't have any sort of user
interface and they can be configured to
start automatically so how do we
configure these windows services to
start automatically
you know let's say for example we want
this Windows Firewall service to start
automatically all we need to do is right
click on that get to the properties
window and on the general tab look at
the startup type for this Windows
Firewall service the startup type is set
to automatic so when the system boots up
you know this service is going to be
started automatically on system you know
boot up so if you look at the status
here look at this Windows Firewall
is already started because the startup
type is automatic on the other hand if
we choose the startup type as manual you
know this service will not be started
automatically we have to manually start
the service for example if you look at
this Windows card space service the
startup type is manual so this is not
going to be started up automatically
when the system starts we need to
right-click on that and select this
option start ok similarly if you want to
stop the service right click on the
service and then select stop from the
context menu in fact you can also
specify you know what is the security
identity under which you want to you
know basically execute this particular
service you you want to start the
service if you look at this service here
when those event log it's using local
service user account and then you can
also specify what you want this service
to do on failure you know the the
service fails to start what you want to
do you want to restart the service
run a different program or restart the
computer itself or you don't want to
take any action and that's the default
option okay so these are the windows
services now the obvious next question
is when would a dotnet developer or an
asp.net developer use event or service
in general we should create a Windows
service to run code in the background
all the time without any sort of user
interaction so obviously when we said
you know the startup type for a Windows
Services automatic you know when we boot
up the computer the service is going to
start automatically
even without a user actually logging
onto that machine on Windows startup the
service is going to start automatically
so if at all if there is a need for you
you know to execute code in the
background all the time
without any sort of user interface
intervention that's when we actually
create a vendor service okay so for
example what we can do is we can create
a vendor service to host it WCF servers
and then we can configure the windows
service to start automatically when the
computer starts so this is going to make
our WCF service always available for
clients to consume even if no one is
logged on on that computer in our next
video we'll discuss creating a Windows
service to host a WCF service that's it
for today thank you for listening have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
