venket this is part 16 of asp.net MVC
tutorial in this video we'll discuss the
difference between update model and try
update model function please watch part
15 before proceeding with this video
let's flip to visual studio this is the
code that we have been working with in
part 15 let's make a simple change to
this create post controller action
method with an employee controller now I
want to move this condition from there
to here
and let's format this code properly and
to do that select the code and plus ctrl
K Day so what are we doing here so after
we you know invoke this update model
function we are checking the model state
okay let's quickly run this with this
change and let's navigate to employee
create controller action method
okay now let's not fill any data and
then press this create button and let's
see what's going to happen now look at
the change that we made you know we are
creating a new employee object and then
we are invoking this update model method
which is going to you know update that
model object for us with the data that
we are posting here now look at this we
are not filling any data here okay so
when I click this button look at what's
going to happen now we get an error it
says the model of type business layer
dot employee could not be updated and
that is because if you look at the
employee class you know look at this to
the employee object we are binding the
data so if you look at the employee
class here this date of birth is of type
date time and date time if I right-click
on that and go to definition look at
this date time is actually structure
meaning it's a value type and it's a non
nullable value type okay and then when
we submit the form without filling any
data date of birth will be now okay and
this property of the employee object you
know date of birth is non nullable
property okay meaning we cannot assign a
null value so that's the reason why it's
crashing so let's make it nullable
daytime datatype just by adding a
question mark we discussed about
nullable datatypes in c-sharp video
tutorial
okay so with this change let's go ahead
and run this application once again and
let's navigate to employee controller
create action method and again without
filling any data let me go ahead and
click on this create button look at this
we get a different error now you know it
says procedure function SP add employee
expects a parameter at name which was
not supplied now if you remember we have
a stored procedure so SP underscore
health text and the name of the stored
procedure is SP add employee so this the
stored procedure that gets called and
then it's complaining that the stood
procedure has got a parameter at name
and for that parameter we are not
supplying a value okay why is that
because if you look at the parameters of
the stored procedure here all of them
are required parameters okay
since we are passing look at this if I
don't fill any data and then submit this
form we are passing a value of now and
that's why the stored procedure is
complaining that I don't have a value
for that parameter okay to make these
parameters optional all I'm doing here
is you know setting them to now let's do
that for all of the parameters name
gender City and date of birth and then
let's alter the stored procedure press
f5 so command completed successfully now
let's go ahead and run this once again
let's navigate to employee controller
create action method and then let's
submit the form without filling any data
again now look at this I get another
error object cannot be cast from D be
null to other types and look at where
I'm getting the error we have the error
in employee business layer dot CS file
in at line number 34 so let's see what
we have at line number 34 in employee
business layer dot cs5 so if I press
ctrl-g and then you know go to line 34
look at this this is the line and and
and look at this when does this property
get executed when we try to load
you know the employees from TBL employee
table because what actually happened
there is you know let me actually select
the data from the table and look at that
you know we have a new row inserted into
this table and look at name gender City
date of birth all of them are now so
when we actually submitted and we
actually submitted this form you know
the insert has actually happened but it
inserted a blank row why because we
didn't fill any of the data here but
then after we you know perform the
insert
what is this controller action method
doing it's redirecting the user back to
the index meta
index action and what does index action
do index action is actually retrieving
all the employees from the database
table and then trying to display them in
this index view but then when we try to
retrieve employees you know look at what
we are doing you're executing this SPG
at all employees stored procedure which
is going to retrieve all of the
employees and then we are looking
through each row and then converting you
know assigning name to name gender to
gender city to city and look at this we
are assigning date of birth to date of
birth but we need to convert that to
date time why is that because you know
when you use the string in the excel to
retrieve date of birth out of this
reader object you know you're converting
by default it's object type but we need
to cast that to date time before we
assign it to this date of birth property
okay so when we are doing this
conversion you know this date of birth
is actually not and we are using convert
to data to date/time function so you
cannot convert a null object to
date/time so that throws an exception
okay so how do we correct this error
it's very easy to fix this error so
obviously what what is the error say let
me click on create once again look at
that you know again the same error but
we should have another blank row
inserted into the database table look at
that now and what does the error say it
says object cannot be cast from D be
null to other types so here you know
this is returning DB now so all we need
to do check you know before we execute
the slide
if it's DB now if it's not DB null then
go ahead and convert that otherwise
don't do that and to do that I am going
to copy this if Rd R of date of birth is
DB now and for that entire expression
I'm going to use and not condition so if
it's not DB null only then go ahead and
try to do the conversion okay with this
chain let's go ahead and run this let's
navigate to create action let's click on
this button look at that I have you know
the third blank row is inserted and then
we have this blank you know name gender
City date of birth now let's say you
know I want name gender City and date of
birth all of these properties of the
employee object to be mandatory because
I don't want nulls for any of them to be
stored in the database so how do we do
that it's very easy to do all you need
to do is decorate you know the
properties of this employee model object
this is what we are using as the model
object you know in MVC so I want name
gender City and date of birth to be
required fields if that is the case all
you need to do is decorate these
properties with required attribute well
this is more about model in our data
annotations and these attributes in a
later video session in detail but for
now understand that to make is you know
particular field as required all we need
to do is decorate that with required
attribute and this required attribute is
present in you know system dot entity
framework
entity framework assembly so we need to
add a reference to entity framework
assembly within this business layer
project now we already have a reference
to entity framework assembly in our you
know MVC web application but not in the
business layer project so we need to add
a reference to that and to do that we
can make use of the new get package
manager so go to tools
and then select tribe library package
manager manage NuGet packages for
solution and within that check for you
know whatever packages that are
installed on this you know for the
solution so it's still retrieving that
information so we have entity framework
which is already installed so let's go
to you know installed packages which
should say you know entity framework is
already installed but then look at this
I have this option here manage so let me
click on that button and at the moment a
reference to entity framework is only
added to MVC demo which is our MVC web
application but not business layer so
I'm going to select that project and
then click on ok so that should add a
reference to entity framework you know
from our business layer project as well
alright so that should be done now
so click on close so we have entity
framework there now this required
attribute class is actually present in a
different namespace so let's go ahead
and import that system dot component
model dot data annotations and then
let's say I want to make name you know a
required field so I'm just using a
required attribute there along the same
lines I want to make gender also
required city required and date of birth
required ok so with this change let's go
ahead and run this and see what's going
to happen so at the moment in the
database table view we have three blank
rows and let's navigate to employee
controller create action let's click on
this button look at that the model of
type business layer dot employee could
not be updated and notice where we are
getting the exception we are getting the
exception when this method is invoked
update model okay now remember we have
made name gender city and date of birth
fields of this employee object mandatory
by decorating that with required
attribute so obviously when this update
model is called you know it inspected
the incoming values from the request and
obviously they are null and update model
throws an exception when there are model
validation errors now instead of using
update model
go ahead and use try update model and
see what's going to happen so all I'm
going to do here is instead of using
update model I'm going to use try update
model and let's run this now and see
what's the behavior so now I want to
navigate to employee controller create
action method click on create button
notice that I get the messages here the
name field is required the gender field
is required city is required date of
birth is required okay so now I don't
get an exception so that's the primary
difference between update model and try
update model so update model throws an
exception if validation fails whereas
try update model will never throw an
exception and another thing to
understand here look at this this try
update model actually returns a boolean
you know meaning true or false if it is
successful in updating the model it
returns true if it is unsuccessful it
will return false you know when it tried
to when it tries to update the model and
if there are any validation errors you
know this is valid property of this
model state object is going to return
false as well so in which case if Trey
turns false we know that this piece of
sport will not be executed and look at
what we are doing we are executing this
line this line gets executed returned
view so the end user stays on the same
page and then he has the opportunity to
correct these validation errors and then
resubmit the form okay so now for
example if I enter some data there let's
say a male CTL and data but let's say
for example that one and click on create
look at that
you know the Ruiz inserted as expected
okay now so that's the difference
between update model and try update
model the similarities both of these
functions are used to update the model
with the form values and perform the
validations okay now is it mandatory to
use update model a try update model
function to update the model no the
answer is obviously no because in the
previous sessions we have seen you know
how to achieve the same behavior now I
can simply pass an employee object here
instead of creating my employee object
and then using my you know using this
try update model or update model
functions I can simply pass employee
object as a parameter to this controller
action method and look at this I am
checking model state is valid so
obviously this object is going to
receive the posted form data and then if
there are any validation errors
you know this model state you know is
valid property of this model state will
return false and then the user stays on
the same page and the user get to see
the validation failures let's go and run
this and see if it's going to work as
expected so if I navigate to employee
create I don't feel any data click on
create look at that the behavior is
exactly the same but now we are not
using update model try update model you
know but still it works the same way all
right now so obviously the next question
is so if you if if we can achieve the
same thing without using update model or
try update model then why do we need to
explicitly in work model binding you
know by calling these methods what's the
need what do we achieve by doing so so
if we want to limit on what can be bound
then explicitly invoking model binding
can be very useful okay if this is
confusing at the moment don't worry
we'll be talking about this in a later
video session in detail on the slide you
can find resources for a speed or nets
in sharpens equal so in two big
questions that's it for today thank you
for listening have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
