this video we'll discuss what is
document already function and when to
use it and the difference between window
dot load and document already functions
document dot ready is a jQuery event it
fires as soon as the Dom is fully loaded
and ready to be manipulated by script
this is the earliest point in the page
load process where this grip can safely
access elements in the HTML Dom this
event is fired before all the images CSS
frames etc are fully loaded on the page
the example that we see here is the same
example that we worked with in part one
of this video series so let's flip to
visual studio so the code that we have
here basically this is trying to find an
element with ID button 1 and attach a
click event handler to it and inside the
click event handler we are displaying
this alert message so basically this
piece of code is wrapped inside this
document already function so what is
this document or Teddy function going to
do this is going to ensure that by the
time this piece of code is executed the
browser Dom is fully loaded what do we
mean by that but that we mean you know
by the time this piece of code is
executed all the HTML elements that are
present on this page are loaded into the
browser document object model so this
script can find the element with ID
button 1 and attach the click event
handler to it so at this point when we
click this button we should get the
alert as expected now what do you think
is going to happen if we remove this
document dot ready function okay so at
the moment we don't have this code
present inside document already and if
you look at the script element the
script element is present before the
HTML button element so by the time the
script is executed this HTML element is
not loaded into the browser Dom so the
script will not be able to find the
button control with ID button 1 and as a
result it won't be able to attach the
click event handler and because of that
when we save these changes and when we
reload the page and when we click the
button notice we don't get the alert as
expected right that's because by the
time the script is executed this button
is not loaded into the browser Dom so
the script is not able to find that
button and attach the click event
handler to it so how can we solve it
there are two ways one way we have
already seen it you know wrap the code
inside document dot ready function what
is document or credit function going to
do it's going to ensure that by the time
the script that is present inside
document or ready function is executed
the browser Dom is fully loaded so the
script can find the elements that it is
looking for and do whatever it has to do
so that's one option
the other option is to place the script
element at the bottom of the page just
before the closing body element okay so
now the script is present you know at
the bottom of the page just before the
closing body element so this script is
present after the HTML button element so
by the time the script is executed the
button is loaded into the browser Dom
meaning the script can find it and
attach the click event handler to it so
at this point if we save these changes
reload the page and then once we click
this button we should get the alert
there we go when you dot load when you
dot load even fires when the Dom as well
as all the content on the page images
CSS frames etc are fully loaded
since the window load event waits for
images CSS etc to be fully loaded this
event fires after ready event when is
the ready event fire you know ready
event fires as soon as the Dom is loaded
it does not wait for images CSS frames
etc to be fully loaded on the page so
you know ready event fires much before
window dot load event actually let's
prove that with an example so let's get
rid of this HTML button element we don't
need it anymore so let's cut the script
element and move it to the
at section and within the head section
dollar actually let's use the vendor
object first window dot load so when
they load even fires we want to execute
a function and when the inventory mate
is fired we want to display in our
vendor loaded message using JavaScript
alert okay
similarly when document dot ready event
is fired we want to display this message
Dom loaded okay notice first we have
vendor load and then we have document
document ready okay so that's the order
but then we know that ready event fires
much before window dot load window dot
load will wait for all the images CSS
flames etc to be loaded
whereas ready event fires immediately
after the browser Dom is loaded so when
we save these changes and when we
refresh this page we expect Dom loaded
message first and then when door loaded
in most cases the script can be run as
soon as the Dom hierarchy has been fully
constructed so ready is usually the best
place to write your JavaScript code
however in your application there could
be scenarios where you should be using
window dot load over document or ready
and here is one such example let's say
we want to get the actual image
dimensions that is height and wealth now
if we have to get the actual image
height and width then we will have to
wait until the image is fully loaded so
the jQuery code to get the height and
width should be in window dot load even
handler so let's look at an example of
that I already have an image here so
let's copy this image and paste it
within our application
so let's drag and drop this image within
the body section and let in our head
section we are going to write the script
to get the height and width but let's
also include a div element here to
display our height and width and let's
give it an ID let's call it div 1 and
let's give an ID to the image let's call
it IMG 1 so within our script dollar
vendo dot load we want to execute a
function and basically here we are going
to find an element with ID div 1 and ID
selector in jquery's hash so I'm going
to use hash so basically this hash is
telling you know find an element within
this page by ID that is document dot get
element by ID div 1 will talk about
selectors in detail in our upcoming
video session so find that div and set
the HTML okay so what do we want to
display within the div we want to
display height so it height equals now
we want to get the image height so I'm
going to use the ID selector again which
is the hash symbol so dollar hash and
the ID of the image element is IMG one
so basically we are saying document dot
get element by ID image 1 and give me
its height okay and then to that lets
append HTML break and then we want hi
our width so with equals the same thing
find an element with image 1 ID and
then get its width and to get the width
we use width function right so with all
these changes let's reload the page and
look at this as soon as the image is
loaded we get the height and width of
the image those are the actual
dimensions now what do you think is
going to happen if I use document dot
ready
instead of window dot load let's see
that so document dot ready let's save
these changes and let's reload the page
look at that it displays height as 0 and
width or 0 why is that by the time
document dot ready event is fired you
know this event is not going to wait
until all the images and CSS are loaded
ok so by the time this piece of code is
executed the image is not loaded with in
this image element so that's why it
reads the height and width as zero okay
but whereas if we change that back to
vendor dot load so this even is fired
after all the images are loaded so it's
able to get the actual height in wet
so now when we save this we should get
the actual height and well thank you for
listening and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
