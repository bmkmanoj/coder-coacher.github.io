this video we'll discuss how to check or
uncheck all check boxes with another
single check box using jQuery we'll be
working with the example that we started
in part 65 so please watch but 65 from
the asp.net MVC tutorial before
proceeding with this video notice that
at the moment when we navigate to the
index view we don't have a check box
within the header so if I have to select
all of these rules then I have to
individually select each check box just
imagine how much time it's going to take
if I have 50 rows within this table so
we want to provide a check box within
the header and then if I select that
check box we want all the other check
boxes to be automatically selected if I
deselect the check box in the header
then automatically the rest of the check
box it should also be deselected let's
see how to achieve this using jQuery so
the first step is to reference the
jQuery script file now at the moment if
you notice our MVC demo project we don't
have a script for app folder here and we
don't have the jQuery script file now if
you create an asp.net MVC for
application using Internet application
template then you would get that
automatically let me explain what I mean
so here I have fired up visual studio
now let's say I'm creating a new project
so file new project and then let's help
a speed on an MVC for web application
and once I click OK then we have a
template here now when we create an MVC
demo project we have chosen empty
template that's the reason why we don't
have scripts folder within this project
but then if you select Internet
applications and click OK that would
create an MVC application like this and
look at that we have a scripts folder
there and then we have several jQuery
files and a jQuery file that we are
interested in here is this jQuery -
1.7.1 dot min dot GS so this is the
minified version of the jQuery file so
that's what we need
so let's navigate to that folder and it
is
Windows Explorer and to do that simply
right-click on the scripts folder open
folder in Windows Explorer copy that
script file and then let's go back to
our MVC demo project and let's create a
folder here let's call it scripts and
then let's paste the script there okay
so we have the jQuery script file the
next step is to reference that script
file within our view okay so let's drag
and drop the script file okay now look
at this it uses this index when we drag
and drop that but we know this script
folder is present within the root
directory of the web application project
so what I'm going to do is instead of
using this I'm going to use the tilde
character till indicates the root
directory within that we have got
scripts folder and within that we have
the jQuery file alright so now let's
write the jQuery so let's use a script
tag specify the type as text slash
JavaScript and the language is
JavaScript
okay so within the opening and closing
tag of the script you know we are going
to write our jQuery and so let's start
writing ta query
dollar dollar indicates jQuery so we are
going to write a function so let's close
that alright so what do we want to do
now for the first thing is at the moment
we don't have a check box within the
header so let's go ahead and include a
check box so this is the text that is
displayed at the moment instead of that
we need a check box so input type is
equal to check box and then let's give
it an ID and let's call it check all
because we're going to use that for that
purpose okay so with these changes let's
refresh this view and the Select X
should be replaced with a check box now
when I click this all the check boxes
should be selected if I deselect this
all the check boxes should be deselected
so what is driving the selection or D
selection clicking on this check box in
the header of
so when we click that checkbox then we
have to you know do something so first
of all you know for the click event
handler we need to write the JavaScript
in order to fire the click event
basically we need to identify that
checkbox control and how do we identify
the checkbox control using its ID check
all and find that we use dollar so we
want to find this checkbox by its ID so
I'm going to use the pound symbol the
hash symbol hash and then what is the ID
of the checkbox it is check all okay so
once we have the checkbox you know once
somebody clicked on it then we want to
write another function okay so what
should happen when we click on that
check all checkbox basically you know
the rest of the checkboxes should be
selected if that is selected if if that
is deselected then they should be
deselected okay so what we are going to
do now is find the ID of the rest of the
checkboxes okay so what is the idea of
the rest of the checkboxes that checkbox
is present right here so the ID is
employee IDs to delete and the name is
also the same thing now to find these
checkboxes I'm going to use the name
instead of ID because if we use the ID
selector we're just going to get one
check box with that ID but we know that
all the check boxes you know in these
rows have the same ID and same name so
we basically want to find them by name
if we want to retrieve all of those
check boxes so that's what I'm going to
do now okay and how do we find them by
name
so again dollar so check box is an input
element so input and what is the name of
that so I'm using this name of filter so
find an input element with the name
whatever is the name so
what is the name of our checkbox
employee IDs to delete so take that and
paste it right there
so find all the checkboxes we just got
that name and then what we need to do
with those checkboxes we need to set an
attribute on that checkboxes what
attribute do we need to set the checked
attribute now one thing to keep in mind
is you know when you check this this
checkbox has an attribute just like how
it has got ID name it has an attribute
called checked so if that attribute is
set to check then that will be selected
okay otherwise it will not be selected
okay so let's set the attribute using
attr function and we want to set the
checked attribute now do we want to set
this to check that unchecked you know
that depends on the state of the check
box that we have in the header if it is
selected then these should be selected
if it is unchecked then these should be
unchecked so the selection of these
check boxes depends on the state of the
check box in the header so this checked
attribute value should be depending on
the check the status off you know we are
saying this dot checked so what does
that mean which what is this referring
to this is referring to the check box on
which you are clicking so what is the
check box that we are clicking on the
check all check box that is in the
header so if it is checked then set the
data beaut to checked if it is unchecked
set it to unchecked
it's as simple as that all right so
let's put a semicolon there save
everything let's go and refresh overview
and see if it's going to work as
expected so let me select this look at
that all the check boxes are selected if
I unselect that all of them are
unselected now look at this we have
everything selected now if I unselect
one of the check box then the check box
within the header should be
automatically unchecked similarly if I
don't have any of them checked and then
I start to check each one of them and
when I reach this point you know I have
only this check box to be checked
if I check this then the checkbox in the
header should also be automatically
selected let's see how to achieve that
now where is the clicker happening now
on the checkboxes within the data rows
okay so when somebody clicks those
checkboxes depending on whether if all
these check boxes are checked you know
if that's the case then we need to have
the header checkbox checked otherwise
don't check it so let's go ahead and
write the code so that all right
so find all the checkboxes which has got
this name okay
and the length so the number of those
checkboxes basically even before that
when we click on any of the checkboxes
which have which has got this name then
what should happen
we should execute some JavaScript okay
so what should happen at that point of
time I'm going to find all these
checkboxes so I'm going to get the count
of all those checkboxes with that name
okay so if or if the count of checkboxes
with that name
is equal to
so what are we doing here if the count
of all the check boxes we have got this
name okay if that is equal to the count
of all these check boxes with that name
that are checked then what should happen
check all check box should be selected
okay so what are we going to do
we are going to take this one and then
set the attr I mean check the attribute
using a TDR function so set check the
status to check it's as simple as that
so let's go ahead and refresh this view
and see if it's going to work so now if
I start to check look at that at this
point the length of check boxes which
has got that name doesn't match with the
same set of check boxes that I checked
so the moment I check this look at
what's going to happen that is selected
but then if I uncheck any one of this
now the uncheck is not happening in the
head that should happen as well and when
that should happen in the end spot it's
as simple as that okay so what should
happen at that point of time we want to
remove so if everything is selected and
if I unselect at least one of them then
the count is not going to match in which
case we want to remove this checked
attribute of the header okay so we are
going to take this one and simply say
remove attribute and which attribute do
we want to remove check the attribute
all right so let's save that let's go in
and refresh this view and see if it
works look at that the moment I uncheck
this look at that that goes away and the
moment I select this it comes back and
then if I uncheck that all of them gets
hand checked so we have the full
functionality there now another thing
that I want this look at that at the
moment I don't have any client-side
confirme
so if I select the checkbox here and
then click delete selected employee
that's going to delete that role now I
don't want that before we actually
delete the row we want a confirmation
box like this okay so if I don't select
any of the rules and then click that
delete selected employees then we should
cancel we should show a confirmation no
rule selected to delete and once I click
OK nothing should happen on the other
hand if I have a few of the rows
selected and then once I click delete
selected employees depending on how many
rows are selected we should display this
message four rows will be deleted if I
click OK the form should be posted to
the server and the rule should be
deleted on the other hand if I click
cancer then the form should not be
posted and no rule should be deleted
let's see have to achieve this again
this is going to be very simple and
straightforward
all right so how are we going to achieve
this now we need to find the rows count
okay so how do we find the row count
depending on you know how many of these
check boxes in the data row are selected
we are going to find the number of rows
that we want to delete okay so how do we
get access to those checked simply use
this expression that's going to give you
you know basically the number of check
boxes that are checked okay but then
when should that piece of code get
executed whenever we click the delete
selected employees button so on the
click of that button on the client side
that's when we need to execute you know
the function that we are going to write
so first of all let's include an ID for
that submit button at the moment it
doesn't have an ID so let's give it an
ID and let's call it B BTN submit
alright so let's take that and then go
back here and write the jQuery so dollar
and then we want to find the element by
ID and if that's the case we use the ID
selector which is hash symbol and then
the ID of the element is butt
bTW and submit then when somebody clicks
on that what should we do we should
write a function okay so what should we
do we should find the check boxes that
are checked and I'm going to use a
variable here a JavaScript variable
count and we are going to initialize to
that one if that count is zero so if the
count is zero then what should happen we
should get an alert box like this new
rule selected to delete okay and then it
should just have that okay button so we
use the alert JavaScript function so
alert and then we will simply say no
rules selected to delete and this alert
box will just display okay button it
will not have okay and cancel all right
and then we don't want the form to be
submitted to the server so we want to
return false okay because there is
nothing to delete so there's no point in
point in posting the form to the server
all right okay on the other hand if the
count is not zero then what should
happen we want to display this message
number of rows will be deleted okay so
how do we get access to the number of
rows now basically to get okay and
cancel buttons then we need to show a
confirmation box and to show a
confirmation box in JavaScript we use
confirm function so return confirm and
then what is the message what are the
rows number of rows is present in this
variable so count class
Rose will be deleted
okay so depending on which button you
have clicked if you have clicked on the
okay button this confirm function is
going to return true if you have clicked
on the cancel button then it is going to
return false if it returns false the
form will not be posted to the server
okay so let's go ahead save everything
and let's refresh this view and see if
it's going to work so I don't have
anything selected I click this button
look at that no roof selected to delete
I click OK the form is not posted to the
server nothing happens on the other hand
I select one row delete selected
employees look at that I get one row
will be deleted if I click cancer the
form will be the form will not be posted
to the server and nothing happens on the
other hand if I click OK the form will
be posted to the server that Row is
deleted so if you select all the rows
click that so two rows will be deleted
click answer nothing happens
alright now we have seen you know how to
reference a script file you know from
the local folder here so I have the
script file here and then we have
referenced that in our application now
Microsoft Google jQuery all of these
have actually hosted the jQuery file for
us on their website so if you don't want
to have a local copy of the jQuery file
on your web server instead if you want
to reference them from those servers you
can do that as well so instead of you
know having a script file here and then
referencing that in my application what
I can do is I can have that URL so here
basically I'm using the Google version
ok
so I can have that URL and then set that
as the source instead of referencing it
from our local folder ok so since I am
referring it from Google I can get rid
of the scripts folder altogether
ok I don't need that any longer so I
saved this i refresh the sphere and the
application should continue to work in
the same way look at that I select that
you know the jQuery is working ok so
basically now we are referencing the
jQuery
that specific site in this case from
Google site all right on this slide you
