this video well disc is creating an
accordion with arrows notice within the
accordion here we've got upward and
downward pointing arrows now we want to
display an upward pointing arrow here
indicating that if we click on it again
the panel body is going to be collapsed
and here since the panel body is
collapsed we have got a downward
pointing arrow indicating that if we
click on it again it's going to expand
the panel body let's see how to include
these arrows to get the arrows we are
going to make use of glyph icons so to
get the upward pointing arrow we are
going to use this cliff icon and to get
the downward pointing arrow this cliff
icon now if you notice where we want
these cliff icons we want them just
before the panel heading so before the
panel heading within the HTML I'm going
to include a span element and the class
for this is going to be the name of the
cliff icon so the glyph icon that we are
going to make use of is cliff icon menu
up so at the moment the first panel body
is already expanded so when it is
already expanded we want to display an
upward pointing arrow indicating that if
we click on it again it's going to
collapse the panel body and to get the
upward pointing arrow this is the cliff
icon that we are going to use on the
rest of the panels since they are
collapsed by default on the initial page
load we want to display the downward
pointing arrows so let's make a copy of
this panel element and use it on the
other panel headings so this panel is
collapsed at the moment so we want to
use menu down and then let's do the same
thing on the other panel heading that we
have let's save our changes now when we
reload this page we should get the glyph
icons next to the panel headings but at
the moment look at this when I collapse
it the icon doesn't change ok they are
static at the moment we want them to be
dynamic if we expand them you know we
want
the arrow to automatically change to
upward pointing arrow indicating that if
we click on that it's going to collapse
it when I collapse it it should
automatically change to a downward
pointing arrow now let's see how to get
that in action now we have to write some
JavaScript to achieve that so let's flip
to visual studio and let's scroll all
the way down and write the required
jQuery code so what I'm going to do here
is find an element that has got collapse
class okay and then I am going to handle
shown dot B s dot collapse event so when
this event is raised we want to handle
that so when is this even traced this
event is raised when a panel is
completely expanded so when we expand an
accordion panel that's when the event is
raised now if you look at the class that
we are looking for its collapse class so
if you look at the panel body for
example if you look at this third panel
right here
so notice here we've got collapse class
on this development okay so we are
finding this panel body and then we are
handling the shown dot B s dot collapse
event so this event is triggered when
the panel is expanded when the panel is
expanded see if it is initially
collapsed we have this image okay but
when we expand it we want to remove that
image and display this image instead
which is an upward pointing arrow okay
so to do that what I'm going to do is
use dollar this keyword here so what is
this keyword going to do this keyword is
actually going to return this panel body
div and then on that I'm going to call
parent function which is going to return
the parent of this development
what is the parent of this development
the parent of this development is the
panel itself okay
so within this panel I'm going to find
you know an element that has got
this class cliff I can menu down okay to
do that we are going to use fine method
so find the elements that have got this
class because when the panel is
collapsed what is the class you know
that we are using to display that
downward pointing arrow glyph I can menu
down so we are going to find this span
element using the jQuery class selector
and then what we want to do we want to
remove that class so remove class and
instead of downward pointing arrow when
the panel is expanded we want to display
an upward pointing arrow so let's use
add class method and instead of menu
down class we use menu up class ok so
let's say we're changes reload our page
and at this point look at this when we
expand this initially it is downward
pointing arrow when I click on this one
look at that the panel expands and look
at what happened to the icon it changed
it to an upward pointing arrow the same
thing is going to happen with this as
well but now if I collapse this look at
that it doesn't change to a downward
pointing arrow because we haven't
handled that event so let's go ahead and
handle that event as well because when
we expand it we want to change the icon
to a downward pointing arrow to do that
we are going to handle let me actually
make a copy of this one we are going to
handle hidden dot be a stock collapse so
when is this event is raised this event
is raised when you know the panel is
completely hidden from the user so at
that point we want to remove the up icon
I mean find the element with menu up
class and then remove that class and add
down class so let's save our changes
reload our page notice that
the moment the panel is expanded its
displaying an upward pointing arrow if I
click on that it collapses and it
displays a downward pointing arrow look
at that all the three panels work is
expected now let's see how to display
plus and minus signs instead of upward
and downward pointing arrows to display
the plus and minus signs we are going to
use the respective glyph icons so
instead of up and down arrows we want
plus sign and minus sign look at the
names of the classes cliff I can plus
sign cliff I can minus sign so first
let's go ahead and replace these classes
so instead of glyph I can menu up we are
going to use cliff icon minus sign and
here instead of cliff I can minnow down
we are going to use cliff I can plus
sign and finally here as well instead of
cliff I can minnow down we are going to
use cliff I can plus sign and we need to
change this jQuery code as well so find
the element with glyph I can plus sign
and remove place a glyph I can plus sign
class and add cliff I can minus sign
class and here we have to do the
opposite so we want to find an element
with class glyph I can minus sign remove
that class and add glyph I can plus sign
class let's save our changes
reload our page and look at that
initially when the panel is expanded we
have got the minus sign if I click on
that the panel collapses and we have got
a plus sign notice all the panels work
as expected
finally let's see how to include you
know these buttons here expand all and
collapse all these buttons are going to
expand all the accordion panels at
ones and close them at once let's see
how to achieve this the first thing that
we want to do here is include these two
buttons if you notice these buttons are
inside eval so let's create a well first
to create a well we created development
with class Val and inside this well
let's create a button element and use
BTN and BTN primary classes let's also
give this button an ID let's call this
BTN expand all and the text on the
button is going to be expand all let's
make a copy of this button and change
the ID - BTN collapse all and let's also
change the text to collapse all let's
save our changes and when we real roll
page notice we get expand all and
collapse all buttons at the moment when
we click these buttons nothing is going
to happen when we click expand all
button we want to expand all the
accordion panels at once on the click of
that button similarly when we click this
collapse all button we want the panels
to be collapsed all at once so we have
to write some jQuery code to achieve
that so let's flip to visual studio and
if you look at the ID of this button it
is BTN expand also let's copy the ID and
then scroll down to the jQuery code
section we are going to make use of the
jQuery ID selector which is hash and
then we are going to hook up click event
handler with the button so when the
click event is phrased we want to handle
that and what do we want to do when we
click the expand all button we want to
expand all accordion panels now if you
look at these panels notice all three of
them are collapsed
now when the panels are collapsed what
are the classes applied when the panels
are collapsed you know these two are the
classes that are applied panel collapse
and collapse so what we are going to do
it within the click event handler is
find all those elements so here we are
going to use jQuery class selector which
is dot find all the elements that have
got the
two glasses panel collapse and collapse
and then what we are going to do is call
collapse function and to that we are
going to pass the string show which is
going to expand all those panels let's
save our changes and reload our page
look at that let's collab this now when
we click expand all look at that all the
panels are expanded now when we click
collapse all nothing is going to happen
because we haven't written the code yet
so when we click collapse all button so
the idea of collapse all button is
collapse all so when we click the button
then what we want to do we want to
collapse all the expanded panels now if
you look at the expanded panels there
are three classes that are applied so we
have got for example if you look at this
first panel right here this panel on the
initial page load it is expanded so when
it's expanded these are the three
classes that are applied panel collapse
collapse and in okay so what we want to
do is when we click on the collapse
button we want to find all those
elements that have got these three
classes and then call collapse function
on them passing in hide as the parameter
value let's see all changes reload our
page look at that and we click expand
all all the panels are expanded and we
click collapse all all of them are
collapsed thank you for listening and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
