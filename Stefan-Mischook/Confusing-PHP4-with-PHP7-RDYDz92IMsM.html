something that came up in a YouTube
question recently and that was a PHP
again the guy was really surprised about
how popular PHP was so let me just
dispel couple miss about PHP and I'm
know PHP fanboy if you watch my blogs
you know but I'm pretty much programming
language diagnostic so I mean I don't
particularly care about one language
over the other to meet are just tools
right there tools to use to build your
apps or to automate your processes
anyhow here are a couple of
misconceptions first of all we are in
the year 2016 fast approaching year 2017
we are in PHP 7 now PHP 7 and the
perception by a lot of people out there
is that PHP is still in version four
which takes us back to 2003 many many
many many things have changed with PHP
since PHP for it is today PHP is today a
very very modern language it has all of
this facility's it has all of the
capabilities of other languages like C
sharp Python Ruby etc etc with one
caveat like all their languages PHP has
its specializations the thing that it
does best so if you're looking at Python
for instance it's a much more flexible
language in terms of its use cases I
thought is used in robotics it's used in
AI issues in web app development its use
a scientist in science and it's used all
over the place and whereas PHP really
it's just used in web app development
but it is the most easily approachable
language for web app development it is
super performance at runtime it runs
circles around Python and Ruby
and your PHP code is actually running
PHP has several frameworks to choose
from in terms of web app framework so
you got Larry Val you got zend and
symphony there's many others so when it
comes to web development PHP is the king
that is the king and if you're going to
be into freelance web development you're
going to find there's much much more
work being a PHP developer maybe you
throw in some WordPress in there some
jun jul are some Drupal and you really
open up a lot of avenues in terms of
money-making so again there is this
notion out there but somehow PHP today
is what PHP was 10 12 years ago it's not
PHP today is very modern it has all of
the major capabilities of the modern
languages like Python like C sharp like
Java like Ruby so don't worry about it
so if you're looking to be a freelancer
you're looking to do that kind of work
then I would strongly suggest PHP but
here's the great thing if you invest in
learning PHP in again to PHP an
object-oriented program of PHP and you
get into a framework with PHP like Larry
valve for example and you decide six
months a year from now whatever two
years from now five years from or
whatever that it's not for you on try
something new you want to jump into
maybe Python it's not going to be a big
deal because the vast majority of the
concepts and the techniques that you're
going to learn in PHP there are one
hundred percent applicable to many other
programming languages including Python
Ruby Java C sharp and others so it's not
like you're wasting your time right it's
like if you learn how to drive a BMW and
you decide a couple years you want to
get a Porsche or you want to get an audi
or whatever you want to get another type
of car it's not like you're going to
lose
in all your driving experience that
driving experience is applicable to any
type of vehicle that you drive seemingly
programming so don't sweat it too much
right don't sweat it too much so very go
remember the misconception new PHP PHP 7
or 7.1 I believe PHP 7.1 it is not PHP
for many things have changed PHP 7 is
very modern has everything that you
wanted an object-oriented language as
all the frameworks it has all the
building capabilities and one big added
benefit will too big out of it benefits
to PHP once again it is super fast is
far more performant at runtime than Ruby
and Python and number two it's very easy
to learn they're very easy to get up and
running quickly with PHP that's probably
one of the main reasons why it's so
popular out there it dominates PHP
dominates the web development space
turns a web individual websites a huge
number of dynamic websites are powered
by PHP most of them small but you have
big ones like Facebook just you know
just as an example so if people tell you
PHP's old garbage a toy language they
don't know what they're talking about
they still think it's the year 2000
they're caught in the time warp all
right I'm off to get my coffee ciao guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
