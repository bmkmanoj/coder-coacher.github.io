was looking at Facebook groups that
actually joined a Facebook group to see
how that was if you recall a couple
months back I was thinking about
Facebook groups versus opening up the
foreign a killer sites dot-com formed to
allow people to join I put in an archive
mode to be a couple years ago because I
just had enough of dealing with spammers
and stuff and the forum software makers
came up with a new version that was
gonna make it a lot easier for people to
join and a lot easier for me to screen
out people bla bla bla bla but I don't
know if I want to really do it there's a
cost to it now that it's a big cause but
nonetheless I'm figuring how many people
gonna use the forum not sure so she got
YouTube and you got Twitter everybody
seems had their favorite social network
so I was looking at Facebook groups I
joined a big group and I was very
disappointed because there's it's hard
to find anything you have a search
feature I don't know how good it is I've
even bother but the post come in it's
just a big mess so unless you're on top
of it every day catching every post it's
kind of a really weak alternative to an
actual properly created form software so
for me Facebook groups is a big thumbs
down I don't think gonna be implementing
that because I'm not you know maybe a
missing sippin I'll take another look in
a week or so when time frees up but at
this point Tom I don't think I'm gonna
do any Facebook groups
it's just looks weak I don't know I'd
rather just turn back my forum or just
keep you keep using YouTube I'm not sure
I'm not sure
depends on the type of content I'm gonna
produce as well and that's about it it's
yeah I'm gonna let you go cuz I'm
getting pretty hungry here bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
