that we're going to learn is the delete
statement so let's look at this this is
pretty much the simplest one there is so
this allows us to basically delete a
record from a table so again we have a
couple key words we have delete and then
we have from that's the key word then we
name the table in this case is people so
we're deleting from people and then we
use a where clause is again where is
like if and PHP if so delete from people
where ID the ID field is equal to 4 we
don't want to delete everything in the
table so we go okay and go and PHP mine
min basically wants us to confirm this
because when you delete something that's
pretty serious because you remove it
from your table so we're just going to
go okay and delete a role is 1 so we
know that we've actually deleted a
record let's check it out and sure
enough record number 4 is gone and there
you go so let me show you something
that's pretty dangerous here now here
I'm saying delete from people watch what
happens you really want to delete from
people you guys sure go ahead the leader
role is 5 so we go SQL and can you guess
what happened mysql return an empty
results set ie0 roles when we said the
lead from people and we did not specify
which particular records we want to
delete with the where we deleted all the
records on the table and now when we're
doing our select we're saying well my
school says well there is actually no
records empty resultset means it did not
get any results from our quarry right so
remember what empty remember results set
results that's going to be quite a bit
in PHP s operations with MySQL so
that's basically what happened with the
delete statement any update statement
it's important that you include aware
the where Clause because that will
identify particular records you want to
effect as we did with update we without
where we updated all the name fields and
with the delete statement without the
where we deleted all our data on the
table and since this is only practice
doesn't make much of a difference to us
here but if you were doing this on a
live data database you would probably
have some problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
