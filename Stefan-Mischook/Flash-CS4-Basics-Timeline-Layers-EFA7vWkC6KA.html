a little bit about working with some of
the basics of the timeline so as you can
see here the primary thing that we're
going to be concentrating on in this
first video is dealing with the layers
themselves so just to get a little bit
of a handle on what we're doing I'm
going to create a simple square right
here using the shift key to sort of put
that into position and i'm going to
double click the text that's written
here so i can name it square or SQ or
whatever I want let's take a look at
what's going on well you'll notice that
inside of flash anytime you have
something on a layer or when you select
that particular there that you're
working with you'll notice that there is
a pencil icon right here indicating that
this is in fact the layer that you are
working with these layers can be made
invisible so you cannot see what's on
that layer now everything's still there
we're just temporarily hiding them and
for example you can also lock that layer
so that I cannot select anything that's
on that layer as you can see you can
also make this layer viewable in outline
mode and as you can see here I've got
the outline of the object be careful
though because even when you're an
outline mode you can still select for
example not only the outline or the
stroke but you can actually select a
piece of the object just as I'm doing
right here so you got to be a little bit
careful about what you're doing with
that regard now that's a little bit
about the basics but here I'm going to
show you that you can create yet another
new layer here let's just call this ov
for oval I'm going to choose a different
color and what we're going to be doing
with these colors in just a second I'll
just choose one that's relatively
appropriate and I'm going to make a oval
shape just right here and if you
remember when we were drawing things we
sort of noticed that when you had two
objects on top of each other and they
share the same layer when you move the
objects after D selecting and then you
selected it again and move the object
used take a bite out of the same p
well since these objects are on two
separate layers no need to worry about
any of that and now I can position these
objects wherever I want notice and if
you had multiple layers like let's say
50 or something crazy like that having
to come through and hide each of those
individual layers is a bit of a pain so
one of the things you can do is click
right on the eye at the top that hides
all the layers and then you could you
know turn on just the one that you want
to work with or turn them all back on
you can lock all the layers you can even
put all of the layers in outline mode
now notice the outline modes have
specific colors but if you double click
on the layer not the name but just like
the icon or anywhere else you can get
layer properties so you could say
whether to show or hide it lock same
thing as you got up here but you can
also choose different outline colors you
know I could come in here and choose the
same color that I had for the actual
object itself and we'll get into some of
the other things but you could say
whether or not this is a normal layer
mask layer a folder or a guide layer so
that should be enough for us at this
point but let's say I did have 50 layers
and as you can see scrolling through all
these layers will be kind of a you know
a bit of a pain for example look here
I'm going to say try and I'm going to
add a triangle let me just choose a
different color here for a second and if
I were to choose my polystar tool and my
properties window I could go to the
options and I could say hey only give me
three sides and that should be fine for
our purposes because all I really want
is a triangle shape well notice that's a
three-sided star which I'm not really
crazy about come back in here and i'm
going to change that to polygon so that
we actually do have a triangle so now
I've got these three layers now if I
wanted to delete one of those layers
quite easy just select it delete it I'm
going to ctrl z undo that for a second
now that's pretty simple but let's
had 50 layers and as you can see if you
had multiple layers here I'll make a few
more that are not going to have anything
on them in order to see where or what's
on all these layers you're going to have
to scroll up and down down here that
could be a bit of a pain so sometimes
what you would want to do is for example
I've got all these shapes you can create
a new folder and in this folder I could
double-click it give it whatever
appropriate name I want like shapes and
I can shift click to select all of these
items and drag them right into the
shapes folder so that allows me to
collapse what's in this folder so that's
a nice way to you know keep things
working for you and have them organized
in a nice neat fashion if you want to
delete that folder you can but look what
it says also deleting the folder deletes
layers nested within it do you want to
do that I'm gonna say no I want to keep
those layers so I'm just going to shift
click I'm going to drag this outside of
the folder and then i'll delete that
folder so that's just a little bit about
the basics of the layers now when you
come back in the next video I'm going to
show you a little bit about the basics
of working with this timeline</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
