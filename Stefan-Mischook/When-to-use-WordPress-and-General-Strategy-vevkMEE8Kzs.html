first of all I was just looking at a vid
I published and the ad appeared over my
video maybe last hey huh
enough of that alright so the question
was when to use WordPress and general
strategy hi Steph
I've enjoyed your vlogs for the past
couple months after years of feeling
misplaced in the public sector I am a
historian by trade I left my job this
winter I'm taking an online course along
with a few books on JavaScript and
Python to start freelancing as a web
developer your vlogs have helped a lot
I'm pondering whether to use WordPress
for my business site and therefore
choose a hosting plan dedicated for
WordPress use I think it would help me
concentrate on doing my courses in these
early stages and not worry too much
about building actual bits and parts of
it other than the content I do see the
benefit of building your own from
scratch I'm afraid that it would take
some valuable time what would you do my
place okay let me just answer these
first few comments so you have somebody
years learning web development you wants
to go freelancing again as I always say
check in your area where the demand is
in terms of the technology use is the
demand in freelance for Python
programmers and JavaScript programmers
or is the demand more in PHP programmers
perhaps you have to check from my
experience if eclis for freelancers PHP
could be far more productive for use in
so many small businesses run on PHP
again I'm not saying PHP is better than
Ruby or Python and bloodless it's not
about the technology it's about the use
of the technology in the marketplace so
you have to determine in your area what
the demand is all about he's asking
about setting up his business site his
site is not just any old business site
is a site to show that he is a developer
so that means that any prospective
client is going to pay a little bit more
closer attention to your website than
they would perhaps a car dealers website
a butcher's website since you're selling
your services as
web developer of some sort what Big D
web designer what not in terms of
WordPress or not doesn't bother me
either way I think that if you set up
your WordPress properly a lot of people
won't know you're using WordPress
necessarily because WordPress has
something called the pages which
basically act like static pages and in
fact we have a few sites in the killer
sites network that are actually all
WordPress and it used to be static HTML
pages but because they were content
focused sites with lots of content and
editing and so forth I just felt it
better to have a pure WordPress
implementation so that all said in time
you want to be sure that your site looks
professional any website has to look
professional but you given what you want
to do you want to provide web developer
skills you got to be sure that's the
case now in these situations you could
use a simple template and just do some
slight mods if you are focus more on
providing the developer aspect of the
job rather than the designer aspect
nobody is going to mind whether or not
you use a very simple but clean layout
if you were selling yourself as a
high-end designer in terms of UI and UX
then you would have to probably do
something from scratch
well almost definitely right because
that's the skill sense that you are
selling I personally don't see a need
for a so-called dedicated WordPress
hosting plan any basic PHP hosting can
support WordPress because WordPress is a
PHP based app and NEC panel based
hosting which is very common control
panel I'm sure Plesk as well another
comic control panel and there's you can
get these with no extra cost with your
basic Linux hosting there's an example
they typically have one-click install of
WordPress but on the other hand if your
intention is to sell yourself as a web
developer for you to download the
WordPress app and upload it and install
it on your server shouldn't be a big
deal and what you might find in your
part of the world and I don't know but
you
I find like like in so many other places
being in WordPress expert to install
configure modify put up themes etc etc
lock it lock it down security wise and
so on you might find there's a huge
demand for that in terms of small
businesses I've seen it over and over
and over again again WordPress
development Drupal development Joomla
development these are the three most
popular content management systems out
there as far as I know it may not be
sexy work for many developers but it can
be extremely lucrative and I I can say I
can tell you that from people I know and
it's just a common thing WordPress is
just everywhere so he continues for what
it's worth I live in Greenland for some
reason businesses haven't really caught
up with the idea that their websites
don't need to look like something from
the 90s oh there you go that's fitting
with a lot of business owners by the way
they don't have a designer's eye and so
so unless they're pushed into it they
won't see a difference between 90 styles
of web design versus modern look with
some exceptions of course this is for
small business owner small business
owners you know they got so many things
they got to take care of they don't have
time to really cost you any sorts of
things but what you'll see with small
business development is that
functionality basically bringing
functionality to the site is far more
obvious to them than design and they
will value that more right so if they
come to you for example and say they
want to install a shopping cart based
system that's pretty obvious to them but
if they have a shopping cart system and
it looks kind of dated they will be much
less sensitive to the aesthetics of the
shopping cart rather than if the
shopping cart actually works or not you
see where I'm going with that and I have
found in my career and other people's
careers is that people who can produce a
functional system are valued more than
people who can develop an aesthetically
pleasing looking thing and I'm not
saying that be able to produce a good
user interface and good user experience
is less valuable I'm just toying with
the perceptions are in terms of
many many small business owners for me
as I've said in other vlogs today what
really differentiates the apps are
besides the general content that they
provide is the UX and UI UX UI iPhones
and Android devices
Windows Mac devices MacBook Pros etc in
terms of functionality it all pretty
neck-and-neck you know some people
prefer to Mac's we prefer windows
eachother pros and cons but at the end
of the day what differentiates is the
usability and the feel of it and the Mac
people who enjoy Mac so much and I count
myself as one of them it just has a
really good feel the Mac operating
system even though the hardware might be
underpowered in certain benchmarks but
in terms of real world use it just has a
very good feel and that's a game that
comes down to you I knew X so let's see
what we got here I'm just going to
continue reading and given the fact I
really don't know any web servers around
and small businesses have their websites
down by coming to Denmark who by the way
just chunk their content on templates
that look the same I think web
developers might be in demand here again
that's why I always say to people in
terms of what language should I learn
which framework should I learn you have
to consider a the type of work that you
want to do and B you have to look at
where you live in the world and look at
the demand you look at the demand by
checking to see local listing for jobs
talking to site owners in the area
checking out indeed com perhaps you know
Craigslist etc etc you have to do a
little bit of snooping to see what the
demand is in your area and then from
that you can decide which way you want
to go so I will finish up this email I
know I won't be able to compete with
prices from Danish companies well maybe
not on a per hour basis but perhaps on a
project basis because a lot of companies
when you hire freelancers they're going
to ask you what your rate is per hour
but at the end of the day they're just
going to ask and they're just going to
be concerned about what their total
it's very rare especially when you're
starting out with new clients but
they're going to let you work on a per
hour basis they're going to want a fixed
price so you can compete perhaps on
fixed price if you have a really good
workflow in terms of how you put out the
projects that you put out so you
continues I know I won't be able to
compete with prices from the Danish
companies and that leaves me with the
task of convincing companies why a local
developer might be a better choice again
one of the big things that small
businesses at least here in North
America have to contend with is language
or communication issues so a lot of
times people will deal with local talent
simply because of that aspect right
there so that's why I always suggest
that always but recently I've been
emphasizing rather that you should work
on your communication skills it will pay
off in dividends anyway that's it for
