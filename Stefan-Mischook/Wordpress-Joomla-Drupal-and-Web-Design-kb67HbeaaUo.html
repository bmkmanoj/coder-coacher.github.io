sites calm and killer PHP calm in this
video blog it's been a little while
since I've made one I'm going to talk
about two things number one the role of
CMS's and blogs in modern day web design
I got a question recently put to me by
somebody asking me if you know making
plugins and modifying blogs and CMS's
blogs like WordPress which well we're
presaged morville become a blog slash
CMS no that's actually come with pretty
much a full-blown CMS at this time I'm
recording this in May 2012 miners'
competitors is Drupal or Drupal and then
there's Joomla and these are all CMS's
slash blogs while Drupal and room are
really full CMS's that you know you can
use to build up websites I talked about
this several years ago I guess and maybe
2006 where a guy came up with the phrase
the WordPress web designer essentially
that's a web designer who uses WordPress
as the basis of all their work this at
the time was kind of new if not totally
new but it was it was starting to grow
and now I think it's become really much
really mainstream for web designers to
actually start their work and start all
their websites brought website projects
based on using a blog or a CMS and the
reason for that of course is that by
doing that every website will have all
the capabilities built into all these
blogs or CMS products if you're not sure
what these things are
she just look them up Drupal or Joomla
or WordPress we have a bunch of videos
on WordPress ourselves at killer sites
and essentially if you build from one of
these free pieces of software the
websites that you build will have
you built will have free commenting
searching capabilities
okay huge plug-in architecture that you
can leverage and in the case of Joomla
Drupal and especially WordPress a huge
amount of templates as you can you bet
you can utilize so you can effect so
that you can instantly skin the site so
that they look really pretty good from
the get-go then you can modify these
skins too to suit whatever needs that
you have for your particular project
that's where understanding PHP becomes
very important because all these CMS's
or blog based tools Drupal Joomla
WordPress they're all built with PHP so
you can edit the templates and so on
just knowing HTML and CSS but if you
know PHP then you could take your
ability to customize these packages well
to the maximum you can do it just about
anything you want to them whether you
want to make changes to the core system
which I would advise against or create a
plugin which is the best way to go now
just in case you don't know plug-in is
this is basically a piece of software in
this case you'd write it with PHP which
allows you to plug right into the
software without changing the course
software and but still be able to effect
a change to how the software operates so
if you wanted to add capabilities to
WordPress you can create a wordpress
plug-in but does this and in fact
there's a huge number of these plugins
that are available for free you don't
have to build them and you can just drop
them right into your WordPress in a way
oh girl same thing or Drupal and Drupal
and Joomla I would imagine although I
haven't looked at joomla's community so
I couldn't say different definitively if
that's the case but I'm pretty sure it
is so what kind of plugins can you build
or can you get you can give ecommerce
plugins that's plugins YouTube
connectivity plugins stats plugins you
name it probably for
plugins survey plugins all these type of
things and if you were building your
sites with static HTML pages meaning non
dynamic pages then you would have to
build these things from scratch or look
around for some tool that was out there
but if you base your whole site on jus
on one of these CMS's Drupal Joomla
WordPress or an others you have all this
type of stuff at your fingertips
of course you're gonna have to research
and understand the communities of each
of these these projects but at the end
of the day it's worthwhile so yes modern
web designers I been saying since at
least 2006 they should learn PHP there's
no question and today with the rise of
html5 which I've been blogging about and
writing about learning JavaScript and
html5 becomes much more important than
it was just two years ago
you see PHP has competitors it has Ruby
and Java and.net and others although PHP
is the dominant one these days
javascript has no competitors and
javascript is used standalone for form
validations and stuff like that but
there's also a lot of JavaScript
packages that are out there that you can
use for free for instance the most
popular being jQuery and there's others
like Script oculus and these are
packages that allow you to create all
kinds of neat effects do validations on
your site with much less work beyond
that javascript is used to manipulate
html5 and the Dom again if you don't
know about this you can see our videos
on killer sites anyhow it's it's worth
looking into modern web design has
really become its own thing this
happened several years ago but it's it's
it's it's distancing itself even more
and more from
additional graphic design and if you
don't know the history about web design
back in the mid 90s early 90s really
graphic designers became the web
designers and because in those days web
design was more about you know the
visual aspects and less about the code
they would use people would use programs
like a dreamweaver frontpage or other
web design software a hot dog I don't
know if any of you guys remember a hot
dog but anyway they would use these web
design programs to hide the code so that
the word it was more or less a designer
thing so graphic designers would free
lat would would not freelance but they
would moonlight their attorney would
moonlight as web designers they would do
it on the side but now the web is much
more complex it's much more involved and
just because you can build a basic
website a basic web page and put some
images on it does not make it a it does
not make your web designer web designers
get to learn a lot more in PHP
JavaScript html5 it's just the tip of
the iceberg so yes the original question
is web design a lot about modifying
plug-ins for for things like Joomla
Drupal and WordPress the answer to that
question is yes and if you learn how to
do that you're gonna get a lot more work
this as simple as that and there you go
I hope you found this video blog
interesting I encourage you to check out
