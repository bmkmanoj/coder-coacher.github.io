talking about building a very simple
wordpress theme and we ended up with the
theme that basically wasn't broken and
it's sitting here it's my template we
don't even have a screenshot for it yet
that's okay in fact for now we'll just
leave it like that and this template
when we activated it just says my new
template which also so happens to be the
name of our of our website which is my
new template if we go back to text
wrangler we can see that we've put in to
link tags one for the RSS and another
for the ping back which is the official
URL of the page that we're actually
sitting on and then this little
declaration here which is the wp
underscore head which lets people know
that we're in fact using wordpress again
you could omit this if you want it to
now down here I've got a PHP block and
I've got a blog info and then I've got
name which is the actual name of the
blog that we're actually developing I've
got blog info name which is the name of
the website or blog that we're
developing now I'm going to cut out a
lot of this white space that I put in
the last video because it's not
necessary and it kind of clutters things
and I'm just going to add some new lines
now when we go back to our dashboard
here under settings I can see that
there's also a tagline now I want to get
that tagline in there too so I'm going
to just create an h2 and in the h 2 i'm
going to put in another PHP block and
i'm going to say blog info and this is
description and i'm going to save that
now if i refresh this page i'm going to
see just another wordpress web blog
which happens to be the tagline that i
have here as well already we're creating
a link between what is being put in the
dashboard and what's appearing on our
website now our website isn't
particularly interesting right now but
we can change that too now if I view the
source
I'm not linking in any way to the
style.css file that I created in the
last video so let's do that now I'm
going to close this view source window
which I got to by the way by just going
view and then page source this is on
firefox and I'm going to reference that
CSS file that I created in the last
video which is just sitting here and
it's basically empty as well to do that
I'm just going to create some space in
my head section and i'm going to type
link Arielle Arielle is the relation
style sheet and hyperlink reference
equals and then again we're going to do
something with blog info blog info
stylesheet URL semicolon and i'm going
to double quote that type equals text /
CSS and i'm just going to close that now
let's see what this does for us if i
refresh this page and I view my page
source again I'll see that WordPress has
actually figured out where my style
sheet is sitting on the web server now
if we take this a step further and I go
to style dot CSS and I say that I want
my body and I'm going to open this up
background to be read and I save this
and my background will turn red that's
not very appealing to the eyes so let's
just delete that for now something I
like to do when I'm working on a website
is I like to clear all the padding in
the margins that the browser will have
by default and to do this I'm going to
use the star and then I'm going to open
my squiggly brackets and i'm going to
say padding 0
zero margin 00 and this will make
everything zero if i refresh it
everything is going to be hugging the
top left of the page generally speaking
it's nice to have some kind of fixed
width or container where I can store the
body of my website in order to do this
I'm going to go back to my index dot PHP
file and instead of just having my
header and my header to my blog info
name and my blog info description
sitting under the body I'm going to
create a div here and my div is going to
be of class header and i'm just going to
indent these two lines and i'm going to
close my div here and i'm going to hit
save now nothing should happen perfect
so what I've done is I've identified a
section of my blog or a section of my
template rather that I want to be
classified as a header before we keep
going I'm going in the style.css file
I'm going to create another div and this
one is going to be called canvas and I'm
going to indent this again so if we
think about this in terms of a canvas or
a frame where we can actually put
content and then a header we're creating
a very simple language for defining how
our style sheet or our template is going
to be rendered now that I have canvas
and header I can properly use them in my
style dot CSS file so I'm going to do
canvas and I want my canvas to be about
900 pixels wide and I wanted to have a
background that's white this is
hexadecimal and i think that's it now i
want the background of my body to be
some kind of green
so let's see if my hexadecimal is decent
in fact you can just put anything in
there perfect so what you're seeing is
you're seeing a 900 pixel canvas and
then beneath it our body has a green
background and everything inside the
canvas is now sitting on a white
background we can make the center line
by just going in typing margin 0 and
then auto now the first declaration here
for margin corresponds to the top and
the bottom margins for the particular
element that we're dealing with the auto
corresponds with the left and the right
margins of the element that we're
dealing with so when I hit save again
this should be now Center aligned so
already our template is starting to take
a little bit of shape another thing I
like to do is I like to stay away from
Times New Roman since Times New Roman
tends to be a very good font for print
but not so much when you're trying to
read something on a web page I'm going
to go into the star over here and i'm
going to say font family Helvetica
aerial saw serif what this means is that
if the person has Helvetica installed on
their computer they're going to be able
to see it as Helvetica if not they'll
see it as aerial which pretty much
everybody has and if not that then just
any kind of sauce serif font basically a
font like Ariel that doesn't have any
service that doesn't have any little
nooks at the end of the letters if i
refresh this page again we move to a
Helvetica typeface now the next step is
to build what is called the loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
