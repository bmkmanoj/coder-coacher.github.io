careers my careers starting as an
entrepreneur when I was 18 years old and
moving into code a few years later and
doing all kinds of different things most
of my career though has been very code
centric but I always looked at coding
and programming as a tool in my tool bag
so I would develop apps and I would
develop sasses and businesses that are
centered around code sometimes the
original studi web was actually a web
development studio where had of teamwork
people working for me we're developing
websites and web apps for people and
then well now study web is the sass that
schools use its educational sass and
I've had other pieces of software that
have utilized the support not
necessarily technology businesses but
the technology was used to support these
other businesses that's why I got into
coding in the first place was to create
presents for myself on the web
I had actually one of the first websites
in the world that were well I had one
her very first websites in the world I
wanted a very first websites in the
world I had photos on it believe it or
not and I was able to open open up
markets in Europe and Asia because of my
website in the 1990s back in those days
if you put up a good photo of a fish
colorful fish you're like a web god
because in those days optimizing images
and putting them online I was like it
was black magic voodoo better hoodoo
back then
anyhow things have changed so one of the
thing is that I've benefited from was
pushing into other areas where I wasn't
comfortable now as a general principle I
like to play to my strengths but it's
good to expose yourself to different
things so for instance I actually come
from more or less a designer background
I was a graphic design trained in Hatton
the artistic end of things if you will
but I decided that learning to code was
such a key skill set for my business
because I would be able to express all
kinds of ideas much more easily and
quickly if I knew how to code so I push
myself to learn how to code let me tell
you back then the resources weren't very
good in terms of learning how to code so
it was a lot harder than it is today and
especially when you come from an
artistic background like I did it was
difficult for me but I really pushed
through and one thing I can tell you
from that is that it's been invaluable
for me to jump into that arena to do
something I wasn't comfortable with and
it exposed myself to value even if you
don't end up becoming a coder full time
understanding the basics of it is such
an important tool to have because it'll
be it will allow you to evaluate things
more clearly
case in point cryptocurrencies bitcoins
if you are a software developer you're
gonna have a much deeper understanding
what cryptocurrencies are what these
network are and what it all means much
more than somebody who doesn't know
anything about coding and so you allow
you to make much more informed decisions
about cryptocurrencies allow you to be
able to look at them with a trained eye
to be able to assess which currency is
which of the crypto coins might be the
better investments investments in quote
meaning gambling but nonetheless it
could be a lot of money be made with
them but you got to look at the
underlying infrastructure just being
able to buy and sell cryptos is a pain
in the butt and for non coders is like
it could be a nightmare for them well
these Asian go to coin base and coin
aisle but again with my major mess up
with bitcoins even though I'm software
developer it was a real pain but and I
and I did intend to bind them seven
years ago because I just got lazy I was
on just the third stage of the process
that was a big mistake of course but
that being said I was able to do it
because I had a background in coding it
gave me that opportunity where as a non
coder
very much more difficult for them and
even today much more difficult so what
I've done I've one of my partners we
bought miners and LTC miners and it's
now that we think we're gonna get rich
on these things quite the opposite it
was more or less an experiment we're
checking into it kind of you know we
wanted to get miners try it out get on
top of that thing and just just just to
see what it's like as nerds and then oh
then by using it and working with it
even though it's not something we're
necessarily really focused on or
something we really it's not our main
thing but by any means I even closed but
I wanted to explore that for real get my
hands dirty for real what mining with
owning the coins getting the wallets
this and that doing the transaction is
working just so we understand it because
understanding that space might reveal
business opportunities forget about the
gambling you know the gambling on the
coins that's one thing but there's also
all kinds of business opportunities that
might come out of that you know close
with this I remember when I don't
remember it I've let that old during the
California Gold Rush journey Kalla
California Gold Rush very similar to the
cryptocurrency Gold Rush
well the cryptic wound the
cryptocurrency rush back during the
California Gold Rush all these people
were going to California because they
finally can get rich mining gold because
said there's a lot there there's gold in
them hills in California so everybody
was going to California to mine gold
what history has taught us is that most
of the people mining the gold didn't
make any money but the people who made
the most money in the California Gold
Rush were the people providing the tools
and the services for the gold miners the
guys selling the shovels and the picks
and the wheelbarrows and all the other
equipment that you need to mind gold and
so we bought a few miners from
from these companies produce LTC miners
and I was talking to my partner I said
you know these guys are making huge
money like they're backordered I bet you
to make an 80 cents on the dollar if not
70 cents on the dollars and they just
can't make enough of these machines
these guys in China are making a fortune
on supplying the miners to the other
people all the suckers like me and so my
friend also built my partner also builds
some aetherium miners and again it's AMD
with their GPUs they can't keep up with
the demand
it's incredible they're making ton of
money on these Assyrian miners now my we
might make money on these miners but the
problem with the mining of the
cryptocurrencies is that difficulty it's
not an exponential but the increased
quite quickly so it's like our machines
ROI return on investment is like
literally plummeting now the depends of
the coins keep going up in value or not
so it's like a race right we don't know
what's gonna happen but I tell you what
the guys who sold us the machines AMD
who sold the Jaypee GPUs they made their
money right away boom they're out there
doing fantastic so keep that in mind if
you're interested in a crypto space I
think the guys are gonna make most of
the money are going to be the one
supplying the tools for the people
involved in the crypto space it's hard
to say though I'm sure as I'm sure you
hear about those Bitcoin millionaires as
well there's no question about that but
nonetheless there's something to
consider
history is a good teacher by the way
history is a good teacher if it was a
Mark Twain very famous guy from the
state us said history doesn't repeat
itself but it tends to rhyme
anyway somebody consider a bite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
