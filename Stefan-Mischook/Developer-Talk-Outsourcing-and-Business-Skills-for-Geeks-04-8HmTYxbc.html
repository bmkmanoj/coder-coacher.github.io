so we're gonna cover just a few quick
things the first question I'm going to
answer well the big question I'm going
to answer is should people in the West
be worried about Indian outsourcing are
they going to lose their jobs to Indian
programmers that's gonna be what I'm
gonna discuss briefly it's it's good
news for everybody even the Indians so
first question I have for you guys if
you can answer below in the YouTube
comments what resolution do you watch
the videos I'm curious about what
resolution you guys actually set when
you're watching my videos I upload these
at 1080p and I'm wondering if anybody
actually watches them at 1080p would
anybody watch them if I start shot start
shooting 4k video let me know about that
I'm just curious another reminder if you
want to get more insider information get
more involved go to the forum their
killer sites like calm community I'll
put the link in the video here I guess
or maybe in the link below in the
comments below I'll put the link the
forum basically I'm just waiting for my
server devs to get back to me so that I
could pass that information on to the 4
and the 4 um excuse me
developers so we can do the last tweaks
I don't want to get done to the forum
it's fully functional now and if you
would call people who watch my videos
for a while I don't know months ago I
asked you know should I set up a
Facebook group or should I set up a
forum or some people are suggesting
maybe he's read it so what I did is I
have the old killer site.com forum this
is actually the third iteration of it
and so I had put it in stasis a couple
years back I say year ago it's more like
two years or three years ago something
like that and it still gets traffic so I
decided to install brand new software I
had people install brand new software to
cut down all the spammers so it's been
pretty cool since I put in a new
software I only had
spammer account got through and with the
new software tools it takes me literally
a second to nail them and they're gone
so it makes it so much easier to manage
that was one of the main reasons why I
shut down the forum because I couldn't
be bothered and my forum administrators
they were having it was almost like a
full-time job just managing all the spam
accounts so thankfully with the new
software we've taken care of that
spamming so far so it looks pretty good
so I invite you to join the forum's
because you're gonna start seeing
premium content there if you care most
of the premium content is going to be
concerned about business and tech or not
just pure business not pure text it's
going to be a combination of a two
whereas you know if you do any MIT
courses you've been watching my flocks
everything what I do is really more
about what I look at technology rather
programming languages and frameworks and
so forth I'm always considering the
business end of it all that's more
important than anything else because as
I say this framework that framework this
library that that library will come and
go it's understanding the core of
language and other languages and of the
technology that underlying all these
that underlie all these things is much
much more important than learning the
next you know fancy library but more
importantly I'm going to start getting
in much more into the whole business end
of things which is awesome I think
everybody is learning to code well the
vast majority anyway for financial
reasons whether they want to get a job
whether they want to be a freelancer
whether they want to build their own
apps or maybe they just want to be able
to build stuff websites or install
WordPress for their own businesses that
have nothing to do with tech I'm going
to be concentrating on that and once I
get the last little things done on a
form I'm going to be rolling out a bunch
of stuff but I've I've only touched on
in previous vlogs over the years and
it's going to be favored on the forum
why because the forum has much better
social features and YouTube don't worry
I'll be still posting on YouTube but I
was I just want to also listen I just
want to
revive the community the killer says
community I want to bring that back and
you know I'm not gonna be su on that one
that's definitely one of my motivations
anyhow so yeah go to the forum so the
question at hand do you have to worry
about Indian outsourcing if you are in
North America or Europe or wherever
wherever else it's not just India it
could be any part of the world where
labor is far cheaper because the cost of
living is far cheaper you see the
Indians they make a lot less like
relative to North Americans but people
coding in some town in Ohio is probably
making much less and somebody is coding
in San Francisco big part of this
because you know the cost of living in
San Francisco is so much higher do you
have to worry no not generally speaking
because outsourcing to to India comes
with a bunch of headaches and usually
it's larger organizations that will do
that although you have some smaller ones
today modern-day development has a lot
more to do than just writing code has
much has a lot to do with communications
a lot that means a mastery of the local
language customs and understanding how
people to think and talk in your region
and though in the inter example speak
English they have different customs
different personalities and they're
great great but it's just a different
mentality and so a lot of small
businesses which are going to be the
vast majority of your market specially
as a freelance or a lot or small
businesses I've got a rather deal with
local talent so people that can speak to
people understand the local culture
somebody they can reach right away I
know I know because I've been in
business for 28 years and I deal with
many of my friends or some business
owners anywhere from making a few
hundred thousand a year to many millions
and vast majority would rather deal with
a local developer that a remote
developer but just because of the
communications issues so as I said
before one of the things you got to
learn as a developers develop great
ability to speak to communicate to write
well and
have business skills as a developer will
serve you many different fronts because
as somebody who understands business and
code it's like having two guns instead
of one gun it's like having two fists
instead of one fist yeah I'm sorry I'm
martial artists amusing he's combative
analogies so I'm trying to think of a
less combative analogy the point is is
that when you have business skills it's
going to help you quite a bit in terms
of your being able to communicate with a
prospective client so let's say you're
getting it to freelancing as a PHP
developer just for example and you go in
there and they may want to build site
they may what a bit we're presently not
they're not sure they may want our
e-commerce system by you understanding
the basics of business and how business
people think and considering how
businesspeople think it's going to give
you a huge advantage because you're
gonna be able to speak their language
and on the flip side I tell small
business owners you should learn at
least the basics of the web stack most
just about every small business has a
website and if you have a website as a
small business owner you should at least
understand the basics of how all this
technology works if you do that you're
gonna be far ahead because you're gonna
be able to communicate with your
developers and be able to communicate
with your developers and understand what
how they think and what they're looking
at understanding how sites are built and
again not to be an expert just to
understand the basics will put you as a
business owner way far ahead because
you'll be able to understand the process
you better to communicate exactly what's
going on you understand what what can be
done what can't be done and you have a
much better idea of judging cost as you
as you as a developer freelancer
otherwise you will have if you have
those business skills those basic
understanding would how business people
think what the considerations are and so
forth you will be able to be a much
better judge in terms of how and what
they're going to need for their
particular site or of a particular app
that you might build and that will allow
you to much better chance you better
land the contract much better chance
you're gonna do a better job for them
because you're gonna understand each
other clearly upfront so having good
business skills for developers huge
great advantage in the marketplace much
better
once you understand your basics your
core like I teach them a course is much
better than to understand business than
it is to learn some new framework you
know as I say with the cart when it
comes to learning new frameworks or new
libraries or to be react or you angular
or whatever all you need to know I say
learn on a need-to-know basis
learn on a need-to-know basis which you
should do once you've got your basics
you understand the whole web stack for
example then you know did this poke
around a little bit of react do the
equivalent hello world react hello world
angular and this read a bit about what's
it used for what it's used for say with
jQuery and then from there when you get
your gigs get your jobs and you can
decide okay I know angular might be good
here so then you just learn it that you
know what you need to learn but I
angular at that point just learn what
you need in terms of react at that point
if your gig requires it a lot of times
vendors people who are evangelizing a
particular technology they'll try to put
forces idea in your head that every
single project has to have react that's
what the react people say or every
single project to have angular that's
what angular people might say the fact
it matter is is it's it's not true so
anyway so understanding as a developer
understanding business how business
works how business people thinks will
give you a huge advantage in the
marketplace whether you have to compete
with remote workers or not and being a
business owner understanding at least
the basics of the web's stack assuming
you're interested in web stuff will help
you terms of making good business
decisions about how what you're going to
develop how you're going to develop it
in what your cost might be that's it for
today's vlog I'm going to be doing more
and more general vlogs relate to
business and tech I'm going to talk
about news I'm gonna talk about what's
developed what's evolving out there in
terms of a big picture and some small
subjects as well and to give you an idea
what I see going forward and I'll be
leveraging of course my 28 years
experience as an entrepreneur many
different small businesses not just tech
other industries and also by 20-plus
years when something years
since 1994 and 95 is her writing code so
you know experience goes a long way
because I seen a lot of these things
I've seen cycles occur I seen
technologies come and go and they die
off and they come things come back so
for instance when I talk to you about in
this vlog don't get married to a
particular library don't try to learn
every new library there's many tech many
technologies just fell apart you know
and and if you were just somebody who
said if you identified yourself as for
instance just a flash ActionScript
developer and that's that's what you
were that was why I was a great
profession till got killed but if you
understood your basics to go from
ActionScript flash developer flex Fleck
I think was called flex developer to
jump into something else not that hard
if you understand your fundamentals well
alright that's it for now bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
