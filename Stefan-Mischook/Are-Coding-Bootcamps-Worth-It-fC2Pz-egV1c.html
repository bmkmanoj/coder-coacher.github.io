I got on a deep focus otherwise the
focus tends to bounce so what are we
going to talk about here we're going to
talk about code boot camps people have
asked our cold boot camps worth it these
are these boot camps where you spend
about eight weeks depending on the boot
camp you know sometimes three months and
you pay ten fifteen thousand dollars
depending and they say that by the end
of a boot camp you will have this
necessary skills like at a high paying
job coding I question that I think you
can get a job after a few months of
practice as an entry-level coder if you
put the work in but not something like
we're gonna be making 80 hundred grand a
year you got to give yourself some time
and develop some chops and experience to
do that
so she is it worth it back to the
original question it depends on a few
things it depends on how dedicated you
are if you're gonna put a heck of a lot
of work into it you're gonna be
motivated you're gonna get into it might
be worth it but if you are motivated and
you're able to do a lot of work and you
able to do these type of things then you
might be better off just doing it on
your own there's lots of courses out
there that you can pick out for 30 100
bucks 50 bucks
lots of YouTube stuff we can pick up a
little bit bits here and there now so
you may be asking yeah but I'm not gonna
have all the answers on YouTube this is
chuh but if you have a well structured
course and I'll just say you know I'm
speaking my book here I sell courses you
know but doing this in 2003 so the boot
camps are really for people who don't
have the ability to be disciplined
enough to actually learn the stuff on
your own but if you're not into it
and enough to do it on your own then
maybe the boot camp won't be good enough
for you it won't be good for you because
if you can't if you're not motivated to
learn this stuff in the beginning you're
not gonna be motivated to be a coder
because coding is an intense job so it
could be a lot of fun if you're into it
but it is an intense job and so if
you're not motivated on your own you
need you feel you need to be whipped
you know that kind of one-on-one
attention then you're you know it might
not be for you and I'll save you 15,000
bucks so what I would suggest strongly
is but first before you try a boot cap
you try learning on your own through a
good course you know why not try $50 or
$35 or $99 on a course and see how it
goes
right put the work in you know these
boot camps at the end of the day nobody
cares you know in terms of employers
whether or not you come from boot camp
they don't what they do care about is
whether or not you have the skills and
you demonstrate your skills through
projects that you build so that's the
key thing some of the boot camps may
have set up little deals with some
companies or they'll take you in try you
out but let me tell you if they're going
to try somebody out from boot camp who's
been doing it for three months they'll
try you out if you've been learning on
your own and working on the code on your
own and you can come in take a look at
all the projects they've built I do it
and then me they may ask you questions
they may give you a trial and you can do
this without spending fifteen thousand
dollars on a boot camp that's my
experience I hire people
I've been coding since 1994 been
teaching since 2003 so I've been
teaching for longer than a lot of these
boot camp teachers have been coding so
keep that in mind I understand the
business of coding very well from the
fact that I've been involved in it for
20 years so you know take it what a
grand solve perhaps but that's just my
take on it so I personally would before
getting into a boot camp I would
actually get into an online course or
buy a couple books it's a lot cheaper
and see if you can discipline yourself
everyday to do a bit an hour to a day
because at the end of day eight hours a
day two hours a day you learn a little
more quickly with eight hours I guess
but the brain can only learn so many new
things per day takes time for it to sort
of sink in so I think if you do two
three hours a day on your own you're
going to learn a lot quickly trust me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
