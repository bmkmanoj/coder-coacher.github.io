until PHP calm i was reading a blog
potent our blog post a thread on the
killer sites com forums and somebody
posts into something interesting where
they were trying to be sold on a web
development and design a program and
degree and what they discovered is that
only four of the classes were actually
based on the web development according
to this post and the restaurant business
related classes and in the degree was
called web design and development said
that you know that's that's is nuts you
know you have a degrees saying your web
design development agreed only for
classes on web development that seems
really strange so the larger point i
want to bring up is that you have to
really consider the program you're
getting into you know i'm sorry i'm
talking about a college or technical
technical college or a university
program really look at the details about
the the what classes are offering what
the specific technologies are teaching
make sure you're not teaching old stuff
you see that a lot where you know people
are going into computer science and
they're learning how to use really old
languages is it's crazy that nobody
hardly uses in the fuel anymore you also
look at you know what percentage of the
classes are actually technology oriented
vs so you know the history of computing
you know like
filler class you know you have to
understand that a lot of these colleges
and universities will for students to
take a lot of filler useless BS classes
yes the history of the computer how it
developed is interesting but you don't
need to pay hundreds of dollars to take
a class on that to them and the textbook
you just look it up on Google and
Wikipedia and you can learn what you
need to learn about that it's not going
to have hardly any impact on your
ability to secure work so again back to
larger point before I would jump into
any any class or any program any course
including including my own I would look
at the contents understand what you're
getting out of it and so that you can
make a proper assessment whether or not
it makes sense and this applies any
program not just web related web
programmer and designer if anything
really have a clinical I about what
you're signing up to what you're getting
into again I'm going to come back to
that I'm going to keep stressing this be
very wary about getting into student
loan debt because it's non-dischargeable
through bankruptcy and what that means
is that if you go back if you take on
student loan debt and for some reason
you're having trouble paying off you
cannot go bankrupt you cannot get rid of
that that you become an effective debt
slave I've addressed as before I'm going
to keep pounding us in because a lot of
students miss this and then they get
caught with tons of data that was
unnecessary yeah I've had people contact
me or if they've completed one year
programs or has spent ten eight ten
thousand dollars or more learning web
design or web programming and they come
and they see one of our packages for 100
bucks teaches a much more and much
better and and what you're going to find
is that a one-year certificate in web
programming is you know it can help you
in certain areas but it's not worth
becoming a desolate
if you know again rehashing this
statement but again have a critical eye
about what you're getting into before
you get into it and this applies to
anything anything so that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
