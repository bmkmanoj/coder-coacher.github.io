question that was put to me in the
YouTube comments I figured I'd do a
quick vlog about it so somebody asked me
how do I make my living now as a
developer so right now being that I'm an
old geezer
I don't actively write code for other
people I do write a little bit of code
for myself but only when I am working on
a new course where I'm writing up code
examples and trying to come up with a
better structure that will help me teach
the lessons more effectively but I did a
lots of app development and lots of
coding for companies back in the day in
fact they did it for some several years
six seven years I think full-time and
then I migrated from being a full-time
independent developer and I started
developing my own apps where I would
write all the code architect top to
bottom and that was I think I started
making that transition in the early 2000
2000 yea year 2000 2001 something like
that and the reason I did that because
at one point in your career as a
developer you would have to decide
whether or not you want to be a
developer working for somebody or
working for several clients for rest of
your career which is cool I know several
people who do that and they like it
whether they're going to go into
retirement very soon another thing you
could look at is whether or not maybe
you want to get into managing developers
you can do that in larger organizations
or maybe for yourself if after you get a
nice stable of clients you start
bringing on junior developers to help
you with things and you build up your
firm that way that's another viable
option and I did that as well in fact
studio web which I registered in 1998
that was the file name
of my web development web design company
where I had people working for me
studio web right before it was called I
design which I should have registered
the black domain glad the chance but
anyway what I had other names as well
when you're learning business and you're
developing a business you go through
different name changes and different
ideas and you get caught up in that when
you're ready when you're creating a name
for your business I'll try to just keep
it simple and easy to spell that's my
advice with regards to God
anyway so at what point I made the
decision and it was a hard decision
because I really loved the cold I said I
don't want to be a coder deep into cold
water in my you know 50s and you know
whatever sixties are but again like I
said a lot of people like that that's
cool I have friends of mine or whatever
me and their 50s and early fifties in
there's no coding and they're made of
great careers make a lot of money doing
that especially if you get into managing
teams and so forth which you should be
at that point if you if you've got
pretty good interpersonal skills that's
something else I don't emphasize enough
that I should really maybe put this
together like structured program if you
will as opposed to my random vlogs here
interpersonal skills being able to
listen to people and being able to
communicate with people if you can do
that and combine that with good coding
skills and good development skills whoa
you're going to do wonders for your
career or your business anyway back to
what I did so at one point I made that
decision I'm not going to be a freelance
developer or working for somebody as a
developer anymore I want to get into
developing my own app so I started
developing apps I spoke about one I had
before had like my dating site which was
just a project it turned into a business
on its own but then I had all these
swingers came into it and I didn't want
to be forever associated with having a
big swinger site so I shut that down
I don't maybe sold or something but
that's
another vlog you can watch that if you
want and I had other things as well I
had a what he call it I guess you leave
remote sales rep system before
Salesforce comm I had one of my first
clients that people are invest and and
that's a whole story elongated to now so
I've had several products that I wrote
from myself from scratch and launched
develop some revenue with them but I was
very much somebody who was a nerd
interested in tech so a lot of times
where to explore these ideas it was to
explore technology so I would sieve it
like in the Java world they did a lot of
my work in Java in those days and some
new libraries will come out or some new
version of Java come out I want to
experiment with something's it's now
build this or build that that's how I
worked so going on in terms of money
making I said to myself I had to develop
I had to develop some sort of business
where I only IPD intellectual property
so I started developing websites and I
took over killer sites calm and it was
1999 or 2000 and I built it up from
there I don't write code except like I
said where I'm just prepping for courses
and try to come up with some cool
examples for people to sort of teach
them how to do certain things but where
my developer skills come in handy is in
launching new products for instance I
have a meeting tomorrow with one of my
partner's and a business but unrelated
to anything to do with coding but my
major role coming into this partnership
is my development in coding experience
going back to 90s I'm able to launch
product very quickly and this is for a
business has nothing to do with
technology except that it uses
technology to to do certain things so
I'm being vague because it's a new thing
and
to talk about it at this time anyway so
right now what I do is I use my
developer skills experience to help me
with all my other businesses it could be
my other businesses I don't have 25
businesses I have a few things so that's
where that stuff comes in handy so even
if you don't see yourself being a
developer in ten years or even five
years or whatever years or even now you
don't want to be a developer learning
how to code and understanding the
process is going to just give you a huge
skill set that's very monetizable in
many different ways and maybe not
directly like I said even though I don't
write code today my coding development
skills helps me immeasurably in so many
other areas so for instance my one of my
focuses is studio web which is an app
that teaches code public uses it but
it's real focuses educational
institutions I have lots of schools who
use to do web and we are about to sit
down to architects to do web for studio
web for is significant because it's a
total rewrite from scratch we're at 3.1
now studio web and the reason we're
doing a rewrite is because after seven
years several coders the code base is
pretty it's getting pretty old
one of my friends small friends is also
former mentee of mine and he now is a
CTO of a company that's funded by VC
capital they raised a couple million
bucks and you know I like what he said
I'd already got if I sit there there's
in mature at you you have code in their
code and that's because of changing
requirements changing developers
libraries that you used originally have
gone really old they've become
incompatible you start having to patch
anyway that's the case with speedy web
those new web is pretty much a bug free
app works really well but for future
development I have to do a rewrite
because the infrastructure that see web
is based on is ancient the arm the
object related read it the object
relational mapping framework is ancient
yeah the idea so we've been bypassing
stuff
using web services and so forth to keep
the codebase going but I've decided to
pull that trigger and say okay I didn't
were required to start from scratch big
job big job but because we know exactly
a lot and because we're staying within
the same language and and level language
p37 we're going to be able to borrow
some code and take some code from the
old code base bring it into the new and
base the whole thing on a brand new
architecture a brand new infrastructure
which really excites because a coder cuz
whoo I can leverage all this cool new
stuff right and now I'm not going to
writing the code I'm going to be
involved and I am involved in managing
the architecture every step of the way
from UI to UX the database without that
we just got the first I just got the
first database design as suggested by
the lead developer and based on our
conversations I said we need this you've
got to be mindful of this we should do
this as the prom we solve for old data's
based design from still web 3 branch and
this what we should do so he says now he
just sent me a few days ago the database
structure so I'm going to be sitting
down and we're going to sit down look it
over you know see what we think that
impacted for us so that's where my
development skills comes in handy I'm
able to get right in there right into
the nuts and bolts of the process to
make sure things are done properly I'm
not just going to do this with the
database and we're choosing a different
middle layer frameworks and sofa and all
kinds of different things
mindful of what the app needs what the
app needs to do now and what I see for
the app within the next year because I
want to bring in one of the things I
want to do and I can't get into too much
detail but I want to bring an AI
component into studio web something I
think will enhance it nicely but hey so
back to your visual think what do I do
I use my developer skills to develop my
own IP my own intellectual property this
is harder to do at first because to
develop an app that generates revenue
it's harder than just selling your skill
pay big money to do the work both are
good Pez what you want to do you know
some people want to develop apps from
scratch for different clients or client
will come to you say I need to build
this this and this and this and you
could you go in there with yourself or
your team and you start developing yeah
that's cool I have a good friend of mine
does that big revenues a couple million
revenue pretty good revenue for a small
development house and then other people
are specialists in a particular
framework like excuse me a particular
CMS like WordPress web developers these
guys make a lot of money because of so
many small businesses out there who are
dependent on WordPress
so they so these guys these WordPress
web developers specialize in WordPress
installing configuring locking it down
for security plug-in skinning themes and
so being that being able to do is you
know your work president / press API you
got it Oh PHP that know HTML CSS
JavaScript a little bit jQuery blah blah
blah so there are different avenues to
user developer skills that's why I keep
saying becoming a developer you can't
lose even if you don't write code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
