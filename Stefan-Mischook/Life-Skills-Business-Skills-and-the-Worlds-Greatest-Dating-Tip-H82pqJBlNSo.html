of my most unusual vlogs ever and it's
going to be taking us into the realms of
business skills and life skills
interpersonal skills now I'm doing this
because of my background
everybody knows I've been a developer
for a long time since 90s but I've been
in business for longer I've been in
business since I've been 18 I started my
first company 18 years old and in fact
that was the last time I held a job
working for somebody else and I was a
bouncer in a nightclub so yeah so I'm
going to start bringing that into more
and more of my videos and I would have
clearly title them to separate the code
or the developer related videos versus
entrepreneur and life skills now you're
saying you're saying to yourself what
life skills does that have to do with
business what has to do with everything
in fact the life skills videos if you're
a developer I would say you should watch
these videos more than anything else a
lot of these lessons that are going to
be talking about here are things I wish
somebody would have told me when I was
much younger now some of them yes I was
actually some of the things are going to
be talking about over next many videos
are lessons that I learned from some my
mentors guys some of them very very very
very wealthy people very successful
people and yeah so I'm going to impart
that onto you guys and a whole bunch of
more things so there's a few things I've
discussed in this video number one I had
a very interesting conversation with a
friend of mine who is in HR Human
Resources and has been for quite a while
two decades now she's highly experienced
and in our conversation she brought up a
very interesting point she said that
when they evaluate candidates they look
at technical skills they have to you
have to have obviously you've got the
chops the skills to be able to perform
but what they pay much more attention to
is whether or not your personality
will fit into the culture of the
business this is huge you know in other
words whether or not you're not a jerk
whether you're somebody who can get
along with other people who can
communicate well who can listen well
somebody who can fit in and work with
other people because a company is a
company like you have company you people
win friends your company if you have
company come over a company is really
just a group of individuals who work
well together and as one of my mentors
told me a long long time ago he rather
have a moderately skilled employee who's
easy to get along with can speak well
and gets along with people
you'd rather have this person been a
genius who's a total jerk remember that
very successful entrepreneur one of my
mentees know one of my mentor excuse me
worth maybe a hundred two hundred
million now and he told me that he had
many companies by the way not just one
companies not a one-hit wonder
many companies different areas you would
start new companies by companies and you
know and manage all these things and
again he said he'd rather have a
moderately skilled person technically
but who's easy to get along with then
somebody is a superstar skill wise
there's a total jerk because his
experience taught him that the super
super capable total jerk is going to be
just a cancer to your company so if
you're in software development and let's
say you're pretty comfortable with your
JavaScript you know your node well you
can do stuff and you're trying to site
hmm which should I learn next well I
would say if you're already pretty
confident as a developer I would put
some time into learning how to become a
better communicator to be better at
dealing with people better at writing
these types of skills will pay off far
more you know now that you already have
your technical base then learning
another language or learning another
framework that's just my two cents on
that so back to my friend who was was in
senior position HR she was saying yes
they pay much more attention to the
interpersonal skills of the candidates
than anything else she said a very
important thing from their experience
the scene it's a lot easier to train
somebody up technically than it is to
try to well for like a better turn to
train them up in terms of interpersonal
skills being just a good person easy to
get along with somebody you can
communicate and get along with the
culture much more difficult to transform
this person from a jerk to being a non
jerk than giving them technical skills
so keep that in mind so you want to pre
anti jerk fi yourself if you're getting
into the workforce whether you're going
to be working for a company whether
you're going to set up your own business
we have to deal with clients a big part
about dealing with clients I could again
tell you from experience is being able
to listen to your clients needs and
truly try to understand what they want
what they need what they're going to
what's going to be useful to them
because at the end of the day if you are
a software developer you are essentially
providing a skill I'd say you're
providing a set of services of skill
like a waiter provides a service of
bringing the full of it a jerk waiter
it's not going to get the tip and a jerk
software developer is not going to get
the references so keep that in mind so
that's that's the first part of this
video second part I'm going to end this
video with something that's going to be
totally weird had a character but
something I stumbled across when I was
18 or 19 and it's working wonders and
it's the most amazing dating tip ever
you've never heard this before I
guarantee nobody on the interwebs has
ever mentioned this or said this this is
my strategy I should trade market and it
works like works wonders so before I get
into this unbelievable dating tip which
you could probably find pretty
entertaining let me just go over two
things about your humble
speaker hear me first of all define
autodidact autodidact a self-taught
person that's me I have taught myself
many different programming languages or
taught myself business did a lot of
reading stuff so I'm a self learner who
I've learned much more outside of school
than I have in school and I did
University so that's one thing about me
define polymath polymath a person of
wide-ranging knowledge you're learning
eclectic it what do you mean eclectic
deriving ideas style or taste from a
broad and diverse range of sources there
you go so these three unusual terms
describe me not by design just by that's
how I am that's how my brain is wired so
you've noticed if you're watching in my
previous vlogs i talked about how i
learned from martial arts lessons i
applied these to my coding i applied
them to my business i apply them all
over the place
and vice versa and back forth and so on
and i bring this up because it's going
to foreshadow what i'm going to be doing
with these blogs or vlogs going forward
i'm going to bring in the strands from
these different fields of study that
i've jumped into whether it be in
martial arts would be as published
author and doing a lot of writing that's
it's a certain skill there software
development of course my design
background etc business background
there's other things as well so i'm
going to be bringing these all in
because that's what i actually do in my
thinking whenever I approach the
situation I'm always looking at all
these different experiences so I'm
trying to put together this web if you
will to present it to you guys in a
concise
way anyway so this dating tip or this
pickup tip if you will is something I
developed when I was 18 or 19 and what
the problem was when you're younger at
least for me at the point was you're
always a little nervous to go meet women
right to go up to them talk to strangers
for a lot of people that's like death
you know so what I decided to do was to
flip my motivations on this so people
don't like rejection right you go up to
a girl and she rejects you my god you
know so I can speak to that in other
vlogs but here's that here's the trick I
decided that I was going to make a game
of it so I told a few buddies of mine
said what we're going to do is we're
playing a game is called
get rejected and the point of the game
is to get rejected as much as possible
and so we would see a girl and one of us
would go up go up to her and just be
silly stupid with the intention of
getting rejected and all our friends
would watch and the better to rejection
you got like there was like yeah good
job man I was pretty good rejection and
it became super funny because you were
really motivated to see how badly you
get rejected so you go up to a girl's
and you know actually and you know and
whatever and it was just very
entertaining but what happened was
strangely enough he started failing at
getting rejected you started meeting all
these women and it was very effective in
terms of meeting women because you just
go up to him you are totally confident
because you're assuming you're going to
get rejected and you're hoping you're
going to get rejected because that's the
whole point of the game and what happens
you come in there very confident and
very calm and all sudden you're not
rejected anyway that's my weird tip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
