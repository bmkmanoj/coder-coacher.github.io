show you how to use Dreamweaver cs4 s
templates to easily put up web pages
without too much of a hassle so when you
first launch Dreamweaver you're going to
have this welcome screen here if you
don't have it just go into edit
preferences and show welcome screen
check this off you may have to restart
Dreamweaver to see it so once you've got
that going what you want to do is you
want to go and create new go to more and
you're going to see all kinds of stuff
here this is pretty complex so you're
going to go blank page select HTML you
see that all kinds of options here and
all these different options you know we
always that you know even you see little
Springs it's a flexible layout you can
sort of the title can actually give you
some information about the page to calm
and elastic one column to call elastic
mean this is flexible with type sizes i
will go to all these details here but
let's take a couple of samples so that
we can get an idea so i want to choose
to calm liquid left sidebar header and
footer here we go so we go over we have
a thumbnail view of it before we create
this page what I want to do is look at
two things doctype and layout CSS doc
tape has to do with the document type
that is used for of this particular page
so what exactly is a doctype the doctype
essentially it's just instructions to
the web browser web browser being
internet explorer or firefox etc
construction in terms of how to
interpret how to read the code and I
don't want to go into too many near
details about this but let me just say
that how the browser reads the code will
affect the subtleties of the way it
displays the page and if you don't
choose the right doctype we can cause
some headaches down the road dreamweaver
cs4 was created at a time when XHTML was
all the rage this is 2008-2009 and of
course that was wrong and the way it
should be is actually HTML for strict so
it said no big deal it doesn't take
anything away from Dreamweaver you just
got select HTML
or an old ones trick this is what you
want to use in 2010 and moving forward
layout CSS now all these layouts here of
course are created with CSS code so this
basically is asking you where do you
want to stick all that CSS code you can
create a new file inserted into an
existing file or just add it to the head
of your HTML page the head part is the
part of a page that is you can't see
when you're browsing the web page I'll
show you what that is a second for the
sake of this video I'm going to add it
to the head words in real life you want
to create a new file problem so I'm just
going to add to the head and then hit
create so here's the page now this is
own code we're in code view here so I'm
going to view in design view so here's
the page and all its glory not very
beautiful but what we have here is a
common structure so we don't have to
figure this out because trust me trying
to figure this out in from scratch with
CSS can be a pain in the butt so we're
going to go file and save as I'm just
going to call it liquid liquid page dot
HTML and there you go so now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to preview this
in a web browser so we can see what the
liquid page actually does for us so i'm
gonna hit f12 and here we go so you see
this now as I you see as I expand and
contract the browser the divisions here
the sections contract and expand with it
right gets very small gets very large
that's what a liquid layout will do for
you
so let's look at another type of layout
and let's go two more and again blank
page HTML I want to go with two column
fixed here we go to column fixed you see
a little lock fixed right sidebar header
footer and it's right now it's cool
let's go left sidebar actually so you're
too calm fix left sidebar there's a
sidebar header footer alright so doctype
again for point 01 strip there's several
others but use when you string and
layout will add the head and go create
file and here it is again so i'm just
going to save this file save as i'm
going to call it fixed dash page there
we go so I'm saved now I'm going to
preview this in the browser now watch
this see how expand and contract it
doesn't this doesn't shrink this is a
classic fixed layout I prefer fixed
layout a lot of people prefer fixed
layout simply because it's easier to
manage that if you go to killer sighs
calm we actually use a two column fixed
layout right you see column one column
one column two and we scroll down we got
our footer now this is all styled up to
look good but that's basically what it
is it's a two column layout and it's a
fixed layout so that we got a consistent
size and shape to everything that we do
it is pretty cool I like it
so now that we've used an HTML template
loaded we have what we haven't loaded up
we can change this video we don't matter
no one pet food and you can start adding
your own text you can start inserting
images you do all you want it's pretty
cool but i'm going to show you something
interesting i'm gonna hit delete on the
footer say that i'm going to show you
another template feature but are called
snippets and dreamweaver so if you go to
classic view or designer for you well
design review will be a little bit more
difficult if you let a design review
let's go to classic view and in classic
view and this panel here you can see
files assets you want to go snippets all
right now in snippets you basically have
little snippets of HTML code ready to go
for you to insert so i'm going to go
into footer I don't say I want a basic
text footer and I see look preview right
up here right this is another type of
footer so you know I'll go with this one
and I just going to drop it in right
here drag and drop and lo and behold our
footer is all ready to go we just have
to change up the text and we're ready to
go so let's preview that see how it
looks on the web browser pretty good so
you see with just a couple clicks
Dreamweaver makes it really easy to
start structuring your pages no
headaches you just have to be a designer
now and you know dreamweaver can help
with that and dreamweaver can speed up
the whole web design process but you
still need basic design skills and and
that's why you know we have courses on
that as well alright i hope you found
this useful i'm stefan is Chuck with
killer sites calm and see you on the web</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
