and killer sites calm in this quick
little video blog I want to explain to
you the difference between wwo main name
and just the domain names so let me give
you a quick example so some of you may
not know that there is a big there is a
difference between having the only go
back to studio while having the WWE in
front of this domain name versus just
having the domain name just like studio
web without the WWE now when I hit enter
on the browser or see it goes back to it
at WWE
but in fact those two different domains
are very different let me give you an
example here so we got the site that
basically converts a hostname that's the
domain name to the IP address that's
actually behind the domain name so let
me give you an example killer
sites com so we've got a fine IP address
taking his sweet time oh okay so that's
the IP ok it's 1 7 4 1 4 2 or 6 8 192
now if we let's go to a new window bear
with me for a second now we're going to
go WWE sites calm you know I hate that
and you see it's different it's 70 3831
83 yes alright and do we at the same
time so you see that though they're both
killer sites calm the WWE killer sites
calm in fact has a different IP address
and this is this is the most important
aspect of it this IP address tells the
internet where your site is actually
sitting on which server is actually
sitting and then through server magic
it sends it to the right website on the
server I'm not going to get into about
here but what you should take away from
this video is that WWE name is not the
same place as just the main name now you
see with killer sites we have two
different IPS meaning the killer sites
comm was perceived to be on a different
place or a different server than W
killer sites comm and we know about
because we have a different IP address
now this IP address the 7038 3183 could
be sitting and 174 142 bees two
different IP addresses could be sitting
on the same physical server but they
couldn't they may not be so these are
two different locations and the reason
I'm able to do this now is because we
were moving from one physical server to
the next we're moving to a brand-new
hardware and the people in charge of
managing this stuff the that it's called
the DNS settings for the sites they made
a mistake by only changing that killer
sites comm to the new IP the new IP is
you know this I piece is the is the
address of the new physical boxers
killer sites now sitting on so they made
the mistake of only changing this
information for killer sites calm and
they forgot to change for the www is
calm that's just sloppiness that's all
that was and so yeah so now anybody is
searching for a killer sites calm
without the WWE are going to the new
server and anybody who comes through
with the wwr sites calm which is the
majority now they're going to the old
server so that causes the problems so
there you go you've learned something
but WWE for domain name changes a domain
name and Google recognizes that as well
I had a problem earlier if another set
we have had at the website and
fact I wasn't thinking and I changed it
from WWE how to build to just how to put
websites and I'll set all the traffic
because you're dropping Google's
dropping our traffic and I was like
what's going on here and that's because
as far as school was concerned the real
website was WWWF sites and not just how
to build websites calm and so it wasn't
sending traffic to the to the new site
right how to build web sites calm
without the WWD
yeah I've been doing a ton of work with
the server migrations and another big
project actually three big projects so
it's we're catching up on things now and
hopefully the content will start to fly
again back in the same way you know you
never know you never know what these
things but hopefully very very soon
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
