did a vlog so I'm going to talk about
choosing business partners what to look
for and a couple of tips some advice
based on my own experience I took on my
first business partner when I was 18
years old and the reason I took this
partner on is because he brought to the
table certain contacts and skill sets
that I did not have we were both pretty
broke at the time so it wasn't a money
issue that's one of the things you can
look forward to business partners they
can bring money to the table but my
partner at the time brought in contacts
in industry and skill sets and together
were able to pool our huge amount of
money which was about two hundred
dollars between us and we were able to
start the business and it grew well
actually so when choosing a business
partner you got to look for a
complementary skill sets
maybe they bring money to the table
maybe to bring contacts maybe when I say
complementary skill sets meaning they
have skills that complement your skills
meaning they have skills that are
different from yours see if you're both
skilled in the same thing it's not as
useful as having somebody who has skills
that you don't have so that you can work
together to build and create the
business that all said the number one
thing to look for in a business partner
is trust and work ethic trust and work
ethic so let me expand on trust you got
to be able to trust them because when
you get into business it's it's a very
you know it's it's a very it's a very
binding association potentially because
you can have different types of business
associations where you're not so tied to
the hip if you will and I would I would
advise that type of association over
having a shared corporation or a shared
company well that's also very common
quite useful but what's also very common
is people having
major legal battles with business
partners X business partners so what I
prefer to do in my business partnerships
is to create business-to-business
relationships as opposed to having
partners in one business and the reason
you do the business of business
relationships is that those are much
easier to sever much easier to cleanly
sever that relationship so that being
said you still need to trust your
partners
you still need to feel that they have a
sense of integrity and work ethic that's
so important and if you can find
somebody like that as I actually got a
piece of advice from one of the most my
most successful mentors and he told me
he'd rather have somebody who was
moderately skilled but had a good work
ethic and was a good person you got
along with them easygoing reasonable
than having a highly talented jerk and
highly telogen jerks will not help you
in the medium or long run that's for
sure because they're jerks jerk could be
people who are lazy there could be
people that are dishonest it could be
people that are erratic have emotional
problems so again I rather have
moderately skilled people who are stable
level-headed fair-minded and honest than
the super-talented jerk so keep that in
mind so yeah that's about it part of my
business series and I have some
announces announcements about
cold-related courses I'll do that in the
next vlog which I'm going to film right
after this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
