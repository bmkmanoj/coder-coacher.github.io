we've got this content container but we
haven't done any styling with it so the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to say content clear both and what this
does is it basically tells the browser
that we don't want our float elements to
interfere with our content we want our
content to appear underneath so if i
refresh this my content should peer
underneath now so it looks like my
background color here isn't showing up
let's just go back oh I've got a typo
here I forgot my colon after height
refresh this again okay so now it looks
like a regular navigation system except
that it look doesn't look like any of
the navigational items are actually
selected right now so let's fix that I'm
going to start off by saying that my dot
nav list item a of type active should
have a background of white perfect next
I want to change the height of it to 35
pixels if you think about this the
reasoning behind it is that we want to
create that little indent here to show
that it is an active element I don't
know if you saw that but if I just get
rid of that you'll see if you go very
closely in here if i refresh this again
they all have the same width but if I
have that height of 35 pixels then
there's that slight indentation I know
it's a detail but it's kind of nice also
I want to make the text a little more
obvious so I'm going to say Anna so dot
nav Li dot active and a in other words
only take the hyperlink that
is selected under the class name dot
active in the navigation of class type
dot nav or AB nap and again we'll just
say that we want our text decoration to
be none and we'll just specify a nice
red and 5 45 b i'm not really sure
refresh this oh I keep missing those
colons okay there we go so we've got
ourselves a nice red over there looks
good so with our very simple navigation
in place we're going to start attaching
some events because right now if I click
on it you can see that the pound sign is
showing up at the top which is very nice
and also it's not actually doing
anything so to start off let's go back
here to our top and we're going to
create some new events we don't need our
mutate stuff that we did in the last
tutorial but we're going to be creating
some click events so it's actually quite
simple all we need to do is select
anything inside the dot nav that's a
list item of and it's a hyperlink inside
of a list item inside of a class of type
nav so that's basically all of the list
items click and then we're going to
create an anonymous function close that
up and then inside here we want to first
off clear any class of type active so
i'm going to say dot nav li dot
removeclass active now that there aren't
any active classes i want to add one to
this which is the hyperlink parent go up
to the list item dot add class active
lastly i just want to return false we
hit save again refresh this page and if
I click on here if I click on here or if
I click on here you can see that our
active navigation is now being set just
kind of neat and we could extend this
example by having a bunch of hidden divs
and then putting our content in those
hidden divs and we could have like a
Content a and a Content be and a Content
see and then we could just show
different content on the page with a bit
of a JAX lastly I want to show you a bit
of navigation I'm going to open up the
dollar sign again except this time it'll
be dot nav Li so in other words just a
list item not the hyperlink and we're
going to say hover function I'm going to
open this up comma function I'll explain
this in a minute open that up and then
we're just going to close our hover
function so our hover function takes two
arguments both of which are functions
and these functions are for the on state
and off state in other words when we
mouse over it and one when you mouse off
of whatever we are hovering on so in
this case we hover on to the list item
when we hover on whatever we put in to
this part will fire and then when we
hover off whatever we put on this part
will fire I'll just show you what that
means in a second with a console dot log
hover on and we can make this a little
more apparent with a bit of handy
logging it save refresh this open fire
bug and you can see that it's hovering
on and off so that's working just going
to comment these lines out and we're
going to do a bit of animation instead
so I'm going to say this dot animate
again we're going to use our curly
braces and this time we're going to
animate instead of by saying fast or
slow we're going to specify the number
of milliseconds so 150 is pretty fast
and then I'm going to say that the line
height should be 25 pixels when I hover
over it and when I'm done it should go
back to 10 pixels which if you remember
is what we specified over here our line
height if i refresh this again you'll
see that we're getting a bit of
animation in the next video we're going
to be looking at how we can actually
manipulate the document object model in
other words how we can lip in other
words how we can manipulate the HTML on
