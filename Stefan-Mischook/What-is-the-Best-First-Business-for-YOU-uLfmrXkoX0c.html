put to me what would be a very good
first business will be a good first
business again into when you're new to
being an entrepreneur I think the
easiest way to get into the whole
entrepreneur game is to get into
freelancing in some sort whether it be
technology you're writing code building
websites building apps maybe you're
doing design work who knows whatever the
catering freelancing is just hiring
yourself out for your time you negotiate
a rate you negotiate a contract you set
support you set the parameters in terms
how the contract is going to work out
how you're going to do your work with
the client you could be a DJ for
instance when you're DJing you are a
contractor you were negotiated for a gig
for a job you get paid a certain amount
so why is this a good first choice for
an entrepreneur because it's a quick and
easy way to get into the world of
business world of business has a lot to
do with understanding negotiations
understanding dealing with clients
dealing with their party businesses it's
a very different situation than working
for someone the relationship is
different
the way you manage yourself is different
when you go in there as a contractor for
example you're not subservient to your
client you're actually equal to your
client whereas when you go work for
somebody they call the shots very
specifically what time you're going to
show up how much you're going to get
paid when you can go and break all this
kind of stuff when you're a contractor
yes you negotiate the price there are
deadlines and so on but you have a lot
of flexibility in terms of what type of
work you're going to do when you're
going to do to work how you're going to
do to work so this is a big part of the
learning
in business why do I pick freelancing
again it's quick and easy to get into
you're selling your time it's the I
would call it the lowest level of being
entrepreneur meaning this is the entry
level of being an entrepreneur now don't
get me wrong you can make a lot of money
as a freelancer especially if you're
highly paid and successful coder I know
coders to make big money and in my last
couple of years especially as a
freelance developer I was making very
very good money for my time and for a
bunch of reasons but we'll get into that
in another video so yeah if you're
looking to get a taste of business how
it's like in the business world my
suggestion for you is to freelance take
whatever skills you have if you don't
have skills develop some sort of skill
that you could then sell to small
business owners to small businesses that
kind of thing
it will really get your it will get your
feet wet if you will I hope you
understand the process help you
understand the lifestyle the lifestyle
of an entrepreneur is a very different
lifestyle from somebody who's working
for somebody as an example when you're
entrepreneur you're going to have to be
much more attentive in terms of your
money how you manage your money you're
gonna have to be able to contend with
ups and downs of the entrepreneurial
lifestyle life a lifestyle you could
have some great months and years and
then you can have some really down years
that's where money management comes in
it's such a huge thing when you're an
entrepreneur the rules are not the rules
that you figure they are in terms of the
business world in terms of pricing how
you negotiate how you work this is all
very different from working for somebody
so you got to keep that in mind again
I'm not getting into details here
because it's just a quick vlog so there
you go you want to be an entrepreneur
find a skill set use one of your skill
sets that you could use to then sell out
there if you're working full time and
you're not sure about getting into it I
was to suggest even if even if you want
to go full-time as an entrepreneur I
would suggest you start off slowly you
take side gigs weekend job job
you can do at night you want to first
start developing entrepreneur skills
before you drop your your job and jump
into it because you may find you're not
liking it too much and of course I think
anything else when you're starting out
something new you got to learn you got
to learn how it works how goes how the
whole process works out so you're gonna
have some stumbles that's normal so give
yourself some breathing space by not
jumping in there two feet in right away
slowly go in slowly it's kind of like
well I'll use a Canadian analogy when
the winter first comes in in Canada the
lakes freeze over but the first month or
so you got to be very careful about
walking on the ice on the lake because
the ice may not be thick enough and you
can fall through and you're dead saving
with business you want to pretend you're
walking on a nice ice cover Lake you
want to take your time
make sure it's thick enough slowlyslowly
approach it so you know what's ahead of
you and it's so it's an incremental
process it's a process we test things
out you pull back try different things
pull back and slowly slowly but surely
you make progress and then what will
happen you'll see this in business it's
going to be like hardly any progress
hardly a progress and finally boom you
get a big spike in sales and activity
that slow slow slow
boom it's rarely I've seen in business
where people every week or reminders
every six months they go up like this
it's more like a boom in this level boom
and that's how it works so yeah
freelancing great way to get into it no
matter what skills you have to freelance
with of course the more valuable skills
the better that's why I suggest for
freelancing I always say the web stack
HTML CSS JavaScript PHP because PHP is
so widely used in small business and
there you have it I hope this is useful
just in case you're wondering yeah it's
pretty white in this room this is my
home office and I got the windows well
behind the camera
just wall-to-wall windows facing the
mountain and I'd like to give you the
mountain scene but the lighting coming
off of the windows is complimentary I
can need all the help I can get
and yeah I just been tearing apart this
office getting rid of old junk and I
think we're gonna have people come in
and I think it needs a paint job or
something so yeah the walls are kind of
white kind of plain I call it the white
room all the decor is you can't see it
now so anyway there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
