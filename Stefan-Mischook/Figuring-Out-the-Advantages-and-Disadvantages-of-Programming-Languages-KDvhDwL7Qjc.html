little screencast just because I don't
want to comb my hair today
so yeah let's ask her questions
straight-6 said yesterday you mentioned
various frameworks Ruby java.net Pisa
PHP Python well of course he's
mentioning languages here Ruby Java PHP
Python dotnet is a framework but the
rest are just languages but I know what
he means he's talking about the
frameworks that come with the languages
like Ruby has Ruby on Rails Java has
many but spring is the predominant one
PHP has laravel and a symphony and
CodeIgniter python has de jank Django
excuse me and flask
so what's answers question can you
discuss advantages and disadvantages of
each of these so we can choose which to
use for a particular application use
case if not do you have any references
so it's a big question I answered it I
so too many variables to discuss with
regards to framework frameworks a lot of
times subjective opinion gets into the
mix and it is hard to get an accurate
assessment that said generally PHP is
easiest to get up and running with this
is in terms of training people PHP is
you write your PHP code you upload the
PHP page to the server that's PHP enable
which you know you throw a rock in a
general direction you hit ten of them
and where you go your PHP is running
also PHP runs faster at runtime faster
than Ruby and Python Ruby on Rails
Python Django it's just a much faster
language especially with the release of
PHP 7 I don't know about a year ago or
whatever it was
Java runs faster once the initial
compile is complete Java because it's a
compiled language it compiles down to
Java bytecode hegets calls for so many
years and once it compiles it runs
really really fast but that this will
hit the compilation you know the first
request boom then you're ready to go of
course it might be pre compiling with
more modern frameworks I don't know the
problem of Java though is it's a very
verbose language is a strongly typed
language so it takes longer to develop
web apps in Java than it does in Ruby
pie
our PHP is just the nature of the
language itself that said you get more
control and it runs faster at runtime
generally speaking I'm not using Java
for startups personally because I can
more nimbly create web apps using PHP or
PHP laravel or Python Django or Ruby and
rails or etcetera etc so keep that in
mind I would use asp.net if I was
logging into an MS based infrastructure
or had the talent on staff a lot of
times when you're making a business
decision with regards to the language
which you're choosing you have to look
at the technology itself but you also
have to look at what are your human
resources what do you have do you have
PHP guys on staff do you have Microsoft
people etc etc what's what's in your
grasp that's a very important thing to
consider always when you're looking at
any type of business model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
