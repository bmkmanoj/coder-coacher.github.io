row I'm drinking my little drink here
this is actually some fruity tea that I
I I cook and then I freeze so it's it's
very tasty but it's no sugar so it's
actually pretty good for you at least
that's what I think anyhow so this is a
vlog um of course I'm doing it on my
little webcam here it's just much easier
this is a vlog I think many people have
been waiting for my top 5 developer
contract clauses so these are top 5
clauses I think you should include in
any developer contract number one the 33
split clause in terms of a payment
should be at the top or now somewhere
near the top I have discussed this in
another video you can look it up another
clause that should be in there put it
down a little bit near the bottom just
like when you buy a car you own the code
until the final payment is made remember
that you own the code until the final
payment is paid just like if you buy a
car until you make that final payment
you know Ford owns that car and if they
balk at this particular clause this
remind them of the car clause and the
reason you do guys that you don't want
to be have 9% at a website done where
you've only been paid half or maybe 66%
and then they decide that they're gonna
get their their buddy to do the final
touches on it and not give you the rest
which is not fair so you own the code
and don't give up the code until you get
payment in full
whether it be an app a website a web app
whatever number three number three
maximum three revisions of a website or
app you got to put that in there after
you give the first drafts they have
three revisions and they got a sign-off
and every revision there should be in
the original contract so everybody's
clear up front otherwise you might find
you
in revision hell where they keep coming
back to you with more and more revisions
which is a you know which instead of
being revisions but actually they end up
being new versions of your website or
app number four
the client must sign off on I know if
that's a developer contract clause but
well here's tip number four the client
has to sign off on the initial contract
and on the final release form you got to
make sure that you have them sign the
original contract which you each get a
copy and then when you finalize the work
that last revisions in you both sign
it's done and you both sign get a copy
so after you get that you know final
release written out it's called a
release so okay your release of any
obligation with regard to the site and
and the the app that you produce so any
new work after that is new work it's new
contract new mighty very important
another thing is you put in the final
contract very important sort of part of
this you know client must sign off you
should have in there Freeman of
liability clause I forget the exact term
you can look it up on Google it just
sucks my mind so basically what's the
final is approved by the client you are
free of any obligation or damages any
extra work must be paid for by the
client this is related to signing off
but this should be in there you know
indicating that you are now free of any
obligations visa via work so he can't
come back or she can't come back and
give you crap for whatever happens you
know software or software breaks but you
can't be held accountable for website
revisions and updates well Adams you put
up a web app and then their web server
changes some configuration and cPanel
and everything blows up you can't be
held responsible for that so that's why
you gotta have that clause which you
know everything is dated of course make
sure everything is dated and make sure
you have a signed copy your own signed
copy
that's important so yeah these are the
five or call the five elements of a
developer contract these are five
elements four clauses one one thing you
know I told you you should have
something where they sign off on this
signing off on obligations that you may
have towards the particular job that you
did for them and there you go if you
have these that's a pretty good place to
start this is not necessarily a complete
contract but these are my important
aspects of the contract I would
definitely have these in and you go a
long way to protecting yourself in those
cities in place
I make no warranty or no promises of the
efficacy of my suggestions because every
situation is different and these are my
suggestions but this will help you a
long way in terms of immunizing yourself
as I just immunize myself against any of
you coming back at me and telling me you
told me to put this in the contract but
they came after me with this and not any
other thing I can't you know you know
can't account for everything anyway
that's it I hope you found this video
useful if you did I'm gonna do like
everybody else on YouTube does like or
share the video
the more likes I get the more views I
get the more I'm encouraged do more of
these videos yeah that's about it
