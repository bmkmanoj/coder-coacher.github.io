the books that I have in my collection
so I figured I would show you some of
them now as I mentioned a previous vlog
I've had literally hundreds of nerd
books and I throw out the vast majority
I'm down to like 28 now so I'm just
going to go through a few but I kept
some of them might be interesting to buy
some of them I just kept for nostalgia
so anyway just out of curiosity for
people so this is a book the HTT
developers handbook this covers the
basics of the hypertext Transfer
Protocol the underpinnings of the of the
web and you see that this book was
published I guess I bought it when I
came around 2003 this is actually one of
my later books I threw out a whole lot
of other books but this might be an
interesting book because HTTP HTTP
protocol has not changed and if you're
getting into really low-level coding
this could be kind of interesting you
learn how the how the HTTP protocol
actually functions so there's a cool
book something that every coder should
learn something called regular
expressions every major language
supports at Java PHP Python Ruby c-sharp
dot everything and regular expressions
allows you to parse text
like nothing else out there it's pretty
archaic looking it's kind of like a a
language within a language and yet
regular expressions this is one of these
key skill sets every developer should
learn at least a little it ought to be a
master of it we should understand the
basics and when the regular expressions
allows you to do again is to parse text
and it could be very useful tool to have
in terms of your skill sets this is an
older writing book and wasn't printed
yeah this is the later edition 2002 so
I'm sure they got later editions but the
regular expressions hasn't changed so
that's why I keep this this is one of my
older books SQL fundamentals SQL
structured query language the language
of databases this is a very hands-on
book when I get this may I here
somewhere
1999 1999 with the 99er imprinting yep
so I bought this bobby-boy in 1999 so
this is a good book again I kept it
because fundamentals of SQL hasn't
change now I know why it's well pretty
well but you can get into do I get into
say inner and outer joins and stuff like
that it's kind of cool to have this well
this is my book it's not all of this
book I wrote 2015 this is from a letter
from the publisher and to me and this is
actually a test printing it was printed
by this company here
Everest printing college in China said
yes it was a Chinese company that
printed it so written in Canada
published in the UK and printed in China
can get this all over the US as well
still out there now I wrote this book to
be ever green meaning CSC
UK edition I wrote this book to be
evergreen meaning that in five years
unless I'm wrong what I covered here
will not have change because unlike you
know ten years ago 15 years ago the web
technologies have not changed they serve
reached a level plateau not a very
stable html5 is html5 css3 css3
basically bootstrap basic bootstrap
basic jobs for Success Center so this
book covers a severe total beginner get
the book now you get a very cheap on
Amazon highly reviewed the next in book
get you up and running one of the
reasons I wrote this book was it was
helping me to plan out the new
curriculum for studio well there's
another little book headfirst guess if
this is one of O'Reilly books were very
visual I bought it it was kind of
interesting to look at at this point I
knew JavaScript variable
teaching and so to me is again these are
all like my newer books and this one was
printed in 2008 so JavaScript book real
thick ones right used to be actually
much thicker than this and I have a
similar type of book at first design
patterns design patterns are basically
a way to design your apps and so I
haven't looked at this book in a long
time so I'm not sure how relevant it is
but again these are the latest looks
like thrown out so many books they're
much older than these yeah this one was
printed in - this is a 2004 edition
I bought that yeah so it's been a long
time this is again if you wanted these
books you have to see if they have later
versions my JavaScript course covers
just about everything it's covered in
here in video for my interactive
training so it's better I think but you
know if you like to read this might be a
good book yeah but you won't want to get
the later edition of that these are
probably the necks of it after a while
so here's a classic book Martin Fowler
this is like refactoring is basically
going through your code and optimizing
it and making it better this is this is
a classic book and it I think it teaches
with Java code was this particular self
the hard hearts of the cover this is
$19.99 so $19.99 so yeah this teaches
you to all the jobs with the techniques
terms of refactoring techniques if like
any language you can apply these
principles although if you're doing PHP
I think you could find PHP with
factoring tutorials and courses and
books to doing Python you probably find
that as well but this is the seminal
book word I think it all came from so I
bought this at the time but this is
actually a very important book this is a
later book the original book actual
original book is from the mid-90s where
he talked about usability and stuff so
he takes the whole new level this author
Jakob Nielsen and this book is much
later book
yeah 2010 so that's like a new book for
me so yeah I kept this one I threw out
the old one because I knew to stuff now
this book
I keep this book because it is cute calm
I did not write this book but the author
passed on his website that represented
his book to me back in 1999 or 2000 it
was 1999 so I keep it because you know
it's just you know it's a personal thing
all the information here is totally
irrelevant teaches old school designing
web design and that we do not do anymore
that at the time C 1997 at the time this
book was like totally like
groundbreaking like these are
groundbreaking sites these layouts trust
me at the time and of course he talks
about here how one day we'll be able to
use CSS one day but CSS ability you know
they're worth back down this is like a
super advanced site at the time so it's
kind of cool so I keep it again
reminds me of my youth back in the 90s I
had the first edition and it was 1996
the first edition and I had many many
other books beyond that and I just threw
him out so being here I used to write a
lot for web designer magazines and I had
stacks of them and how he kept a few
articles here I just cut out you know
segments pages rather so yeah here's the
article alright there's somebody you
know Stefan apparently I'm a CSS expert
so I wrote a little commentary here what
else is there
yeah again I just sliced up pages
because I didn't feel like dragging out
his magazines here we go again recognize
my frog are teaching a little jQuery
here this goes back here load JavaScript
here
more JavaScript these are every month
ASA submit course material to these guys
to web designer magazine published out
of the UK here's like the first page
your experts boom-boom-boom looks
familiar
so here I'm writing the patent provides
third installment of this qrp speak on
video tutorials anyone so yeah
here is the Oh PHP q our PHP techniques
and tricks Oh old articles I wrote and
how to go to the contact form to give
you an idea how baited this is
Dreamweaver eight so I just kept a few
of them you know and many more now here
it is my frog again so there that's it
people somebody at least one person
today well I can see some of your books
now I threw out like I said it's a vast
majority because they were too old I
still have about twenty books but these
are the relevant ones books that I have
now are on I bought some books on
advanced game design with JavaScript
courses and that'll cure see what people
are doing and I bought some Python books
of course because before I do a course I
like to research the latest and greatest
see what's out there besides what's on
the web so yeah now whether or not you
decide to use a book that's up to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
