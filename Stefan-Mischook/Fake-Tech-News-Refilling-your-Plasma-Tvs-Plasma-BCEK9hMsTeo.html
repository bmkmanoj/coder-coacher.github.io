bit of a fun vlog on fake tech news now
I decided to do this because I've ran
into some fake tech news recently which
I at least I think it is and a good
friend of mine was telling me about a
classic fake tech news as you know the
the interwebs the Internet is filled
with a lot of information some of it
false
and with the recent election in the US
there's a lot of talk about fake news
and fake news actually exists outside of
political spheres as well - all over the
place I'll give you an example a classic
one if you check up if you do a search
on Google rather for leaking plasma TVs
one of the first things will come out is
a search result on samsung site or the
question on the site is do I have to
refill my plasma TVs this is you know
this is fake news because plasma TVs the
plasma is sealed into into the TVs and
little cells and you know you don't have
to refill but this was a commonly held
beliefs it's fake tecnu who sells out
there people actually felt that they had
to refill their plasma TVs and a friend
of mine had a plasma TV and his
co-workers gonna come up to him say hey
when you refill your plasma do you have
to bring it to the shop or does he come
and refill it for you there were a lot
of people thought this was the case so I
thought that was kind of funny little
fake tech news so why did I bring this
up because I ran into what I think is
fake tech news so I have a Canon camera
here and I was looking at getting a new
lens a different type of lens for a
different type of shot and the Sigma
lenses out there Sigma is a brand of
lenses that have a series of lenses
called the art series that are highly
regarded for their sharpness highly
regarded for their sharpness and but if
you go online on all these YouTube
videos and reviews you hear a lot of
chatter about how the lenses have
trouble auto focusing and people say
which you know they try
just um and they're having troubles and
you know autofocus and there's trouble
with the auto focusing and he see this
all over the place and I thought to
myself after how do I touch these lenses
are beautiful but apparently they can't
autofocus very well so I was interesting
to me because the Sigma lenses are
literally half the price of the
equivalent canyonlands and sometimes
apparently people say the Sigma lens is
sharper than the equivalent canon and
they're half the price so you're
wondering I wonder what's going on with
that so anyway I decided to go to a
local camera store brought my camera my
ATD Canon and they had a bunch of Sigma
lenses I put them on I did auto focusing
I assumed that they were gonna fail but
I did like ten minutes of auto focusing
and people running back and forth like
this and he focused perfectly all the
time I tried three different Sigma
lenses sees we had two tried three
different Sigma lenses and they all auto
focus perfectly you know as strange
thing I was very surprised to see that
and so I asked the guy working behind a
calendar at the camera store said you
know I read online with these these
lenses don't focus properly and he
looked at me and smirking he said yeah
you they see a lot of things online so
yeah just a quick little fun vlog fake
tech news
I think the refilling the plasma TVs is
funnier but you know the Sigma lens
thing that's this weirdest anyway I
thought you'd find that entertaining
