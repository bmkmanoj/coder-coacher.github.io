is show you to the page I'm going to
show you a few things regards to page
structuring so we have this text called
loans says welcome to the page now this
we know it's formatted in a paragraph
right says here p paragraph and if we
look at a code view here it is here
right P for paragraph so I like to say
that this is a heading this is the top
of the page on the status is heading 1
remember when it comes to headings the
lower the number the more important it
is so heading 1 is considered more
important than heading 2 and so on so
let's select that again we look h1
heading 1 and so we're going to do that
of course what we see here is the
default wave at the browser displays
heading ones but just so you see heading
to notice a little bit smaller heading 3
a little bit smaller since this is the
top of the page i'm gonna make it a
heading 1 that in itself is not the most
important thing but you understand the
logic here so this i'm going to say this
is a heading to a little bit smaller and
you know what i was going to cheat copy
and paste this hit enter so i'm going to
push that down now this is interesting
we'll look at that later so let me say
this is a heading 3 now let's preview
what we got here as you can see the text
goes beyond the div so let's take a look
at a cold and see what's going on there
so it's the main content yeah because we
gave it a height of 482 pics which will
cause some problems which change that to
percentage I'm going to say it's 100
then I'll hit enter and which preview
that see if anything changes worse so
there you go you see how to div now
because we gave it a percentage its
extended far enough to hold all our
texts in place of course you see on this
side this div is not extending itself
automatically so you're going to have to
set that manually although in other
videos outside this course especially if
you get into co to show you how you can
set this up so that you can keep these
two divs matching but again here's a
classic example where if you design your
own template from scratch as we've done
here you can start running into little
problems like this where divs don't
match up or things get pushed around so
it comes down to tweaking to get these
things to work out right but if you use
a template as I suggest a lot of these
little problems have been solved for us
anyhow let's go back to our page so I'm
going to refresh this view so in a
little view and should be a refresh here
somewhere well you know I was close it
and we open up again oops wrong one
center line so that we have a see it's
not doing it for some reason a little
bug and dreamweaver I guess owl what
you're going to do anyhow so we have our
view here let's make sure everything is
cool but we know the browser render
things properly so we're okay remember
this design view is an approximation of
what you're going to see in the page so
sometimes as we see here and dreamweaver
doesn't do a stellar job at that
unfortunately but let's just confirm hi
hun percent okay so we're good we're
good Allah what you're going to do so
doesn't matter because all it matters
really is what renders in the web page
itself if people see so let's let's
style these headings these heading tags
so we're usually heading 1 heading 2
heading 3
if you recall scroll up going to shrink
this just to create some room select
this and we see heading one here right
select this heading to select this
heading three so let's open up our our
CSS style sheet and we're going to
create a new style so we also a new rule
and we'll create it in this document
only we're going to go tag so we're
going to select heading 1 okay so what
can we do here we can set the font for
that heading but I'm going to do
something better than setting the fonts
on each of the heading tags I'll show
you where you can set the font on the
body tag and take advantage of the
Cascade you see what I mean a second so
let's say we'll say the size of this is
18 point and we'll say it's bold and
we'll leave say its upper case since
it's a heading we'll leave the colored
empty default so this goes to the
default black so you look okay so you
see are heading 1 has changed right so
if we well it's a data property let's
say we go color and we say it's blue see
how it turns blue we say red we'll keep
it red so here we go welcome to the page
is it heading 1 and you know 18 Pikes is
a little small little 24 pics there we
go let me save that file save now let's
let's add another property to our style
so if we go in here anyone what's that
another one new CSS rule say tag again
this time let's effect are heading to in
this document only tag we've done all
this before we're pros now so i would
say bold so yeah sighs I'll say 18 you
know what remind you interest of 20
animus a case uppercase
and color watch watch what I can do with
the moms big picture I can actually go
anywhere in Dreamweaver and pick a color
i want so i'm going to say we'll keep
the same color a lot of keep writing is
consistent so you okay will apply then
ok and here we go are heading to has now
been affected here it is heading to
finally of heading number three right
heading 3 so let's add that as well plus
tag scroll down heading 3 this document
only okay I'll go wait bold go 18 point
again we use the picker same color so
what it looks like there we go so it's a
little bit smaller so let's save this
again preview f12 and here's our page at
a one two and three courses colors
pretty obnoxious so maybe we should
change that I don't know change it to
light gray and then we'll go ahead to
more like a dark gray rather and
pettings number one you selected up here
heading number one say the same thing
you know if we go into our properties
panel we can affect the color to write
down here I select it and it gives us
access right here so we have some
options in that regard but so should we
click to CSS button pops will when you
click this it pops open to the current
CSS rule that were we have our mouse
over so if i'll select that it changed
it to be the next heading see 24 pics
notice the heading to so you get the
idea what say that again f12 preview so
here's a page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
