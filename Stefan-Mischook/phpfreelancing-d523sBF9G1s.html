killer size calm I'm well in this video
tutorial I want to show you something
very interesting about PHP and
freelancing opportunities before I get
into that I just want to point out but
I'm using my ultra sensitive mic so you
may hear unusual sounds in the
background this mic is so sensitive in
fact if I'm an ant walks across the
floor it might pick it up so my
apologies alright so I cut the screen
capture here I cut this from a popular a
freelancing site or people go and they
can check out projects that are
available I forget the name of the site
I copied this a few days ago so you know
know well my apologies for not
mentioning the site what's relevant here
is the projects or that are available on
the site now this is a pretty decent
sample size meaning there's a lot of
projects here now a few thousand I would
imagine and you can get a good idea of
what the demand is out there in terms of
freelancing work and as I've been saying
for a number of years now PHP rules
write PHP here's number one with 2079
projects available Web Design is number
two with 1600s and so on and well I
guess that's the main point of this
video as I've been saying for a while if
you're looking to get into freelance
work small business startup web design
and web programming work rather PHP is
the way to go another thing I want to
point out is that in the top two roles
you notice you have MySQL that's
probably PHP work as well because you
know MySQL and MySQL excuse me and PHP
sort of go hand-in-hand you look at down
a for throwing at Facebook Facebook is
written of course in PHP so that's
another PHP
project here let's go down a little bit
more now we're going down a little bit
here but you got Joomla again that's PHP
you got blog chances are if it's blog
work it's probably WordPress PHP look
we're pressing 322 PHP so as you can see
even though PHP is at the top of the
stack here there's also a lot of other
areas where actual PHP work is hidden in
there if you look at the dotnet in the
Java requests now this is a little
skewed because when you got Java and.net
this is stuff that you typically will
see more often in the enterprise meaning
in very large corporations government
type of work and I would doubt that
these type of places big corporations of
government are going to be hiring people
from a freelancer site so this is a
little skewed in high regard
what surprised me with this list though
is I haven't found any Ruby programming
and Ruby is you know is is growing very
quickly has been for several years now
especially since the Ruby on Rails thing
took off a few years back but it's
really strange I can't find any C html5
even C classic ASP which is kind of
funny but where's the Ruby I guess they
just don't offer Ruby on this I don't
know I have to look into it but anyway I
would imagine another freelancing sites
you're gonna see a lot more Ruby work
although still I think PHP is going to
rule and be dominant for many years to
come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
