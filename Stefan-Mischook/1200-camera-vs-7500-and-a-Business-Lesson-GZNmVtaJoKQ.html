video shot with a about a $1,200 camera
Canon a TD with a pretty decent lens and
I just wanted to show you what this
looks like and we're gonna compare this
it's about $1,200 u.s. camera versus my
$7,500 cinema camera so that you can see
the difference and see if it's worth it
to you just in terms of picture quality
and then I'll give you my thoughts
afterwards now if you're asking yourself
Steph this is a coating and business
channel why are you talking about
cameras you silly nerd well one of the
things I do is try to demonstrate
universal principles that you'll see in
many different fields in many different
disciplines that's why I bring up the
boxing the martial arts the business of
coding and now the cameras so if you
understand some of these universal
principles and it's going to help you
with your coding career your business
career your freelance career just
getting a job etc and of course in this
case camera so you help decide and
consider diminishing returns and things
that you buy and see if well will
continue from here let me get my cinema
camera out and then we'll see how that
looks
so now I'm recording at the same time
with the same lighting with a very
expensive camera now this is the one I
was using just before it's a $1,200
camera Canon 80 deep or as good and now
I'm recording this video with a $7,500
camera I would say that the video
quality optimally is 25% better
depending on your eye some people might
say it so much better
here's the problem I'm an intermediate
level camera operator so even with DSLRs
this when it comes to high-end cinema
cameras I'm just a beginner so you'll
see in the last 50 100 videos or so what
I've been doing the majority of them
with this camera here the big cinema
camera I simply have been learning the
the game I've been learning how to use
the camera properly so you see sometimes
that can't the image is super sharp
sometimes it's a little overexposed
sometimes you see a blue sheen because
I'm not balancing the white balance
properly etc etc I've been learning how
to use it with the big with the great
power of this camera there's a lot of
details you have to understand so I've
been learning that and it's as much my
hobby as anything else why am I doing
this
well I want you understand in business
and in Co in life there's sometimes
something called a law of diminishing
returns what does that mean
that means sometimes as you spend more
and more money on something with the
expectation of increased quality how
much more quality of get really
diminishes so let me just say let's say
this camera here which is 7500 versus
1200 this camera might be image wise 25%
better and 30% better depending on the
circumstances but it's of course
multiples the cost of this camera the
advantage of this camera though is that
has all kinds of capabilities around it
really makes it easy in terms of work
flow remember I talked about that in
software development I chalked up I
talked about that in business what if I
have a good business that has really
good workflows and now workflow is a
flow of work and it's basically a way
that you do your daily activities of the
business to maximize your productivity
which means profits at the end of the
process in software workflows while
software workflows plays a big role in
terms the efficiency of how you write
and deploy your apps I've talked about
that in terms of freelancing right where
what are the things freelancers have to
do is have to develop some good
workflows to maximize their time you can
do this through just good old fashioned
from business processes coding processes
by having a strict structure in terms of
how you write your code leveraging
frameworks and libraries etc except
cetera so so this camera here because
it's a pro camera it makes the workflows
easier so for example if I want assets
and they call a white balance on this
camera I just press a button it's on the
side bing-bang it's done Bob's your
uncle this is more difficult I have to
go into some menu but boom it's two
three steps versus one step and there's
many many examples of that where this
professional camera just smooths out the
workflow now how much faster will made
you maybe it will make you twenty
percent faster maybe to make you ten
percent faster maybe make you fifty
percent faster depending on
circumstances now if you're just a soul
soul vlogger a hobbyist doesn't make too
much of difference but if you're on a
budget where you have a crew your film
crew and you're paying lots of money per
hour to save 10% it could save you a lot
of money so I was talking to friend buy
who manages some of the biggest
commercial projects in Montreal he's a
location manager and he tells me it's
gonna be the budgets were spending you
know half a million dollars if they can
save 10% and save 50 grand or even save
5% and say 25 grand on a shoot because
they're using a similar camera if it has
all these tools to speed up the workflow
it's worth it to them right so I bought
this camera because I wanted to improve
the quality of my video I wanted to have
less headaches and terms of me producing
my videos I don't have to tinker around
with this thing the other thing and so
it just makes it more pleasant
especially since I'm doing almost daily
videos now what I plan to do and take
time because I'm developing my skills I
planned to up the quality not just a
frequency but the quality so I may
reduce the number of videos I put out
for a week but I'm hoping to increase
the quality of the videos and that's
pretty much it this was meant to be a
short vlog but that's why I don't have
my lapel mic at my overhead mic so you
might be hearing me from buddy on the
side of the room at least you get that
sound so yeah what to take away I think
you can you can see how
using cameras and shooting videos how it
relates to business how it relates to
software development in terms of
workflows in terms of diminishing
returns this channel is much more than
just about codes about code business and
that's why I relate to different areas
out there I've related to martial arts
relate to boxer and relate to business I
relate their coding I relate to cameras
now to help you to understand some
universal principles gotta serve you
really well whether you have a software
developer whether you start a business
whether you get into freelancing and of
course in this situation whether you
decide to buy a camera so all right
we'll talk soon
