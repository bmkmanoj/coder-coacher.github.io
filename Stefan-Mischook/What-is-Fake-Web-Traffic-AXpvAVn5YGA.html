struggle of killer sites and happy new
year I'm recording this on January 1st
2013 I wanted to open up a year with a
little insight into traffic and fake
traffic so what is fake traffic well let
me give you a quick example
so I've killer sites calm we see we got
our social networking buttons here and
that's where you see the greatest
example the greatest example of fake
traffic Facebook is one of them so let's
say I click on the share button you see
the screen pops up and when you type in
something and it posts this to Facebook
now I'm sort of visiting Facebook at
this point right but I'm not really
interacting with the site I'm just
posting something that's all that is a
type of fake traffic because as you can
see here there's nothing you can
monetize here it's very difficult for
Facebook to make any money here because
you're not really doing much with the
Facebook site and this is actually one
of the generous examples of a Facebook
of what Facebook considers traffic the
worst of course is I think is the like
buttons yes so if I go to this popular
site Huffington Post I I don't read this
very often myself now if I like this
button how to prevent a cure
how to prevent here hangover is moving
so that pisses me off when they when
they collapse the ad and then the whole
screen moves that's just really bad
usability so if you if you click the
like button I guess I'm just gonna like
this button here see that's it it didn't
even take me anywhere right it's light
and it shows up in my facebook profile
of course but is that really a visit to
Facebook site it's not but according to
Facebook it is in a huge number of
Facebook's visits their traffic is
derived from these like buttons
this is an old 1990 style web traffic
trick or hack it's fake traffic it's not
real real traffic is when you go to the
site and you visit the site and you read
the content on site not when you hit a
share and a window pops up or you hit a
like button and nothing happens so
Facebook a lot of the so-called traffic
is derived from likes and shares I think
something like 80% so it's when they
release their information when they were
about to go public they talked about
this on page 80 they don't want people
to know so that's why it's wetter
reasons anyway why as I posted on this
blog way before they went public but I
thought the stock was way overvalued
because I know from my own web
experience over the last 15 years that
that type of traffic the fake traffic I
just talked about
it doesn't monetize it doesn't make
money and in the end it is what it is
it's just fake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
