related vlog i'm gonna good mood today
again I got my coffee I had a pretty
good ache today for breakfast so by the
way I didn't do that 24 hour for 24 12
hour fast I cut it down because I said
oh yes somebody reminded me in the
comments but it is Thanksgiving for the
US so it doesn't make any sense so I'm
gonna start my fast tonight and I wanted
my breakfast this morning I'm probably
not gonna have supper tonight and I
gotta fast until tomorrow morning
so no lunch and no supper so yeah so I
know you guys Thanksgiving you know
can't do it but maybe after Thanksgiving
you can do it anyway what I was going to
talk about here somebody I was asking
about starting a business or becoming
entrepreneur at 50 years old yeah he's
got a wife kids he's got a mortgage big
mortgage now here's the thing in that
situation you got lots of
responsibilities so you have to manage
your risk much more closely but the big
advantage of being 15 having all this
work experience all these contacts all
these skill sets in industry in
interpersonal skills these can be
leveraged right because a big part of
the problem for young entrepreneurs is
being able to develop these skills it
takes time but if you already have it
you can you know get out of you get the
things going at a faster rate because
you don't have to learn these skills you
already have it so what you got to do is
you got to manage your risk you got to
be very careful about what you do don't
make any moves that will will put you in
financial in a financially bad situation
don't quit your job what you do is you
start working on it on the side you
start developing you know I don't know
what the business is but you know I
started developing put up the website
develop the plan for the business don't
go into too much too much detail don't
go crazy with the business plan because
they're all all these business plans
will change inevitably as you get out in
the market and you start developing on
the side maybe your wife could help you
out and start helping you work on some
specific little details here and there
and you slowly deploy so the process is
a little bit more gradual perhaps
because you could be working on the
evenings on the weekends and try to look
at implementing since you've been in
industry for a while try to look at
processes a talk that you can implement
to automate some of the things that you
need to do to get things done so for
instance if you're you need a website
you may just as an entrepreneur for the
first little while just use a builder at
website builders quickly or I would
actually personally be going towards
WordPress right away so you have that
flexibility and just implement a
template see if you were doing a web
design or web development business web
design business rather implementing a
template would be a big no-no because
your so you design skills but if you
have a business it has really nothing to
do with web design even if your web
developer just use the template just
clean it up a little bit make it your
own you know don't have to go crazy with
it just get it out there get a lot get
it out there get her live and just
slowly implement don't spend money you
can't afford to lose and just be very
very careful about your expenditures of
time your expenditures in cash of course
and just gradually do it on the side
that's my best advice to you and just
get it out there as quickly as possible
to see so you can get user feedback so
that you could pivot and make the
changes but you need to do accordingly
alright that's pretty much it for that I
hope this is helpful
