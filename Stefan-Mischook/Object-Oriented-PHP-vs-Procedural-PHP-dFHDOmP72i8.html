this vlog should you be writing
object-oriented PHP or old-school
procedural something that surprised me
recently there's is a little bit of push
towards using old style procedural PHP
and their argument is that it's a lot
lighter it's a lot less verbose a lot
less code you're gonna write and that
could be true and that is true in
certain sort of many circumstances but
here's the thing
if you're working on a project with
multiple individuals then
object-oriented structures might how
better or make it easier to impose a
certain consistency amongst the coders
and also makes it a little bit easier
perhaps to assign work to people on top
of that all the good stuff all the juicy
juicy stuff in PHP in terms of the
libraries and the frameworks and all
this kind of stuff that you can leverage
to make your work much much easier is
all object oriented so even if you're
looking at the verbosity meaning the
length the excess length perhaps of
object-oriented code versus procedural
PHP you have to consider the fact that
you get all these objects you get this
rich library of frameworks to leverage
which kind of negates that in a big way
and finally if you're looking for
employment and so forth if you come in
there just as a procedural old Scot old
style PHP developer good luck trying to
find any work with that you know what I
mean
so if though your tinker your tinkerer
you work on your own maybe you're doing
some little projects for small
businesses and so forth
yeah maybe there might be a situation
where you can do one or two pages of
procedural code just the banks of stuff
up
make sure your code is clean though you
know code a good good clean coding rules
still apply you know and I've talked
about this before and in fact many years
ago I actually mentioned that I said
listen for small little projects and PHP
don't ruin this so we need to go
object-oriented although these days
that's kind of heretical it's heresy to
say such things so there you go I would
tend to 99% of the time be using
object-oriented code you still have to
write a thick remember I'm not
big believer in inheritance based
object-oriented programming I'm much
more of a believer in interface based
coding and just doing that will make
your cold a bunch simpler by using
interfaces and no child and parent
classes and so on just keep it simple
one layer and you should be good because
there's too much goodness to be found in
frameworks like laravel or symphony or
cake or whatever whatever framework you
choose to use and they're all
object-oriented so you're gonna be using
objects anyway and all the new database
libraries in PHP are object-oriented you
know I don't believe MySQL I yes it does
have procedure when it does but you know
you know the PHP PDO is pure
object-oriented of course and if you
want to take advantage of the more
advanced functionality in in PHP it's
all object-oriented so keep that in mind
especially with the release of PHP seven
so but I am sympathetic to people kind
of don't like big thick amounts of code
unnecessary code that is something I can
agree with you I can agree with you on
anyway that's it for this super mini
short blog I hope you enjoyed and find
it interesting job like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
