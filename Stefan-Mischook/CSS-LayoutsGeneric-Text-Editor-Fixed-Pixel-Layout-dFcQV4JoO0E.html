how to go about creating some CSS layout
what I want to speak to you about is the
concept of fixed pixel layout now the
first thing we're going to have to
understand is that we are going to be
creating an existing website that looks
similar to the one that you're seeing in
front of you and if you happen to have
access to the source files that come
with this video you should be able to
download and you can take a look at
these yourselves you can open them up
and deconstruct how they were created
however we're gonna arm or at least I'm
going to walk you through how to go
about creating this from scratch so even
if you don't have the source files
that's not really a problem but
nevertheless if you do you can take a
look at them now one of the things
you'll notice in the file that is
provided the one that you're seeing
right in front of you here is the fact
that I happen to have a fixed amount of
resolution that I'm working with now my
computer screen here on my Mac is set to
1024 x 768 now you'll notice that the
website fits very nicely inside of that
environment in fact there's a little bit
of extra space left over so that things
don't get too crowded out and if we
scroll up and down you can see I've
provided you with a lot of content in
here so that it gives you a very
realistic look that you would probably
see if you have your own website and one
of the things that you will notice is
that at a full screen in the browser
when I have this set to full screen if I
were to move this slightly here I'll go
back up to the top you can see that the
entire containing element the white area
that I'm talking about here is moving
back and forth so that it's always in
the center of the document and that's
because i'll be showing you how to
create exactly that but one of the
things that I do want to draw your
attention to is the fact that if i were
to shrink this down a little bit more
you
notice that it what happens is it
invokes the scroll bar the horizontal
scroll bar that we see here and that
would mean that in order to read this
website we would have to scroll back and
forth now you might be wondering out
geez why would I want to have something
looking like that well the reason we
work with fixed pixel layout is because
the general populace works with a screen
resolution that our dimensions will fit
nicely inside of now I'll show you a
website that we can go to to actually
check out and see what the most popular
screen resolutions are but for the
moment just note that the dimensions
that I'm giving you are going to fit in
most people's browsers now so why do we
work with a fixed pixel layout well the
opposite of a fixed pixel layout which I
will also be showing you a little later
on in this video would be a liquid
layout or something that's a little bit
more malleable what does that mean it
means when I shrink down the browser the
words will be wrapping and making the
actual website gets smaller in a fixed
pixel lay out the website is always this
big and as you can see if we have a
resolution higher than 1024 which I
happen to be recording at then no
problem all will see is more space and
this fixed pixel amount right in the
middle however if we did shrink this we
saw that there's a scrollbar in a liquid
base layout or something that's a little
bit more malleable as I mentioned we
would have the words wrapping now the
only difficulties with a liquid base
layout is that if I have a extremely
large resolution the liquid base layout
will stretch out to fit that resolution
and that ends up with perhaps more words
on one line then we would actually like
you know when you have like you know 40
words on one line that's not really
conducive to good legibility however the
other difficulty with liquid based
layouts
is that if i were to shrink this too
much certainly we wouldn't get a
scrollbar but you know you'd end up with
like two or three words on one line but
there are ways of controlling that with
minimum and maximum with amounts and
that's a good way to go but another
reason why we work with fixed pixel
layout although I'm not really using a
lot of graphics in this particular
layout in fact I'm not using any
graphics it's all just text and
typography based you can see that it
would be a lot easier to design for a
fixed pixel layout than it is for a
liquid based land and since this
particular video is aimed at beginners
we're going to stick with some beginner
information to start with so having said
all of that let me also bring your
attention to another area that is
important I want to draw your attention
to this website net market share and
I'll net market share we can see
important information like you know
which people are using which browsers
which ones are the most popular ones
that are out there this is important for
us as web developers as we need to be on
top of this information and be able to
see which browsers support what
functionality however for our purposes
all I'm really interested in is the as
you can see here I've already got screen
resolutions so if you go to screen
resolutions and it's right over here in
the other section you'll notice that the
complete market share as of the time of
this particular recording may 2011
you'll notice that twenty percent of
your audience is going to be using 1024
x 768 but the vast majority of your
audience is also going to be using
something that's larger than 20 24 what
does that mean for us well it's not
really a big deal if they're larger
because we'll just see more of the
background color of our website so in
other words I'll see more of this gray
as opposed to this but the website
itself will not change
however do be aware that if we wanted to
go smaller than 1024 in terms of our
fixed pixel amounts we're really running
into area where there's a very small
portion of our audience less than 1% is
actually still using sem 640 by 480 so
we're not really concerned about that
and we haven't been for years with
regards to fix pixel layout so
nevertheless as I wanted to show you net
market share is telling us that 1024 is
a good portion of our audience now if i
had made my fixed pixel layout larger
than 1024 what would end up happening is
that on the vast majority people who
have that larger resolution they may be
able to see this but remember twenty
percent of your audience is at 1024 so
that means twenty percent of your
audience will have your website showing
a scroll bar if you went for a fixed
pixel layout larger than 1024 now we
don't want to alienate any amount of our
audience and certainly we wouldn't want
to alienate a large portion like twenty
percent imagine you we're doing business
and for example there was a million
dollars in sales on your website that
would be great but if that was the case
every month let's say if you alienated
twenty percent of your audience turn
them off by having have them scroll left
and right on the horizontal scroll bar
well that's twenty percent of potential
business going down the drain and I
don't know anybody who can you know
quickly afford to lose twenty percent of
their business so that's why we're
working with a 1024 layout and that
resolution is also something that has to
sort of keep in mind the fact that our
container area here in other words the
white area that I'm pointing to is
actually not 1024 its 960 and the reason
it's 960 is because there's other
elements in the real estate that is on
my resolution screen so for example I
have menu items if I'd weren't hiding my
doc my doc would be taking up some
ace i also have scroll bar on the left
and the right hand side and that eats up
a bunch of space so we oftentimes will
work with a 960 pixel amount for the
container and that way it'll fit quite
nicely inside of a 1024 environment and
1024 screen resolution so that's a
little bit about fixed pixel layout and
hopefully it's enough to get you started
with understanding why we're working
with this fixed pixel amount and we'll
see as I said earlier we'll see some
examples of a liquid based layout later
on I'll show you how to convert your
fixed pixel to a liquid base layout if
that's something that you're interested
in and we'd like to do so we'll see more
of that but in the next video we're
going to get started by jumping into our
HTML and coding it so that we're ready
for our CSS layout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
