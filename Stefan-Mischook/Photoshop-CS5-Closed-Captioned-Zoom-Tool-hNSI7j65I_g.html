are are in fact open and in fact now
that we know how to open up some of
those images a couple of things i do
want to explain you and show you how to
work with here I've just opened up an
image called salt and pepper it doesn't
really matter what image you happen to
have open and what I do want to discuss
with you is how we can zoom in on a
number of different images very simple
and easy ways that we can do that right
now you'll notice that the percentage of
my value here and this is specifically
what percent you are zoomed in we have a
hundred percent of our image that's
exactly what it looks like however if we
wish we could have made this two hundred
percent and as you can see it just gets
larger when you do that you can scroll
through your image using your scroll bar
down here or up here but I just want to
make clear a couple of other things that
you can do with zooming in on your image
and one of the easiest things to do is
to work with the shortcuts command + or
control + on a PC and as you can see
when you do that it allows you to zoom
in on those images how much can we zoom
in thirty two hundred percent that's
really really tight and as you can see
it creates this grid of sorts based on
all of the pixels that you have in the
image command- on the other hand zooms
out and as you can see we are continuing
to zoom out and if I were to continue
getting smaller you would see that my
window just gets smaller and it's
revealing bridge underneath here but if
I set this to a different screen mode by
pressing F you can see that I'm not
disturbed by the background and here
ctrl + will zoom in control minus will
zoom out you can see the values up here
at the top so those are really simple
and easy shortcuts to remember do you
remember this as well if I were zoomed
in on this you'll notice that my image
is taking a considerable amount of my
screen what if I want to move around
this screen now and especially in this
particular screen mode you see if I was
to go through
the different modes in the first mode
where we see our buttons up at the top
certainly you can use these scroll bars
to move around as I'd mentioned but you
know depending on which mode you're in
now I don't see those scroll bars
because I pressed F I'm in a different
screen mode well how do you work in this
space well here's a great shortcut and
it works in any Adobe platform press the
spacebar and you'll notice that your
cursor right over here is going to be
turned into a hand which allows you to
move the canvas you'll see there's a
nice little you know animation movement
here that allows it to slow down a
little easing on that movement but
notice this is really really great you
can move around your canvas you can
continue working at this zoomed in
environment and I can you know do my
selections and whatever else I need to
do and just press spacebar to move it
around a little bit more space bar again
do your work so get used to that it's a
very very easy thing to remember and a
great trick that helps you to move
around in your environment here's some
other great tricks as well you can press
command one and that will bring you back
to one hundred percent as you can see
here and all of these are found under
the View menu so zoom in command + zoom
out command minus actual pixel size you
know one hundred percent command one but
look at this fit on the screen command 0
so if your screen has the possibility of
supporting a larger environment you'll
notice here my my zoom level is actually
set to 116 if you're on a higher
resolution than I am you probably have
even more than this and you're zoomed in
a considerable amount more than I am
just remember another thing is that when
you are not at a hundred percent well
you might start to see some pixelization
happening with your images right so
everything's getting all pixel eyes you
can see that there's some artifice in
around the edges here that's because
this is not a super high quality image
it's only 72 pixels per inch right so
keep that in mind as well so
nevertheless if I press command one
I go back to a hundred percent or
control one on the pc of course and what
else you can see is that the different
modes here are the ones that i was
mentioning right so standard screen mode
is this one but the f key will i just
select through those views right the
different screen modes and there are a
number of other things that we'll get to
in these views once we need to see them
but as you can see here they're all
pretty much easy suming in and out
information here is the first tool that
i'm showing you is the zoom tool by the
way and this one allows you to zoom in
very very specifically to an area for
example let's say i wanted to target
this little granule of salt right there
i can click and drag and you'll notice
that in doing so and clicking and
dragging out will zoom out that's pretty
cool isn't it so you can click and drag
to zoom in or you can click down to zoom
out so just going back and forth like
this zooming in zooming out and it's a
really easy way of sort of creating your
zooms you could just click directly
right on the object and as you can see
i'm zooming in directly on this granule
of salt right here if i were to continue
by pressing the option or Alt key on a
PC you'll notice that the plus sign that
was here a second ago is now gone and
it's been converted into a minus sign
just like that and now I have a smaller
screen as I do here but remember I could
just zoom in right there by dragging or
just by clicking so just clicking along
allows me to zoom in right on that
granule of salt command one back to one
hundred percent or command 0 back to fit
it inside the screen notice here with
the zoom tool you also have all these
other ones as well actual pixels one to
one that's a hundred percent fitted in
the screen fill the screen completely
fill the screen print size
I will show you you know add a hundred
percent when it's printing so all of
these things will allow you to work with
the zoom tool as well as without the
zoom tool you can also just go to the
View menus right over here so a lot that
you can do with magnification and don't
forget pressing spacebar allows you to
move around that canvas and get in a lot
closer so we're going to continue now
with another set of tutorials in just a
