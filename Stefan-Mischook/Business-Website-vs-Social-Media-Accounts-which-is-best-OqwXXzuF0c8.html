are really getting big like Facebook
Twitter etc some companies were playing
with the idea of yeah who needs a
website we have facebook we have Twitter
etc and now what I'm hearing is that
they're moving off of Facebook they're
realizing that they're having their own
website is is hugely important because
what Facebook is the most pernicious my
my opinion you build up your facebook
presence you build up a page and then
the Facebook will started to start a
throttling back how many people within
your community that you built up on
Facebook we're actually seeing your
message you you had to build up their
site Facebook site within your page your
Facebook commercial page build up your
presence bring a lot of traffic to
Facebook and then you had to pay them
you had to pay them to fully reach your
audience that you work so hard to build
so some big media companies a you know
forget Facebook's
back to their own site and they're
realizing that they have to develop
their own web presence and web
properties off of social media platforms
whether it be Facebook YouTube or
Twitter etc Instagram you have to do
that you have to have a combined
approach when you're going out there and
to showcase yourself as a developer or
as a freelancer or to showcase some sort
of sass you may be putting out
software-as-a-service sass equals
software of a service or your clients as
well one of the jobs of as a freelance
developer should be to be able to
provide at least some basic guidance in
terms of web marketing or of a web
presence so let's say you meet a client
and they want to put up a wordpress
information site at information-rich
site so you might use a CMS like
WordPress or Drupal or something or
whatever CMS you want but in addition to
that you've got to tie that in with a
social presence so don't get me wrong
you have to have a social presence these
days and depending on the type of
business you may find certain social
media sites are better than others
so for me for example I do have a
Facebook presence but Facebook is like a
second thought to me I find YouTube to
be the best for me especially given the
type of content and I just want to get
my message out whether it be to
individuals or to institutions schools
etc I want to use my software that said
so scratch that so as a freelancer as a
developer you have to consider the site
the website representing the business or
the product and how it relates to the
social media presence so you should have
a plan in that regard and you should be
able to as a freelancer provide at least
some basic guidance so you see the
business you build their site you build
theirs put in their CMS you're tied in
there with some Facebook presence you're
tied in with it maybe an Instagram
presence maybe YouTube presence
depending etcetera etcetera etcetera now
I'm not gonna get into details here I
just wanted to bring that up but one
thing you shouldn't do and companies are
starting to learn the big media company
you shouldn't just have only social
media presence you need to have a home
base you need to nurture your own spot
on the web and that's your website so
don't forget that big company is
starting to realize that the mistake
they made in relying just on Facebook
that's always a bad idea
diversify out have a presence outside of
social media because at the end of the
day you do you don't have much control
over your social media presence inside
of individual sites because they can
choose to shut you down at any moment or
cut you off from your audience at any
moment there you go I hope that's
