examine the differences between html5
and its predecessor XHTML in the sample
files that were provided for you you'll
find two folders one called old XHTML
and one called html5 version one now
we're going to be using both of these
purely for the sake of examining what
they look like if you open up the old
HTML and just preview it in any browser
you're going to see a very simple sample
website here and it's using older XHTML
we're going to take a second to examine
the source files in just a moment at the
same time you'll also notice here I have
just a second the html5 version one now
if you look at that there's really no
differences between the two in terms of
the design it's just purely one is using
green while the other one is using
purple the older one using purple now
this is an easy way for us to just see
them visually but we're not really
looking at them from a visual
perspective for this particular video
all I really want to be doing is
examining the code information for both
of these now you could do that in any
browser you could do that in any HTML
editor I just happen to be using
Dreamweaver at the moment and as you can
see I've got both files open right now
now like I said you can use any editor
to examine these i'm using dreamweaver
because we have some nice color coding
in here as well you can see things
fairly fairly easily now I want to show
you the differences so here is the newer
version this particular version is the
html5 version and the XHTML version I
have right next to it so if we were to
look at the differences between these
two well anybody here who has had
experience creating websites using XHTML
but is fairly new to html5 you'll notice
a few things in particular that do stand
out first and foremost let's take a look
at the very first line we have our
type and as you can see here the doctype
in XHTML was really really extensive and
most of this information we don't really
need so let's take a look at the
difference in our new html5 version Wow
very simple so as you can see the
simplicity of how the elements are
written is one important thing right
away and you'll notice that we also have
some other number of changes I'm really
concentrating on simple semantics so
let's look at some at how some of these
things are addressed in our version well
you'll notice here in the html5 x l m
and s HTTP we don't really need to use
that anymore and as you can see it's so
much cleaner it's really going to make
things a lot easier for you to work with
just from a visual perspective if
nothing else and some other information
take a look at the meta tag that we have
here there's quite a bit of information
in the older version content type and
text HTML some of this was just used for
validation of the XHTML which we don't
really care about in html5 it'll
validate without it so all I'm really
concerned with in an HTML environment is
the char set or the character set of
utf-8 and you'll also notice some other
things about the content for example
it's assumed that we're going to be
using text HTML so we don't even have to
address it in our newer version let's
take a look at the meta tag here wow
that is so clean it's almost as clean as
what happened with the doctype that is
just so much more easier to work with
there are some you know exceptions that
you could put in here for example we
could have put in utf-8 in quotation
marks but it's not necessary so there's
no real need for us to do that as well
there's also some other things that you
may recognize as a meta tag is sort of a
self and closing tag and that's why you
know we don't have a closed meta tag we
just used to use the forward slash at
the end of it with the space but let's
take a look in html5 we don't really
need that we're assuming that yes
this is a meta tag and it doesn't need
to be self enclosed or enclosed at all
we just the browser will just understand
that so that makes things remarkably
simpler just in the first four lines as
you can see when we examine the
differences now if we look a little bit
closer and we sort of examined some
elements like working with the semantic
sort of elements that we have here well
div is kind of a neutral semantics or
non semantic i should say we don't
really know it a div is other than you
know maybe a division of sorts and in
the past using XHTML everyone would use
the either ID or classes and you can see
that in this example there are both
classes as well as IDs being used here
and this main div is our container so we
created an ID for it called the
container and we also had a section that
was kind of a header so you'll notice
that ID equals header you know in
quotations it's there but and you may
also remember especially any of you who
have looked at some of the earlier
killer sites it's often recommended in
the earlier methods to put a little HTML
comment in here that said this ends the
header why because when you have a lot
of closing div tags and you don't really
know after a while which one belongs to
which so this is a nice little way of
you know addressing that but let's look
at how easy things are in html5 for
example rather than having to deal with
a div with the ID header or a div with
the ID nav or a main section for your
articles or anything along those lines
or a div for that matter with the ID of
footer what we do in this instance is
just use the much more semantically
friendly header tag and header element
and notice there's no need for a div ID
equals it shortens the amount that of
code that we're writing but that's not
really a big issue here it's just the
simplicity of understanding oh well this
is the header and this is the closing
header
there's no need for those html5 or
excuse me the HTML code that we had
before in here those comments are
removed because I know this is the
closing header tag it's forward slash
header same thing for the new nav tag as
you can see here nav and we now have a
closed nav that's great and notice there
are articles that's right if you have a
main section of information well that
could be your article and within their
you can have many headlines and sub
headlines as I do and you'll also notice
that you know if I have a special
section that I want to sort of highlight
inside of it well there's even a section
element that we have in the new version
most importantly you know the footer tag
footer footer you see in XHTML there are
we could track the information and
google has statistics that would have
shown how many people are using ID
equals footer in their HTML declarations
just as well as you know rapper or
container or nav or header and those are
all very popular tags so rather or
popular IDs and classes so why not just
create an element with that name it's
much easier to understand from a
semantic perspective and it also makes
things so much easier for us to work
with when we're coding debugging and
doing any number of different things
inside of the new html5 now come back in
the next chapter and what we're going to
be dealing with is building a html5 web
site so we'll address some of these
issues again but we're going to put it
in together in a shell that looks a
little bit more visually appealing than
the one that we just took a look at so
we'll see in just a second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
