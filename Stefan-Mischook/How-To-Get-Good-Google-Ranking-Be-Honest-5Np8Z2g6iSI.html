to talk about getting good google
ranking as you can see in the title of
this blog post the short answer is that
you should just be honest about the
content that you're producing for your
site so this actually goes back to one
of the very first rules of web design I
was taught or introduced to I guess in
1994-95 early on and that rule is
content is king now this of course is
not a rule that that was invented for
web design I think this probably goes
back to earlier publishing and TV and
radio so forth and the basic idea is
that if you have good content people
will want to link to your sites and
links of course are the lifeblood of any
of any site and the more quality links
that you got you bet you have coming
into your site the higher the rank your
site will be in any of the search
engines including Google of course
Google pioneer the whole idea of a link
based of voting system if you will
meaning that more sites that link to
your site and higher quality of those
links are in a more in tune with your
site in terms of content I'll get two
i'll get to that point and second the
higher ranking your site will appear in
the google search engines when i was
talking about the context or the
information about you know over regards
to the sites that are linking to you in
a nutshell if you have a bunch of sites
linking to you where the sites have
nothing to do with the subject of your
site that's not nearly as important as
if let's say for instance with
keysight's com to have other web design
related sites linked to me is is good to
have I know if I had a gambling site
linked to me or site about gardening
linking to me it would be fun it would
you know it helps a bit but it's not
nearly as valuable and in fact it can
hurt you because
by having unrelated sites linked to you
that sort of waters down the your site
as far as Google and other search
engines are concerned nobody knows
exactly how Google gives different ways
to different parameters in their search
engine algorithm it's you know this is
something to keep to themselves of
course all that you know to prevent
people from gaming the system as as much
as it can so that's why I always go back
to being honest now for me and I've held
this position for many many years now I
look at the relationship that a website
owner has with Google as being a it's a
mutually beneficial relationship in that
Google's looking to link to high quality
sites to be able to provide good search
results or you know when you know when
you do a search for a particular subject
and a site comes up on google or any
search engine google wants that site
that it points to in its results to be
high quality high content sites and
that's why every every so often in
google will change the algorithm to try
to purge out the cheaters and to try to
push up to the top of their search
results the high quality sites because
for google the better the results are
able to provide the mo for the people
visiting google and searching with
google the more traffic they're going to
get so they want they want to promote
good sites at the same time you want
google to push people to your website so
it only makes sense that you just put
out high quality content that's you know
related to the subject at hand that's
why for instance if you go to the killer
sites network will have a site like how
to build websites calm and it's pretty
clear that the website what the website
is about and you see that the content is
strictly about that
well it's about building websites so
keep that in mind if you want to score
good ranking with Google you want to try
to consider your your place on the web
as being a symbiotic relationship with
Google and the other engines where
Google needs good content 2.2 and you as
a website owner you need google and all
the other sensitive search engines to
point to you and so the best way to do
this is to make sure that you keep your
website honest and you know with regards
to its content so if your site is called
how to build websites don't have a porno
site there have a site on how to build
websites and you try to continuously
improve the quality of your content this
is just the beginning of web marketing
and search engine optimization if you
will there's a lot of other things you
can do that are extremely important but
this is really the foundation of any
good website with regards to want it to
draw as much traffic to it as possible
there you go from Stefan is Chuck with
killer sites com I hope you enjoyed this
