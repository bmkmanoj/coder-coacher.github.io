learn about the
structured query language SQL
SQL is the language used to communicate
with MySQL the database server actually
SQL is the universal language which used
to communicate with any SQL based server
so we're talking MySQL of course
Microsoft sequel server Oracle and so on
so once you've learned SQL for MySQL you
have learnt it at least the basics
anyway for many other similar relational
databases
as I explained in a previous video the
SQL language is actually fairly easy to
learn it was designed this way because
they wanted to create a language for
non-programmers they wanted a language
that was easy to pick up so that
ordinary office people could use it to
do simple database operations that being
said if you get into some advanced stuff
it requires a little bit more
understanding of course but for our
purposes in terms of learning enough SQL
to be able to use it with PHP we won't
need to get into any of the esoteric the
more advanced SQL stuff especially the
beginning and I would even say that for
most of us in our PHP work you won't
have to touch on those advanced MySQL or
SQL commands and code if you will
to practice our SQL and to learn it
we're going to use PHP mind-made again
and here I have it here and what we're
going to do is we're going to load up
the database that we created earlier so
I called it killer and we have one table
and we have the table people and if we
look at the table structure by clicking
on the instructor button here you see
that this is a fairly simple table since
we have only two fields name and ID so
essentially since the ID field as we
discussed in a previous video is a auto
increment field which means that my SQL
Server itself will actually be adding
numbers for us we know it's a number
because an int this is the unique ID
that identifies records in the table
again this is somebody I discussed in a
previous video what we need to do is
just pay attention to really this name
field for us well for a lot of our
operations you'll see what I mean once
we get into it so we've checked out the
structure so we know we got the name
field here so we go to browse and you
can see actually my school is firing off
a little query here
well PHP my name is anyhow so what we're
going to do is we gonna hit the SQL tab
and in the SQL tab we're gonna be able
to type in some commands as we'll see
here's a command and we'll be able to
take it from there
SQL has four basic commands and here
they are
we have insert select update delete with
these four basic commands you'll be able
to do a heck of a lot to the MySQL
database in terms of inserting data into
the database selecting data from the
database that's pulling it out updating
records that you already have in the
database and deleting records from the
database now some of these have well
server these commands have sub options
we're going to explore some of them here
but our main goal is just to get enough
SQL under our belts so that we can move
into using PHP to speak with MySQL
to be clear when I say we're gonna use
PHP to speak to MySQL PHP will basically
be used to fire off these commands will
be writing these SQL commands inside of
our PHP scripts so that then PHP will be
able to fire us off to the SQL server or
MySQL server and we can get things done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
