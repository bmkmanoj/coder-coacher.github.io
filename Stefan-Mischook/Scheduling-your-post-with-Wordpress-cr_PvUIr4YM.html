shockwave killer sites calm in this
quick tip video I want to show you
something that we have in WordPress and
if you're not familiar with WordPress
it's a blogging engine I'll just go to
our blog here and you know wow everybody
seen blogs right so we're prints has a
really interesting feature for people
who are busy and on the go
it has a scheduling post feature now I'm
highlighting it here let's go into the
actual post now you can see at this time
it's now 3:30 and this post is actually
due scheduled to be published
automatically by WordPress at 3:37 this
is very cool when you write a post in
WordPress you can go on the side panel
under the publish tab here I guess you'd
call it and you can hit the edit button
and you can decide what time you want
this pulse to actually be published live
on the site that's a real cool feature
because let's say you want to go on a
trip so instead of having to log into
your blog every other day to publish
content what you can do is write up a
bunch of post item to your WordPress and
just set the date in the scheduler ahead
you know it could be weeks ahead it
could be months ahead whatever or
minutes ahead and you'll be able to then
walk away from your WordPress and you
know about WordPress will take care of
it for you it will publish the content
for your regular basis this is very
important if you're running a site and
you want to keep the search engines
happy especially Google you never want
to tick off Google never piss off the
Google and one things that the Google
likes is a continuous flow of new
content so this WordPress scheduling
feature is really cool for that reason
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
