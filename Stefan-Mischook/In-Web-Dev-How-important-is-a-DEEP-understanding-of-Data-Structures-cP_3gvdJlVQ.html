more YouTube videos this is more tech
oriented content here so under my video
on was a learning code can be fuzzy
fuzzy meaning unclear so just keep
walking through it alright let's see
what we got here I'm confused
in one thing people say on Quora but
don't do is learn data structures des
data structures with JavaScript but I
want to work as a full-stack developers
how do I learn data structures and on
which Lang don't worry about data
structures you learn data structures
when you need to learn data structures
yes if you're going to go do an
interview they might want you two to
work on data structures to show how you
can iterate through an array or
something like that which is a type of
data structure and in that situation
where you're going to go apply for a job
what you ought to do once you learn your
basics in your course you look online
and say okay typical JavaScript
questions that they'll ask you in an
interview or typical if you can do PHP
typical PHP questions typical Java and
you're going to find them and just work
through them make sure you understand
best you can
and it just is prepped for your
interview that way that being said I
have to say when it comes to web stack
developer you're just gonna need to
understand basic arrays that's pretty
much it typically you just pulling stuff
from a database you put it into a result
set and then you just iterate through
that results set to display the contents
of your database query on the page and
that's pretty much it so I wouldn't get
too concerned about data structures you
and in terms of all of the different
data structures that are out there in
day-to-day practice
mmm not that important except for what I
just said so if you want to learn the
web stack don't worry about data
structures just worry about the web
stack html5 css3 javascript and whatever
server-side language you want to do PHP
Python and Java C sharp Ruby whatever it
is you want to do JavaScript of course
my top choice is freelance is PHP
otherwise it'd probably be JavaScript
because getting a lot of mojo nowadays I
would also consider server-side Java if
you want to do enterprise bingo work for
big companies but in that situation you
know you need a degree of some sort or
maybe server-side asp.net c-sharp again
probably you're gonna need a degree at
some point you could do Python or Ruby I
would do Python first and Ruby but again
Python Ruby for web apps for web apps is
more of a niche like there's many more
opportunities in the PHP world in terms
of web apps and there's and if you want
to go work for larger organizations
they're probably going to be doing Java
or.net in that regard and apparently
they're going into JavaScript nodejs
type of server-side stuff so depends on
the type of web stack programming you
want to do regardless of the type you
have to get into big 3 html5 css3
javascript don't worry about data
structures it's overplayed except maybe
when you're doing the silly interview
where they come up with all these crazy
requirements like being able to work
your way through all these archaic
problems that may or may not come up or
come up very rarely most of the time
when you're doing web apps these most of
the time you're just dealing with
database issues understanding how to how
to create secure connections to the
database efficient connections not
secure but create creating excuse me
creating a secure connection to the
database it's very easy trivial you know
boom boom you're done but understanding
how to write good queries and how to
structure your queries when to use
certain types of queries interacting
with your database that's the more
tricky part understanding how to
structure your database efficiently for
the given needs of your application
that's the tricky part and guess what
that's most of the job most of the job
of web app developer is collecting
information in a webpage processing that
information so there's there's no
attacks SQL injection stuff like that
and so what the data is clean then
storing that database that information
in the database and then retrieving that
database at the right time that's pretty
much what most web apps
and then diesel I presented a good way
depending on your clients needs
so terms of data structures again unless
you're interviewing or you're doing a
very specific type of programming I
wouldn't worry too much learn the basic
array types or collection types
depending on the language javascript' is
fine then you go from there now if you
want to do the web stack there's no
point learning C++ data structures
you're not writing C++
no point learning Python data structures
you're not writing Python although that
being said all modern languages share
many of the same data structures they
have different ways of looking at it
though anyway I hope that helps I love
comments like this what a great teacher
you are just finish the five intial
courses that's my web stack my IWD
course package looking for the next step
suggestions yes you've done the five
intro courses html5 CSS excuse me h2o
five css3 javascript PHP SQL these are
the core languages of most web apps then
right there I would jump into one of the
many projects where to provide doovy for
invalidation with PHP and JavaScript do
the PHP tag cloud do the simple login
system do the MVC login system and then
from there there's other project but
from there what I would do is I would go
out and talk to people I say I want to
build you a simple website I want to
build you a web app do it that's how
you're going to learn yes you're not
gonna have all the answers right away
but because you have your foundation
help if you come up to a situation where
you're not sure what to do you just look
it up really easily because you know how
to look it up it's like it's like now
that you know how to read and write you
don't need to go out there and learn how
to spell every single word in the
English dictionary you know how to spell
words you can just go to the thesaurus
look at miss in a minute boom here we go
okay that's what that word means as
simple as that
same thing with programming if you're
taught the core hey Steff quick question
about python i'm always coming across
comments from people saying python is
dead
I started learning blender 3d modeling
software and he uses Python a lot of
apps a lot of programs use Python to
automate it and so forth and I wanted to
learn it because I'm following my PC
what do you things somebody who tells
you that Python instead of dying is
pretty clueless have you heard of AI
have you heard of machine learning
Python is the king in that that filled
that area actually I'm going to be
interviewing couple friends of mine who
have companies that are using Python to
build their AI stack if you will so the
whole idea of a Python is dead or dying
isn't his rig is literally ridiculous
Python is going to be here forever
because of AI ml and because it's used
in all kinds of software like blender to
automate it and there's others and it
could be used over would the web stack
etc etc but just because the AI and
machine learning implementation Python
is not going anywhere
what is another silly comment on the web
here's a comment from a teacher I also
have to tell my pupils over and over
better to learn vocabulary for three
times ten minutes than a half an hour at
a time
he's just confirming what I was teaching
I guess in this video that frequency is
more important than time in terms of
learning better that you learn as in as
as in this example three times ten
minutes and spending a half an hour at a
time so you do ten minutes you walk away
for two hours to another tennis walk
away to because our lizard brain the
super-powerful brain in that we all
possess pays attention to frequency more
than anything else if you keep seeing
things over and over again we'll say hey
that's kind of important and then it
will use its tremendous power to start
learning things and you're going to
learn much more quickly this is not
theory it's not just personal experience
this is proven in the science can I use
Python to make voice recognition app
like Siri iPhone as a voice on Samsung I
would imagine so I would imagine so I
would imagine they're using Python to do
the voice recognition I haven't looked
into it but I would imagine my only
concern with that as a Python might be
running a little slow for that kind of
work but maybe not because what they do
to compensate for pythons lack of speed
at runtime is about the right the core
of the engine in a fast processing
language like C++ and then they'll write
everything around it in Python because
if they wrote it all in C++ it's super
slow to write it's a real rule it's very
hard because it just takes much longer
so what the duals are right the core
that the engine in C++ that the part of
the app part of the program that has too
heavy processing and then they will
write the everything around it in Python
so yes probably Python I'll just look
into it I've never written voice
recognition software codes so I can't
say for sure but that would be my guess
somebody asked a couple videos ago where
can i where can we look around for
code somebody asked a few videos ago
where can we look around for code that
is already out there that we might be
able to use Thanks
well it depends on the type of projects
that you're doing so let's say you
wanted to build CMS you just type in
open source CMS and Google and a whole
bunch will appear a lot of these open
source code bases will be stored on a
place called github where you download
it then you can start working on it you
just search for whatever piece of
software you want to build and then you
take it from there you might look up
shopping cart system PHP or shopping
cart system Ruby rails shopping in a
cart system JavaScript etc you get the
idea you just use Google Google's your
friend in that regard so I'll end off
somebody asked me do you film with your
movie camera or your phone did you film
this so I the car vlogs I actually
filmed with my my Google pixel phone yes
the Google pixel fall takes very good
video when you have good lighting that's
for sure
and in Turtles like this these days I'm
using my cinema camera
and I'm thinking I'm finally learning
how to use this bloody thing properly
now if you looked at I did a must have
done like hundred videos with this new
camera and I was still learning it
because a cinema camera has a lot of
power and capability but you have to
know what you're doing and finally
finally know it took a hundred videos
but finally I mastered again the key
fundamentals of using this camera and
that was understanding exposure and
white balance and understanding how that
all works together with of course the
basic what they call the exposure
triangle the aperture size is the ISIL
etc so these are the things that I had
to learn again just camera basics how to
operate the camera and I think the video
quality is now more consistent at least
alright I see end of the vlog bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
