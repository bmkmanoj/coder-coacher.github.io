a good domain name this is a video I do
every now and then because I get the
question every now and then and this
changes every now and then because the
web is changing so back in the past 10
years ago choosing a domain name was
affected by the domain name extension
with the extension comm net org dot info
polls are all domain name extensions now
if you know the basics of domain names
you know that studio web com it's
different from Studio web org I could
own both domains but they're not the
same address so you could have two
different companies owning each of these
domain names anyway the rule of what
makes a good domain name a couple of
rules number one you want to keep the
way names short and easy to say and
spell so good domain name is google very
simple you just felt good to my name is
studio web very easy to spell and say so
that's number one rule to this day does
the the domain name have to reflect the
business you know so if you were a
plumber should you have plumber in your
domain name you don't have to have it
it's not at all a rule it could help a
little bit with the search engines and
the search engine ranking but that's
it's not new is that as important as it
was at one time so the domain name of
your site does not have to have the same
name as your company it does not have to
necessarily reflect what your company or
your sign is about you cds you know like
Flickr Twitter Facebook Google visa
yahoo you know dude do these names have
really anything to do with the nature of
the site but I or a business under these
names not really so number one rule make
sure that the domain names as short as
possible make sure that they're easy to
spell easy to remember
and whether the domain extension is
calmed org dot biz doesn't really matter
at these days people don't see much of a
difference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
