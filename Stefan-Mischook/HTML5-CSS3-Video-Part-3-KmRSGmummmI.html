pushed down a little bit so I'm just
going to say top of I don't know 100
pixels and left of 10 pixels and now we
just have to style this guy or the
actual navigation inside of it so let's
do that so the first thing I need to do
is get my unordered lists to not have
those ugly bullets so I'll just say list
style is none nav unordered list list
items let's say float left margin I
don't know zero pixels on the top and 24
pixels on each side and nav unordered
list list item hyperlinks maybe make
them display block give them a little
bit of a margin on the top and set their
font size to 13 pixels let's see what
happens all right so now we're looking
at something that looks a little better
I'm going to add some padding 3 pixels
10 pixels four pixels 10 pixels give it
a gray color and I'm going to have let's
just see what that looks like okay we're
going to get rid of that text decoration
and I also just as a general rule I'm
going to say that my font family will be
Ariel salsera that looks a little better
so now we've got like a nicer looking
thing up here and I also want to make
sure that my active navigation is a
little more interesting and I'm also
going to have a hover thing as well so
let's do the hover first so on when I
say nav unordered list li a hover in
other words when i'm hovering over the
navigation i want a background of 555 so
that's going to be gray and a color of
white FFF and i'm going to say a mozilla
border radius of 12 pixels so it'll look
like a la jeune lozenge I'm also going
to make this work for WebKit too so i'll
just say WebKit border radius of 12
pixels now when i hover over these are
starting to look like buttons just kind
of neat again there's absolutely no
images here I'm also going to add some
border radius to the to the top here so
that it it's smoother so I'll take these
two lines and then for the actual nav
i'm going to add so we don't want any
border radius on the top or on the right
the top right but we do on the bottom
right the bottom left and save that so
now we've got this nice thing coming
across and I'm also going to maybe add a
little bit of a gradient just to see
what that'll look like so we'll do that
for the active navigation so for nav
unordered list li dot active a so the
active list item we're going to add a
background of moes linear gradient of
Center bottom
and we'll start with a gray at the
bottom and then go up to a lighter gray
at the top see what that looks like oof
I don't know about that well let's see
if I make the background color white
that's a little better and then I say
that the border radius is 12 pixels it
doesn't look too bad and let's see if we
can maybe maybe it should be EEE let's
see if I make this 999 that's a little
better it's a little smoother you make
this EEE there we go that's a little
nicer it's a little smoother I'm also
going to add a border so a border width
of actually I'm not too sure about this
border now let's forget the border yeah
that's nice cool so here we go we've got
a nice little navigation at the top and
what's kind of cool about this is that
we can even add opacity to all of this
business just like we did in the last
video so in my nav here if I say opacity
0.7 it'll be seventy percent opaque and
then we get this neat effect where it's
kind of floating in air and we can see
the video underneath and it builds this
really nice composite effect again you
know we can style are our paragraph
section as well so it'll have the same
sort of effect where I can set the
opacity here too i don't know eighty
percent and if we make the section
article p
actual paragraphs let's say they have 13
pixel font size the line height is 20
pixels margin bottom of 10 pixels and I
create a couple of paragraphs here a
couple of paragraphs of text there is
something that looks pretty decent I'm
sure if there was in fact we could even
add some lorem ipsum text from the last
video or two videos ago rather
it's a lot of video or a lot of text
rather obviously this wouldn't work
you'd have to find another way of
handling larger pieces of text you could
make this scrolling or whatever and
you'll notice that you know if I scale
this down or scale this up it's pretty
flexible and it creates a really nice
effect so that's what I wanted to show
you about the video tag and it's pretty
performant it works well and it's
another alternative to flash video it
doesn't work with Internet Explorer and
if you're interested in doing real-time
streaming or you want a content if you
want to protect your content or what
have you it's probably not the best
solution but if you're trying to avoid
flash and you want an open format it's a
great alternative so that's it for flash
for sorry that's it for the video tag in
the next video what we're going to do is
look at canvas which is another feature
of html5 and lastly just sort of seeing
what we can do with the the canvas tag
I'm John leben salt and thanks for
