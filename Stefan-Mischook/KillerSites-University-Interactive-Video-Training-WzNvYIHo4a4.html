killer sites calm and a killer PHP calm
in this quick little video I'm going to
do a little bit of shameless
self-promotion but it's actually
something that you probably well you
might find interesting and basically I
want to talk about our new interactive
training site killer sites University so
I was clipped to it right here so here
it is so what makes this site different
from what we already have in our library
and our downloaded courses that you can
get on our video store essentially
essentially this is an interactive
training system so what that means is
that you have video courses and they're
surrounded by a whole bunch of code
challenges and multiple choice challenge
questions and it's a guided tutorial as
well so the best way to show you what I
mean let's just take a quick look at
what's going on so i'm going to log in
with a test account here and to join us
free and we have free courses so you can
see right here this is the user
dashboard when you log in and here the
courses that this particular user
subscribe to soar beginners HTML or
javascript etc so what's launch of
course will continue it now the system
remembers where you were in the course
last so if you had been on chapter 10 it
would open up on chapter 10 so houses so
how does this work basically let's go to
course or review so you have a series of
videos so this particular course has 14
videos and this course has 49 multiple
choice questions and 24 code challenges
you get the source files so it's pretty
good so let's just start chapter one and
what happens you open up and you played
a video so we played a video
here's our here's our basic course I
don't know if you heard that audio or
not but anyway so you watch the video
and once you've done with the video you
can scroll down you got a question 1 or
you can just go here question 1 so here
we are question 1 now this is really
simple stuff rights are basic course
what is a web browser so you can ask an
application you use a create web page so
that's going to be a wrong answer so we
selected will send a solution and of
course we got the wrong answer so
incorrect answer so what you see as you
go through the system it tracks your
progress and whenever you get answers
wrong as opposed it will subtract points
and whatever you get answers right it
will add points now you can keep asking
right and if you keep getting it wrong
so try another one so so the solution
again got it wrong and what's really
cool is that these video courses these
interactive courses rather are guided so
we have a hinting system here so here we
got get hint so we see that there's two
hints remaining but the hints cost you
points so we will get hint a browser is
an application used to browse the
internet so we got another hit browser
is not used to create web page so you
know it makes a pretty simple now at
this point what you need to do so it is
click an application i just select
rather an application used to view in
what you in web pages you get to correct
that's already click ok and it takes you
to the next question now this is kind of
you know basic stuff well this is very
basic stuff for people because this is a
beginners course so let's go back to the
dashboard for you code monkeys so let's
check out the beginners javascript
course we will continue course again we
have a video and you played a video and
then you can because at the end of a
chapter you see this is on the third
chapter here lesson three javascript
flow and execution we have something
called a chapter review
you read the chapter review so here we
go putting it all together variable so
create two different variables called
first and laughs with the value of your
first and last name respectively so you
can write some pretty involved involved
code so I'm just going to write a bunch
of stuff that's not good so that the
solution incorrect now because this is a
chapter review review question he knows
you only lost five points so that the
social again incorrect five points
whereas was the most noise because you
just had a few answers you lost a lot
more points the whole point of this
point stuff is the track how well your
you know how you pay attention to things
and whether you doing things properly
and this goes to building your profile
which will have some credibility because
the system makes it you know challenging
for you again if you look at these hints
these hints will cost you 75 points and
so here pretty detailed hands we got
another hand here pretty detailed hint
so it's more you can get the answer last
10 to just gives you the answer so I
just I'm just going to take this because
I'm kind of lazy so i just copied i'm
going to paste my answer here and it
should work alright see because i had
done this question before is a test user
i got several points are awarded but if
you were doing this for the first time
you get real pie so i'm just going to
continue and you just go through the
course like so and you can of course
track where you are with the bread club
the bread crumbs it's pretty cool again
all the courses that come with source
files you can pick up individual courses
some are free most are paid you know or
you could subscribe and subscriptions
free pretty affordable 29 a month and we
have these courses at this time there's
more coming out in the future if you
want a more detailed view how it works
we have our how it works page is
interactive learning
or you know we show you you know the
profile page here's a profile page you
can see the total score up here and the
right and you see the badges that the
unlock badges are basically
accomplishments that you you
accomplished as you go through the
system so you have the beginners HTML
that's if you've done the course you get
the beginners HTML badge and so on PHP
tag cloud and there's other badges and
prizes that you can unlock if you will
things like answering 10 questions
without getting any hints in a role and
that kind of thing of course attracts
the courses that you completed it's a
pretty good stuff and the good thing
about the profile building is that
because the system tracks your progress
scores you you unlock badges it gives
people an idea about what you've been
doing in the course how well you've been
doing in the course and it's something
that some people could probably use on
their resumes since your ears a control
here in terms of the system so if your
employer wanted you to learn PHP for
instance or JavaScript you can you can
be assured that you know by him picking
up the course for you he can track
you'll see how you know what you've
completed it and you learn this material
you've done it properly because it will
be reflected in your profile in your you
know in your scores now if you want to
see what your profile looks publicly
just go to your dashboard then you go
view public profile and you see that
this test user has completed two courses
the beginners all p in a beautiful
script as if they've only done eighteen
percent of beginners HTML two percent of
twenty four percent of tag cloud they've
unlocked these badges we have many more
badges and
coming out and more than you see here so
there you go to close out this
introduction to killer sites University
I want to show you a real profile here
and you can see she's unlocked 35 badges
she's accumulated 16,000 points and you
see the courses that she's completed so
she's been pretty involved the badges
that she's unlocked and it gives you an
idea of what this person is actually
pretty dedicated to learning these
things and you see when she when she
joined and last activity day which is a
few days ago and of course if you want
to share your profile we provide this
convenient link so you can just cut and
paste this and send it to people and you
can see that you know through and I for
like a better turned an audited system
approved proofs system that you know
you're actually learning the material
that's it I hope you found this video
informative we will be introducing
individual courses over the next few
months and thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
