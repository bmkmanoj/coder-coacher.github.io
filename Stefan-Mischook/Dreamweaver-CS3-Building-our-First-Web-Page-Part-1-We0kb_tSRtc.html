dreamweaver cs3 what a basic theory
anyway what I want to do now is build
our very first web page with cs3 the
idea behind this particular video is
just to give you a feel about how it how
it is to use the tools in Dreamweaver
cs3 and you can see how quickly we can
put together a very simple web page
later on we'll get into details and
we'll get into the fancier stuff for now
just get into it pause the video from
time to time so you can actually do
stuff with me along the way and I think
that jumping into it like this will make
things a lot clearer for you down the
road so we have dreamweaver open here so
what we want to do is we want to go into
assuming that we have the screen here
this is the welcome screen if you don't
have that you go into edit preferences
you will show welcome to make sure this
is checked off show welcome screen if
this is not checked off check it off and
then you have to restart dreamweaver to
see the screen so when you're in here
you want to go under the create new
column here and you want to select just
HTML now dreamweaver automatically
spawns this window here for us and
creates an untitled document so let's
give this web page a title call web page
one and then click enter so that sets
the title you see now we have a little
star beside the untitled 6 tab here what
you want to do now is go to file save
now Dreamweaver is going to ask you
where you want to save it now I assume
that you created the home directory for
your website as we did in a previous
video and if you notice we have our
images folder so what you want to do is
you want to call it index
dot HTML I'm going to explain to you
what this is all about very soon and
click Save so you see in our files panel
group here just say I'm opening closing
and so you can see so you got index dot
HTML file if I scroll this over you can
also get a little bit of injury extra
information about this file we get its
size it's only one kilobyte since it's
nothing in there and we see the type of
document it is now says it's a firefox
document the reason it says it's a
firefox documents because firefox is my
default browser on this particular
computer if IE internet explorer was
your default document excuse me browser
it would say ie document and you can see
the data was created and so forth so we
have an index HTML page and now you
notice that it's not called untitled 6
is called index.html so we can
open-close documents like we can click
the X button here that will close it to
open up the file you can double-click it
like I just did or you can right click
it or Apple click it and then on the Mac
of course and just click open so we have
our HTML document open now what's an
HTML document dot HTML HTML is short for
hypertext markup language hypertext is
referred reference to links it's it's a
piece of to a link you know you click on
a link in a website so if we go to a web
page and i'm on google here if I click
news that's a link it's called a
hyperlink because when you click on it
it takes you to a different page that's
the type err it's it's crazy so hyper
text refers to text that has a link on
it you see that whole idea of the link
where you click on a piece of text and
it takes you to another page or another
website that really is the backbone of
the internet that's the brilliance of
internet where you can just scroll
through a text document or D which our
document that has images and you can
click on a piece of image or the text
and it will take you to another page
that's really the nuts and bolts of it
all well in the basic sense it's called
hypertext markup language type or text
as opposed to hyper images because
originally when the web was designed it
was not designed to support images the
web used to be just text only text only
pages things have changed markup
language HTML a markup language is a
written language that basically
describes to the browser what it is you
want to have displayed in the page so
when you're building a web page whether
it be with Dreamweaver or some other
tool you're actually just writing code
code that browsers web browsers like
most of the firefox or internet explorer
read we're going to get into this in
another video but when you're actually
doing stuff dropping in images and so
forth with Dreamweaver you're actually
in the background Dreamweaver is
actually writing code so what brings me
to another thing you see we've got these
three tabs we got design view show
design view show code and design views
and show code view by default
dreamweaver goes to design view where
you can build your pages as if you are
using a word processor like like
Microsoft Word or something if you
wanted to check out the code but
Dreamweaver is creating behind the
scenes you would just click the code
button and lo and behold you have all
kinds of code you don't need to
understand this completely to be a web
designer or to use Dreamweaver although
it does help quite a bit and we're going
to get into it just a little bit of this
in another video again don't don't get
scared off this is not actually as
complex as it looks but I just want you
to take away from this segment of the
video is that when you are creating
pages in Dreamweaver Dreamweavers
actually in the background writing code
for you
alright since we've made a change to our
page let's actually save this and we
know that the page is not saved because
you see the little star here beside the
name so let's just go to file and you
hit save you notice beside the save
command we have ctrl + S that tells us
the hot key on the keyboard that we can
combination the hot key combination
rather that we can use to save our
document without having to go up through
the menu so I'll just use the menu for
now since we're doing our video so I'll
ctrl s so you see the stars appears that
tells us that the page is now been saved
so what we're going to do now is build
out a quick little page just by cutting
and pasting some text in here so you
notice I had typed us in manually so I'm
going to hit the enter key and you see
it creates a new paragraph for us and
you notice this becomes unsaved again
this time I'm going to use the hotkeys
just to save the document so let me get
some text and then we'll paste that in
and we'll start creating a few
paragraphs some headings and we'll take
a look at our page you know live browser
