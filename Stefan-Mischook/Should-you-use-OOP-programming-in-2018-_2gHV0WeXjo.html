object-oriented code in 2018 generally
speaking I would say yes but of course
it depends on the type of programming
that you're going to do in recent years
there's been a bit of a backlash against
Oopa Oopa short for object-oriented
programming because it has a bunch of
land mines things that I've been
critical of for many years now
and I've actually taken Eaton pass for
being critical of object-oriented
programming in that regard before I get
into it let me just say that I don't
think object-oriented programming should
be thrown out with the bathwater as they
say I think it should be used properly
and in moderation so what's the problem
object-oriented programming
well what happen is you have an idea
with object-oriented programming where
basically you configure your code you
write your code in the form of
programmatic objects the idea is to
create code that's easier to read easier
to update and better organized in the
form of objects and then you would have
these code objects which kind of look
like functions if you know anything
about programming and these code objects
will communicate with each other to
build your software whereas the
old-school type of programming something
called procedural programming it's where
everything was organized in terms of
procedures or tasks and the downside
with procedural coding was that it could
get messy pretty quickly with something
called go-to statements go-to statements
anybody remembers that amongst other
things now here is my take on this whole
thing of object-oriented programming
versus procedure over so functional the
big problem with old-school procedural
was not so much the style programming
programming but more the lack of
discipline and a lot of programmers in
those days the code tended to get very
messy very quickly and procedural code
would easily degrade into something
called spaghetti code kind of
like a bowl spaghetti everything's all
mixed up and you try to pull and make a
little change here it would break
something there and it was just a big
mess and guess what this can happen
pretty easily with object-oriented
programming as well object-oriented
languages as well because if you design
your object-oriented code using some of
the baseline or some of the key tools
built into object-oriented programming
you could get spaghetti like code as
well and I'm talking about inheritance
inheritance can lead to lots of
spaghetti code because what happens with
inheritance is you have basically a
bunch of nerds writing a bunch of code
which you would call your baseline
object so you know that like the
foundation of your app and then what
they would do is they would use the
mechanisms of inheritance this is
something built into object-oriented
programming languages but allow you to
basically use code from those base that
baseline layer of code those base
objects they call me base objects that
call them the parent objects etc the
problem with that is that then you have
one set of code the higher-level code
which is becomes very dependent on this
base line code but it's not only is it
dependent it's also very much
intertwined
so there's a lot without getting too
specific details what happens when you
use inheritance it's far more likely
that you're going to get spaghetti ish
code code that is what nerds would say
is tightly coupled meaning couple
tightly meaning very much bound together
very dependent on each other but not in
a clean coupling this is a clean
coupling where you go click it's clean
you got just two hooks it's more like
this type of coupling all kinds of
little things and if one coder goes and
changes something in a base class like
this the whole thing falls apart I don't
know if that makes any sense point is
away a lot of people implemented or used
in her
since it became a problem where you had
the same not the same but you have
spaghetti ish brittle code as a result
and it became a mess on top of that
object-oriented code it has a tendency
to be very verbose being very long very
big long-winded because you got again a
Miami into specifics it could be just
you have to write a lot more code if
you're writing ooo code I was just going
to code than you would if you were a
function or a procedural code and again
the more code but I don't know if I said
this already so forget the again strike
again the more code that you have the
more potential for bugs right it's just
the way it is I remember way back in the
day way back when I was a young nerdly I
was forced to do some PHP coding
procedural PHP with PHP 3 I believe it
was and at this time this is in the 90s
I was a big Java programmer so that's
heavyweight object-oriented programming
there and the client insisted that I do
within PHP because they already had
invested some PHP I've talked about this
in other vlogs and so what happened is
well if I wanted a job I had to write in
PHP say ok I'm gonna read PHP I'm out
now I remember I was disgusted with PHP
what wasn't happy with it because it was
it wasn't the most pretty looking code
that PHP code itself to begin with but
it lacked a lot of the built-in
capabilities that you had in Java
because first and foremost at that time
PHP 3 was not object-oriented it was
procedural that today PHP 7 is pure it's
fully object-oriented it has all the
capabilities that any modern
object-oriented language so let me go
back in time again to that example
anyway so here I am is starting to write
this thing with old-school PHP it with
all its weaknesses but what I discovered
it took as a fraction of the code it
took to write the same thing in Java
so for example this is a rough number
for me to do something in PHP might take
five lines of code it could take five
hundred to a thousand lines to do the
same thing in Java and I remember one of
the big weaknesses of PHP was that it
didn't have something called try catch
air trapping had a very primitive air
trapping PHP did happen whereas Java has
a very sophisticated air trapping now of
course the air traffic code was very
very again a long-winded verbose lots of
air trapping code let me tell you PHP
just had a city called I statement boom
you just killed it there's very simple
was primitive it was it wasn't very it
wasn't very cool but here's the thing I
remember I was discussing I believe was
with my brother at the time he was crap
it all over PHP is there but it was was
doing then and a lot of people still do
now anyway and I wasn't a big fit was it
thrilled but it sort of I came to a
realization and said well you know yeah
we don't have any good air trapping
which will allow us to pinpoint exactly
what error is in our code but if we only
have five lines of code instead of a
thousand it's a lot easier to debug it's
a lot easier to debug in the first place
so it became much less of an issue for
me at that time specially because these
this was a simple web app wasn't
anything very complex the PHP app so
made me realize that yeah
PHP procedural pieces of PHP PHP 3 which
is old PHP was very limited but it was
very it was very terse meaning it very
little cold got a lot done with PHP so
there's a give-and-take with that anyway
back to the original discussion that and
all code being would you write it today
yes I would write it today but I would
write it in a more conservative way I
wouldn't use inheritance 99% at a time
because it can get all spaghetti ish
inheritance now people argue yeah but
you could do it properly and this and
that is true but again from my
experience in the field
it's more likely if you use inheritance
you're going to have problems and some
of the most famous Java people out there
talk about that and they actually say
they prefer something called composition
and interface that basic Java
development versus inheritance based
Java development and again the whole
point of inheritance is to try to reuse
code and to try to keep the code more
modular but you reuse code but you then
you have what you calls tightly tightly
coupled code which is something you want
to avoid tightly coupled code is just
code that's too interdependent on each
other all strung up and stuff which
could cause problems
now you could reuse code using the
composition design pattern and design
patterns as a way to write code there's
many out there now design pattern the
design pattern composition this says
have simple objects simple code that
then calls other simple code objects
again you do one of my courses and you
understand what this is all about
essentially you want a favor
composition utilizing very simple I call
them dumb dumb objects over inheritance
and another thing you can use another
design pattern where you use something
use something called interfaces which
will allow you to create a consistency
in your code base across the entire app
so again if you're a total beginner to
programming this is all gibberish to you
so this is this is video here's more
leaning towards people who have a bit of
programming background at least you know
your basics and so on and there you go
so yeah I would still be using
inheritance these days but I would use
very simple objects I would be using
very few design patterns I would use as
I said composition and I would use
interfaces that allows you to share code
reuse code which is a holy grail of
coding by the way to reuse code and
interfaces will allow you create a
consistent code base
across your app I will also use of
course MVC Model View controller which
is a very popular way of organizing your
code and that's it I would have just you
know simple objects some nerds well the
Japanese will call these fine-grained
objects that have a single purpose and
this way they're more easy to they're
more easily used or more easily updated
or more easily well that's it that's all
you need to know I suppose about this
yes I would use object-oriented
programming for sure I would just keep
it simple I wouldn't go into some of the
more of that stuff in terms of the
object-oriented the strategies that are
put out there and that's always happens
whenever you have academics who take a
technology they tend to go wild because
in terms of their theoretical executions
involve their theoretical theoretical
implementations of an idea so you see
that in any field so I saw two martial
arts where you would see martial arts
where they started from a fighting base
because they all came from a fighting
base at one point in time all the
traditional arts all came from a
fighting style at one point but what
happens is that and they start the
martial art teachers started working on
new techniques and new ideas that are
detached from actual combat and they get
into these more elaborate more complex
techniques and trading methods they're
become more and more detached from the
real world and you end up with this pile
of mess in a martial art and that
doesn't really work in the real world
you see this so many times I saw this I
used to train styles like that until I
got smart about it and you've seen that
in programming as well so you've seen a
good idea object-oriented programming
which it's intention is to make code
cleaner easier update and more reusable
and of course they go the Nerds get
ahold of it
academic nerds rather and they go down
these tangents these rabbit holes and
they create all these complexities based
on not real-world stuff and I've seen
this in the Java community I've seen
this in many different areas of
programming as well so you got to watch
out for that so yeah object-oriented
programming sure why not use it 2018
just use it properly lightly don't go
too crazy and but you know what it's not
necessarily you're gonna have to use all
code for certain types of programming
you'd probably be better off a
functional code a accessor exercise so
it's all very circumstantial proof but
generally speaking for web apps web apps
and so forth for larger systems I would
lean towards object-oriented code but
lately applied if you will that's it gel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
