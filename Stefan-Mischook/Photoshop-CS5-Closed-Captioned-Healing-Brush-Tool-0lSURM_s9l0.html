at the healing brush tool it's a great
tool really works very well and unlike
the other ones which except for that is
the patch tool the patch tool we sort of
defined a source we said look I want
this area to look like this area well
the healing brush tool does a similar
thing unlike the Spot Healing Brush tool
which you just point to and it figures
out what's around that area and says hey
well I'll help you with that no problem
but here the healing brush tool is a
little bit more specific so first thing
I want to do is I'm going to revert this
back to its normal shape and we can do
that together if you're following along
and old man jpg here is what I have open
i'm just going to zoom in on some of
these areas right here and let's take a
look at what the healing brush tool can
do now very small notice it's not
feathered at all and here if I were to
press shift and left square bracket I
can feather that all the way to 0 let's
see there it is hardness 0 so you can
have a feathered edge or you can work
with something that is a harder edge if
you prefer and just my right square
bracket to increase the size of that now
let's take a look if you'll notice if I
were to just click somewhere little
warning says option click to define the
source point that's all to click on a pc
that should be used as it repair so if
you wanted this area to look more like
this area over here you can do that
quite easily just press alt or option
depending on your platform click on it
here and then notice how it's bringing
that area over and if i come here and
click on that take a look you'll
probably be really really you know very
difficult for anybody to see the change
that was made in that area now look if i
were to take this area that i took over
here and sort of put it in with some
place that you know looks very different
like the shadow so that's not a great
idea because
well I mean it worked okay here but and
that's thanks to the power of the
healing brush tool it's extremely
powerful but let's see what happens if
we take it over here not such a great
thing I'm going to go back commands add
I'm just going to undo that particular
move now let's set another source point
for example if I were to come in here
i'm going to press alt and I'll set this
area as my source and then when I let go
I'm going to come over here and click on
that not left click as I did but not
right click excuse me but left click and
you can see the difference there's the
big blemish and there it is without now
I purposely took a little bit of the
pattern that was here and brought it
over here just to try and make it look a
little bit more realistic and then with
that again we saw how we can you know
dodge that little area if it's a little
too dark and we can work with those
elements in here just like that so
nevertheless these are great ways that
you can go in and manage certain areas
that have blemishes and remove certain
things so for example I'll just go back
to that tool again and I'll say well
what about this area here over lapping
this area so let's take a very similar
area notice starting to get a little
dark here and it's little highlights in
these areas so I'm going to copy maybe
this area over here and you can even
make it smaller or larger whatever you
want just press option I'll click there
then I'll come here and try to mask
right over this area and you can see
there that you know I've really done a
very good job of removing some of those
elements I'm going to zoom out just by
pressing alt by the way you don't really
have to press alt it's it's
all-inclusive in here just left and
right should be fine and notice the
difference right you'd really be
hard-pressed to notice that you know
there was something here there was
something there as well so you can work
around with some of these elements
and you know if we were to zoom in on
this area over here for example you'll
notice that small little darkness can be
overcome just by coming in here alt
clicking coming over here and just
separating that space you'll notice when
you do click there's that little plus
sign just off to the right of my brush
preview and as you can see that little
element just shows you know what areas
you're copying so if you continuously
brush with this you're continuously
copying that area but what you may
notice is that it did a really good job
of eliminating that little blemish it's
hardly noticeable and I really believe
that anybody would be very hard for us
to notice that it was ever there so
that's just a little bit more of working
with the healing tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
