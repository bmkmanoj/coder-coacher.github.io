haven't heard that the iPhone is in fact
being slowed down when a new operating
system comes out but to be precise older
iPhones are being purposefully in the
code they slow them down and the reason
Apple gives is because the batteries are
getting old and because the battery is
getting old they're less performant and
it could cause the operating system to
randomly shut down the phone without
notice because it's protecting itself or
something to that effect anyhow it's
interesting that they finally admitted
it why not just mentioned this a few
years ago so that people maybe instead
of dealing with an older slower iPhone
maybe they could just upgrade the
battery I don't know this is my theory
Amrit and it's running at full blast
right now and you can barely hear it
this is how much noise it makes running
full blast and let's see how litecoin
machines compare noise wise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
