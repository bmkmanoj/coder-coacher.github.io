about martial arts and decision making
so if you're looking for some nerd
technical information in this vlog
you're not going to get it this is about
martial arts and decision making you see
what I mean so it starts off with a
little story so a very good friend of
mine scratch that somebody I know you
for years so but I knew for years were
trained with for many years we didn't
hang out outside of class but I traded
him for many many years and you may or
may not know about me I did martial arts
pretty consistently for about 30 years
give or take depending and lots of
styles that are you know combat oriented
boxing for like five six years I did
some some muy Thai never daring fine but
point I training anyway on the side I
did judo for a few years freestyle
wrestling a whole bunch of stuff I've
been in a ring many times and I used to
be a bouncer in a nightclub well a
couple like clubs I did bouncing work
for about two years something like that
anyway so all that to say and a little
bit about fighting so one of my training
partners used to go to a nightclub and
on regular basis and one day and this is
when he's in his mid-30s later he's a
little older than me at the time this
goes back a few years and he gets into a
fight at a club but he went too often
and he got to fight for with a few guys
and he put one guy in the hospital and
hurt the other couple guy it's pretty
badly I forget the details bottom line
is he he took out some people put one
guy in a hospital and so thus he got
arrested now up in Canada the laws are
not nearly as harsh as they are in the
States but they are what they are so he
you got into a bunch of trouble for
getting into a fight using all
his martial art skills and so I ran into
him maybe six months or a year after the
whole thing settled this is a guy with
no criminal background no priors as far
as I know so you had to go to court yet
to get lawyers you had to pay for the
guy's hospital bills he had to pay for
legal costs so cost them a chunk of
change now you can understand in Canada
it's not like the US you know our our
legal system is not nearly as litigious
you can't sue people for everything that
God it's not that it's very difficult
compared to the u.s. that being said a
super expensive process tons of time and
a court to go to court to deal with all
the headaches associated with all this
he said to me and this is a guy had been
training martial arts as long as as me
and he said you know it wasn't worth it
stuff you know it wasn't worse me
getting into the fight and he said you
wouldn't do it again mm-hmm you wouldn't
do it again and it goes back to an old
rule i was talking I was a kid actual I
was 14 if you see a situation brewing
whereas a fight about to happen you have
to make a decision then then in there
whether you're willing to hurt this
person really really badly and if you're
not willing to hurt this person really
really badly then just leave right away
now 99.999% at a time you shouldn't want
to hurt anybody badly because first of
all it's we get you to deep trouble with
the law say it evolved could get you
killed because if you heard somebody
really badly they may hold a grudge or
their family or friends might hold a
grudge and they'll come after you if
they know who you are and then you can
get in trouble with the law and it's a
whole bunch of headaches so unless your
life is really in danger unless it's
like you have no option I can tell you
now I'm a guy
who's was a bouncer been in a lot of
situations I would strongly suggest to
you that you just avoid fights it's just
not worth it even if you could take out
five guys at the same time but I know
people can and even if you can do all
this type of stuff even if you're the
baddest person around you know besides
the fact that you can be as bad as you
can get it just takes somebody with a
weapon and it could take you out pretty
easily the criminal and the civil
liability and the headaches involved
with office you're much much much much
much better off just to leave just
forget about it you got to pick your
battles as they say you're going to pick
your fights so how does this relate to
coding well not much really to coding at
all except to say that when you are
working on a project sometimes you'd be
tempted as a coder to try to optimize a
chunk of code this is like so this is so
unrelated but it's kind of related
anyway you I used to do this I I can
make this chunk of code and I can make
the code run five percent better or
temper sound better but at the end of
the day to get that extra five ten
percent of efficiency is this not worth
the effort it's just it's not worth the
effort because CPUs are so fast
computers are getting faster every year
chances are that this five or ten
percent increase is going to have much
of an impact on your abs performance
overall or the perception of performance
is nearly zero so I wouldn't be
bothering too much with that so how do
how does this relate back to getting to
scraps get into fights and and not
fighting it has to do with picking your
battles it has to do with considering
the consequences and I've talked about
this a risk and reward of doing things
so to get into a fight even if you're a
bad ass mother again like I said it's
not worth it you know even my
agent 45 now I'm an old guy and I'm not
new as capable as I used to be but I'm
so i'm sooo pretty capable but i don't
care anymore it's like I a jag I insults
me whatever what do I care if I get into
fight with him and I beat them up i
could probably get arrested and charged
and cosmic crime so money this is
headache it's much easier just to go
whatever just walk or leaf leaf that's
it they come at you and they're chasing
you then you know if you can you do it
if you're not sure you can hurt them you
can defend yourself rather than you just
usually run that's my advice same leone
coding don't waste your time on chunks
of code that you may think you can
optimize they'll also waste your time in
battles with other people around you if
you have a battle over I don't know it
could be with clients over 50 bucks or
it could be with coworkers all I'm
suggesting to use that calmness as they
say in French and a pet that calmness
become consider that the risk and
considered whether or not taking a
particular action is actually worth
taking and sometimes it's better to bite
your tongue and not get into a scrap
with something even if you think you're
right even if you know you're right you
guys say is it worth me doing anything
here so worth me getting involved that's
all that's all I got to say touch up
it's time for album of the day it is
Steely Dan can't buy it through now if
you saw my other brief mention of Steely
Dan's Asia which was a black album which
is much more of a jazzy album here is
Steely Dan's Asia this I think is there
it might be in their best album it has
the most hits on it though hits that
you've probably heard maybe you may have
heard the melodies in the past and it
really is a great album and this I
believe is a vinyl pressing yep made in
Japan oh you can see or not so that
means the quality of this is tipped
typically not always better but
typically better than North American
pressing for instance although UK
pressings are very good as well so this
is a great album in from 70s it has some
huge hits on here reeling in the years
the biggest hit next thing you know like
you're gonna hear i'm sure you've heard
do it again dirty work great stuff only
a fool would say that another great song
midnight cruiser great album jazzy but a
little less jazzy a little bit more
poppy than the previous Steely Dan album
i mentioned highly recommend especially
if you're into high-quality soundly
sound like well recorded music well
recorded by the artists Steely Dan does
a very consistent job in that regard I
don't know if you can get this in high
def digital yet I don't think you can so
if you want the best quality you would
have to get the vinyl listen to the
album on YouTube I'm sure you can find
out there yep Steely Dan can buy a
thrill several hits on there I'm sure
you will enjoy it very much this is for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
