Saturday night I guess it's Saturday
night again Saturday night coffee coffee
and berries so don't mind my blue lips
the the blueberries does that so I'm
doing a night vlog to answer a question
that was put to me how important is good
photography in websites and should i buy
a Nikon the shirt to start shooting
photos for websites so two answers a
great imagery and photography's is very
important for websites I try to use them
myself although it's a part of it but
before I would go out to buy a camera
hoping to make my money selling photos
for websites I think that's unlikely not
because they're not important during
it's an unlikely thing you're going to
make a lot of money on that at the
beginning because there's so many stock
photography sites out there that people
can buy their images from millions
probably now for 25 bucks or if your
unlimited license use for websites so
photography is great but I think if you
wanted to get into photography I
wouldn't count on trying to sell photos
to people who want to build websites I
think they're going to they might buy a
photo from you but remember you're going
to be competing against all those two
stock photography sites which you can
upload to as well but it's a difficult
thing a friend of mine has been doing
the stock photography thing for years
now he's not a professional photographer
but he's got a pretty good DSLR he takes
photos and he's been building up his
talks his stock photography collection
on these sites for years now doesn't
make much you know makes 50 bucks 100
bucks a month baby after years so that's
not the route if you want to make money
as a photographer I would imagine you
would have to get into a good friend of
mine was doing
photography professionally for a little
bit you have to get into the wedding
businesses to do photography for
weddings special events business events
and whatnot another thing to consider if
and again i'm not in a professional
photographer so this is a basic
principle I'm leaning on here basic
business principle if you want to get a
hit ahead in any business you get a
specialized you got to find a niche and
you got to do stuff at other people are
not doing so that said I would strongly
recommend that you get into baby or look
at you rather specialized photography
maybe drone photography drone you know
flyovers video photos for wedding
special events maybe people maybe that
might be an angle that will allow you to
get into the game but here's the thing
that's probably a lot of logistical
issues with regards to doing
professional photography you have to
learn how to use the cameras and all the
equipment and that takes time you get to
learn that and i would recommend you do
course whether it be an online course or
private tutoring even better doing
online course and go offer to work for a
wedding photographer for free you might
you might even have a hard time getting
that gig because they don't want people
know what they're doing but that's a
good quick way if you did several months
of working for professional in the field
that could speed up your learning big
time so going back way back when I was a
young guy I want to get into the
import-export business so what did I do
I went and worked as a drone drone
meaning at the very bottom of the barrel
for an import-export business but I knew
of I said I off whatever i'll wash
floors i'll do whatever was the best
move i could have made because i was
able to just i worked there just for
summer but first of all I develop a good
relationship with the owners which came
in useful later on in the career and
number two I learned a lot about how the
business worked in the back end in the
operation how they were doing things
because I was there for several few my
so you may want to do that is where I
get into photography so to conclude yes
good photos is important for web
development that's for sure good to have
nice images the problem is there's so
much competition because of all these
photo sharing sites that is very
difficult so if you want to get into
photography that's cool but understand
that there's a lot of competition
understand that you should be looking at
niche areas of professional video and
photography providing those services it
could be specialized in baby photos if
you're good with babies could be drone
and other wacky types of video that you
specialize in to provide these services
who knows I'm not in that space so you
have to really learn the business that's
a very important thing about getting
into any type of business is you have to
really understand you know where the
demand is understand the business so if
you're on a tight budget you may want to
get yourself a nice decent entry-level
DSLR don't go for a five-thousand-dollar
camera or anything like that if you're I
don't know nikon so if I were you if you
were into let's say canon you might want
to get something middle of the road like
an 80 da 0d that's what I just got or
7th ed and work with that camera because
you can take amazing photos and do very
good videos with those cameras without
putting out the big money that would say
a 5d mark Vegas mark for now will cost
now cost you a 45 Grand so especially if
you're beginner because you may not like
it in the end the good thing about
investing in camera equipment with the
big boys nikon or canon there's always
going to be a market and aftermarket for
that so let's say you buy a decent nikon
or decent cannon was a couple good lads
as you start with one lens of flexible
lens and then you move on from there if
you decide that photographer for me you
you know there's going to be a market
for madmen for my camera and you know
there's gonna be a market for that lens
so that's so you will get all your money
back that's for sure but at least you
get some of it back so there you go
those are the considerations I hope you
don't mind this night blog like I said
this is my
surface pro web camera and it's just so
easy to do vlogs this way and that's it
cheers guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
