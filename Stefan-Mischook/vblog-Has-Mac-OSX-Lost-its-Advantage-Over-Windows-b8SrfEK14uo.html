with killer sites calm and killer video
store calm and other sites what are the
advantages that for me one of the main
advantages that Mac had over windows was
the fact that viruses were few and far
between you didn't get viruses too much
part of the reason was because there was
so few max out their relative to my
relative to Windows that the virus
makers said don't even bother with it
and another reason why you saw that
spira says as far as I understood it was
because the mac operating system mac OS
10 is based on a unix flavor of unix
called freebsd if i recall so unix in it
in it of itself is a more secure
operating system doesn't mean it's a
hundred percent safe but it is more
secure than windows at least as far as i
understand i'm not an expert in unix
anyway you may have heard recently this
is the early April 2012 Mac Big Mac
virus has hit the web it's hit over half
a million seed machines where it's
downloading all kinds of crap so you
don't want to well the virus basically
sticks up any machines checks your hard
drive for banking information or
whatever information may find
interesting and then it sends this off
to a server somewhere so bottom line and
the point of this video blog is that Mac
OS is one of its major advantages the
perception or the security is now gone
as a result we were seeing amongst other
things more cracks or more chinks and
apples
of dominance that we've seen over the
last five years or so as I've mentioned
in another video I believe that Windows
has an opportunity here to really make
some major headway with windows 8
combined with Nokia Lumia phone and
which uses a windows 8 derivative
meaning it looks the same it's a
tile-based Windows operating system and
when you look at the new high-end really
slick looking ultrabooks would basically
look like the mac air and other laptops
wet that are now stylistically and power
wise matching the apple computer devices
what's the other point yeah the other
point is that you know I have to be
honest with you I stopped using really
windows very much too much with windows
XP Windows Vista was a total disaster
certificado is that even bother and but
now windows 7 i've been looking at it
and I'm actually pretty impressed at how
much they've you know Microsoft has
progressed I heard he windows days you
know for what I've seen is even much
better i'm looking at windows again
because i got to do a bunch of new
tutorials updated tutorials with windows
because still by far and away windows is
the predominant operating system used
out there here's another advantage I
think windows may have a very smart move
in that they've integrated html5 and
JavaScript into the corridor operating
system so developers programmers with
html5 and gems but now it should be able
to write apps for Windows native apps
now I don't know the details and looked
at it in detail but it's it's something
it's something worth noting and I think
that this is a board because the easier
it is for software developers to create
programs for
particular platform the more software
you can have the more attractive to
platform is so there you go yeah one of
the main advantages that Mac had was the
protection from viruses and trojans and
all this kind of stuff it seems it seems
as though that era is now done it may
have been done that a couple years ago
but I've as far as I know I haven't
gotten any Mac viruses knock on wood but
it's something to be concerned about now
and the solution is is to use virtual
machines that's the solution what is
that well on Mac that's using fusion
installing a version of windows and in
there surf with your windows on your on
your sites that you may but may be
dangerous doing that will protect it
will protect you from viruses because
the viruses will be contained within the
virtual machine that's what I used to do
what I was still using Windows XP a lot
i had person i was using vmware fusion
although there are free or virtual
machines out there they're apparently
pretty good i've never used them but I
sort of told anyhow i use vmware fusion
workstation nokia where workstation for
Windows and I would just install
different versions of microsoft windows
so that I could surf the web with them
and not have to worry about trojans and
so on because I got a Trojan I just
rolled back the virtual machine and
there is no problem if you don't know
what a virtual machine is it's basically
a sandbox that you install and your
computer and then you install your
operating system windows in that sandbox
nothing gets out of it so if you get a
virus there doesn't matter can't get out
and another big advantage about is that
you can just say you know roll back to
the version of windows before that virus
came around so you can do these type of
things it's pretty cool you won't i
won't get into details here i was using
the sites for surfing i was using it for
saucer development so i could
test apps that I built on different
versions of Windows or with different
versions of Internet Explorer back in
the date anyway that's it a little bit
of a rambling vblog right all right late
little tired ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
