calm now I just recorded this video but
I'm going to get into now I just
recorded for about 15 minutes and guess
what I didn't press record so I'm pretty
bummed out about that because now I'm
going to try and repeat the 15 minutes
in the next five minutes of those
probably going to take me 10 minutes
because that's the way I roll so this
video is about how and/or why rather do
I have so many domain names if you've
been watching my videos sometimes to say
I'm staff with killer sites com other
times I'll say I'm staff with killer PHP
or web mentor or studio web so why so
many domain names it has to do with
history it has to do with the fact but
I've been involved on this Web teaching
stuff for a long long time so we go way
back I started coding in 1994 and I
started professionally coding in 1996
meaning being paid to code and over that
period of time I would buy ups by up
sites or actually build up sites and
URLs now the first web design related
site I picked up or started was killer
sites com now I didn't come up with that
site i actually purchased it or not
purchase time I got it from the previous
owner who's actually used pretty famous
back in the 90s he wrote this book
called here it is called creating killer
websites yeah it was international
bestseller published in like nineteen
language languages and if you notice on
the spawn the book here killer sites
calm and so killer sites calm was
established in 1996 or 95 I'm not sure
and it basically was a companion to this
very very popular book and this book was
very important because he really you
know he was this guy this author is the
first guy to say you know what we should
maybe use good design principles in
teaching web in actually building
websites as something that
prior you know prior to this book people
didn't do the sites are pretty pretty
ugly pretty ugly but so he brought in
that amongst other things and he was a
very important figure back in the 90s I
was lucky enough to inherit the site
from him I'm not sure exactly what it's
either two thousand or two thousand to
something like that and I started
writing articles and teaching web design
and basic web development so what
happened is he fast forward a year or
two and I had written some PHP articles
on killer sites calm and I said well you
know what the way Google was working the
search engine mr. google they liked very
topic specific sites these sites I said
no I'm going to create some niche site
so i created killer PHP calm to put all
my PHP videos and vlogs and podcasts and
articles and tutorials on killer PHP
then I created another site called how
to build websites etapa Gators web
design basic HTML basic stuff real basic
stuff and then I add CSS tutorial net
and other sites now never said I talked
about studio web com studio web com in
fact I registered that domain 1998 for
my web development company that I had at
the time and yeah now I started
developing professionally being paid to
write code in 96 actually no 95 actually
did a website for a legal firm anyway
but I really got rolling with it in 96
and then i have worked under different
names but then i gots to do well I was
pretty good name and I had a web design
studio with maybe 7 10 people and most
seven people under me in a long time and
so that's where suiting web comes from
now study web is a cipher teachers code
used by schools different thing now so
yes that's why I have a lot of domain
names because I would try I was going
after micro niche night
going after niche site search engine
traffic it was a very effective strategy
in its day things have changed though
now's anybody who knows anything about
web marketing having a strong presence
on social media is very important out
with the search engines in the old days
it was just about how many sites linked
to you and how important those linking
sites were and some other things as well
these days your presence on social media
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google Google
Plus etc those are much more important
for accenture engine search engines and
I think that's that makes sense because
the search engine ones want to know what
people are talking about now in terms of
judging which sites are more important
so there you go I think that covers it
that's why I have many different domain
names experimentation but i think i'm
getting rid of them i'm cutting down
because i used to have kill sites QR PHP
a set of key or PHP or netcom which you
don't need to do any more used to do
because it's try to protect the URLs I
don't want people registry and killer
PHP or by a killer PHP com silliness
like this so eventually you know I'd
have like 50 domain names with all these
different domain extensions or got
infocomm is stupid because now you
there's like a thousand domain name
extensions or you can't do it anymore
you just pick your domain that's it yeah
and then I had killer Ajax and killer
JavaScript and killer this and kill her
that so you know I've kind of moved away
a bit from the killer names because you
know people get a little uppity about
that killer sites what's that site about
yeah so I get that tie would get calls
from people say where's your information
or emails where's your information about
you know Manson you know or Jeffrey
Dahmer you know where's your you know
they figure out literally a website
about mass murderers or something but
killer sites is about building killer
websites as in really good websites and
again it was the book website for miss
this
take your really hot book um yeah but
don't worry yeah this this is not my
book but I recently wrote my own book
right here it's a nine bestseller 19
languages doing okay it's getting very
good reviews at amazon i just published
this in last summer i guess last july so
it's almost a year old not bad and
actually wrote this book to help me plan
out my new video courses my interactive
training system and it helped a lot so
it's kind of that two purposes you know
so there you go do you need many domain
names these days no pick a good one
that's suitable for your business make
sure short remember Bo not hard to spell
if possible it's hard to find good
amazing good domain names now because
everybody who sits on them but if you
hunt around you find something and yeah
just build them up just build them up
however you need to build them up
depending on the type of business but
that's a whole new video but you're
going to have to wait until the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
