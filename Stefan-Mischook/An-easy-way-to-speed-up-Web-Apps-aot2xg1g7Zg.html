twenty 4 2016 so in about to lie i
decided to actively start vlogging on
this youtube channel as you may or may
not know in the past we had put up a
whole bunch of videos from older courses
well at the tiny word holder and though
this is a youtube channel that's must be
78 years old i guess now it was pretty
much inactive up until about june or
july with some exceptions may be a vlog
every two weeks or something so i
decided to try to do almost daily vlogs
since july at the time i believe i had
around 10,000 subscribers so as you can
see here subscribers thirteen thousand
nine hundred and ninety-nine so yeah in
the grand scheme of things it's not a
huge amount of subscribers no kidding
but considering that i went from 10,000
to just about 14,000 just a few months
it's not bad it's not bad considering
the amount of effort I put into this
thing's a terrible amount but anyway so
now i'm going to press refresh and i'm
pretty sure we're going to be over
13,000 999 we want to get rid of evil 13
there we go 14001 isn't that cool so
it's official we're out of the evil 13th
now we're into the lucky for teens which
can only mean good things so thanks for
being a subscriber i'm enjoying doing
the youtube videos here's a phone call
so they'll have to let you go bye-bye
about to head out for my coffee but I
had a little
vlog to do October morning late October
in Montreal see the reflection of the
sky the sky actually looks like so best
way to speed up an appt is to do two
things well PHP app so we have an old
over a legacy PHP app but I run and own
works really well and it's got some
legacy code in their meaning old code
and one of the issues with speed for us
what are we going to do about speed so
it can go in there and start refactoring
which means rewriting bits of the code
to simplify it to maybe speed it up but
the easiest way to speed up a code base
is to wall with PHP is to move PHP early
versions of code from PHP 5 point
whatever version of PHP you have 5 could
be 5.5 5.6 whatever and then move it to
PHP 7 there's a huge speed increase with
PHP 7 that's great and I highly
recommend that you do that we just did
that recently we had some amazing
results but you may have to rewrite some
of your code to adopt itself to to adapt
itself rather to PHP 7 or some
differences here and there the other
thing we did is we move from a
traditional spinning disk drive excuse
me and then we moved into SSD cloud base
drives and whoo to give you an idea
responses that used to take a second or
two with PHP 5.6 or whatever it was five
point accent you know and a traditional
drive have gone down from one or two
seconds to respond to instant you click
and as you're lifting your finger up
it's so fast now but you get a response
it's like a whole brand-new shiny app
and all we did was migrated to PHP 7 and
also we
use an SSD based server super stoked
super happy about it it's breathe new
life into the app without having to do a
huge amount of code yeah so if you got
an appt web app whether it be in PHP or
any other language really any other
server programming language first thing
I would do well in any other language be
sure you have the latest version of the
language usually the optimized for speed
and look at SSD base hosting because
it's just so so much faster so much
faster yeah it's pretty much it short
vlog because I gotta go get my coffee
and I gotta this much work to do today
we'll talk soon bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
