in 2018 short answer is yes all right
and the video okay just kidding I'm
gonna do a little bit more SQL is the
structured query language SQL it's the
language of databases specifically it's
a language of relational databases if
you're building a web app there is a
99.4% chance that you're going to be
using a relational database could be
MySQL be sequel server it could be
whatever firebase and others out there
most of time people are using MySQL now
the reason I mentioned this is because
it's kind of it kind of gets lost in the
mix in terms of web app development
people will kind of as an afterthought
think about databases it but in fact
they should be really respected because
the speed of your app most of the time
will be largely determined by how well
you design your database structure I had
a recent incident where essentially a
small clerical error was made with one
of the database tables key to the studio
web educational app and because of this
essentially a clerical error will go
into the details here it was basically
not applying proper indexes to a table
if you know your databases you know what
I'm talking about
anyway because of that the app was
running super slow and I was putting
tons and tons of CPU onto it and Ram it
was still running was starting to run
really slow because I've always new
students schools jumping on board so I
decided to just take a look at the
database tables and to my surprise I
whoa somebody made a mistake then index
the tables properly so I took the the
three minutes to index the table this is
one of these things where you spend like
a couple hours to three hours diagnosing
a problem and then you realize a problem
then it comes down to just two three
minutes to fix the problem you see that
a lot in software development any out so
I just applied these indexes to the
table database table a tables where I
store lots of information story records
and applying the applying the index took
two or three minutes and bing-bang-boom
Bob's your uncle also superfast
superfast so yes
pay a bit more attention to SQL and
databases in 2018 so sure if you're
learning web app development having well
optimized databases having them
structured properly can really speed up
your app and in increase the longevity
of your app again I mentioned this
because for a lot of people I get the
impression they don't give the database
enough attention enough love as they say
you gotta you know it's it's a poor part
it's it's a significant part of it and
in fact going back to my experience back
to the 1990s one of the most expensive
thing in terms of processor power and
just your apps your servers power is
opening up connections to the database
communicating with database so we used
to design our code to minimize that and
there's different strategies you can use
different to caching and so on anyhow
I'll get into that here but again in
2018 don't fool yourself database is
relational databases which is the most
popular type there's several types of
databases there's object databases as
flat-file databases and there's
relational databases other types as well
relational databases are still hugely
important so pay attention to that so
once you get past your basics if you're
doing the web stack your html5 css3 some
JavaScript and then you choose your
server-side programming language whether
it be PHP or Python or Java C sharp or
Ruby then you got to get into some
databases understand once all about
understand how to create efficient
databases and how to leverage the tools
within the database software the beta
database server software if that's going
to be processing and delivering the
database the data rather to your apps
and you'll be served very well by that
all right hope you found this quick
