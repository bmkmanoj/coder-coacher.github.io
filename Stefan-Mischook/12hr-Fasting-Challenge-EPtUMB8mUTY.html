different see how many people
participate in this I've told you and
other vlogs that I do fast on occasion
now I used to do it much more now I'm
doing again a fast could be 24 hours 48
hours could be longer it could be just
you know 18 hours so here's my challenge
for you my challenge is that you try a
day-long fast not 24 hours trying like a
12-hour 12-hour get up have a light
breakfast and this just drink water all
day and maybe have a light meal at night
no limes a light meal or maybe try and
skip to the next day now do this only if
you're healthy and make sure you consult
your doctor and all this these are usual
legal things I have to tell you because
I'm not a medical doctor it's a
suggestion you have to make the judge
would call for yourself if you're
healthy enough alright now that I've
immunized myself my suggestion what I do
is it starts slow if you try too fast
your body's going to really react
quickly so you try slow and gradually
try to reduce your intake of food
remember it's the amount of food you
take in it has a greater impact in terms
of your health and your weight and your
how you feel than the type of food type
of food healthier food the better of
course but the amount of food according
to studies is more important even or at
least as important so what I would
suggest what you do if you just try to
take in less food drink more water also
be drinking check online so much why you
should have I'm 6 to 199 pounds and I
should be drinking like 2 liters a day I
think it's like 8 10 cups a day or
something like that so of water liquid
you know any liquids count of course so
yeah try to do that because what it will
do is when you do fast
when you do diet drink lots of water it
will actually improve your ability to
think by the way now let me tell you the
first time you do it's gonna be poof
it's a little bit nerve-wracking you
might feel nauseous you might have
dizziness spells you might feel aches
these are all things it's like that's
cold turkey by the way
your body coming off stuff and but once
you get past that you feel much better
let me tell you so my suggestion
challenge this week at least try do at
least a 12 hour fast see what happens
drink water and if you're healthy check
into that and depending on the response
we're going to try other challenges so
perhaps with you know me committing to
this with you and you committing with me
and the rest of us here maybe we'll be
like you know having training partners
if you will anyway see what happens bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
