vlog but i thought i would point it out
this is something i was reading today
about this huge rise and sextortion by
crime gangs using social media to entrap
victims in a nutshell what this comes
down to is you see people about the
gangs are going online and getting girls
or women to pretend to want to go out
with you but they never go out with you
and you can hook up with them you can
meet them rather through social networks
and dating sites and so on and what they
basically want to do is they want to
convince you to do something that you
would not want your mother to see yeah
so you can figure out what that might be
so and they want you to do that so that
they can take photos screen captures
video captures and then what the duels
will come back and then they will try to
extort you get you to pay up money or
they will take the images that they
captured in the video at the captured of
you doing things that you would not want
your mother to see and they would put
this left right and to put this on your
facebook and your twitter and so on so
this is something you should be aware of
and I'm putting it out there because I
know most of the audience are guys who
are in the target age range teens to 20s
20 year olds of course it can happen to
a bunch of older people and it's
typically men who are targeted rather
than women and it makes sense because
men are much more susceptible to this
type of thing because the way the trap
goes is that they meet you online and
they start having chats with you and
then say let's say let's have some fun
blah blah blah and where you go and they
take photos of you and you're done so
first of all if this has happened to you
my advice and as they say in the article
is to basically shut off all
communication reach out to police and
get ready if
some things about you are posted live on
Facebook it's going to be embarrassing
but they what are you gonna do six
months nobody's going to care and that's
it so just try to relax if that happens
to say sorry you know I got scammed and
any reasonable person who's a friend of
yours or family member if they're not
hypocrites they'll realize it could have
happened to them that being said so
let's talk about what you can do to
protect yourself against this first of
all you got to assume rule number one of
the internet rule number one of the web
of the interwebs as I like to say rule
number one is that you never assume that
you have any privacy so let me reverse
that assume about everything what you do
is publicly accessible even if you think
it's not even if you're on protected
counts and all this kind of stuff
accounts can be hacked passwords could
be breached photos can be released we've
seen this with Apple even we've seen
what Sony we've seen with everybody even
one of our old systems on killer sites
years ago God hacked fortunately we
don't keep any credit card information
or anything like that anyhow so back to
this whole sextortion thing so you have
to assume whenever you do anything on
the web whether it be written video
audio or images just assume that it can
be released to the public so if you move
with that assumption if you operate with
that assumption you should then never
put anything online but you wouldn't
want your mother to see if that's that's
the criteria or your mother or your
grandmother you don't want anything that
your mother or your grandmother you
wouldn't want them to see if you're
about to do something and you would be
embarrassed but your mother would see
this then don't do it that is my advice
to you if you do that simple rule you
keep yourself out of all kinds of
trouble now this is especially hard for
younger guys because you know our brain
is
two sections we have the higher-level
brain which is our cognitive our
thinking brain and below it we have this
much much much larger monkey brain the
lower brain the monkey brain is
extremely powerful in terms of
influencing our behavior in fact the
monkey brain influences ninety percent
of our decision-making so with that in
mind whenever you're about to make a
decision that is emotionally charged or
shall we say physically motivated I
would suggest to you strongly that you
take a step back count to ten no no
count to fifty before you make a move
that's being driven by your emotions or
by something else that's not
intellectual if you do that you keep
yourself out of a lot of trouble let me
give you an example let's say when you
go shopping for groceries if you're
hungry you're going to buy all kinds of
stupid food that you might not buy so
when I go shopping for food I try to
make sure but I've eaten already so that
I'm full so like when I pick in the
foods that are buying at the grocery
store i'm picking out food that makes
sense right so this plan of action about
buying your groceries when you're you
know when you're full this strategy can
be applied to all other aspects of your
life so keep that in mind make what you
will of it and so there you go so sex
store should be very careful don't be
doing things online that you wouldn't
want your mother to see and if you
follow that simple rule you probably
keep yourself out of a lot of trouble
always assume that whatever you do
online can be made publicly available
and the fact that matter is ninety-nine
percent of women will not be interested
in in anything lewd anything that you
know you wouldn't want your mother to
see again to go back to that again not
an a person a woman would not want to do
anything online anyway and so if you're
doing online dating take it from
somebody who's done it and somebody who
has had a dating site owned one I would
after a very short quick chat I would be
meeting meeting these women at a coffee
shop in a
public place there's lots of people
because you never know what you're going
to get until you meet them in person and
if they don't want to meet you in person
at a public place and safe a coffee shop
or something then you don't want to meet
them because obviously there's something
going on there so there you go don't get
caught in the sextortion don't reveal
anything that you wouldn't want your
mother to see that's my advice but I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
