learn about the
structured query language SQL
SQL is the language used to communicate
with MySQL database server actually SQL
is the universal language which used to
communicate with any SQL based server so
we're talking MySQL of course Microsoft
sequel server oracle and so on so once
you've learned SQL for mysql you have
learnt it at least the basics anyway for
many other similar relational databases
as I explained in a previous video the
SQL language is actually fairly easy to
learn it was designed this way because
they wanted to create a language for
non-programmers they wanted a language
that was easy to pick up so that
ordinary office people could use it to
do simple database operations that being
said if you get into some advanced stuff
it requires a little bit more
understanding of course but for our
purposes in terms of learning enough SQL
to be able to use it with PHP we won't
need to get into any of the esoteric the
more advanced SQL stuff especially the
beginning and I would even say that for
most of us in our PHP work you won't
have to touch on those advanced MySQL or
SQL commands and co if you will
to practice our SQL and to learn it
we're going to use PHP mind min again
and here I have it here and what we're
going to do is we're going to load up
the database that we created earlier so
i called it killer and we have one table
and we have the table people and if we
look at the table structure by clicking
on the instructor button here you see
that this is a fairly simple table since
we have only two fields name and ID so
essentially since the ID field as we
discussed in a previous video is a auto
increment feel which means that MySQL
server itself will actually be adding
numbers for us we know it's a number
because an inter this is a unique ID
that identifies records in the table
again something I discussed in a
previous video what we need to do is
just pay attention to really this name
field for a month for a lot of our
operations you'll see what I mean once
we get into it so we've checked out the
structure so we know we got the name
field here we go to browse and you can
see actually my school's firing off a
little query here well PHP my name is
anyhow so what we're going to do is
we're going to hit the SQL tab and in
the SQL tab we're going to be able to
type in some commands as we see here's a
command and we'll be able to take it
from there
SQL has four basic commands and here
they are you have insert select update
delete with these four basic commands
you'll be able to do a heck of a lot to
the MySQL database in terms of inserting
data into the database selecting data
from the database that's pulling it out
updating records that you already have
in the database and deleting records
from the database now some of these have
several of these commands have sub
options we're going to explore some of
them here but our main goal is just to
get enough SQL under our belts so that
we can move into using PHP to speak with
MySQL
to be clear when I say we're going to
use PHP to speak to MySQL PHP will
basically be used to fire off these
commands will be writing these SQL
commands inside of our PHP scripts so
that then PHP will be able to fire us
off to the SQL server or MySQL server
and we can get things done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
