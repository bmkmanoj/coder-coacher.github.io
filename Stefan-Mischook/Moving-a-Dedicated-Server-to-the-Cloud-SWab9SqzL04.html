Friday morning and I'm off to do two
things get my coffee I might get a bagel
but I can't come on a fast today good
too fast it's good for your health then
I got to go to the back and take care of
some biking and yeah we're supposed to
have the new video source site they
clean up I mentioned previously I should
be done next couple days we shall see we
shall see and big thing coming up next
week for me at least in mom for me for
the business we're going to be moving
off our last dedicated server next next
week or week at I think it's next week
actually at least are going to be
planning it we're going to be moving off
our last dedicated server I guess this
is we're going pure cloud now I have a
lot of stuff on a cloud now but we have
our last dedicated server box that's
going to be shut down and it would be
transferring over the sites and the app
well it's apps from that dedicate server
into the cloud for cloud-based hosting
which is pretty cool because then I will
won't have to worry about a single point
of failure meaning winning on it is a
physical dedicated servers you have to
worry about the heart hard drive might
fail or power supply by fail or your
board might burn etc excited cetera but
when you're on the cloud your
virtualized
you don't have to worry about that it's
all taken care of for you so it's cool I
found a cloud host provider that not
only provides the cloud services they
provide full Turkey maintenance and
upkeep of your servers automatic backup
the us attack patch of applications etc
et-cetera priority support you pay a
touch more and all setting you don't
need to have a linux expert working for
you or you don't have to become a Linux
expert yourself to manage your own your
virtual private server that's very very
cool excited about that rainy day today
I'm going to end this video with a shot
of the the foggy mountain here's a
little bit of advice for people out
there nerd advice now I'm a little older
and most of you guys in my 40s so I have
a little experience size of business and
the coding and the other things also the
datee and let me say I have my battle
scar see this white patch here that's
from 1x this white patchy that's from
another x2 girls whose names I will not
name but unusual individual we'll just
put it at that if you go out on a first
date with somebody or a second date and
the girl mentions her ex-boyfriend you
walking by restaurant rizal me and my ex
used to go there matches him by name
that is a major red flag and I will
suggest to you I would vacate the
premises nicely obviously she's got some
issues with the ex and from my
experience those issues will come
crashing in could be a week later it
could be much later they will so I would
flee the scene for you in those
circumstances all right dating tip from
a nerd do what you will</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
