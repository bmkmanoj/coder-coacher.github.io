miss chuck and in this video tutorial
we're going to create our own custom PHP
functions i'm assuming for this video
that you've done my previous videos on
functions where i cover some of the
basic concepts things like arguments and
returning values and so forth if you
haven't done those you should because it
will make understanding this video much
easier
I've divided this video into four basic
sections so what the idea of making it
easier for you to follow along the first
part we're actually going to jump right
in and create our very first custom
functions and learn about the function
keyword and the basic structure in terms
of code when building your own custom
function part 2 we're going to learn how
to return values from a function part 3
we're going to learn how to create a
function that can accept arguments and
then use those arguments within the
function and in part 4 we're going to
use conditional statements within a
function and hiss statement and learn
how we can return optional return values
based on a conditional again if any of
this seems unclear to you don't worry
once the video is finished you'll find
that it's actually quite easy
let's jump right
and create a very first custom function
once again i'm just going to use
dreamweaver because i assume most of you
are web designers so this is what most
web designers use although you can use
again you can use any text editor that
you wander if you just use milk pad so
functions always start off with the
keyword function this basically tells
PHP that we're creating a function and
we're going to call this function footer
and we put the curly bracket so here's
the basic structure of a function you
have the keyword function you have the
name of the function followed by your
brackets and then you have your set of
curly brackets it's a very this is
actually a pretty standard layout for so
many things in PHP so I think you're
probably getting familiar with it
essentially whatever code you put in
between these two curly brackets is your
function code
now that we have the basic structure to
function in place let's actually get the
function to do something so for the sake
of this video we're just going to do
something very very easy now hello world
is a old nerd first programming tricker
i don't know how you call it the first
thing that they teach programmers to do
when they're learning to program is how
to get the programming language to say
hello world so here we go we're saying
hello world so let's actually view that
page and see what happens so I've loaded
up the page in our browser and we hit
the refraction of course nothing happens
and nothing happened because we didn't
tell PHP to actually do anything well
yeah we did it we created a function but
we did not instruct PHP to actually use
a function you can think of as cold in a
function as code in reserve it's sort of
waiting there to be used so until you
explicitly tell PHP to use it the code
will not be processed that's what's
different right if I just said echo out
if I just excuse me road echo hello
world in the in the script without
outside the function PHP of course would
print it out right away but with
functions you have to basically tell PHP
to actually use the function so we cover
that in a previous video and we're just
going to use a function here so let's go
here and being lazy guy but i am i'll
just tell dreamweaver to create my code
block and what we're going to do we're
just going to call the function and
we've learned in a previous video to
call function means when you call means
to use a function all you have to do is
state the function name and that's it so
now let's we save this what's refresh
our page and hello world
years so that's pretty simple let's look
at one of the first advantages that you
have when you use functions because
right now doesn't seem like there's any
advantage so let's add tons of hello
worlds to our function and we'll save
that so you notice how much space all
this function code takes meanwhile our
call to the function is rather rather
simple it's just one line so it's again
we'll buta page we're going to see a
bunch of hello worlds so the first rule
that we learned about function first
advantage rather is that functions can
help you encapsulate a lot of code and
which will make your code in your pages
a lot cleaner encapsulate meaning that
the code all this code here is
encapsulated is wrapped up inside of the
function footer that we created so
typically when you're actually doing
your PHP code what you want to do for
real projects you probably want to stick
your your function all your function
code inside a separate file and then you
would call then you would include that
file and I'll show you how to do that
later inside your PHP pages that people
actually see this way your pages with
all your HTML and your CSS and so forth
is very clean free of all kinds of
excess PHP code think of it as in much
the same way as as you link to CSS files
external CSS files so that you can reuse
the same CSS code on many many different
pages that's one advantage of a function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
