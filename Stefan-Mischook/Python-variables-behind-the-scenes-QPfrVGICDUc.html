little bit of new details about
variables when you're declaring
variables declaring variables means
you're just creating variables I figured
I go to some detail about what's
actually going on behind the scenes when
you create a variable with Python so
let's jump into that right now talk
about variables so I got some pens I'm
doing this because it's just different
you know can't always do the same thing
so let's talk about an internal
variables you see that variables so
let's draw something there
this is RAM as in RAM random access
memory some random access memory is the
RAM that is included in every computer
you know you buy a computer has eight
gigs of RAM 16 gigs of RAM all your apps
and all programming languages when they
run they're constantly using Ram RAM is
very very important that's why if you
have more RAM and faster RAM your
computer will run faster so you have to
imagine that the RAM is made up of tiny
little little cubicles in here so let's
just draw that
okay now you know why I became a
software developer and not an artist so
dis imagine these are all little
cubicles kind of like kind of like an
ice-cream tray
listen ice cream kind of like an ice
cube tray so imagine this is rack this
is the dress and each of these slots is
a spot in memory Ravis random access
memories so from every each of these
spots is kind of like it's kind like a
spot in an ice-cream in an ice cube tray
where in each spot you can put
information in each spot sometimes
information can be text sometimes the
information can be numbers sometimes
information could be floats and there
are many other data types we've learned
about data types right so that's right
now when you create a variable for
instance
so we got a couple variables here we got
name and we know because we're nerds now
we know that name equals the fan you
know that stuff is string its data type
or instead out the type string there we
go
price another variable and you know that
it is of the data type float because
it's a number with a decimal in there
it's a floating point number so what's
going on when when you create a variable
what's actually going on behind the
scenes is that Python is storing this
information into a spot in RAM so Stefon
is being stored into this spot right
here and 26 point 50 is being stored
into this spot right here now we don't
know what spot in our random Python the
story information and we don't have to
know we don't have to care you see with
older programming languages like C and
C++ you would have to explicitly that
means you would have to deliberately you
would have to specify what spot
this information was held in it could
get very complicated there's a lot more
to it than that because each spot has a
coordinate index it has an index rather
it has an address I was actually they
call it an address so it was like a
spreadsheet you can go abc123
so the address of this memory space
there would be to see right number to
see so would be to see now in the old
days coders would have to remember okay
I put name the name variable inside a to
see and you have to track all that what
a pain with modern languages like Python
JavaScript Java C sharp and many others
Swift you don't have to do that you
create your variable and the programming
language will just stick the information
in a
around for you now you have to name your
variables you have to give them names
because that is like a label so putting
a sticker on the variable that's how
sorry putting a sticker rather on the
piece of information that's how Python
tracks is information you say give it
the variable name so at this time and
this time I called it name and it just
knows that this information it happens
to be Steph is in the slot here but we
refer to it via this label the name of
the variable saving with price price
like a sticker it's like the name
pricing it's a variable name price is
like a sticker but you stick on
something and that's how we reference
the information that Python sticks in
RAM and that's what basically ends
basically that's what basically what
python is doing behind the scenes when
it's creating a variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
