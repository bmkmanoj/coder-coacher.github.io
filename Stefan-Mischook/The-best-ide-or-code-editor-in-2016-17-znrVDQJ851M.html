this simple device instead of spending
1500 2000 dollars on a mic $99 all right
what is the best IDE integrated
development environment or code editor
that you can use you talk to 10
different nerds you're going to get 11
different answers so this is my opinion
if you are doing a software development
Java or PHP in terms of an IDE I would
go with phpstorm and that's simply
because I've heard from well my lead
developer uses phpstorm he loves it but
also I'm biased because phpstorm is
created by JetBrains and they're not
paying me at all but I'm a big fan of
JetBrains because they really
revolutionize IDE s with their java ide
which all of a sudden the name of the
Java IDE popped right out of my head but
you can just type in JetBrains Java IDE
and that's called IntelliJ there we go
it's IntelliJ amazing tool especially
beginning to refactoring and stuff like
that there were they were ahead of the
game ten years ago or so and apparently
they still are if you don't want to get
into a full-fledged IDE with all the
power that they provide which I
recommend then you can get into a code
editor like sublime text which is really
really cool because it's very
customizable with with shortcuts and all
kinds of things you can do with it it's
very very powerful code editor in terms
of whatever type of code you're writing
whether it be PHP HTML Javascript
whatever you want I sublime text can
support it although if you're again like
I said I would go with phpstorm for PHP
if I was doing some full-fledged PHP
development and I would use the IntelliJ
for javo'''s doing that of course if
you're doing Swift programming I code
yeah if you're doing Swift programming
for iOS there we go then you're just
going to have to use Apple's ID
of course that's what you want to use
there beyond that if you were learning
to code for the first time learning web
stuff html5 css3 javascript PHP SQL
using my courses or any courses then I
would either recommend sublime text or
you could go with maybe Adobe brackets
which is kind of cool although you know
whatever code editor that you use but
those two are kind of cool they can kind
of look sleek and that's my
recommendations of all notepad plus plus
and a whole bunch of other ones out
there are pretty cool as well
but this is my quick choice again this
is going with my quick SuperDuper fast v
vlog style to make it easy for people to
find stuff ciao bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
