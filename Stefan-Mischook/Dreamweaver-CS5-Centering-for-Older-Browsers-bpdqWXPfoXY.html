selector it's a couple of things we need
to do well in creating a very simple
layout like the one I'm describing a
simple two column layout you'll notice
in most popular websites for example if
I you know just go to a browser and
here's the apple store and you can see
that what's going on in here is the
simple fact that this particular browser
is showcasing a 1024 design well there
are many different ways of creating
websites some of them are what we refer
to as fixed pixel some of them are what
we refer to as a liquid based design
well this fixed pixel based design here
is set to be a specific width and this
width will automatically fit as you can
see here inside of a 1024 screen
resolution my screen is set to 1024
resolution you more than likely have a
much larger screen resolution than I do
and if that's the case what are you
going to be seeing well let's take a
look I'm going to go to my preferences
and it's the only time i'm going to
change the display here and let's see if
this actually will work if i were to set
it to a much higher screen resolution
see right now i'm at 1024 because of the
taping purposes here and if i were to
set it to something larger like this one
now it's only going to be temporary
we're going to come back to this in just
a second so let's take a look as you can
see I've got much more real estate on my
screen and what it's showing me now is
if i make my browser window full screen
as you can see here well what happens is
the website is fixed right in the middle
of the page and when i move the size of
the browser what happens to it it always
remains in the center of that browser
notice that anything the extra space
that you have here is just being
displayed by the body color on Apple's
clean website which generally wants to
showcase you know very clean design
they've got it all in white but you've
probably seen websites that look like
this that have like you know other
background colors or
background images going on here things
that will explore a little bit later on
in other videos as well so this is
showing you what we're trying to achieve
and as you can see regardless of the
size of the browser the website which is
fixed pixel right it's almost always a
certain amount and never stretches
larger than what it is right now that
fixed pixel design always remains in the
center regardless of the size of the
browser so that's what we're attempting
to do so I'm going to go back to my
system preferences we're going to set
this back to 1024 and now hopefully this
will show up quite nicely and as you can
see here I'm going to have to make this
maximum again and notice well when
you've got that happening it fits
perfectly in a 1024 scenario so that's
exactly what we're attempting to do in
our own designs here so what we can see
in this very simple design is that we're
going to need something to always be in
the center of our work so what I'm going
to show you now is kind of an older
antiquated way of doing this it's
something that is specifically related
to older versions of internet explorer
IE six for example we and the method
we're going to be using a little later
on to Center our website is only going
to work in more modern browsers so this
is specifically for an older browser but
I do have to admit at this point in time
there's probably only like seven percent
of people that this really will be
affecting so don't worry about it if you
don't add it in and especially in a year
from now or so this might not be as big
of a deal so I'm just going to come in
and we're going to start by setting the
tag for the body and what are we going
to do nothing else except actually let
me cancel that what did I do check it
out look in my head section of my
document I actually added something
internally that's terrible why did that
happen well let's make sure here's my
cursor in my design view if I come in
here and I say tag to redefine the body
fine but look it says this document only
know dreamweaver style dot CSS that's
the x
ternal style sheet i created good so now
i'm going to go to block and we're just
going to set the text align the center
why because everything now on my page is
going to be center align as you can see
if i were to type out some texts or
something like this and refresh it it
would be Center aligned if I just
preview this in the browser and we can
take a look real quick aha there is my
Center aligned object always in the
center of my texts okay so i'm just
going to quick that quickly and let me
get this back to my full screen here
i'll just say maximum so now you can see
it's fitting into the area always
centered okay let's get rid of that so
that's going to Center all the content
on our page including the website but
you might be thinking hey I don't want
my text to be centered that's kind of
gross don't worry when we come back
we're going to take care of that as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
