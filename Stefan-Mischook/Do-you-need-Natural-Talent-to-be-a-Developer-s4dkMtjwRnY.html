here
and yeah so let's blog about this I am
answering questions now and next bunch
of blogs questions that are put to be by
the people on the youtubes alright do
you need to be naturally talented to be
a good developer short answer is no you
just need to be somebody who's patient
somebody who's dedicated and somebody
he's willing to put in the time that's
all what you have to do though is you
have to figure out where your strength
lies everybody's different some people
may be really good at front-end code
some people be more inclined to back-end
code some people might be better with
infrastructure some people may be good
at designing really efficient algorithms
you gotta figure that out how do you
figure that out you do your fundamentals
you do your fundamentals so you're
exposed to all these different things on
a fundamental level and then from there
as you experiment with smaller mini
projects and you eventually do one or
two decent-sized projects you're gonna
start knowing yourself you're gonna
start figuring out where you shine and
that's what you should do I learnt this
from my boxing days and from my martial
art days play to your strengths when I
was a boxer I was a bunch better boxer
puncher type I guess hang out on the
outside for a lot of jobs move boom boom
boom that kind of thing inside fighting
not too good Steph wasn't too good on
inside fighting but when I was on the
outside my skill level was far far
higher so I was always taking a game to
the outside I wanted a guy to play the
long game with me I didn't want the guy
to play the ropes put me on the ropes
get me on the ropes
I can handle myself nothing wrong but I
was much better on the outside so on the
ropes I was like a level six on ten in
terms of my scale on the outside with
the jabbing game and when I was doing
the boxing I suppose the infighting my
level went up to eight or more so same
thing with Cody you have to figure out
our development I should say you
have to figure out where your Shaiful
eyes you may be this type of person was
good at UI and UX user interface and
user experience design good UI guys and
girls and good UX people hard to find
very hard to find so if you're good at
that concentrate on that and then you
would steer your learning in that
direction that means more html5 more
css3
maybe react jeaious or what-have-you
depending on the type of project that
comes up but again play to your
strengths on the other hand you may be
really good at architecture where you
sort of structure the code and so on and
you set it up so that the other
developers can come in and fill in those
blanks that you create this nice
framework think of like a skeleton that
you create so what the app can be built
out and filled in nicely very important
better architecture very bad for
software in the medium and long term so
figure out where your strong go in that
direction so in terms of talent figure
out what your talent is you don't need
to be a genius algorithm writer to be a
fantastic web developer who may be great
at UI and UX I find that people are
usually good algorithms or terrible UX
and vice versa
you get the idea I hope that helps ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
