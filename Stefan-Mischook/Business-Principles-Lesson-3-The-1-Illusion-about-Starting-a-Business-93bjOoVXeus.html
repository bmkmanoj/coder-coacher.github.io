here
here's a underlying principle or reality
of business that you have to really
grasp and internalize and if you
understand this it forms the basis of
your entire business strategy so it's
very important and this is how I
summarized it if you're a hundred
percent sure that your product is gonna
sell really well you probably have a 10%
chance ten percent if you're lucky
that's the reality of situation a lot of
people are sold this illusion about how
building of businesses and the illusion
is that you come out with the brilliant
idea and then you go to market with it
you produce you go to market be piece of
software it could be a type of
restaurant who knows whatever the
product is so you come up with a
brilliant idea and you go to market and
it sells like crazy this is the illusion
that people have it doesn't work that
way it's not even close to being that
the reality about building a product and
a business it's about grinding it's
about iterations iterations mean going
back and revamping revamping and
changing revamping and changing and
revamping and changing and it's about
being responsive to your audience in the
world so you put out your product you
see how people react and you make
changes accordingly this is where the
judgment call comes in you have to be
able to make that judgment call when if
the product is actually viable and
that's a difficult thing what I
typically do is respond to the initial
reaction from clients and how difficult
it is to get clients in the first place
and getting clients means clients are
actually willing to pay so that is a
huge part of it and that's a judgment
call and yeah that's a judgement call
so what this all means
during the business strategy is that you
have to work to get your product get
your service out as quickly as possible
as cheaply as possible so that you can
gauge your potential clients reaction to
your product the big mistake is to spend
too much time and money trying to
perfect something before you actually
release it to the public and then you
find out it's a total flop it has no
chance of success happens a lot happens
a lot so this is core to my business
course which has no name yet I haven't
figured out what the name is going to be
in but the core principle is that you
have to realize that most of the
projects you're going to put out that
most of the business ideas that you put
out there and not going to be a viable
and then when you do find the one that's
viable it's gonna be far from perfect
when it starts you're gonna have to
spend a lot more time and effort
refining it based on user reaction and
I'm going to get into that in a deep way
with my course on business this is
something I don't think I don't know I
don't know if you've heard it anywhere
house perhaps you haven't I don't know
everything that I talk about whether it
be coding whether it be business well
especially business
there's derived from my own personal
experiences I've been in business for 28
years going on 29 years so I have a
pretty good idea about how things work
anyway that's it for now bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
