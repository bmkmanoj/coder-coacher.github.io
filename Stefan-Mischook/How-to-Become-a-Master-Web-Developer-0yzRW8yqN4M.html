master web developer so you may or may
not know I've been developing websites
and apps since 1994 and I've worked with
many different languages over the years
on many different types of projects so
what has my over 20 years experience
have taught me
Tway the way to become a master web
developer is to number one sit to one
language and master that language that's
a very important point instead of
jumping around learning a little bit of
Ruby a little bit of Python a little bit
of this a little bit of that what you
want to do is you want to pick a
particular technology whichever ones you
prefer and then really understand it
well and start building projects with it
so if you were to pick PHP for example
then learn your basics learn your
object-oriented programming in PHP and
then pick a PHP framework these days
recording this in 2016 Larry Bell is the
most prominent import and important one
but really any MVC framework that's up
to date is a good choice next thing you
want to do is you want to get deeper
into the logic of programming and into
the nuts and bolts of the language so
learn how to use your particular
language in an advanced way so for
instance with PHP you might want to get
into anonymous inner functions get into
recursion not only knowing what these
are and how to do it but knowing when
you'd want to use these patterns of
coding if you will and as I mentioned
just a few moments ago a big thing is to
build real projects you learn much more
by actually building real things rather
than just doing a bunch of tutorials so
dive deep into real projects continue to
spend some time on the side looking and
exploring at more advanced ways to
approach coding and stick to it until
you become really advanced because the
danger is to start spreading your
self too thin and starting to learn
three four or five different frameworks
or languages at the same time it's very
tempting I've been there I've done it in
the past and it just slows down your
progress to becoming a master developer
web developer or otherwise and I first
learned this principle by the way when I
was a martial artist and it was a point
when I was like maybe 16 or 17 and I was
doing three or four styles at the same
time above three and it got to the point
when I was like 17 years old I was
intermediate level and about seven
styles crazily crazy enough now I've
been doing martial arts in some intense
so and one day one of my coaches one of
the teacher said to me Steph you know
you've been doing martial arts for a
long time now but you're not an expert
at martial arts yet you know a lot of
different things but you're not really
at that expert level so you said to
become the expert you have to pick a
style and learn it really well and he
says when you do get to that expert
level your ability to interpret all the
other styles will become expert level
and so I took his advice and that's what
I did and sure enough when I really
honed my craft in one style my wrestling
got much better my boxing got much
better my catcher Campbell got much
better and so on and so forth same thing
with programming by the way caught in
same loop where I would do a little bit
of this a little bit of a dot of that
and you're going to have to mix it up
when you're programming you always go to
you know especially in web development
you're typically going to be using at
least four languages HTML CSS JavaScript
for sure those are three you for sure
you're going to use and then after that
for server-side programming you might be
doing PHP you might be doing Ruby may be
doing Python you might be doing Java
there's other options as well if you
don't know what server-side programming
is you should do my beginner's HTML
course I teach all that and of course a
lot more so there you go if you want to
master programming is what you want to
do stick to one language really get a
good understanding of it
pick a framework that goes with that
language master it and
build projects off of that and you'll
see that you'll learn to become a much
better and more productive programmer by
doing that as opposed to learning a bit
of this one week and learning a bit of
that when we can learning a bit of this
one week so there you go
I saved you a lot of headaches well I
will save you a lot of headaches if you
take this advice thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
