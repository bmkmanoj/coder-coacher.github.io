and other sites so why did I stop or
shut down my web development studio now
this is going back a long time it's
going back to the 90s well late 90s
early 2000 actually excuse me later Lee
2000s late 90s so I had a web
development studio and we're doing a lot
of web apps and so on and it was a small
team at its big as maybe six or seven
people or the lead working under me and
after a few years of doing this I
decided to shut it down as far as having
people work for me in web development to
to sell you know so in terms of building
other people's systems and the number
one reason I shut it down well there's
two reasons number one when you become a
manager of people when you're you become
successful as a web developer has an
independent which it will happen you
know if you keep developing your skills
you keep improving on what you do what
will happens you'll find is you get more
and more and more clients and then uh
soon you're gonna have more work than
you can handle
so there's a couple of ways to deal with
that number one you could start
implementing more frameworks like
bringing jQuery and really know how to
use a property heavier an MVC framework
like within the PHP world that would be
today I think the best choice would
probably be lair eval or if you're in a
ruby camp you would use rails and you
become really good with these frameworks
and other frameworks of course bootstrap
yada yada yada and then you take these
and then you can put together projects
much more quickly another way you can
handle this is you can start bringing in
help you can start hiring other
developers whose skill sets complement
yours so if you're strong with coding
then you might want to bring in a
front-end guy or if you're more of a
front-end guy you want to hire him so
maybe some guys who do the backend you
know the server-side coding the PHP to
Ruby to Java whatever
anyway so you have those two options now
what happens though if you go
the second option where you higher in
people and ultimately if you become
really successful this you will have to
do what you're going to see is a you're
going to become detached from the
process of writing code for instance
because you just won't have time you're
going to be too busy dealing with
clients too busy managing the team and
managing the projects from afar you
won't be you'll be losing touch with the
code and that was one of the big reasons
why I shut it down because I was
becoming too detached from the code and
I didn't want to be at that point in
time I didn't want to lose touch with
the code I really love to code back in
those days that's for sure
now that I don't like it now but back
then back then it was like a DOS totally
obsessed with code and building projects
you know I was one of those guys on
Friday nights my friends will go out you
know drinking a playing pool I mean oh
no I'm working on a dating app here it's
like I have so much fun building apps
anyway so that's the so if you bring in
a talent you bring in people working for
you you're gonna get detached from code
from the process and it becomes you have
a whole new role you have a whole new
job so keep that in mind you may love
that you may not like that but that's
the reality of a situation another thing
that happens with your discovers but it
takes many people working for you to
equal the salary you would make or the
money would make as an independent
contractor working on your own my
calculations back in a day it takes
about ten takes about ten people working
for you full-time before you you know
you can earn enough from their work to
be able to make the same money that you
would be making if you worked on your
own keep that in mind as well so there's
this there will be this lag period
between you start hiring a few people
and you're going to see your the money
that you put in your pocket is gonna
drop because you've got all these other
costs associated with having several
people working for you management cost
and accounting costs and it just this
general overhead I find when you have
more than three people on a
project the productivity of the
individual person individual people
rather working on the project drops
quite a bit not that they're not doing
good work it's just that you've got this
overhead of coordinating the activities
of four or more people so keep that in
mind I find the optimum group size for
working on projects is about three
people working on a particular project
well no one jumping around anyway
so what happens you're gonna need about
ten people working for you full-time
before you make the same money as you
would working as in your own independent
and what excuse me you have to have 10
people working for you for you to make
the same money as you would if you were
working on your own but again and what
the frameworks were you start using
frameworks that maximize your practice
your productivity which I did a lot of
that now you can make really good money
that way when you get into that the
problem with that it's limited there's
always so much you can do so keep that
in mind
so I got I decide to stop the original
studio web by the way was a web
development firm Studio web and I
registered that domain in 1998 because
the ice it was called believe it ah I
design before in in the mid-90s and then
I said I'll call studio web should have
kept the ISIS find domain right you know
anyway so that's it
so I just got I want to be more into
code again so I shut that down and also
I didn't you know I was at that period I
was at that plumbers like five or six
guys maybe yeah five or six guys we said
that was some points working for me I
forget the exact number and I was still
making less that I would have made when
I was just going on my own so that's
just something to consider if you're in
the freelance web development business
right now and you're thinking about
bringing in staff another thing you can
do is maybe partner other guys where you
have them you outsource to people you
know and trust
parts of the project
so you still keep your hands dirty in
code that you love if you like the code
you like the design and so forth but you
out stars little bits that you don't
want to do necessarily this is a
compromise if you will and I can tell
you if you do that right you can make
very good money much more than you think
my peak in the 90s I was doing I was
building out about 200 the hour that's
what I was making at for of my time I
have spoken to people I thought I was
doing pretty good I spoken
I know people who were doing 300 the
hour now it's not what they said to the
clown pain I'm charging 300 the hour but
they say okay hour rate my rates 75 and
but because of the they had their own
frameworks that's what I did I had my
own framework and this is what I was in
my java days I have no Java based
framework was a POJO based MVC system
but I had put together this this is back
in the day when MVC frameworks they were
out there but I didn't like what was out
there so I just removed my own I
wouldn't do that today today if I wasn't
PHP I would use lair eval or if I was in
Ruby I would use rails for instance or
today in JavaScript you look at node.js
I'd be a good choice I think anyway by
using your framework you could be very
very productive and so you know you know
you say yeah I'll do this job and I'll
charge you five grand and you calculate
your hours and you say I'm charging 75
bucks the hour and you actually I'm
making 200 is that ripping off no
because they're gonna compare your bid
with other people's bits as long as you
deliver the work it's good and you're
competitive of everybody else that you
know as far as I'm concerned it doesn't
matter how much time you take you know
in that time you've invested in your
framework or learning this framework or
putting together a workflow the tighly
efficient that's worth money that's just
like the time and author puts in their
book and they make residuals off that
book it's not it's not nothing wrong
with that so if you invest in your skill
sets you invest in your own framework or
some other framework you should use
other frameworks by the way I'm not
somebody I hadn't
these days you don't need to build your
own framework just to be clear when you
invest your time and effort into that
there's residuals from that you're
heightened productivity and anyway
that's pretty much it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
