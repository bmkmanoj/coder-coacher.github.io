put up some of my JavaScript course
videos so I decided to do this
so here is chapter one which is about 30
to 40 minutes of my beginner's
JavaScript course created just in 2015
beginning of 2016 so they're very much
up to date and even if you're watching
this years from now they will be very
very good to watch still because
JavaScript on the basic level on the
beginners level is pretty stable I
assume from this course that you've done
new programming before so I take my time
to cover some of the basic concepts very
slowly step by step so if you've had
trouble with other courses before I'm
pretty sure you'll be okay with my
course because I'm moving these videos
on YouTube you have none of the
interactivity unfortunately that you get
with my training apps to do web but
nonetheless there's still a lot to learn
so have fun enjoy the material be sure
to take notes as you go along you're
going to see little pop-up milk takers
appear in white in the videos those are
little signals to you to take notes take
notes because it's just going to help
you to learn the stuff that much more
quickly enjoy the videos bye hi and
welcome to beginners JavaScript my name
is Steph javascript is the most popular
programming language in the world today
and that's probably because JavaScript
is built into every single web browser
that's out there so that includes Chrome
Firefox Safari Internet Explorer
everyone you can also find JavaScript on
every type of computer windows computers
Mac computers Linux computers you can
find it on iOS devices that's iPads and
iPhones you can find it on Android
devices as well
javascript is everywhere so it's a very
important language to learn especially
if you want to get into web design and
web app creation every single modern
website these days uses JavaScript and
definitely every single web app
use a JavaScript now when I said that
JavaScript is built into every browser
that means that there is a JavaScript
app the JavaScript app is there to
process the JavaScript code that you
write so you need that app there to
process the code and to execute the
commands if you remember from your basic
web design training every computer
language it's just a set of instructions
that the computer's execute that the
computers follow so of HTML and CSS well
of HTML for instance that language is
designed to tell web browsers what to
put in a web page Java Script on the
other hand is a true programming
language and what that means that is
that JavaScript code can be used to tell
web browsers how to do things in a page
it allows you to give your web pages and
your web sites decision-making
capabilities it can be easy decisions
like checking to see if somebody put in
an email address properly in a form to
very advanced programming where you can
set up a whole game with JavaScript
right inside a web browser
to learn JavaScript you should know
basic web design so that means HTML CSS
you should know basic concepts like what
a server is domain names hosting that
kind of stuff if you got that you're
ready to learn JavaScript one of the
great things about learning JavaScript
is that it's part of a large family of
languages so when you learn a concept or
a technique in JavaScript you will be
learning that same concept in many
different languages so for example in
JavaScript you have something called a
variable I won't get into what it is now
we'll learn about it in the in the main
course but you also have variables in
the Ruby language in Python in PHP in
Java Java and JavaScript are two
different languages by the way so the
point is is that what you learn in this
beginners JavaScript course a lot of
stuff that you learn is going to be very
helpful in terms of all in terms of you
learning all these other languages so
you're gonna be an old expression you're
going to be killing many birds with one
stone and yeah because in the old days
used to throw stones at birds and kill
them so if you're able to kill two birds
one one toss that you're stolen many oh
you get the idea
to work with JavaScript all you need is
a good web browser I'm going to be using
Google's Chrome I think that's the best
one today and of course you're free to
use any web browser because as I said
all the web browsers have the JavaScript
engine built into it and you can use
whatever code editor that you like I'm
going to be using sublime text because
it's very popular these days with the
Nerds it's a pretty good code editor and
because I'm gonna be doing my demos on
Windows and some of my demos on Mac
sublime text is available on both of
these types of computers again use
whatever code editor that you're you are
comfortable with it's better that it
supports JavaScript and when a code
editor supports JavaScript that means is
that it can read and understand
JavaScript so it can do those things
like code completion and cold coloring
these things that are helpful to to
coding and that's pretty much it
welcome to the course and will give you
my my little learning tips take your
time especially when you're learning to
program for a first time it could be a
little frustrating so you may not get
something on Monday but by Tuesday or
Wednesday the ideas the concepts will
sink in you'll slowly get it step by
step if I'm speaking too quickly in a
video or too slowly you can adjust the
playback speed to suit whatever is
better for you and finally I would
suggest that you take out a pen and
paper or whatever and write notes
because writing notes is going to help
you to remember you may not need to
review the notes later but just the fact
that you write them down the first time
is going to help you to remember and
it's it's pretty useful so that's pretty
much it we'll talk soon
so in this video we're gonna look at
some code so I created a folder on my
desktop called JavaScript and pre
original name there and what we want to
do is look at chapter 1 lesson 4 and
I've written a bunch of code for you
there just to make your lives easier
well I'll make my life easier so here we
go
chapter 4 chapter 1 lesson 4 excuse me
so we've used the html5 doctype so we're
using the latest and greatest version of
HTML and you see I have an HTML common
excuse me an HTML comment so for no
particular reason well there's a reason
for it
javascript is simply called je s by
turner's je s is short for JavaScript I
want you to see what comments are of a
reminding of comments because we're
gonna learn about gee how the script
comments in this video so let's scroll
down you see we got a style block style
opening closing we've seen this before
now I put this optional type text equals
CSS reason for that so looks look down
here you see I have a JavaScript block
now the JavaScript is very similar says
well first of all this is a bunch of
JavaScript in here we'll ignore that for
now let me just cut that out you see
this is the opening JavaScript block
closing JavaScript block just like CSS
opening style closing style now the
old-school JavaScript you can script
type equals text Joseph just like the
script style type equals text the excess
CSS now just like what's CSS with
JavaScript you don't have to put this in
anymore
you can because it's known today that if
you're going to put in a scripting into
your pages it's going to be JavaScript
now scripting it's just another word
another way of saying programming there
is a little bit of a difference between
a scripting language and a programming
language it's not that important really
these days
so this understand script is programming
so you're writing JavaScript you're
writing jet you know you're ringing a
just with language now remember let me
just put this back in Java and
JavaScript when we write this down
Java is not equal to you have a script
now you see this here I'm teaching a
little bit programming sneaking it in
right now
so when you have the the exclamation
point the Nerds will call that the bang
operator as in dying anyway so why
operator because it operates on like a
like a surgeon operates on a patient so
anyway so you got this exclamation point
the bang operator and equal and this
basically means not equal to right so
this is saying Java is not equal to
JavaScript so that means that Java is
not JavaScript there in fact two
separate programming languages try to
keep that in mind
okay so I've opened up chapter 1 lesson
5 and this will basically take us from
where we left off in the previous video
first thing I want to talk about
something I should have mentioned before
is that web pages as you know they they
process their process from the top down
so that means that this code will get
processed well this is a comment this
code will get processed before this code
and so on and the same thing applies for
JavaScript if you go down here and you
see we've got our script block this is
some JavaScript this is some JavaScript
code this code will get processed before
this code and that will be something you
have to consider when you're writing
your JavaScript code later because
sometimes you have to be sure that you
have certain code in place before other
code will work yadda yadda yadda it gets
a little complex but anyway just keep in
mind that the page loads from the top
down it's an important thing to know now
JavaScript can be inserted into the page
a few ways you can put it in the head of
your document as we've done here you can
also put it in the body you've noticed I
put some JavaScript down here you see
here I got the double slash that is a
javascript comment and so we've
commented out this particular piece of
JavaScript code now in JavaScript if you
want to comment out one line you use
double slash now this looks like it's on
two lines with that just because we're
doing word prep see it's actually one
line of code here so I just wanted to
point that out if you want to do
multi-line comments in JavaScript you do
slash star and you end it with star
slash and this is a multi-line
JavaScript comment now it's all in blue
now because the code editor here is is
showing us that this is commented out
now if I do this this will be
uncommented and now we see this
JavaScript code here but before this
gets processed of course all this
JavaScript code will get processed
beforehand keep that in mind when you're
when you're writing a code sometimes
you'll get bugs and you'll be wondering
why something's not working that's
because sometimes is because the order
of your code will play a role in this
okay let's actually run some JavaScript
code since we got a bit of it in here so
I got some code down here this is a
little bit complex so I'm going to just
comment this out for now and we'll get
back to this later but oh yeah there's
another way to add JavaScript code you
can add it like this kind of like when
you add your CSS external stylesheets
you do a JavaScript like this you have a
script and you get the closing script
and you just can use the SRC attribute
which is short for source and you can
point to an external jsy ojs means dot
javascript so you can put all your
scripts in here if you wanted to well in
an external sheet I haven't done it here
because in this example because you know
I just want to show you quickly how to
learn how to write JavaScript so I'm
taking it easy right now but keep in
mind that this is another way is one of
the three ways that you can add
JavaScript to your pages if you're doing
a lot of professional work we got really
big scripts lots of JavaScript that
you're writing you definitely want to be
putting it into an external javascript
file like this but for our simple
examples I'm just going to keep the
JavaScript right in the page as we've
done
okay let's look at our very first bit of
Java code so I scroll down here to our
script block and you notice here I get
the two slashes and some text now this
is a JavaScript comment as I said in a
previous video when you have two slashes
that's a JavaScript comment it's a
single line comment meaning that the
comment will work on one line now if you
want to comment out many lines what you
do is you go slash star and then you
close it with star slash so now these
are all commented out and what that
means is that the browser will ignore
this code now we've seen this before so
let me just go back and comment this
line here there we go and you can see
that the text is turning blue
when it's commented out so here we go
some Java code right here now this is
something called alert alert is
something that is built into JavaScript
built right into the JavaScript language
and of course the JavaScript app now
alert is an example of something called
a function now if you look here I've
written it out for you alert is a
function function is short for
functionality so you can think of
functions as being little chunks of code
that are kind of like mini apps inside
of the JavaScript app and these mini
apps provide some sort of functionality
they do something for you so alert is
actually one of the very first functions
that I've ever used and what it does it
creates a little popup box let me show
you what it does so we're gonna refresh
the page and there it is javascript
alert now the box is empty kind of
useless but we're gonna fix that now so
you know this is a function because well
now you know what alert it is you see
this this is like one of these special
keywords in the JavaScript language
you remember keyword encoding is a word
that has special meaning in the
particular coding language so in the
case of JavaScript alert has a very
special meaning and the JavaScript
engine
banging language knows what it is of
course and as I said JavaScript is a
function because it does something it
provides functionality now you as a nerd
a new nerd programmer can identify can
see what code is a function by well
first of all you'll know that alert is a
function because you know it now but
also you can tell by these two little
round brackets if you got a word
followed by these two little round
brackets that's a function so let's add
a little bit to this function
now alert can do more than just pop up a
box you can actually send message so
I'll say send others right to send
message well send message display a
message so I'll change that to display
not really not it's not really singing
it's displaying it display message so
now it's refresh display message right
so that's what alert does now this runs
because this alert box runs because
JavaScript starts reading excuse me the
web browser starts reading from the top
and it works its way down and when it
reaches this code it displays it now you
notice that the end of our function the
alert function we have this little
semicolon here just like CSS this is the
end of this function so let me show you
what I mean so I put another one in
displaymessage - now let me refresh
display message display a message - so
you see how we fart off two functions
right basically sending the web browser
to commands now watch web site take off
this semicolon here we're gonna get an
error because this semicolon scuse me
tells JavaScript this is the end of this
function is the beginning is the this is
start of this function so we need that
separator between our function calls you
see when you use a function like this
nerds will say you're calling a function
it's kind of like you're calling up your
buddy yeah so watch what happens I save
that see nothing happens it's broken
you know the reason it's broken because
JavaScript JavaScript had a problem with
a
because we didn't put the semicolon here
now we didn't see anything because we
didn't tell JavaScript to display an
error we can do that if you go into your
web browser you right-click you go view
no no no no inspect element that's one
way to do it and you see here that's one
error uncaught syntax error and an
unexpected identifier so this is
JavaScript telling those fact okay we
did have an error so this is where the
development tools in the developer tools
in our web browsers can help us out
especially when we are working with our
JavaScript trying to figure out what's
going on I can solve that problem by
putting a semicolon back in reload the
page you see the error doesn't appear
and our JavaScript alerts appear as we
learn more about javascript we're going
to work more with the developer tools
here so that we can look at our errors
and check them out you have to
understand civ and when you are writing
code especially when you're starting to
get into programming like JavaScript
there's always error so gonna happen so
it's very important but you start
understanding error codes and you start
understanding what the errors are
telling you but we'll get into that
all right I've opened up chapter 1
lesson 7 and yeah so here we go we've
seen this before we got our two alerts
and we separated our alerts with the
semicolon so JavaScript knew this was
the end of this function this is the
next function so I'm gonna get rid of
this because it's annoying to have two
alerts I'll show you another built-in
function into JavaScript something
called prompt and you see the very
similar format well exactly the same one
that exactly assumed so you got alert
and you got the two round brackets and
the message that the alert box will
display and then we end this function
and call this is a function call and I
say it's a function call because we're
calling this function we're saying two
jobs but please use this alert function
here's a new functions called prompt and
very similar you got are opening and
closing brackets and here is the
information that we're sending to the
prompt function so this little section
of information and we're sending it was
so awful eart we sent this information
we totally just you know display this
text here which says display message now
when you're sending messages or
information to a function like this this
is called sending arguments it's like
making an argument for your position you
know when you get into arguments
somebody you're trying to explain
something to them they don't fast ovis
so this is in programming lingo
programming talk nerd talk they're
saying we're sending an argument to our
function or they'll just say the nerves
will just say this is the arguments for
of a function now some functions will
require that you had arguments some
won't some will have one argument like
this some other functions like prompt
will have multiple arguments argument
number one and you see the the comma
here that separates the arguments and
this is argument number two now
sometimes the arguments will be text
like this sometimes will be other things
so for now just understand that in
between these two brackets you got your
arguments any arguments send the
function extra information in the case
of alert it tells the alert box what to
display and in prompt it tells the
prompt box which we're going to see in
about two seconds not only what to
display but there's two places where
displays things so well we'll just take
a look and we'll see how it works let's
refresh so we got our alert right
display message okay now here's our
prompt box another prompt box it's kind
of like an alert except allows you to
enter a box where somebody can enter in
information and you can take that
information too maybe this could be like
an automatic sign up form where you say
hey please enter your your user name
something like that and yeah you see now
this text here please enter your name
this corresponds to this here and then
you see the second text your name here
it is your name and that corresponds to
to this argument here so I'm just gonna
go okay now there's a lot you can do so
let me just say we just enter name like
this so you can see the difference
Refresh display message and now it's
just name so there we go we've learned a
little bit more about functions you
learned about arguments right where you
can send the function instructions in
terms of what to do and different
functions will have different types of
arguments that you can send and you're
going to learn the functions one of the
things you can do with your knowledge of
functions is actually build your own
functions and why would you want to
build your own functions because
functions allow you to put all kinds of
code all kinds of JavaScript code into a
nice package that package is the
function so that you can use this
function over and over and over again
it's very powerful and in the next video
I'm going to show you how to do some
basic functions
the right word in chapter 1 lesson 8 so
what we're gonna do here is we're going
to learn a couple things first we're
gonna create our very own function and
you do that using the function keyword
now when JavaScript sees the word
function it knows you're creating
function so then we're gonna go function
we're gonna give it a name I'm just
gonna call it call it right and there's
our basic function what doesn't make
some space here and yeah so next thing
we need is we need the two curly
brackets and what's you know I call
curly because it's got a little pointy
brackets there and they're kind of like
curls so a function starts with the
keyword function this is when we're
creating our own function then we give
it a name and call whatever name we want
you know I just choose to I just decide
to call call it now I when you creating
functions in JavaScript the convention
the way you're supposed to do it you
start with lowercase and then in between
words you use a capital so if your
function was called my function you see
how that is lowercase and uppercase F it
just makes it easier to read as well let
me just go back to call it for whatever
reasons and then of course I got my
little curly braces excuse me my round
braces and in here I can do all kinds of
stuff but for now I'll just leave it
like this so here is a basic function
keyword function tells JavaScript we're
creating a function and then I say call
it so what we're gonna do here now
because I'm gonna take these two other
functions and I'm going to stick it into
our custom function so what's cool is
that you've just learned that you can
put functions inside of functions
besides a whole bunch of other things so
now we have the function let's reload
the page and you notice this time our
alert and our prompt did not load
automatically right because what happens
when you put code inside of a function
that code will not activate until you
actually call this function until you
activate the function itself this new
function now I call it call it but you
know what's
I'm gonna change to my function so I
don't confuse you so let me to say that
again this code here the code inside of
our function will not activate until we
call this function and the functions
name is my function and that's how
JavaScript work it's kind of cool
whereas remember when we had our our
function alert and prompt when we had it
outside just like this inside of any
function just you know right in the
script tags it automatically launched
now if we refresh watch see they
automatically launch right but if we we
only have it inside of our function it
will not launch when we refresh see it
doesn't watch now to activate this code
we have to call the function so there's
many ways to do that one way to do that
in JavaScript is to use something called
on click so let me scroll down here
you'll see our button we have the button
here the try button and you see on click
so we have the on click tag attribute
and this is called an event handler let
me put that in a comment so it's easy to
read so we call that an event handler
and JavaScript has many event handlers
so you got on click on mouse-over
and this basically allows you to capture
to see if certain events happen so in
this case this event is just to see if
somebody clicks on this button and the
button is right here now I see right
here in the web page if somebody clicks
on this button you do this here so we're
gonna say call my function so you see
that's our function up here so it says
this code says on click equals and you
got our quotes open closing and we say
on click my function so when we
translate that it's on click use this
function here and that's the function
that we created up here so let's reload
the page so I'm going to click the try
it function there we go here's our alert
okay
and here is our JavaScript prompt so
there we go we've learned a few things
we learned about event handlers we
learned about one of them called on
click and we applied it directly to our
button here and we learned how to create
our own custom functions and we learned
that you can actually add other
functions inside of functions and the
whole point of creating functions is to
be able to chunk up your code to package
but to package up your JavaScript code
into neat little packages so that you
can organize it better and you can reuse
it over and over again because now we
can use this code all over the place we
could put on clique I'll put it
somewhere else let's say put it on this
first paragraph here so I'm gonna say on
click of the paragraph call my function
so watch this I refresh so first we have
here ok ok now let's click on the first
paragraph there we go ok ok now this
paragraph see I didn't put it on click
here so it doesn't work but on this one
let me took it again it works so you see
how we can now use this code here we can
apply it to a button we could apply to
our paragraph and we apply this code we
activate the function code using on
click event handlers there are other
event handlers as well we can go on
mouse over say that refresh now watch
this I'm just I'm not even gonna click
ok I just move my mouse over and it
activates it
all right I've opened up to a chapter 1
lesson 9 we're gonna continue learning
about functions and yeah so let's
pretend we wanted to identify when
somebody clicked on this button here or
somebody clicked on this paragraph so
let me first of all change this event
handler back to an on-click and so how
do we do that
well we could send a message one way
there's better ways to do it but we'll
do it this way the old-fashioned way
first we can send a message to our
function here and then have that message
displayed to us in our alerts and our
prompt so how do we send that message
well first of all we have to change the
basic way our function works and we do
that because we're nerd coders here and
we can do that so we're gonna say my
function has will have a something
called an argument message so what is
this say this says to us now that our
function now wants an argument remember
an argument is whatever you put in
between these brackets when the function
is called this is a function call
remember we are calling the function
here or using it here but here we're
creating the function so when you create
the function you have to tell a
JavaScript that you want a some
arguments are used in your function so
right here we're saying we need a
message so we're gonna do that now so
what we're gonna do with this message so
we get a message sent to us we'll do
that here we'll go to my function want
to send a message there's gonna be a
button alright you'll see it in second I
know it's complex we'll see in a second
and I'll say this message is paragraph
there we go so now our function call
because we're calling a function here
right or say okay we're saying the
message of paragraph now let me explain
something here first of all when you're
calling a function and those a lot
complexity a lot of complex stuff here
when you have unclick you knows we have
to put it in between the double quotes
if you sending an argument a message and
you gotta put in quotes in JavaScript
you got you can't use double quotes
inside of double quotes you have to use
single quotes inside of double quotes
now the Nakota editor is giving me
trouble here let me just fix that
alright there we go so you have to do
that knows I got double quotes and
inside double quotes I have a single
quotes around paragraph so I'm gonna do
that here as well that should work
that's a general rule of JavaScript if
you have something surround if you have
quotes surrounding another set of quotes
you should make the outside double
quotes the inside single quotes
otherwise you're gonna have some
problems so well let's first test that I
load this page up in the browser okay on
click okay okay so I clicked it try
again alright so okay it's working so
far but we're not getting any message
because the message we want to have is
the word paragraph and so how do we
display that in our alert in this case
will be paragraph and it would be well
this would be this shouldn't be
paragraph this should be actually button
button so we'll do that in our function
code here now we created a function so
we want to add this message to what's
going on in here so we do that like this
we like this let's say plus add the
message we'll do that here plus add the
message so we're taking this message and
we're placing it inside of our function
here now let's see what it looks like
first of all and I'll explain a little
bit more so let's try it see message but
since we clicked on the button that's
that's what we get button okay button
right now if we click on our paragraph
paragraph paragraph you see that now let
me make this a little bit
clear and you say I'll say you clicked
on you clicked on and that will be that
and yeah very good so yeah so let's save
that refresh you clicked on button got a
prompt see we put it right after name so
you name dot dot button cuz we clicked
on the button
you know let's make that you clicked on
there we go message so let's see how
that looks refresh you clicked on button
you clicked on button okay
now let's click on the paragraph you
clicked on paragraph you clicked on
paragraph so there you go
so we learned a few things here we
learned that we can we can tell it if we
want to receive arguments or messages
from when it's called when this function
is called remember when you're calling a
function is when you're using a function
right so that's what we did here let me
just expand this so it's all on one
lines clear so when we because we added
this request for an argument basically
we're saying here when we create our
function okay what'swhat's accept a
message so when we called our function
which we called my function we sent the
message we sent the message first one
was button second message was paragraph
so not bad we're learning or learning
all right so we're moving along here
we're learning we're learning so we've
already checked out to event handlers we
saw on clicking on mouse-over and
there's many others in this particular
lesson I want to look at a new event
handler so we call on load and also want
to create a new function our new custom
function and you know while creating a
function we'll learn a little bit more
so let's jump into some code I'm now on
chapter 1 - lesson 10 dot HTML let me
scroll up so yeah so let's look at a new
event handler something called on load
so typically you would put on load on
the body tag and the onload is for when
the page loads when you know on loading
of the page so load load func I'll call
it load func and yeah that's the
function we're going to load so now
let's create our own custom function
load func so I'm gonna go function
that's the keyword that tells JavaScript
we're creating a new function called low
func and we're gonna have our open and
closing curly braces opening and closing
curly braces this is the beginning of
the function it's the answer all this
whatever is in between this will be
processed as part of this function so
what can we do here
I don't know well we can just alert
something out though alert and what do
we want to learn out we're going to
learn a message something really obvious
the page has loaded so there we go so we
got a simple function the page has
loaded so let's scroll down a little bit
so look at here so it says unload do
this so on the page load do this and
what do we do we run this function now
we created this function now javascript
knows we're creating a function because
we start with the keyword function we
call it load function then we put a
little curly brace our little round
brackets rather and and we just say
alert do this now we could do a whole
bunch of different
we'll learn how to do very soon but yeah
so that's it what's this event handler
so I just from the last lesson let me
just delete that so what's this load to
pay see how it looks and here it is the
page has loaded right pretty good right
see it's still spinning that means it's
winning first a ok it and then it will
complete the load of the page pretty
pretty cool
so let me just get this into view so
that when we load it again next time it
will look pretty good so yeah not bad
not bad ok so this is pretty standard
stuff
so let's display something a little bit
more interesting inside of our alert so
javascript has a date function and so
let's just display the date and plus so
when we break this down so we have a
date function in JavaScript and to use
it you have to set you have to start
with the keyword new date and I'll get
into the details later but all you need
to know now is when you add new date
you're just telling us where to display
the date and of course I'm using the
plus sign to add it to this to this
string of text they call it a string of
text because it you know one one piece
of text next piece of text next piece of
text and strings alone and that's why
it's called a string of text nerds would
just simply call this a string and to
say let's add a new string to the alert
box and they're just talking about
adding text now remember when you're
adding text that is displayed as text in
JavaScript whether it be in alert boxes
or prompts you need and elsewhere you
need to put your string of text inside
of quotes like that otherwise it will be
treated as something else we'll get into
that later all you need to know if you
want to add text to your JavaScript you
have to put it inside of quotes
typically use double but you can use
single quotes too and now what we want
to do is we want to add the date here
and we're using this plus so we add the
string of text so we say also add the
date and this is gonna write out
date to our alert so let me just view
this I saved it open a browser and look
at there it is this page loaded at
Friday September 4 of 2015 this is you
know eastern daylight team it is a very
long date format right we'll get into
that later
but there you go so we've added our date
it's gonna get rid of this stuff and not
bad now I was going to teach you
something else but I think we'll stop
right here and we'll get into the next
part of this lesson in the next video
lesson
all right we're back so let me scroll up
here again so we see that we've created
our two custom function the first custom
function was called my function the
second custom function was called load
func and you know we're creating
functions because we used the special
function keyword here to say to
JavaScript we're going to create a
function we're going to call my function
and in between the curly braces is all
all the code that's part of this
function you see now we can use this
function in multiple places in our page
as we did down here we called it on the
button on the click on the button and we
call it here on the click on the
paragraph as well I'm talking about the
onclick I'm talking about this event
handler on click this event handler here
on click we also learned about the event
handler onload which is usually applied
to the body tag but you could apply it
anywhere I suppose but the body's weight
a lot of times you put this in you
remember when the page loads it always
starts at the top starting with the
doctype and it starts blowing its way
down so sometimes this order of loading
is very important that you keep in mind
so for instance when we give me an
example let's say on the body you say on
load load load func right so you're
saying load this function on load but if
you didn't create this function you
would get an error so let me just
comment this out let me give you an idea
so we're gonna go multi-line comment so
now this code of course because it's in
a comment is ignored so even though
we're telling the body to load the load
func function when the page loads it
won't be able to find it because we
commented it out so let's watch what
happens open in browser see nothing
happens nothing loads but there's an
error now we know it's an error because
if we go to our developer tools more
tools developer tools and it's actually
was bringing it out here so you can see
it more tools
developer tools or you just control
shift I which I will do from now on and
here comes the developer tools and you
see here little red square well red
circle when X says we have an error and
if you look here here's the error
console if you don't see if copses click
on you can pop it up like this just
click on it and says here uncaught
reference error load function is not
defined so it's saying the load func is
not defined when you define submit means
you you you create it to define some
used to create it or to describe it so
all the jobs repairer here is telling us
is that it can't find the load func C
and and C it's because we're trying to
call it here on load load func but since
it can't find it because we've commented
out well it can't find it so when it
can't find it stops the scripts in the
page and nothing works right so this is
where it makes sense to start looking at
errors that your JavaScript code will
produce so you can start understanding
them a bit better and it will help you
to learn how to code better whether it
be with JavaScript or any other coding
language or programming language so
errors are your friends so let me just
go back now I'm going to uncomment this
so now sudden load funk appears and it's
going to work when we just load it up
see it works loads up
in this video we're gonna take a little
bit of a break from code and I want to
remind you of the JavaScript Dom and I
want to get a little bit deeper into it
I first talked about it a little bit in
the CSS course where I talked about the
hierarchy of tags how there were parent
eggs and grandparent tags and child tags
and if you remember with CSS we had the
enth child selector and stuff like that
and we also have the rule of specificity
how if you had a more specific rule in
your CSS that rule would override less
specific rules anyway this all has to do
with the JavaScript Dom and the japs'
McDon becomes much more important now
that we're getting into JavaScript and
that's because you're gonna use
JavaScript to be able to navigate
through your web page to go into tags
remove tags add new tags insert text
into paragraphs change text that are in
paragraphs or headers or whatever so
this is all about the Dom the document
object models Dom is short for document
object model and how understanding the
Dom is very important because when we
get into the JavaScript that works with
the Dom you know kind of make sense you
bet you understand the Dom so I'm going
back up Dom is short for document object
model and it's a virtual map or a model
of a web page why do they call it a
model you can think of like a model
airplane where engineers will create a
little model airplane or a model ship or
something and so to check out their
designs make sure it would work good
before they would build the big real
airplane you know because building a
small model is a lot quicker and easier
and cheaper so the document object model
now document means the webpage a
document is a webpage object now the
object well you know I'm gonna explain
to you in a very simple way you see all
the tags and the page where you got your
body tag h1 tag you the browser
considers these as being little mini
objects a little mini things that you
can move around
and change and stuff so anyway don't
worry about objects right now but model
the M and Dom could be model or map so
you can also look at this as the map of
the tags in the webpage this is what it
is so let's look at this diagram but it
created for you and you see on the right
hand side you see a typical web page you
have two HTML tags and so on and you got
in great at this big grey box which is
basically wraps around the body portion
of the web page and you see the arrow
like point to this little diagram here
this tree on the left and you see that
the body is in grey and you see all
these these little boxes here and this
map here is all in grey so what I'm
trying to show you here is that all
these sub tags here h1 PU ll eyes these
are all subtags of the body or you can
say in other words they're all children
of the body tags so H 1 P and ul they're
all children of body now if you look at
our code here you see that body wraps
around the h1 the pul is anyhow eyes so
the body is the parent of all these tags
because it wraps around these tags now
if you look on top you got the head even
though the head is on top of body the
head is not the parent of body because
body is not inside of the head tags it's
sitting beside the head tags look at the
map here look at our diagram you see
head it's sitting beside body you can
look at the head section of the page as
being the brother or the sister of body
right and you can look at HTML here the
HTML tag right here to be HTML tag I
called it though the mother of all tags
see the HTML tag is the parent of head
and body and of course hTML is a
grandparent of h1 P and ul and also
meditate oh why because if H one's
parent is body and body's parent is is
HTML that means H h1 is of course the
grandchild of HTML just like your
father's father is your grandfather if
that makes sense so why am I talking
about father's bodies parents
all this kind of stuff because again
when we get a little further into the
course we're gonna learn about built-in
JavaScript functions we just learned
about functions like alert prompt
there's many others but there are
specific functions in JavaScript but
allow you to jump around to navigate
this map and to be able to go in there
and you might change the text inside of
this paragraph using javascript so so me
may click on a button and you can load
in different text or you can add list
item to this list and a whole bunch of
other things and Dom manipulation
manipulation another word for me relate
manipulation is changing things dawn Dom
do M manipulation that is the basis of a
lot of games in and a lot of apps in
what you see online so using the
JavaScript Dom and using JavaScript you
can transform a website into a web app
because you can change things on the fly
depending so there you go I hope this
makes sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
