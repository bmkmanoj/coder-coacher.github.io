name is Steph so I'm going to quickly
talk about CSS and page layout very
quick video very quick vlog for
beginners to web design and somebody
pointed out in the YouTube comments
recently that they had a harder time
learning CSS and JavaScript I believe
was JavaScript and it could have been
Python now just in case you don't know
JavaScript Python these are full-fledged
programming languages whereas CSS is a
styling language for web pages and web
apps websites so a lot of people find
CSS especially when it comes to page
layout much more difficult than
programming languages which is kind of
funny because programming languages are
very powerful and there's a lot of
complexity there the reason why a lot of
people have problems with CSS is because
CSS technology in of itself the language
itself in my opinion is not the best
conceived language CSS was originally
designed to style web pages and web
pages were originally conceived of as
text documents as way of as a way to
exchange information in text format
overview so it evolved into a
full-fledged programming environment
where web pages became web apps web apps
are just web pages there are
applications and web apps require
graphical user interfaces they require
interfaces not pages of text and so the
paradigms built into CSS are not well
suited for graphical user interfaces
with html5 and css3 they've done a lot
to fix that for instance you have now
CSS tables which basically allow you to
create grids or tables roles and columns
in your web pages pretty easily if you
don't know programming it's very common
in programming languages that's how
a sort of divide up the window if you
will into columns and rows and so forth
to make it easy for people for
programmers to create the basic
graphical user interfaces the GUI for
apps so anyway long story short yes if
you are a beginner to web design and web
development and you're having challenges
with CSS specially CSS layout try not to
worry too much about it you are not the
only one even highly experienced
programmers and coders still have
problems with CSS because it's so
unintuitive that said what coders have
done in response to how unintuitive CSS
can be is that they created frameworks
and the most popular one for user
interfaces is something called bootstrap
and once you know your basic CSS and you
should learn how to do CSS layout with
raw CSS but once you know that then
everybody just uses bootstrap and in
fact that's what we do we're about to do
a rewrite of our app studio web and it
is being rewritten with a bootstrap
framework with the bootstrap framework
framework rather because it just makes
things so much easier now one of the
things which we look for in modern-day
websites is website should be responsive
many of the time so what's the
responsive site a responsive site is a
site to simply respond to the size of
the web browser the size of the screen
so here is a web site for my book build
your web site now and which I wrote in
2015 but I wrote this stuff too by the
way to be evergreen meaning the content
in here is just as good today as it was
back then it'll be good for years that's
because the language is what I teach
html5 css3 touch on javascript touch on
bootstrap touch on jQuery just touch
everything that I teaching there and all
the foundations and so forth
it's 100% up to date hasn't changed at
all thankfully technologies of web
design and web apps are pretty stable
now they've hit a plateau if you don't
know your past in terms of these texts
I've been doing this since the 90s
it was painful because it was changing
so quickly stuff that you learned a year
before was starting to become outdated
already and two year old tech three our
tech was totally updated this is no
longer the case with web tech it's
pretty static it's pretty stable static
being stable so you'd be good there
anyway so a responsive site is a site
that responds resizes you knows how
everything's resizing the text reflows
even my images are changing sizes the
size of the Frog changes and you notice
I have a menu up here and then I resize
and then it becomes a what they call a
hamburger menu here so that's a
responsive site and this allows your
site to totally flex and change no
matter what size the browser window is
or if people are coming on a tablet
here's a tablet size or people come in
on with a smartphone that is a
responsive website so the recap if
you're learning CSS you having
difficulty you're trying to get your
head wrapped around it the key to doing
it the key to understanding CSS is to
concentrate on the basic concepts of CSS
kind of the kind of strange at first
that's for sure an irritated kind of
abstract but what time you get it but
once you've got those basics then you
move into something like a bootstrap
which is a framework just a bunch of
code that makes it easier for you to
layout your pages this particular layout
was made with bootstrap as well if you
like to read is my little shameless
self-promotion you want an easy to read
book 224 pages you want to learn how to
write CSS write HTML how to build web
pages website you want to send a big
picture and you want to understand how
it all fits together you're like
diagrams images you like a book that's
easy to read lightweight
there's only 224 pages I invite you to
pick up my book highly reviewed as you
can see and yeah available on amazon.com
dot CA that UK etc etc etc and don't
take my word for it you can read the
book reviews for yourself and see what
people think
all right that's it for my shameless
self-promotion and I think in subsequent
blogs I'll start appearing on camera
again I decided for this one I was feel
like combing my hair to be totally
honest with you so I said I'll do this
on screen as a joke by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
