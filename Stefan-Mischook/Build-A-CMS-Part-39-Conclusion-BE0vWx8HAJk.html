I failed to mention in the last video if
you've edit the
what-you-see-is-what-you-get field and
you try to edit the content to add
quotes and hit submit you'll probably
notice that you get strange slashes and
what that refers to is that's it refers
to a PHP function that is enabled by
default and if you go to the tiny MCE
website and look at the documentation
and specifically look at the tiny MCE
faq you'll notice that is a question
here HTML output includes lots of
slashes and as it explains that's
because you're using PHP and there's a
feature called magic quotes enabled by
default and it's an attempt to
automatically escape certain characters
to prevent security issues however as a
general rule as you can read in the PHP
documentation this feature has been
deprecated and the lying on this feature
is highly discouraged as a general rule
it's preferred to code with magic quotes
off and what we're gonna do as the tiny
MCE FAQ suggests is we're going to copy
this code and basically what this does
is it strips the slashes out from our
post get cookie and requests arrays so
I'm going to go back to coda I'm going
to edit our init dot PHP file
and I'm gonna paste it in here at the
bottom like so and what this will do is
this will automatically strip those
slashes for us without us having to do
anything you could also potentially run
a PHP function called strip slashes from
specific variables but I'm gonna do it
globally so now if i refresh the page
let's try editing this again you'll
notice those slashes disappear because
they're being stripped from our post and
get variables so that's the last quick
change and you can read more about that
if you want a little bit of a better
explanation either on the tiny MCE
website or specifically on the magic
quotes page so as a quick note magic
quotes are depreciated and they're gonna
be removed entirely from PHP 6 anyway so
that basically wraps up this series at
least for the moment
I mean we have a fully working very
basic but fully working content
management system that allows us to
easily log in either by clicking a login
link or adding question mark login to
the URL and it checks the database for
the correct username and password allows
us to login
it gives us editable areas that indicate
what sections of the page are editable
and I guess one quick change I'm gonna
go back and edit this code quickly and
I'm gonna change one of these blocks
from me what you see is what you get
type so I'm gonna a comment or a comma
excuse me and I'm gonna add text area
just so we can see the three different
content types
so that as I was saying we have three
different content types we have a one
line content type just very basic we
have a what-you-see-is-what-you-get
field which allows us to edit things add
colors add sizes add you know additional
styles and then we also have a text area
field which is just very simple and it
allows you to add your own code and
basic content in these spots so my goal
with this series as I said way back
video what number one or two is to
create something basic something that
you can use this as a foundation for
your own system so I hope that this has
given you a lot to think about and that
you'll be able to continue adding to
this application and adding in your own
functionality I don't think this
particular series is completely done I
mean they're obviously additional things
that I'd like to cover but I'm gonna cap
it off at 39 videos just for the moment
it'll let me move on to a couple other
things then I may come back to this
series there are a couple things I have
in mind already additions that I'd like
to make for example some basic
functionality as far as being able to
create new users perhaps some sort of
easy installation system which would
automatically set up the database and
make things a little bit simpler for you
and I guess two other things probably
would be nice to have some sort of
password reset and you know ability to
change the administrators password
easily and the last thing which I think
is pretty essential so I would like to
have some sort of interface for being
able to upload photos and that's pretty
important obviously not all content is
going to be text-based so being able to
add photos would be quite an important
feature but as I said these are things I
probably will come back to in the future
thank you for listening I hope you have
learned a lot and you've enjoyed the
series and feel free to contact me if
you have any you know additional
features you'd like to see your comments
or questions on things that I've covered
please feel free to contact me either
through my email which is Ben at killing
sites calm or on the killer sites forums
where I go by the username Ben so thanks
for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
