going to learn the SQL language this is
the coding language of databases and
what am I gonna do instead of breaking
it up into all kinds of little parts I'm
gonna just try to do it in one bigger
video this is something that I haven't
done in a long time and I figured yeah
I'll see how people react to it and the
other unconventional thing I'm going to
do is we're going to actually build to
the course we're actually going to do
the course using the w3 schools website
there's a whole bunch of reasons for it
which i'll gated to pretty soon and
that's about it so I'm recording this on
Windows 10 just because most people use
Windows these days I use both Mac and
Windows so it doesn't really matter
which computer you use all I suggest is
that you do go to the w3 schools comm
slash SQL so you can follow along what
I'm going to do is is actually go
through their tutorial I'm gonna fill in
a lot of blanks here and there though
and I'm gonna translate a lot of what
they do here from nerd to non nerd
w3schools is a great site if you know
what you're doing and you want to build
your knowledge that's why I always
emphasize in all my videos that the key
is the basics if you know the basics
then you can learn all kinds of other
stuff quite easily so w3schools has all
kinds of good material here and tools in
here to actually make testing the code
pretty easy so you know if you're a
total beginner I would say you get my
book or you do my interactive web
developer course and then you can come
to the w3 schools and learn different
things or maybe go deeper into different
subjects anyway off on a tangent so SQL
is the language of relational databases
so let me step back for a little bit so
a database is simply an app that is used
to store a lot of data
and data is another word it's a nerd
word for information so a database is a
base of information databases are apps
and the apps have all kinds of
functionality built into them to make
storing and retrieving and managing
large chunks of information easy you
need these type of apps these database
apps trust me when you start building up
you know a good a good amount of
information so let's say you have a
online shopping cart where you're going
to need to keep track of all your
clients or their client shipping
addresses the orders that they purchase
the products in your catalog now you
could do this manually using flat files
or maybe if you do a little PHP you
could store stuff in text files and use
PHP text file capabilities to extract
information but that would be just silly
because one of the advantages of using a
database is that they got all these
tools built into them to make all this
really easy so there are several types
of databases out there and there is the
three that I'm aware of any hour anyway
are the SQL database which we're going
to be spending all of our time on the
flat file database which are just text
files and then the object database an
object database is a database that works
with object oriented code so if you've
done my JavaScript course where I've
introduced you to some basic
object-oriented concepts that's where
object database has come in and our
other types of databases now you can
think of the types of databases like
there are types of automobiles you have
sports cars you have convertibles you
have minivans you have trucks each type
of database has their role whether
strong or some you know where they're
strong with a weak these days if you're
going to get into web development or any
type of development really there's a 99%
chance you will be using SQL based data
basis rather than object databases or
flat-file databases which the other two
types that I talked about and their
other types most of the time you're
using SQL databases SQL is short for
structured
we're a language and it's let's break
down that word structured it's
structured it's querying its language
that's structured and it's for querying
a query is just a nerd word a fancy word
for ask questions so it's a structured
language for asking questions structured
query language
it's a coding language and or you can
reverse it so you got SQL structured
query language you Google it's a
language for querying and in structured
and so what are you worrying you're
querying you're asking questions you're
communicating with a database a database
app but you're not communicating with
all types of databases the SQL language
was invented with the SQL databases
another word for an SQL database is a
relational database and I'll explain to
you as we get further into this video
what why is it called a relational
database so there are very several
vendors out there several companies out
there that produce a build SQL databases
and if you look at the w3 school sites
it lists them right here at the top so
we have MySQL which probably most
popular and an SQL server from Microsoft
and access which is yeah it's kind of an
SQL server oracle sybase DB 2 plus grey
SQL or others and again you're gonna get
the the people who love Oracle or gonna
say MySQL is garbage and vice versa just
like with programming languages just
like with cars you know I happen to like
alleys my friend lost BMWs and we won't
agree so what we're gonna be learning is
SQL which is a universal language of SQL
databases they call it the ANSI language
so we'll get into it later you can
forget about that for now so we're gonna
learn the basics we're gonna learn how
SQL databases work and so on so let me
just get into my in the intro here so
what's this read off some of these
things and I'm gonna fill in the blanks
translate from nerd to non nerd so SQL
stands for structured query language we
discussed that and the language allows
you to access databases SQL is ANSI
American National Standards Institute
standards so means it's a standard
language but all
SQL databases support the SQL ANSI
standard but in addition to that
Microsoft will have their own
proprietary versions of SQL functions
and stuff that you can do and all the
vendors do that all whether it be mysql
oracle sybase whatever so but what we're
gonna concentrate on in this course well
this video is the basic SQL syntax the
basic stuff because it's universal and
once you get the basics by the way 95%
of your SQL work will be with these
basics so let's see what else what can
ask you I'll do it again it's all nerd
here basically you can use SQL to create
databases within a database tables we'll
discuss what tables are soon delete
records add records all kinds of stuff
it's very very very powerful so let me
scroll down so if you look at websites
like YouTube like Facebook like Twitter
studio web killer sites any WordPress
blog behind the scenes you have a
database and in all those cases you have
an SQL database powering everything
storing all the information so it's
quite useful so let's so you jump in a
year - I hate database tables okay so an
SQL database another word for SQL
database another way you call it
relational databases and the way
relational databases basically work is
you put all the information into tables
think of an HTML table so if you look on
this page here you see a table right
here right now tables have rows from
left to right and they have columns up
and down and each column represents a
different piece of information so this
table is a customer table Remo says
right here a customer table and attracts
all the information about customers that
you would want so that's the customer ID
you always have to give your records in
your database table this is a record
this is a rector this is a record each
client is a different record a new
recording a new record
so I hope you understand that anyway so
when you are building your database
tables because you build these you
design these as a as a coder you have to
think about all the information you want
to track so let's say you have an online
store and you're gonna have a table on
your clients your customers so you have
each customer has to have an I an ID
that has to be unique there can't be two
customers with the ID of two because
that excuse me the idea of one because
that would cause troubles trust me so
the ID you have to cut have what they
call a unique ID in every table to
identify each record each row each role
is a record each world's record so they
have custom ID the customer name that
comes contact name the address city
postal code country now what you put in
the table as up to you and every
business will have different things they
want to track so let me make an analogy
so I'm opened up here Google sheets it's
a spreadsheet and spreadsheets kind of
look like database tables cuz you got
columns right you got rows and the big
difference is is that with spreadsheets
the whole point of spreadsheet is to
take information hold loss information
to manipulate to create graphs to create
reports some people use them as
databases to but they don't have nearly
the power of a proper database app to
manage huge amounts of information think
about if you had like you know millions
and millions of records and so on they
could get pretty complex so I'm just
using the spreadsheet here to help you
understand how it go so if I was a nerd
I am a nerd but let's say I had a job
where I wanted to create an online store
so I had to track orders I had to have a
client table and I had a whole bunch of
other tables probably so what I'm gonna
do here I'm just gonna name this sheet
I'm just gonna call it cly I'm gonna
call it store pretend this whole thing
is like my database and each sheet I
don't know if you're familiar with Excel
represents a new table so this table I'm
gonna call it
this should be able to rename it renamed
it I'm going to call it clients so it'd
be like my clients table they have
another table here I'm gonna call it
never be name I'm gonna call it product
so I would have all my products tables
right that'd be cool
let's say I want another database table
this could be a good way to using a
spreadsheet like this is to figure out
what you want in your database table so
I'm gonna rename this you've got a
client products you got orders right
here you got orders they don't add
another one this is gonna freak you out
and I'll explain to you why I'm doing
this later on and you've got rename I'm
gonna call it order details now you
notice the names I chose for each of
these tables each of these database
tables now to be clear I'm just using
Excel to demonstrate concepts here Excel
is not a database but they do have roles
left to right and they do have columns
so it's a nice way for me to sort of
demonstrate the basic principles we're
gonna get back to the w3c because then
we can actually interact with the
database table using real commands so if
we you look at this first sheet here
we'll call it our database table is
called the clients now in the client
side of the ID cuss ID custom class last
name cuss phone cuss address now I use
cuss cuz I was kind of lazy but it's
kind of clears customer but if I was
designing a system for long term I would
give a proper name I would call them
customer and you knows I have no spaces
in there you should have no space is
just like naming variables and stuff if
you're doing PHP or JavaScript and you
notice how the names tell you something
about the information in the column
right this call me okay it's the
customers name I don't go CN i don't
name it CN or call it column a give it a
name so that it makes sense to me and
I'm looking back at her six months from
now I'm writing code my PHP code to
interact with this table they'll be easy
for me to you know figure out what
this column is about and even when it
comes down to the table name I call
clients right it's a table where I'm
keeping track all my client so you have
a client ID client ID 1 this is client
information so I'm just gonna copy this
that's just so it's clear so let's say I
added a new client whoo-hoo new client
buys what's tying to be stuff again
we're gonna call it Nick Nick comes in
and buys a product and it's not miss
Chuck of course so I'll call Nick Yahoo
he buys and he's got a different phone
number whatever whatever whatever and as
my address is well Nick's address rather
is the South pulled there we go so you
get the idea so as clients come in you
would add them in your client table when
you have all these records and each
client will have a unique ID the cuss
idea again like I said if I was really
doing this real to be a customer ID it's
good to have long names for your column
names or database names it just makes it
easier for you to call it just like when
you're writing your code and JavaScript
or PHP or whatever language so here's
that table so the next tip will be the
products table so you gotta have
products so I'm gonna say that what are
you gonna you're gonna need a product ID
right so go to a product ID that's cool
all right like like this that's cool and
then we're also gonna have you're gonna
have a you're gonna have a product
product name so I'm using camelcase here
remember camelcase from the programming
up and down like a camel's hump right
product name or you know I'm gonna have
well so we have a product so you can do
underscore like this that would be cool
underscore or you can do - - I'll just
be consistent product name product what
else do we have product logo price yeah
what else do we want we want product
letter wait let's say we're shipping
bananas or something I don't know so
that's it so doesn't even act like that
for now see when you're doing apps for
clients they're gonna tell you what
they're gonna need to track about their
products if you're sitting up like at
all
for them there you go site the center so
now you got your product so you know I
need a product ID so in a database you
have something called the unique key now
it's usually the ID of every of the
record and table so if I go back to his
clients table you know it's a customer
ID this is always gonna be unique each
value and here in each of these roles
are unique you'll never have a number
another number for in the state in this
row here you'll never have another
number six that way you can a neat
uniquely identify in this case the
clients in the table so yeah so that's
kind of cool that's kind of a standard
of thing
now databases actually have tools and
capabilities built into them lots of
them to make your life easy one of the
things they have they have the ability
for you to set a column to save it make
sure this is called the auto increment
column so it will automatically generate
these numbers for you
so anyway keep that in mind a lot to
take in I know but this is the nature of
this particular video so I'm just gonna
do it like this it's an old spreadsheet
trick you take two numbers like this and
then you get the you highlight them you
get the little square and you're drag
and then your spreadsheet does that for
you kind of cool so we're gonna have a
product name we're gonna go of potatoes
boat a tows product price we'll say it's
a it's a dollar and we're gonna say
product weight one pound
right so it's not bad so you know so we
go next product when you go tomatoes
tomatoes potatoes and product price we
say it's a dollar 25 and we say it's for
1 lb anyway and then what else could we
have we'll have X boxes Xbox is product
price we'll say it's $200 and it weighs
10 lbs there you go so we got our
product table building up now when
you're building your tables you wouldn't
fill in this data like this I'm just
doing this to demonstrate what you would
use code later on SQL code combined
probably with PHP or Java or Python
whatever a coding language programming
language you want to use to fill in this
data most of the time it depends it
depends clients might give you a whole
bunch of data in you know a file and you
have to import it using SQL but anyway
I'm just putting in some data see to get
an idea of how it works so that's kind
of cool is it get your product you got a
product idea to name the price wait
that's cool we added this table here but
the clients got the client names so how
about the orders you got to order so
we're gonna have order ID and we're
gonna have order date thing is right now
the word date and we have order shipping
address you never know and this is gonna
this is a key concept in databases I'm
about to teach you right here we
drumroll and it's gonna be called
customer ID now why did I drumroll
customer ID because your customers are
stored in the client table you know we
should call this table collide customer
right because can I'm client and we have
customer we got to keep everything
consistent right I'm dumb so we're gonna
go customer tables there we go customers
see cuz we have customer table customer
column ID call name customer name last
name and so on so in our order page we
have a customer ID now remember I talked
about SQL databases or called relational
databases now think of it we're
relational it's about relationships like
brothers sisters aunts cousins dogs cats
and not dogs cats but you get the idea
there's a relational database holds all
its data in tables as we're kind of
building here in the spreadsheet just as
an example you would actually build
these tables in a real database app
which we're going to do soon yeah so you
have all these tables so you know we had
a customer table or products table or
orders table and so on so one of the
things that you do with an SQL database
with a relational database
is that you create connections you
create relationships between one table
and the other so why don't you put your
customers and their orders all in one
table because it would be a mess it
would be a mess you don't want to do
that that would be like putting your
underwear in your sock drawer you don't
want to put your underwear in your sock
store because when you put your
underwear and your socks mix together
your socks are going to disappear in
your underwear it's gonna be hard to
find any of your socks and it's the same
thing
with your database tables when you're
creating your database tables for your
database you want to conceptualize you
want to think about how you organize
your data so it's very common you would
have a custom if you're doing an online
store you would have a customers table
and then you would have an orders table
and then you have a products table and
so on and so forth so the next step is
to create a relationship between tables
you don't always have relationship
between tables but a lot of times you do
so for instance we have our orders and
customers place orders so how do you
associate a particular order here's the
order right so we have order we just
just let's do what we do here just for
sake though making it look clear and
clean so we're gonna have our order IDs
here cool and let me just do this both
so imagine there was date and shipping
address and so on so how do you connect
the order from the orders table with the
customer who buys you do it through the
customer ID the customer ID so this
customer ID is related to is the same as
the customer ID in this table so in your
code when a new order would come in you
would add a new order entry here it's a
order date today you know you would put
the date today so I don't know August
3rd and then you would have a shipping
address because who knows maybe you have
a client they have address but they may
have a separate shipping shipping
address so I would always put the
shipping address in there but you know
what
your client may said you know no we
don't need that that's not how we
operate in our business so you got to be
understanding when you design
database tables you're gonna be adapting
to what your client tells you so there's
this period where you sit down with the
client you interview them and you find
out what they need yeah yeah yeah and
then you design your tables like I'm
doing here anyway so you put the
shipping address that there is and then
you put the client ID so in code would
it would be a PHP code or your Java code
your Python called your Ruby code
whatever you and combined with SQL by
the way PHP Python Ruby when they're
working with databases or relational
databases when they're working with SQL
databases they're always interacting
with the SQL language right so you have
your PHP that's doing SQL and then the
SQL communicates with the database I
hope that makes sense we'll be demoing
that at some point in the future so yeah
so you want to basically tag this
particular order order number one we
know it's order number one because order
ID number one and we want to tag it with
a customer meaning when I say which
customer but order number one so we go
to our customers and strangely it's
custom we'll say it's customer number
two so we just put it in here
order number one customer number two by
order number one so imagine you've got
thousands of orders right you got
thousands of orders and you want to know
how many orders the customer ID bought
excuse me the customer number too but
what's the ID of number two then you can
go to your orders table and this do some
SQL and say show me which orders the
customer with the idea of two but it and
that kind of stuff so this is just a
taste so you've learned about building
tables you learn about the columns and
rows you know that each of every time
you got a new row that's a new record
it's a new son new piece of information
you learned about having unique IDs in
the table utakome unique keys like a key
you know a unique key the key to the
table meaning this can't be record to
reproduce you only you know an order ID
in the orders table you only have an
order ID number two once right because
then you're gonna have all kinds of
problems like a unique address on the
streets like your buildings address you
don't have the 33
Catherine Street twice on Catherine
Street because people know where to send
the mail I hope that makes sense anyway
but other records you can have
duplicates cuz you know your customer
with the ID of to may place many orders
where we hope they do
right so and you go back and and and
last thing we learnt is that you have
what they call these relationships
created between tables and you do that
by putting keys from one table into the
next table so let me give you that
example is our unique key in this table
of course is the customer ID right and
we know about customer with the idea
number two is this guy here Nick and in
our owners table we say the customer if
the idea of two bought this order right
so it's unique so now we can do all
kinds of crazy cool operations using the
power of SQL to pull out all kinds of
data about customer with the ID of -
okay that's been talking for a long time
I think I'm going to take a break right
now I may come back in this video or I
may do a part two I'm not sure I know I
said before I was gonna try and do it
all one video but my coffee is nearly
run out so forget about it's not gonna
happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
