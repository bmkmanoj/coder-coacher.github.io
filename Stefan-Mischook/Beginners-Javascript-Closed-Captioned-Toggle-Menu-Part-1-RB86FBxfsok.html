practice a lot of things we've been
learning over the course of this entire
video training session
and we're going to actually jump into
now pure Dom JavaScript programming
there are two things I want to point out
in this particular video first of all
we're going to be working once again
within the document object here and in
the object the document object there are
two things I want to look at something
called the get element by ID function
very important function when we say that
again the get element by ID function and
we're going to look at a very important
property called inner HTML with these
two very important tools we will be able
to create a JavaScript toggle menu very
easily
okay
to open into some code here but I've
already written for us and what I'm
gonna do now I'm gonna walk you through
this code so you understand what's going
on specifically this is gonna make a new
one for you guys the insert text
function here but before I do that let's
take a look at the actual page so it's a
pretty simple page nothing to get too
excited about but if you look over here
I got this main menu but click on it you
see this menu pop open Hair Spray shoes
flower socks two S's there this menu may
look familiar to you because we built
that in a previous video using a
function it may have been called las'
products I don't know we called it then
but I'm sure you're familiar with this
code I'm gonna walk you through this
code and so that you're reminded of it
just in case you forgot and we'll work
our way down
first of all at the top here we have
just a basic CSS declarations here I
change the font family to verdana
because you know I just prefer that font
to default font to Arial I created two
IDs here menu title menu items let's
scroll down here and you see menu title
and we see menu items
notice how menu items is just an empty
paragraph I left it empty so that we can
use Dom scripting methods to populate
this with some with some text our list
that we saw before anyhow let's scroll
back up here so after our CSS let's drop
down to the JavaScript here and let's
look at the first function so our first
function is called list underscore
products now I have a comment here let's
pretend we got these values from a
database we could do that we could have
grabbed this from a database using some
wow I'm not going to get into the
details about that because this is just
a basics JavaScript course but pretend
that you could have done that anyway so
we've created our new array we've
populated our array and then we created
a variable and we've used this variable
to basically populate it with the stuff
that we've held in our array here so
we've seen this code before the only
thing I want to point out is that we've
included a dash so that a dash appears
in front of each item from the array and
we've also included a break so that
after one item is displayed we get a
break then the next item and so on what
you want to take away from this is that
by the end of this function we return
the text variable which is basically all
this stuff combined in here so we get
that list will I just preview that again
we just get this list here right so
that's all we're doing with this
function we're returning all that text
formatted
later on I'll show you how we could
create links out of this so we can have
a menu of actually as clickable via HTML
links anyhow just to understand we're
returning text now which is this
variable so now let's go down into the
next function so to create a taco menu
we have to track whether something is
off or on whether the menu is off or on
this probably doesn't make too much
sense to you now but just understand
when you're creating a menu that's
toggling you know what I mean by toggle
up see off on off on off on when you're
toggling a menu like that you have to
keep track of whether the menu is open
or closed I could have called this open
or closed but decide just call off on so
anyway so let's just take a look at the
code and I think yeah I think you
understand so we have this function
called insert text first thing I do is I
have a big if statement here right thing
at the if and I have the else so I say
if the variable on/off right we declared
it here if the variable on/off is equal
to off then we do this otherwise it's
not equal to off if T equal to Han then
we're gonna do this before I get into
this just remember that after we've
completed all this stuff you notice how
I declared a variable on here so if it's
off once they've done my business I say
okay turn it on so the next time we come
around it will be on so this will fire
here Sophie drop down here if it is on
this all gets done and then we set it
back to off again so next time somebody
clicks it will be off again so this part
will get fired off I hope that makes
sense this is how this is the basic
strategy rather of how you create
something a toggle button an on/off
switch if you will you create your
variable here outside the function right
and that becomes a global variable we've
looked at that in a previous video and
then we we do our business we check to
see that on our offer
we do our business and then we switch it
in the other direction so for us off we
turn on and in this case it would be on
on the house and that means we're gonna
turn it off I hope that makes sense
in part two of this video we're going to
get into the heart of this and that's
the get element by ID function and the
innerhtml property these two tools if
you will are very very important in
JavaScript Dom scripting and it allows
us to make all those changes to the
pages dynamically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
