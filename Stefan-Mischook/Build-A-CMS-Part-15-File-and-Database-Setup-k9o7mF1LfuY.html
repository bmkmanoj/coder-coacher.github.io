video is one through four I discussed
the overall plans for our content
management system and how to build out
basic HTML and CSS website that we would
make editable using the CMS that we were
creating in lessons 5 through 14 I've
reused videos from the PHP login with
Hopi and MVC series because that gives
us the basis that we need to start our
application by creating basic
authorization and templating objects so
we're going to get started today by
working on the file structure and the
database setup it's involved with our
content management system what do you
see here on the left side of my screen
is the results of videos 1 through 4
well we have an application folder and
resources folder and our index dot PHP
so that's contains the basic HTML and
CSS website that we built out on the
right-hand of my screen this is the
resulting code from videos 5 through 14
which includes the code for our
authorization object and templating
objects so I'm going to be working to
combine these two projects together to
form one cohesive content management
system let me start out by working on
the app folder and this folder will
contain all the files needed for a
content management system and so far all
we have is a resources folder
it holds images also in this resources
folder I'm going to add a couple
additional folders we go ahead and add a
CSS folder and that's gonna hold the
style dot CSS and I'm going to change
the name of this to FP underscore style
dot CSS and the F P stands for flight
path which is the name of the content
management system that I'm building
obviously you can change it but that's
what I've gone with for this example and
I pre faced a lot of the CSS styles that
we're going to be working with and some
of the files themselves
with FP just indicate that they're part
of the content management system not
part of the actual website so in
addition to the CSS folder I'm also
going to build out a JavaScript folder
like so I'm not going to put anything in
it just yet but we will use it in the
future in addition to the resources
folder I'm also going to create a new
folder that I'm going to call it core
because this is going to contain the
core functionality of the application
and the idea here is that I'm trying to
make everything as modular as possible
this would allow us to simply add
folders for additional key bits of
functionality so hopefully this is the
right approach and this is what we'll be
using as I build out the rest of the
application so in the core folder I'm
going to create a couple additional
folders I'm going to create one for
models one for templates which I'll talk
about in a couple minutes and another
one for views and within this I'm gonna
pull over the views from videos 5
through 14 gonna put those views within
the views folder here we go and we
actually don't need a members view so
I'm just gonna delete that
all we need from here is the feed under
square login and for models I'm gonna
pull over the authorization and template
objects so those are key bits of
functionality that our content
management system needs the ability to
log in and log out and the ability to
display different views and then for
includes I'm gonna work with this a
little bit but if I go back to the app
folder I'm going to move over these two
files here
and that is nearly all I'm also gonna
move in the login and logout dot PHP
files to the app folder as well so that
concludes the file movement process
let's move on to updating our database
I've opened up PHP myadmin and you
should have something very similar to me
I have an Opie underscore log in a
database and this is the same database
that I created in the PHP login with
Opie and MVC series and I have one users
table in it which contains three columns
an ID username and password and we have
one record with the ID being one a
username being admin and the password
being a hashed version of the password
admin rather than simply reusing this
database I want to rename it to
something that's more closely related to
a content management system so as far as
I understand it there isn't an actual
easy way to rename database using
phpMyAdmin but what I am gonna do
instead is I will export the database
and then we import it under a different
name
so I'm gonna go to the export tab yeah
just hit go and what you see here is he
proper commands to recreate the database
and I've copied this data I'm gonna open
up a text editor paste it in and save it
to my desktop
and then I'll go back to the phpMyAdmin
home I'm going to create a new database
here which I'm simply going to call FP
underscore CMS and I'm going to input
this data back in again here we go
so you'll see once again we have all the
correct structure and the correct data
in place from the old database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
