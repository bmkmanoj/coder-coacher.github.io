jQuery let's do a quick video covering
some JavaScript basics I'll be looking
specifically at javascript variables
arrays couple of useful JavaScript
functions how to create your own custom
functions if you're already familiar
with these feel free to skip on to the
next video first off let's talk about
variables variables are important
because it'd allow us to associate a
name with our data you're one of the
essential building blocks of this
language allowing us to store and easily
access data we create a variable like
this you start with a VAR keyword and
the variable name this case is temp then
an equal sign and then the data we want
that variable to hold in this case it's
test note that variables in JavaScript
are dynamic you don't need to specify
what type of data a variable will hold
since Java scripts looks at that data
and figures out its type automatically
for example test is a string because of
the quotes it will also automatically
figure out if it's an integer a double
boolean or an array talking about arrays
let me show you how to create one do it
like so far 10 equals and a square
bracket the items in your array
separated by commas and then a closing
square bracket and finally the semicolon
arrays are useful for storing groups of
related data i don't think i'll be using
them much in this particular course i
thought i should cover them briefly just
in case if you want to retrieve a
specific element from an array you do it
like this note that the elements in the
array start at 0 so 0 is the first
element 1 is the second element etc if
you want to get the total number of
elements in array you use length like
this and note that there's no
parentheses on this length is not a
function it's just an attribute of that
array so parentheses aren't needed let's
talk about a couple useful functions one
you probably familiar with is alert
which pops up an alert box with some
information asks user to view it and
then click OK
a creating an alert message looks like
this it can be useful for displaying
information to a user in many cases I'll
use it as a quick way to debug my
JavaScript code but there are alternate
ways to handle debugging and I'll
discuss that later one other similar
function is confirm this function pops
up in alert box the X to the user a
question and gives them the option of
choosing yes or no based on what the
user selects this function will return
true or false and finally I want to talk
about prompt this function prompts the
user for some specific data do it's how
I would code that you'll note I have the
VAR again creating a variable and then I
do prompt and then in the parenthesis I
put the question that I want to ask the
user and this function will set the
variable you specify whatever data the
user types in finally let's talk about
custom functions javascript already
includes a lot of useful functionality
how do you code a custom function looks
like this you have a function we have
the name of the function we have
parentheses and inside those parentheses
will have any variables that we want
this function to use and then finally we
might return something at the end of
that function please note that returning
data isn't always required sometimes you
may just have a function that does
something and then that's the end of it
but in often cases you'll use return to
return a bit of data at the end of the
function for example who is a simple
function that takes two numbers adds
them together and returns the result
you'll note that we were passing in num1
and num2 those are two variables that
this function expects and then returning
the sum of those two if we want to call
a function for example this edition
function just above we can do this we
save our combined in this case we're
creating a variable that's going to hold
the results from addition we're passing
in one and three so we're going to call
the addition method or excuse me the
addition function passing in one and
three that variable crate that we
created called
will equal four I think that's enough of
the basics for now there might be a
couple other things i'll discuss later
in this series but i just wanted to make
sure you had at least a basic foundation
in javascript before we dive into jquery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
