on my site killer PHP and it was PHP vs.
Python in 2018 and somebody sent me an
email responding to a comment I made
about PHP vs. Python and so I'm just
gonna read you he quoted this back to me
I would suggest Python if you want to
get into AI and ml and PHP if you want
to create web apps or work with
WordPress in a serious way so he
responds to me I'm just gonna read this
because it's an interesting response I
do a lot of PHP programming for
interconnected systems it is a great
back-end language for connecting all
kinds of systems calling API is put data
and data base it is great language for
programming jobs that run standalone
have nothing to you with Web Apps
yes I've done that before you create a
few PHP pages with some scripts even
have PHP interact with the file system
so on and then you run a cron job on
Linux or the similar same thing on
Windows and you just call that PHP and
the way it goes and does all kinds of
stuff let me continue would be great if
you consider this aspect to that post
also I am beginning to do some AI and ml
with PHP very there are interesting
things out there this is true I've
mentioned that in previous vlog people
have used PHP to do ml and AI my point
is though in industry if you do an ml a
I chances are doing Python or I think
it's the our language although you could
do it PHP but remember what I'm looking
at all languages I'm also considering
the job implications the commercial
implications not necessarily just the
technical implications that make any
sense so yes you can do ml with PHP
would you probably not because everybody
else is doing in a Python so you do in
PHP you're gonna be like the only person
in the world the practically is doing in
PHP and that could leave you high and
dry you know what I mean he continues to
say PHP is not as resource hungry as
Java 100% and is possible to run a web
server a MySQL server and a lot of PHP
standalone programs on a virtual machine
with 512 mega bits of RAM but 512
megabytes of RAM excuse me something
impossible to do with the Java
equivalent
this is chuh Java as a heavy startup
cost or some heavy footprints if you
love Java versus PHP that's one of the
things I like about PHP it's super
lightweight PHP is good if you're a good
programmer and is bad for bad
programmers more freedom comes more
responsibility this is true this is all
true as well PHP can be used in the
hacked way but you could also write very
clean object-oriented PHP code that has
its own arm and it does everything that
every modern programming language does
of all the controls you're testing and I
won't get into the details but
everything that you would do a job
everything to do it see sharpening you
do it python everybody do it
I guess Ruby anything or JavaScript
anything that you do it all these
languages in terms of sophisticated code
writing you can do what PHP there's no
question but of course there's that old
PHP legacy where it was developed on a
need-to-know basis kind of a hacked up
language so people who don't use peach
peas they still think PHP is on version
3 when in fact it's version 7 which is a
huge upgrade even from version 5 so yeah
everything this guy says is correct in
that article which I'll link to below
this video in that article I just point
out where PHP is really strong in terms
of industry again whenever I look at
coding languages whether programming
languages otherwise of considering the
business ramifications as well not just
the technical ramifications as I said
before all the languages out there all
the modern ones are pretty powerful and
they're all very capable all depends on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
