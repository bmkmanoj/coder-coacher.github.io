killer sights calm you hit the blog I've
I'm starting to write more articles and
the reason raising some articles because
sometimes I can better present an idea
in written form at any house so a couple
pieces entrepreneurs modern-day
entrepreneurs and I basically talk about
very quick how if you're going to be an
entrepreneur these days you have to as
an entrepreneur even if you're not going
to be writing code even if you're not
going to be involved in the the tech end
of it you have to be aware of your
technology options out there so just
about every business is going to need a
website as an example and if you are
business owner even if you're working
web designers web developer is any web
designers web developers here will tell
you when you're dealing with owners or
clients who don't know anything about
the web it's a lot more difficult to get
the site out because they don't know the
process they don't know what's possible
so you as a business owner as an
entrepreneur if you know the basics of
web design you know the business basics
of HTML and CSS just the basics not any
understand you know how the web kind of
works at a website's couldn't work
you're gonna be able to make much better
business decisions and that's gonna save
a lot of frustration with your web
designers and your web developers it's
gonna save your lives
headaches and you're gonna be able to
make better business decisions because
you'll know what's what's the whoa
what's doable what's not doable so this
goes beyond just the basics of building
website it has to do with understanding
social media how different social media
platforms can be used depending on the
type of business that you have for
instance Facebook was kind of general
purpose
whereas YouTube might be not so good for
a piping company but it might be good
for hair salon or something you get the
idea so is this something I just wrote
very quickly another thing I have a
guest post I get people who want to
guest posts on killer size because
killer size gets
I don't know if it's a million or two
billion page views a month now I have to
check haven't looked at the data
recently and so here we go three things
you should do if you want to start a
successful business interesting little
article the she put together Lucy and
somebody asked recently I think it was a
private message there's web flow spend
spell the end of web designers web flows
is an app that allows you to create
responsive web sites fairly easily
haven't used it but to me it's not the
end you're gonna see in time as you
develop your as the web development
develops as this tool sets get more
sophisticated the role of a web
professional the role of a web designer
of a web developer will change so as an
example what we had to do in the 1990s
the late 90s versus what happened in
2003 it was a huge shift in the skill
sets that web design web designers
needed and to certain extent web
developers and then again in 2012 about
there's another shift again in terms of
the skills not as big of a shift from
the 90s and early 2000s but still a
shift I for example flash flash died
outs flash developer as flash or
animation flash you know that was
technology totally disappeared and
that's not necessarily the best example
but you get the idea the point is that's
why I keep emphasizing the core
understanding the core foundations of
fundamentals of programming of coding
the fundamentals of what makes up the
web client versus the server the client
server model the request response cycle
all these things are universal and no
matter what tools come out whether it be
web flow or some new html5 gizmo or
whatever new language if you have your
fundamentals then everything else
becomes super easy so I discussed this
just briefly on this
in the article so if you check out again
killer sites go to the blog yes I am
encouraging people to check out the site
takes two second to click two seconds to
click over but I just gave you a
synopsis of what what I discussed in
these articles I'm gonna be posting more
and more here and you notice I'm
bringing in more of my entrepreneurial
background which twenty eight years
experience and I'm combining that with
my coding experience as well I want to
start I want to bring in both
perspectives so that you have a more
more well rounded skillset and
interpretation of things because I think
a lot of developers people are learning
to become developers a lot of them are
either looking to become freelancers or
they're looking to develop their own
apps develop their own weather be apps
or web apps or whatnot and it's very
important that you understand the
business end of things in both cases
even if you're working for a company if
you can understand how business people
think understand business considerations
it's gonna make you a better developer
all right that's it for now mo toxin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
