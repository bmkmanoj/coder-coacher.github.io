calm alright in this video I want to
talk about creating apps creating web
apps it's a short little video I was
having a conversation with a friend of
mine who works for a very large software
manufacturer and the subject of mobile
app creation came up now this company
has tons of mobile apps multi little two
dozen something like that quite a bit
and so the question I asked is what is
the breakdown the percentage between
using html5 based mobile apps where you
just basically create a responsive
website you know lots of CSS JavaScript
and away you go versus a native app
writing you know if you're ready for iOS
you use Swift or objective c or if
you're ready for Android you use java so
you know i figured it's probably eighty
twenty eighty percent web HTML five and
twenty percent iOS or native rather so
wonder what you think now before i get
him to the answer i was actually quite
surprised at what the percentage really
is not yet up stanton this is a very big
very big company very well-established
so it's kind of surprised by the answer
the answer is it was ninety-nine percent
html5 ninety nine percent and the reason
it is is because for the types of apps
that they deal which are business
oriented apps html5 did a great job and
going native was not required so let me
expand upon that first of all if you
want to take your html5 based apps and
have them work and have full access to
the hardware the underlying hardware of
your mobile devices so that you can
access the gyro meter and stuff like
that you have to use well you have to
use an intermediary framework so there's
but what I know of is something called
Cordova which is free you can use it
basically you know you can just drop
your html5 app in there and you can do
API calls right to your underlying
device now of course this is never going
to be as good as mobile if you want a
really super fast responsive type of app
if you want really really slick custom
graphics you're going to have to go
native that's Swift objective-c for iOS
that's java for Android but the fact of
the matter is for most apps out there
you don't you know you probably won't
see that big of a difference so and
that's what they say the out to be
honest with you I have not used Cordova
or these frameworks I looked at them but
I haven't used them so I don't really
have any comments from personal
experience which from this company which
is a huge company the fact that they use
html5 inside of Cordova 99% of the times
should tell you something about how
effective this is you know so you know
I've been talking about in a couple of
videos how you know writing apps for iOS
or writing apps for Android was not
going to be necessarily the best choice
in terms of programming environment to
learn now I'm a big advocate of learning
web technologies that's html5 css3
javascript and you know for back end i
am i'm a big proponent of PHP although i
can see some circumstances where you
might want to go javascript or perhaps
node will come into play although again
i have yet to explore that so i don't
want to you know pass judgment that but
that's the future of by the way it's
probably javascript and PHP going
forward but anyway so that's just a
curious little piece of information
again major software company one of the
biggest in the top ten in the world
ninety-nine percent of their apps are
actually html5 stuck inside of
Cordova rapper so that they don't have
to write for Android and then they don't
have to port and write for iOS it's the
only times they do that the only ties
with the right native is a when have an
app that is really just specifically
designed for a particular device soft in
writing just for iphone don't know you
know then they'll go native Orville
ready to try and ride will go native
again and maybe in the situation where
they really need some super fancy user
interface that would be hard to do with
html5 and the other web technologies
that's html5 css3 and JavaScript of
course and there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
