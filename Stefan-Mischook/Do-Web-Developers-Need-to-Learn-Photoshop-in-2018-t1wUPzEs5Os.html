couple questions that were put to me in
the private messaging don't worry your
names shall be anonymous so hey Steph my
name is I had a quick question for you
about freelance dev work if you got a
minute to land your advice I'll give you
two minutes
I'm currently a j s+ Python full stack
developer good skills but I'm brushing
up on my PHP and we're pressed so I can
start looking for my first freelance
clients do you find the code alone is
sufficient for most jobs or do you also
create graphics and work in the adobe
world eg Photoshop Illustrator etc in
other words do I need to take time
initially to learn how to create
graphics or is that just more of a
cherry on top of that that I can work on
as I go thanks for your help in advance
keep cranking out the videos first of
all yeah so you know your Jas and your
Python full stack fantastic now for you
to go into PHP WordPress I'm sure you're
finding it pretty easy right that's once
you know your basics then all the
languages and so on become pretty easy
to get into and I assume that you're
learning PHP WordPress cause you see
that's where the jobs are right that's
where the jobs are I would be doing
Python j/s full stack maybe if I was
doing startup work maybe I had a very
particular application where I wanted to
leverage some aspects of Python perhaps
that that I needed to work with perhaps
that you had an AI layer you want to
work with or something I don't know so
yeah so as typical when people actually
get out there in a real world they find
that PHP and WordPress
however boring it may be or seem to be
there's a huge amount of demand and as I
said before when you got tons of work
and you're making great money and you're
in huge demand also the work becomes
more fun anyhow so do you need to be
graphically inclined turn to creating
graphics for websites not really I don't
think so I think if you have the
WordPress seeming skills and the PHP
skills then you don't really need to
become an expert if Photoshop Pro Skater
anything like that these days
if you're working with clients chances
are there have they will have a local
already for their business in terms of
the aesthetics there's certain looks if
you will certain structures to user
interfaces and modern websites that we
know work now you know whether it be you
know banner based or top banner with one
or two columns this is the typical
layout so what I would suggest that you
do is when you first see your client you
sit down with them and you ask them
about the artwork do they have a logo do
they have a color scheme for their
business they might they might likely do
and based on those answers then you can
show them common template so we have a
two called layout we have the front page
we might go with panels etc etc so just
show you know some nice-looking
templates or show them some some nice
size say what sites do you like and then
you could take it from there you got to
try to look at the design aesthetic from
20,000 feet if you understand what it
means so that you can sort of see the
grid behind of a design and what you see
that the grid is as I said it's pretty
consistent
it's either panels based or it's maybe
one top pattern with left column and
right column usually the on your side
the left-hand column would be the main
content column on the right you have
your your menus items but again it can
be flipped whatever show the client raw
templates so they can take a look at
that and then what you would do is then
have them provide photos or
or imagery related to their particular
business so know the days of having to
be a graphic designer in terms of web
development are long gone it's good to
understand basic design principles like
alignment no more than two fonts per
page use a white space I like to
describe white space I've for many years
I describe it to people as breathing
room you want to give your sight
breathing room again simple clean layout
with nice-looking images nice-looking
photos that don't require major work or
preparation is the key to success with
these websites if you need to do some
image prep then you could either partner
with somebody on that hire somebody on
that they may be able to provide that
but the need for high end Photoshop work
and illustrator work this is like old
school went designed that you don't see
too much these things I hope that makes
sense so know that short answer is no
don't worry about it just do it
underneath tender basis the more
valuable skill set is your back-end
coatings knowledge that is for sure that
is for sure
big time your ability to write code
implement WordPress add plugins lock it
down strip up a theme etc that's what a
huge value is and you could just they
may have a graphic designer I mean Oh
graphic designer we just you know prep a
couple images really quickly again
modern day graphic
excuse me modern a web design doesn't
require photoshop skills I get used to
for the most part next question I stat
first of all well done thank you for
your vlogs the information knowledge is
shares antastic the reason writing
excuse me the reason for writing this
message is your opinion in choosing a
specialization for a job for a living a
little bit about me I'm 40 years old
live in Europe working in logistics
industry for at least 15 years lately I
took my university degree in computer
science trying to make a career change
towards the IT field as you know a
degree in C has a little bit of
everything
math algorithms network ila tryouts
visual very basic knowledge is some
programming language like C SQL PHP HTML
CSS Python GS and some project
management etc having no real work
experience or internships it seems very
hard to apply for jobs so I decided to
specialize in one specific field thing
and master iam that's a good strategy
being 40 years old doesn't let me being
40 years old doesn't let me a lot of
choices as I speak from the aspect of
time the choices that came in my mind in
web development or big data with
analytics I know it's a matter of
personal taste but I asked for your
opinion in that what would you choose
any other suggestions thanks in advance
for your efforts when I read some of
these emails people are just typing out
quick messages sometimes they don't
proofread sometimes English is a second
language so and sometimes I just mess up
as I'm reading it so my apologies but I
think we all understand what the
question is so he wants to know at his
age whether he should get into the web
development field or big data analytics
if you're doing bait that big data
analytics that's assumes you have a
scientific background you have a
background working I'm just shaking
working at a logistics industry for 15
years it's not precise enough for me I'm
not sure what that means
logistics I don't know if you would have
the background to be able to analyze big
data so when you get into big data
you're getting to data sciences there's
a need that you're gonna have to have
supporting skill sets that go with that
right so if you're doing data sciences
you have to understand their sciences
before you can start writing the code to
process all this data and what imagine
the same thing is with big data
analytics perhaps you have to look into
that now that being said I think the
major issue is about with big data
analytics you're going to be looking for
a job working for larger corporations I
would imagine or businesses
that do big data analytics I don't think
they would be hiring freelancers to do
that although I have not looked into
that there really doubt it I think this
is a job this is a career path if you
will that requires or ends with you
getting a job which is cool there's a
lot of advantages to that on the other
hand if you do web development you have
the flexibility of both getting it to
freelance being a hired gun or go
working for a web developer studio
though web development has been around
for Allura since the my knees it's still
huge lots of demand for it and that's
not going away anytime soon and you know
before you start thinking web
development so that's real to you 15
years is relative a year 15 20 years
rather for any type of business or
industry so it's still pretty early
stages in that regard although the role
of a web developer as i've mentioned
other vlogs has changed over the years
in the 90s is very design centric lots
of Photoshop work kalasa illustrator
work and then in the early 2000s it
became much more coding front-end coding
and then later on it became front-end
coding with usability you had to become
very good with usability not just the
user interface and way look but also
usability became much more involved in
it was always there but the web
professional over time separated more
and more from a traditional graphic
artists role to give you a little backup
background knowledge on this in the
early days most of the web designers
were graphic designers who were doing
web design on the site so they just kind
of looked at the aesthetic the visual
appeal of a site they didn't get into
usability they didn't get into
functional layout it was all very it was
experimental a lot of web sites were
just brochures online but as the
industry matured and as the technology
became more advanced search in web
design technology and web development
technology
the graphic designer role as a web
designer slowly grew further and further
apart whereas now very separate things
so the great front-end or professional
front-end web developer they they're
very they're not only schooled in the
coding this html5 css3 and JavaScript
but the Alice understand usability or
they also understand user interface
design they also understand how to make
these designs responsive and functions
something like graphic designers don't
ever touch on something that 1990s web
devout designers barely ever touch on
any of these things so coming back from
my tangent web design as a career versus
data big data analytics it's as you said
it's a personal choice thing I think
with the web development stack you're
gonna have more flexibility in the type
of jobs and work that you can do more
different types of companies big
companies small companies doing
freelance work setting up at your own
web design studio or web development
studio so you have that flexibility with
the Web Design where's big data you're
looking at more likely than not working
for very large organizations which has
its own pros and cons but you you have
less flexibility there so it depends
what you want to do depends what you
want to do I think it's flexibility
versus perhaps working for large
organizations but with the big data you
have to look into that they may require
if you have some sort of supporting
skill set a degree to go along with that
but you said you you you are doing CS
your CS degree C that's the thing with a
lot of the universities they trying to
expose you a lot of university programs
they're trying to expose a whole bunch
of different things and then as you will
learn once or you already know if you're
in the field you really learn your craft
getting in there right doing the work
and working with what clients and
building actual projects and stuff but
again let me emphasize before
you get into project building you should
do your foundation your core training
first that's why I structure my studio
of course is that way it speeds up the
whole process of learning and it will
just make you a much better programmer
much more quickly so yeah so that is my
two cents on that all right this is an
unusual question from two weeks ago it's
a question about boxing so I mean just
when you can shut it off now if you
don't want to hear the answer but this
is interesting I haven't read this yet
but I'm going to read it I've had a
restrictive isolated upbringing my
father's a control freak as a result of
this I've always suppress my emotions
they become depressed and though I would
still be able to go for the go on in
life but I hit some plateau I peaked in
depression I just couldn't focus anymore
in school I quit college three times
started looking for an alternative route
at the same time five years ago and I
came to know about Floyd Mayweather and
his style of fighting and resonated a
lot with me so I became very interested
in passionate about studying the style
elusive slips slicks sharp smooth
defensive
yeah Floyd is a master boxer master
boxer if you're not into boxing if
you're not into the art of boxing Floyd
style could look really boring because
he's so slick and he's doing all kinds
of subtleties with his body positioning
and so forth that if you're a boxer if
you have a boxing background you can
appreciate anything wow this guy's
really good but if you're not into the
sport you don't understand it can look
kind of boring but yeah if you're gonna
be a boxer fight like Floyd you don't
wanna get your head bashed in the
problem is that because of my
restrictive up ring yet I got some
anxiety which overstates my fear of
brain damage
I am constantly second doubting decision
to box or not I will shadow box and tell
myself yes I'm gonna do it the moment
then moments later I will see some
brutal sparring on the internet and with
one kid totally destroying the other I
think this is just brutal it is brutal
and when you see that as because you got
a jerk of a coach and a jerk of a print
a training partner
training partners are there to help you
develop as a fighter not to beat the
hell out of you
doesn't mean it can't be stiff good
strong fighting but when you're a
beginner and you're sparring you should
be not trying to knock each other's
heads off you should be trying to work
out the technique and flow there's got
to be some contact and as you become
more and more advanced they should
become better it's gonna get more
serious but again you should inspire to
try to destroy your opponent you're
there to learn you're your sparring it's
a training it's a type of training
although pressure putting pressure is a
huge part of the training but don't
knock each other's heads off so if you
have a jerk let's just try to knock your
head off don't fail with it because
you're not gonna you know you'll get
something out of it but you're gonna get
you know you're gonna get hit
unnecessarily another thing don't be an
idiot wear a head head gear when you
spar wear a mouthpiece I see some tough
guys who decide to not gonna wear
headgear but the world's best fighters
the Tyson's and the Ollie's and the
Mayweather's and even the sluggers when
they train they wear headgear and then
wear 16-ounce gloves you know so to
protect their hands and to protect your
partners from you know getting dis cuts
and serious damage again their training
partners not training opponents so if
you see a school where this is
destroying each other and the coach lets
that happen don't load it at school
because you're not gonna learn well
you'll learn but you're gonna get
unnecessarily brutalized for no good
reason but that being said when you're
boxing it's boxing you're not playing
badminton and I got my nose broken two
times boxing because it has sheis things
happen Kamiya kids you know get in there
boom boom boom and you know punches are
flying and it wasn't malicious it just
happened I was sparring you know a
really serious fighter at the time and I
was still learning my craft and I just
made stupid mistakes but I was unusual I
I didn't see too many people getting
into those broke so but somebody
considered but you can get headgear that
will protect you but it makes it harder
to breathe with that kind of
head gear this thing you know so let me
finish that mostly I was see some brutal
spy on the internet on the internet with
one kid totally destroy any other and I
think this is brutal I am NOT going to
do this or I might think boxing is only
for the intellectually misfortunate and
society all kinds of thoughts I've been
in the boxing gym on four or five
occasions
what discouraged me is that I would get
a mild headache that lasted for a few
days every time after spine move yeah I
went to the doc he said it wasn't
anything serious but I thought maybe
that was assignment bodies tell me I'm
not built for it I have pretty small
skull please give me some advice well if
you're getting headaches already then I
would probably refrain from boxing
boxing that means you're getting hit in
the head you may want to change your
style if you can not get hit so much I
was kind of like a boxer puncher type I
didn't get hit too often and I would
always move and slip and slide but if
you get and I never got headaches but if
you're getting headaches already you
know the brain is a thing you don't want
to damage its it you better to damage
your hands your knees not that that's
fun but the brain is the last thing you
want to mess up so if you're already
getting headaches there's other ways
that you can work out your your
aggressions other ways you can calm your
mind you might want to try judo Jiu
Jitsu you know try stuff that doesn't
walk your hand if if I was going to
whack anything the last thing you want
to whack his two head because it's the
brain you know you don't want to mess
with your brain and you seem like oh
like a smart guy well-written and yeah
so don't don't smack your head out
especially if you're starting to get
headaches already I would say try
another sport that doesn't damage your
brain or or maybe spiral with sparring
partners where you agree not to like
each other very hard if they say you
know you're you're a or something
because you don't want to take shots at
a head
you know let's forget about it they're
idiots because you know you're gonna box
for X number of years I don't know if
you wanted to come pro or not chances
are even if you come pro 80% of
professional fighters get brain damage
that's one of reasons I think
I decided not to go pro as a fighter
because one of the reasons anyways
because I don't want to get brain
damaged I said you know what I might
have some ability but there's an 80%
chance I'm gonna wind up with some
permanent damage so it's not worth it
because the boxing career is done you
know if you're lucky in your 40s that's
the oldest you can get I don't know how
young you are but then you've got many
more years in terms of professional life
lifes I was talking to one of my uncle's
who was actually a very high level
basketball player he was one of the best
in Canada in a day in like 10-15 years
after his career I would run into people
who had recognized my last name its age
you know blah blah blah and he was a
type of guy he would score I think was
average 33 or 33 33 to 34 points per
game so he was really good but what
happened when he was 18 or 19 he was
going for the Olympics some guy jumped
on his back and destroyed his spine and
so I asked him a few years back I said
uncle I said you know if she had to do
it over again would you do the
basketball again and you know this guy
was a newspaper all clippings and he was
pretty pretty pretty big you know for
that time anyway and he said no he said
because for a few years of fame fleeting
Fame it wasn't a huge star anything but
a few years of glory will say he says he
has permanent painters or hands from you
know permanent back problems to him it
wasn't worth it so he was actually one
of the reasons why I decided not to take
the boxing to the next level because I
got to a point with my boxing where if I
wanted to go to the next level I had to
go like full-time like they couldn't had
to go hardcore and to become a
professional athlete you have to become
like a warrior monk that's all you can
do in terms of diets in terms of your
sleeping habits everything so I wasn't
willing to to do that and I wasn't going
to get brain damage and then when I got
my nose straight in to help trust me it
so crooked now but it was far worse
before when I got my nose straightened
out they had to break in to three places
two or three anything was
and the doctor said the surgeon said no
more boxing for you knows you know
pretty weak at this point so I said I
forget I'm ugly enough not gonna do it
so all right long story
that's long to finish off this long
story if you're getting headaches I
would suggest not doing it so much
anymore or maybe asking your sparring
partners to not smash your head in
it's not necessary to take a heart
beating now yeah light light hits and
stuff whatever but if you are getting
hit with light hits and stuff your
body's telling you something but if you
guys are folks hey listen you know don't
lock my head off we're being nice here
we're trying to learn technique right
because if you guys try to knock your
head off
and knock you out first you know first
of all that's not a great way to fight
but it's hard to practice those tricky
techniques and stuff if you're always
worried you're gonna get your head
knocked off that's why I use parting
partners or partners you know you want
to get it you know you want to get some
shots because you want it to be you know
some why some what's realistic but you
want to be able to train some of those
interesting slips and those moves and
you won't be able to train them properly
if you just worry about the guys always
gonna try and rip your head off right so
keep that in mind that's my advice you
know health is much more important I
rather be as might one of my expressions
I rather be healthy and poor I rather be
healthy and poor then sick and rich I'd
rather be healthy and poor than sick and
rich in fact I have some friends of mine
who were bike couriers their entire
lives you know I just did bike courier
bubble type guys but you know what
they're like they're much older than me
Eric in her late 50s some of these guys
friends of friends you know and they're
super healthy because they biked their
entire careers every day's five days a
week
super healthy and I know these 50 old
guys got money and their constant pain
and overweight dinner having health
problems meanwhile this poor dude a
couple of them they biked over place
their little bike 30 miles and they're
like in their late 50s no problem for
them so
personally I rather be the healthy
poorer biker guy than the rich guy who's
got all kinds of heart problems and all
kinds of other health problems so yeah
don't don't destroy your body because
you only have one and that brain once
you damage it can't be repaired</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
