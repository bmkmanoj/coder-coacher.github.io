JavaScript variables let's start off by
part 2 by reviewing a couple of things
now I wrote this out in my summer here
and I'm just going to read and comment
on a few things and then we'll get back
into code quickly so we know that
variables are virtual containers to hold
information and you know that we need to
create variables to hold information
because for anything to happen on a
computer really it has to be placed into
memory and you remember memory is RAM
that's why when you buy more memory for
your computer the computer runs faster
because it's able to stick stuff and
memory and more stuff and memory faster
it goes you see in the old days with
more primitive programming languages a
programmer had to manually stick the
information the data into specific spots
in memory this is a long and tedious
process that brings a whole new meaning
to hyper annular okay that was badly
different delivered but you have to
understand programming was really a much
more geeky thing in the past when you
didn't have the ability to create
variables on the fly as you can with
javascript so we can understand when you
use the VAR keyword in Java Script
basically you're automating the process
variables automate the process for you
you just create a variable and stick
information JavaScript takes care of all
the dirty details and of course the
creative variable and JavaScript you
need to use the keyword var followed by
the name you want to give it so let's
jump back into some code so we've seen
this before so let's look at a few
things now you notice here in my
examples let me just organize this code
a little bit better i created a
variables first and then down here i
assign them now this is like a very old
school way well it's not an old school
way this is kind of in covering way of
doing it you could actually just do this
you can declare variable and when use
the VAR keyword and you give it a name
that you create a variable near its call
that declaring a variable so when you
declare variable you can do it
at the same time as you give it a value
so let's go our first name and last name
of course so see I've minimize the
amount of code we needed and just to
make sure everything works fine we
reload when we see it out of that alert
pop up as we did here we know our codes
working pretty good another reason why
we know our code is working pretty good
let me just remove that yeah right bang
boom internet explorer displays or
higher for us okay and we get no alert
box because the code screwed up along
the way right so put that back in
everything should work a fine there we
go so to get back to it as you can see
you can declare variable and declaring
the variable just basically means use
the far keyword and add a name for the
variable and you can give it a value on
one line you don't have to do it on two
lines as it did before let's look at
variable names now you notice when I
create a variable I didn't have a space
like this I can't have vara first name
because as far as Java scripts concerned
this space makes it well screws it up
unto your lotus we got our error again
right and well let's just look at that
ever a little bit more closely see line
14 character 11 air expected semicolon
so let me look at that again you see
when you have a space line 14 it's
expecting a semicolon here because we
know space that tell jokes would figures
you're starting something new to be
declaring it of a variable or whatnot so
it's expecting this but in fact it
matters which you should take away from
this is that you don't want to space in
your variable names it has to be either
touching little space or you can use
something like an underscore that works
two variables can have
lowercase and uppercase is all works but
what I would suggest you keep it all
lowercase you can start there you can
start variables with text and you can
start it out with no number you see
that's not going to work javascript
doesn't want numbers for the gang of a
variable so we'll just refresh that
again Bing cy14 character 5 x 14
character 12345 see it doesn't like that
no numbers the beginning of variables
probably can do this so you can put a
number in after the first letter but
your first letter of your variable names
have to be text okay it can't be numbers
can't be special symbol I guess it could
be a dollar sign it can't be that symbol
can't beat it symbol just to be safe
when you create a variable just make
sure it starts with a letter make sure
there's no spaces in between them and
all special weird characters get out
cause problems as well so yeah if you
want to create spaces between your
variable names like first names was
clear you can put an underscore in a way
to go yes these are nerdy details I know
but I'm trying to make your life easier
another thing you can do you can also
put in one separate lines you can put
them all on one line if you want to a
little harder to read see what's on CH
this oh we got a problem first name on
the flowers go ok ah it's because the
alert sealer is looking for first name
without our underscore right and because
I put in an underscore this is now a
different variable name and this so to
solve that error we're having before is
go first name let's see makes your last
name last name okay but say that reload
rock and roll alright so you notice how
i was able to declare the variables all
in one line that's important that i have
the semicolon after each variable
creation or declaration makes no
difference now see I don't need to have
space they can have it all squished up
because when javascript sees the
semicolon that's like a period so it
knows that we're starting a new
statement when after the period remember
each of these things geez lines is
considered statement so that's where
these semicolons come in now this is
cool having it all on one line because
it saves space but it can get hard to
read so i recommend that i need to
create your variables you put them on
separate lines like this it's much
cleaner easier to read there's a a lot
about variables i'm not going to cover
in this first video because my goal is
to get moving along as quickly as
possible so one last thing we can do is
we can actually add variables together
you know so we did it down here in the
alert but we can actually do it up here
so we can go number let's go yupz we go
we'll say the last name is equal to
first name plus number let's see what
happened to their there it worked say
Nick Nick six how did that happen so you
go the alert is basically printing out
whatever value we have stored in these
variables we have the variable first
name we added a space so it's nice and
clear and we have the variable last name
so we know the last name is Miss Chuck
and we know the first name is well we
know the last name was Miss Chuck and
but when we loaded our script here it
says Nick and Nick 6e that's the fruit
that's the second variable mix six right
second variable last name so why is we
declared the variable last name to have
the value to hold the value of Miss
Chuck but for some reason it came out
Nick six why because we changed it here
now let's take the last name variable
and what's actually put in the values
the first name first name is Nick plus
the whatever value is being held in the
variable number which was six right
that's what we had Nick 61 so let's see
if we change this to 22 and let's
refresh that Nick Nick 22 or we could
change it to some text again if you
recall to make it text in JavaScript we
need to put the text in between quilts
like this so let's preview that Nick and
Nick Jimmy fish so we learned something
new now we just learned that we can
actually replace information about in
variables with other information this
type of stuff comes in really handy when
we're getting deeper into javascript
there's a lot more about JavaScript
variable so we could get into but we
have enough now more than enough now to
be able to proceed with our other
practical JavaScript lessons so we'll
get back to variables at a later time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
