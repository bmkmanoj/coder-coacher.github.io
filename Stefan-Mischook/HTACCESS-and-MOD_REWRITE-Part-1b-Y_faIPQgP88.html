examples I'm going to pull from the
forum post and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to simply copy and paste this
and I'm going to create a comment for
each of the different cases that we're
going to be covering so we want to
rewrite this URL to this
so just to be clear the way mod regret
works is it looks for a specific pattern
in the URL so in this case in this
particular example that I'm going to be
writing in a second it's going to be
looking for login if it finds it behind
the scenes not visible to the end user
in the browser the server is going to go
ahead and display the contents of this
file and what that means is that using
mod rewrite we can basically make our
URLs anything we want as long as it
matches the pattern the server is smart
enough to automatically display the
correct content so I'm going to go ahead
and finish up the last couple examples
that I want to show you today at least
the comments for them so you did the
first one this is a second
and this is the third okay so I'm gonna
go ahead and delete all this save it and
let's start working on our first move
mod rewrite line so as I mentioned a
minute ago like up here with the syntax
this rule is going to start with rewrite
rule then we're gonna use a pattern and
this is done with regular expressions
hopefully you have at least a faint
familiarity with regular expressions but
if not that's fine I'll try to explain
things as best I can
we're gonna start with this character
which is shift 6 on your keyboard if
you're not really familiar with using
that this indicates the start to the
pattern that we want to match and then
I'm going to use a dollar sign to
indicate the end of the pattern that we
want to match so this is important for
example because let's say I do this this
pattern by itself at the moment will
only match test however if we remove the
ending dollar sign it could match test
one or two whatever you want so these
characters are important to eliminate
eliminating delineating excuse me the
beginning and end of a pattern that we
want to match
so I'm gonna put that back in and the
pattern that we want to match here is
login and just in case the user decides
to add an ending slash I'm going to do
slash and a question mark think so
and this question mark indicates that
the preceding character in this case the
slash is optional so the user may
include it or it may not
either way the pattern will match so
this is the pattern the server is going
to look for and if it finds it it's
going to automatically display the
contents for index.php question mark
action equals login and then after that
we want to use two flags and those
you've displayed within brackets like so
and flags are one or two uppercase
characters the first one I'm going to
use is MC which stands I'm not sure what
if it stands for exactly but it
indicates that the pattern that we're
matching is case insensitive so login
all lowercase will work and login all
uppercase will work so I'm that's pretty
important and the second flag that I'm
going to use which is separated by a
comma is L and that indicates that this
is the last rewrite rule that's going to
be used so if the pattern is matched
it's going to rewrite it to this URL and
it's going to end so this means that it
won't continue to further down the file
potentially matching other rules and
specifically about flags there are
several we're actually quite a few flags
that can be used I'm not going to cover
all of them I'm just going to cover the
two or three that I think are especially
useful and feel free to suit search
Google or take a look at some of the
resource links I'm going to talk about
at the end of this screencast and have a
look at exactly what you can do with
flags
so I'm going to go ahead and save this
file and I believe everything is good to
go
here so I'm going to go back to my index
dot PHP and I'm going to tweak this file
a little bit just so we can test this so
I'm going to start with an if statement
and I'm going to check if the action
variable within the URL is set so if it
is set we're going to display it in the
browser so echo I'm not show it to
action and then if it's not set
I do action echo action actually need to
do that I'm gonna do none okay so I'm
gonna save it and let's do a quick
preview okay so this is index.php you'll
notice by default action as none so
let's quickly test this and you'll
notice the page changes and action is
test so that's working correctly so now
let's go ahead and try our mod rewrite
rule and make sure it's working let's
put in login you notice we automatically
display the correct file and the login
action displays within the page so we
know that I rewrite rule is working
correctly it's seeing the login and it's
transferring us to the correct page and
if for example let's try something else
let's try a test you'll notice it's not
found it only matches this specific rule
and on those last little test let's try
with an ending slash know if that works
as well so like I said earlier this
question mark indicates that the slash
is optional</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
