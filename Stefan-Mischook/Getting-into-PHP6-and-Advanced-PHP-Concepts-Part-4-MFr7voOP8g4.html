comm and today what I'm gonna be doing
is building on the Auto loading tutorial
that we did in the last well the last in
this series and we're going to be
looking at how we can deal with magic
methods which are really cool relatively
new feature in PHP and how we can use
magic methods to cut down a lot of
redundant code in our application so I'm
gonna start off by just cleaning up what
we did in the last video which is going
to come up later on but for now I'm just
going to delete the KP controllers test
class and also in our application path
we don't need to specify this second
include path so I'm just going to delete
that as well and of course all of this
source code is available you can
download it on killer PHP com if i
refresh this again i'll just get get
name John Smith so that's working and
what I'm going to be doing now is
looking at actually if we we can now
change this so instead of using com
killer PHP skp I'll just do killer PHP
backslash models as models and here I'm
just going to specify models okay
now typically speaking if you have a
class you'll find that there's a lot of
time spent writing getters and setters
now I get her in a setter I'm gonna give
you a quick example of that so let's say
I've got this user class here I can
create a function or a a property called
address so what you're seeing is you're
seeing something that's actually
protected it's a variable that can't be
accessed outside of the scope of this
particular user object and so if I want
to set this address I can't just go into
my index dot PHP file here
I'm just gonna comment this out and go
user address equals I don't know let's
say I live close to the Eiffel Tower I
if I try and do this it'll say cannot
access protected property because it's
protected that's exactly what a
protected property is so often one of
the advantages of object-oriented
programming is this idea called
encapsulation basically we hide data and
we hide variables from other classes so
that we have a very clear interface into
what can be set and what can't be set
inside of an object however there is you
know a set of classes out there called
data transfer objects or sometimes
they're called business objects or value
objects where we're basically using the
object as a way of storing a bunch of
data about something and a user object
is a good example of this where we have
a user maybe they have a first name and
a last name and an address and a phone
number and all sorts of other kinds of
bits of variable data and we want that
all to be associated with that user so
in this case instead of just saying
address you know Eiffel Tower in the you
know typically you would do something
like create a public function called set
address and you would take in the
address as a variable and then you would
say this address is equal to address and
I would go here and I would say set
address and this should work and if I
want to get the address I would do echo
user get address and then here I would
have to create a public function called
get a dress and I would return this
address and I would get Eiffel Tower
this seems a little silly at this point
because we're just putting stuff in and
getting stuff out but oftentimes you'll
find yourself setting
getting variable data and if you've got
a class hierarchy where you've got
different objects that are inheriting
from other objects it's quite common
that you'll be using getters and setters
as they're called as a way of dealing
with basically the the objects that are
inherited from various super classes so
if we think about this idea of a model
before we go any further I'm gonna talk
a little bit about what a model is so
that we can see how we can abstract this
concept a model in the MVC framework
usually deals with saving or persisting
data so if you have a view which I'm
just going to pull up a diagram of MVC
here so here's a very simple diagram of
MVC this is what you would call
traditional NBC now NBC is a design
pattern and what that means is that it's
essentially a pattern of constructing an
application in a way that you've
separated out what needs to be saved the
data in this case we would call that the
model the controller which dispatches
requests and what that means is that
when you want to have a user access a
particular part of your website you
would have them hit the controller
object and the controller object would
figure out where to go and what to do
and then lastly you have the view which
basically renders any kind of data that
would be coming from the model so we're
gonna actually be writing some of this
code ourselves and looking at this whole
pattern in the last video we created
this user object and we stored it in the
model now if we go back to the user
object we can see that basically it's
just setting in getting data associated
with a particular user in this imaginary
system if this was a production
environment you might also have a
function called save or insert or delete
and what this would do is this would
actually save the data in a database so
let's take that aside for now because
there's plenty of frameworks out there
that'll automate this
but let's look more at the architecture
of you know autoloading or sari of using
magic methods to get inset various bits
of data so the first thing I want to do
is I want to look at a magic method and
magic methods typically start with two
underscores and this one we're gonna
delete get name for now we'll revisit
that in a minute this one is going to be
called it's going to be a public
function and it's going to be called
call and call takes in a name and it
takes a collection of arguments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
