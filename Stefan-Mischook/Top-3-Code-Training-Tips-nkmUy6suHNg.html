make learning how to code much much
easier whether it be html5 and css3 or
whether it be a full programming
language like PHP Java Python whatever
pick pick it these three tips apply I
may have mentioned these in other vlogs
I'm not sure frankly because I put a lot
of information into these vlogs so this
is going to be a short vlog specific to
these three tips that's it so tip number
one write notes write handwritten notes
specifically when you are either
watching a video reading book whatever
however you are learning how to code I
strongly suggest that you take hand
written notes so I I get what these
cheaper one dollar notebooks and I take
notes all the time why should you take
handwritten notes versus just doing the
videos like most people would do the
reason is is because by taking a
handwritten note you are going to commit
the lessons to memory much more easily
much more quickly meaning you're going
to be able to remember the stuff that
you're learning much more easily why is
that because the brain takes in
information through our senses you know
sight sound touch taste smell the more
senses that you can activate during a
particular experience the more your
brain is going to see that this
particular experience is important and
it's going to associate it's going to
create a stronger memory in your brain
that's a simple psychology so when you
watch a video for instance you're seeing
and you're hearing so you're activating
two senses by taking a note and holding
a pen and writing on a paper you're
activating your sense of touch so you're
adding another sensory input to anchor
that memory in your brain there's other
things you can do as well but just by
taking notes you may not even have to
review the notes but I'm telling you if
you take notes as you are
pause the video taken out pause the
video take a note you're going to see
how it's going to make learning how to
code much much easier tip number two in
learning how to code is that you should
get to writing code as quickly as
possible there is something about
writing code don't make the mistake I've
made in the past where I spent a couple
weeks a month reading about coding
trying to understand the principles
intellectually by reading about code
what you should be doing is actually
coding as soon as possible even if the
code that you're writing you don't
understand folding you may only
understand half of it write it anyway
because a strange things happens when
you actually write code it actually
triggers the brain once again to want to
put more efforts probably when you're
sleeping or in your back your mind some
process I don't know what it is it's
going to help you to learn how to code
much more quickly than you would
otherwise and what you'll find is the
more you code the quicker the concepts
behind the code are going to become
understandable to you I've experienced
this myself when I was learning how to
called way back in the day was something
interesting I got this principle of
jumping into the practical end of
something in this case coding from my
martial arts background what I
discovered many years ago that one
sparring session six minute sparring
session one six to eight minute sparring
session was worth more than months of
training and doing pad were doing drills
doing heavy bag work in the case of
boxing for instance so actual sparring
getting in there and mixing it up was
worth so much more than doing
theoretical exercises and sure enough I
applied that principle in martial arts
and it worked in coding rather from my
martial arts by writing real code you're
going to learn much more quickly that's
why my courses in right away the first
day really students are actually writing
code right away it's such an important
thing to do and tip number three when
learning how to code
would be prepared to make mistakes
coding reading code coding programming
is a process filled with errors and if
you're nervous about making errors like
a lot of people are that will slow you
down in terms of learning how to code
don't be nervous about making errors
even the best programmers in the world
are constantly making errors it's why
all these professional tools these IDE Z
into integrated development environments
have all these tools built in to help
you deal with errors because it is
normal we're dealing with a lot of
complexity when we're coding even with
the simpler languages and so a lot of
mistakes can be introduced it's just
normal that's why we have many versions
of apps we have Windows 10 in iOS 9 or
is it at ten hundred oh okay there's two
reasons why we have new versions of
operating systems or new versions of
languages number one reason is because
we want to add new features so there's
Windows 10 because there's a lot of new
features there's Mac OS 10 because
there's a lot of new features but
another reason why you have new versions
of operating systems or new versions of
programming languages like you have as
jabba's out what I don't know what is
that now 1.7 or I haven't looked at job
in years or PHP is that PHP 7 Python set
at Python 3 3.5 to last I checked reason
you have these new versions is because
they're correcting problems and older
versions especially when you have the
the sub number so if you have Python for
instance so you have Python 3.5 Y point
5 well not because necessarily they are
adding new features they're probably
doing bug fixes they're probably doing
some minor architectural fix especially
when you have subset of numbers here's
3.5 point to that point 2 typically is
because they're fixing bugs so even the
most experienced programmers coders in
the world they're going to be making
mistakes all the time so you as somebody
who's learning house you have to accept
and expect that you're going to make
mistakes so don't get 2 more try not to
get too flustered or too anxious
or or impatient when you make mistakes
as you were learning how to code it's
just par for the course I know it's easy
easier said than done I'm the type of
guys once in a while I admit I've
screamed at my computer because things
were working usually not because of bad
code I've written although that's
happened we're especially dealing with
early beta versions of.net a long time
ago where you wrote the code and things
didn't work you're like why is it test
walking and you get all angry and you
get frustrated but you can understand
that's part of process and the calmer
you can stay in those situations in all
situations in life really the calmer you
can stay the more easily you're going to
solve the problem when I used to box one
of the things we were taught by my coach
it was highly accomplished fighter used
to say what you want to do to get the
fighter off his game
you want to invoke some sort of emotion
in them you either want to get them
angry at you or you want to get them
scared of you one or the other both are
good because when they're angry or
they're scared they're going to make
stupid mistakes and it's going to be
harder for them to figure out your
weaknesses so one of the things they
always we were taught to do is to stay
calm at all costs to stay calm but to
get them flustered get them angry get
them scared get them anxious get them
impatient and that gave you an advantage
as a fighter over them and that's why
you see before fights it's partly the
self self of five but you see a lot of
fighters there's a lot of insults
running around sometimes it's fake but
sometimes they're really trying to get
under the skin of the other fighter to
throw them off their game so when you're
learning how to code don't throw
yourself off your game by getting
emotional about getting angry or getting
frustrated try to stay calm and if you
come to a situation when you're trying
to learn something in coding and it's
just not working out take a break
walk away do something else typically
the day later or two days later or
whatever four days later it will come to
you and you go ah now I understand so
just that's it those are my my three
tips on how to code I hope you find them
useful
