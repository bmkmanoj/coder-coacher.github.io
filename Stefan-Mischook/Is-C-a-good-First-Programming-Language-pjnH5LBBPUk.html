language before I get into it I want to
mention something called bug replay it's
a browser plugin slash service used for
software testers for web apps click on
the button captures video not only video
of what's going on a screen but also all
the browser environmental variables
basically everything about a web
developer needs this is a sponsored
endorsement wanted a very maybe the
first on YouTube so if you want to learn
more click on a link below alright is
C++ a good first programming language in
a nutshell I would say no and before you
C++ as Ehlert's out there go crazy I'm
not attacking C++ C++ is a very powerful
language it has many uses it's very
relevant you check out my other videos
on it I don't disparage C++ in any way
but the question is is not a question of
whether or not C++ is a good language is
whether or not it's a good language for
the new beginner programmer and it's not
in my humble opinion as an educator for
many years now
because it's very complex there's a lot
of things that you have to manage in C++
that you don't have to manage in other
languages like Python like JavaScript
like PHP like Swift like Ruby now you
can argue with C++ you're going to be
learning more about the guts if you will
of the computers but the fact that it
matter is most developers are using high
level languages these days meaning
languages that are not as complex as C++
mmm you got this don't don't get me
wrong there's a lot of jobs in C++ which
is a lot more programmers collectively
doing Java JavaScript Python PHP Swift
and Java work without all about extra
headaches with C++ gives you again this
is a question of an educational choice
as a tool the language C++ as a tool of
Education
so because C++ is complex I
would go with other languages as the
first programming language like Python
etc now you say to yourself well I want
to learn C++
why would I learn Python doesn't make
any sense well that's because 90% of
modern-day programming languages all
share the same principles and techniques
core core core techniques and core
principles core concepts so when you
learn Python you basically be gonna be
learning
90% of what C++ is all about when you
learn JavaScript same thing and so when
you learn Python it's much more
approachable it's much easier to learn
so you can learn all these concepts are
much easier way so if you wanted to get
to C++ Python is in fact the easier the
better route or JavaScript or even PHP
and it's just a training process it's
kind of like if you want to teach
somebody how to ski you don't put them
on the triple black diamond super hard
hill and push him down the slope and say
you're gonna be closer to the mountain
no you put them on the bunny slopes you
teach them the basics and then once they
get comfortable with that they can move
on into the more the harder at the heart
of Hills right same thing you got to
think of C++ because it has a lot of
power in a run super fast it with that
power comes complexity and you have to
have a deeper knowledge of things so if
you want to learn C++ learn Python first
learn JavaScript first we'll learn Swift
first learn PHP first learn Java first
in terms of complexity in terms of ease
of learning I would say that something
like a Python it's amongst the easiest
or JavaScript PHP and then you know Ruby
what else is there Swift and then on top
of that you would have something like a
little bit more complex than Java
because with Java you have to do more
things you have to be mindful and aware
of more things than you do in languages
like JavaScript and Python if you're a
coder if you're a programmer I'm talking
about the fact that you have to be
explicit in your type declarations in
Java you don't have to be
and in the other languages in Python and
so on and then on top of Java
what's even more complex of course is
C++ so if you want to get to C++ again
go through these other languages so my
opinion as an educator the quickest way
to learning C C++ is to start with a
basic of language a simpler language at
first that's it now don't get me wrong
if you renew don't think just because
Python is simpler
Java is simpler PHP is simpler
JavaScript super it doesn't mean that
they are inferior or there's less jobs
or less money to be made or less
productive in fact most modern
programming these days are done with
these higher-level languages because
they're more productive much in the same
way that furniture makers don't go and
cut down their own trees anymore they go
to the lumber place and they get the
mill they get the wood all milled
already to build their furniture not the
perfect analogy but now I hope it
conveys the general message and meaning
and there you go I know no we're gonna
get people who are not gonna be too
pleased again your C++ guy I'm not
saying C++ sucks I'm saying it's just
you should have a bridging language
beforehand it might be alright that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
