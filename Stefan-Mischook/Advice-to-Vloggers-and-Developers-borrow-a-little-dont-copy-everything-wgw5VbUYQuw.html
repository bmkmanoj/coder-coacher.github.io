at youtubers aspiring youtubers and it
also applies to business and content
creation in general your some advice I
can give you we see out there now on
youtube-land the king of the vloggers
this guy named Casey Neistat
seems like a nice guy very successful
vloggers gets millions of views now he
gets millions of views because he was
the first to bring a style of
videography if you will but had not been
widely used on YouTube and he was just
for raesha see pushed really hard every
day doing vlogs and he was a nice guy
but more also he had really interesting
vlog subjects like you know he went to
exotic places took some you know he was
the first to do those all those drone
footage and stuff now I want to point
out two things first of all nothing
creative comes out of a vacuum everybody
copies from everybody else but then
there's there's whirling ideas and then
there's like just just stupid copying
but it's just like really bad now Casey
in terms of the web in terms of YouTube
he was I didn't see anybody do his stop
before him and he was obviously very
good at his videography would be a great
DP director of photography for film I I
would get well at least in terms of his
ability to stitch things together but
his style was not his invention his
style is actually pretty much this guy's
style now this is a great movie and I
think some people want a cat Oscars and
this was put out in 1997 I guess when
Casey was like 16 years old or something
like that so obviously I'm guessing that
Casey Neistat
I'm going to put money on watch this
movie because Casey nice that style is
100% from this movie there's no
difference in fact this is it's exactly
the same if you want to know what Casey
nice that style is his style is
Boogie Nights style this guide I
understand I think his name John
Anderson is the director so you want to
see where Casey nice that learned his
stuff and got his whole style exactly
this
there's no drones in this one but they
had these crane cameras same type of
drone like scenes close-up of the hands
cut cuts from scene to see varied the
type of cuts of Casey does the close-up
on his hands and was drinking coffee or
something the montages the music
everything everything the timing of the
music with the cuts this is all here so
that's what Casey got that and that's
cool now it worked for Casey Casey's
copying of this style worked for him on
YouTube because he was one of the first
at least the first I know of nothing I'm
a big YouTube guy beulah he was one of
the first to bring it to YouTube that is
the key he was one of the first to bring
it to YouTube now what we see I've seen
out there and I'm not looking for it but
I seen too many people who are copying
Casey nice that to a tee there like it's
there Bruce it's so blatant you know
it's okay to copy one or two things like
I copied this I got this idea from Casey
zoom in zoom out not that this
revolutionary but I saw him do van I
said hey that's pretty good little thing
because I used to move my camera around
like this move my camera it's a lot
easier to get the same resetting of the
focus of the attention of the user just
by zooming in and out that's cool but
I'm not gonna do all the other things
that Casey got from this movie because
Casey has done it so much this it's his
whole style on YouTube amongst the
uninformed youtubers who haven't seen
this film I'm not gonna do it because
you're gonna just be the person who's
copying Casey nice that you know people
go around on skateboards and boosted
boards this is you know this case this
boosted board you don't know this they
got electric skateboard this guy nice
daddy always goes around the skateboards
and in the booster board and you see how
these other bloggers doing
and and then they all have drones now
and they all do the same type of cuts is
Casey nice dad and they all you know
they all get did a lot of them get their
music from the same place SoundCloud
it's just getting ridiculous let me end
off with this and this is an advice this
is not I'm not trying to criticize or
poke at you visit advice if you try to
copy somebody who's widely known within
an area in this case YouTube for a
particular style particular format
you're not going to go very far with
that because he's already doing it you
know you have to try to come up with
your own something totally your own it's
ok de Bourgh one or two things from
other people but to just blatantly copy
everything it's just such a disaster
you're not gonna help yourself with that
but I know coming up with something
original is difficult it's difficult ask
Casey he went to Boogie Nights so but
again it worked for him because he was
the first guy to actually take this
style and bring it to youtube right so
try I strongly suggest and again it's
hard it's hard copying of somebody else
blatantly like that they forget it
you could try blending things blending
styles so it's new if you look in music
you look at like I'll use a fairly
recent example Amy Winehouse he she was
able to blend Motown with hip-hop and
bit of jazz and so and here's some of
her to some of the biggest tunes are
actually her I would say renditions if
you will some big huge Motown hits and
even I was a pretty good year for this
didn't recognize it until I heard this
motel Nate I hadn't heard in like 30
years like oh okay that's where she got
it from but she combined it with other
styles right
she did the B high thing the big had the
hair there the hoes Motown but she
combined it with other things as well so
she made it her own but I'm seeing too
often out there's people are just
blatantly copying this guy Casey
nightstand
like if I have to see another person you
know do do some drone scenes with us
background music from SoundCloud and
what I have to I'm gonna have to
uh-huh I'm gonna have to shut off this
