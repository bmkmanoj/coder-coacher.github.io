now this is something that you may or
may not have to do and it depends
entirely on your shopping cart and what
you're selling you know you but paypal
does support shipping so i want to show
you how you can do that here so here I'm
going to say shipping amount and i'm
going to say shopping cart get item
shipping costs and you can do the same
thing with tax as well you can apply
tags just like you apply shipping and
you can have you can have rules you can
have business rules associated with that
as well so for the shipping costs for me
i want to keep my shipping costs
relatively straightforward so in order
to do that I'm going to do I'm going to
create another public function so we've
got get item shipping costs this is
another thing that paypal likes to have
so that it can know how much the
shipping is for each item and so I'm
going to say public function get item
shipping cost pass in the product ID and
here i'm going to say return this items
and i'm going to have the product now we
need to multiply that by however time
many times we have the item so this is
where the original cost of the item if
let's say our shipping costs for tomato
soup is to box well we might want to say
that if you buy ten ten ten cans of
tomato soup or if you buy ten of any
item then you know the shipping cost is
this or the shipping cost is that you
could do it any which way you want
however I'm doing it just this very
simple way because it makes sense for
the tutorial but if you were writing
your own shopping cart this is probably
where you would deviate and set things
up however which way they made sense to
what you were selling but i'm going to
say i want to multiply the
item quantity so I'm going to say this
get item quantity of the product ID and
i'm going to multiply that by this now
you're going to notice I'm using a
lowercase get this time shipping costs
for and i'm going to say get item cost
and then i'm going to say product ID all
right let's explain this for a second we
want to take the item quantity for a
particular product ID and we want to
multiply that by the shipping cost now
i'm not exactly sure the way the way I'm
doing this right now is I'm basically
saying okay whatever the item is cost
its cost is I'm going to pass that into
the shipping cost so if something is 6
box then get it shipping costs
for six bucks is going to return a
certain amount and let's say actually
let's just do this I'm going to create a
private function and it's going to be
get shipping costs for and i'm going to
say price now it's important to bear in
mind that all these rules are being
calculated on the unit price of the item
and then multiplied by the quantity now
we can create certain business rules so
if price is less than 10 for example
let's say it's less than ten bucks then
your shipping is going to be a dollar
ninety-nine else if you're let's say
your price is over 50 bucks or sorry is
less than 50 bucks then your shipping
cost is going to be 1099 and let's say
for everything else if you've got a
really big order then your shipping cost
is going to be 34 99 I don't know
so this could be very different
depending on how you want to do it you
could check based on the product ID and
based on certain products or you could
also have a for example in your catalog
over here you could also have wait and
then based on the weight of an object
that you're shipping you could pass that
into your shopping cart and your
shopping cart could figure out what the
shipping costs are for or another way of
doing this is to actually pass into the
shopping cart where you're from picking
the address and then you know if you're
doing something outside of north america
then you could also have rules for that
as well but this is the underlying
framework that we're going to be working
with so it's a very simple shipping
calculator but just to give you an idea
of where you would want to store the
logic for that now for now to keep
things a little simple hopefully I'm
just going to add a break tag here and
I'm going to say shipping amount is
shipping them out and just like we have
the amount here I'm also going to put in
a break tag and i'm going to say unit
cost is and then the unit cost and i'm
just going to refresh that so we can
tell that for 931 shipping amount is is
third ok for 48 of these guys my
shipping amount is going to be fifteen
dollars and my unit cost is a dollar 33
for each one of these cans of tomato
soup so what I've done let's just go
back to our calculator here is I've
basically taken the shipping costs for a
dollar 99 and i've multiplied it by the
item quantity so I've got eight items of
the dollar 99 and my shipping cost for
each item is a dollar 99 and I'm
multiplying a dollar ninety nine times
eight and that's how we're getting
fifteen dollars for a ten-dollar order
which may or may not make sense
depending on what you're selling anyways
so now that we have these
variables in place we've pretty much
flushed out most of our of our shopping
card we can add to it we can clear it we
are now in a position let's just go back
view court view cart doesn't exist yet
so let's let's do that in a minute but
for now let's just add some more items
to our existing shopping cart so I'm
going to go back to view store i'm going
to add another thing of tomato soup i'm
going to add some linguine i'm going to
add some fresh cumin you can see that
our quantities are starting to come up
here and i'm just going to quickly go
back and i'm going to style this so
we're going to call this shopping cart
another neat little section and this a
shopping cart and the width of this
table is going to be out of 600 pixels
border is going to be 1 pixel solid
light gray border collapse set this to
collapse what this means is that we're
not going to get double borders it's
going to collapse them down if it
notices that the neighbor has a border
I'm going to set this to margin 0 auto
which is going to align it center
shopping cart TR th so we're going into
the table row and into the table head
and in here I want the background to be
eaeaea which is going to be a little
lighter than cccc or ccc which is the
same thing as si si si si si si this is
the same but it's just shorthand and i'm
going to set another border here to 1
pixel solid ccc and we're going to add a
little bit of padding and refresh that
so already this is looking a little
better
and the other thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to say shopping cart TR TD so
these are the actual cells and they're
also going to have a one pixel border
and a bit of padding all right Oh got a
dot here there we go well this is
starting to come together slowly but
surely let's go back to our add to cart
page now this function here render
shopping cart row we can probably just
move that into our templates file at
this point I'm just going to delete that
cut that out and then go to templates
file and drop it in here so this is
going to we're going to create a section
called shopping cart templates in the
next video we're going to be creating
new templates for calculating the
subtotal and the shipping row and
finalizing our op and cart page before
going to paypal thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
