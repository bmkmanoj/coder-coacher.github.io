gonna be a quick video during an intro
to me so just in case you don't know I
touch on some of the things about me in
the past so the video channel this
YouTube channel is more or less a hobby
for me there's also a promotional thing
I'm sort of getting the word out there
about what I do my main concern at these
days is I help schools get code into the
classrooms that set of encoding since
1994 worked on many many apps including
a publicly traded companies the last
several years though I've been much more
much more of an architect and I sort of
managed coders and manage my own
projects so I don't do freelance
personally anymore but I did it for
years and the rules of freelancing it
pretty much the same so I keep on
mentioning mentioned a few sites so let
me first start with killer sites calm so
if you look here in this book keller
sites calm now I didn't write this book
David Siegel wrote this book now I this
site well this book by the way it was
like the one of the best-selling books
in web design in the 90s if not the best
selling book i think was published in 19
languages and stuff and yell so i took
over the site killer sites calm I took
over editorial and in about year 2000
something like that and I've been
developing courses and writing about
coding since that time I developed my
first video course angles in 2003 so
yeah so that's killer sites com you know
it's it's a it's a site that it's still
there it's still up and running and I
keep it up to date a little bit but I've
moved on to institutional work so i
don't i'm not as religious with it if he
was i used to be although we still get a
couple million page views per month with
that site it's not bad so last year 2015
i wrote this book this is my book i
wrote this last year because publisher
asked me to and it's still in book
stores all across north america europe
and you can get it on Amazon as well
this is a big
book on web design and I touch on its
html5 css3 beginners book and a big
picture also touch on things like jQuery
a touch on bootstrap again it's a
beginner's book it's designed to get you
up and running to give you a big picture
get into the most important aspects of
coding that's the thing about teaching
coding and any subject is you've got to
figure out what the important aspects of
the subjects are so with HTML what are
the important aspects CSS already
important aspects because if you know
HTML and CSS any of you do a special
HTML especially html5 and css3 and
JavaScript they get they can get to be
pretty big subjects so if you were to
sit there and try to teach every single
tag in HTML every single rule of CSS it
would be pretty pretty hard on that on
the head especially as a teacher so the
key is is when you're learning any new
subject and teaching any new subject is
to figure out the key elements of that
subject what are the fundamental
principles and techniques that really
matter and because we're lucky enough to
live in the age of Google work you know
you forget that you forget a particular
CSS rule we forget of a particular HTML
tag you forget a particular library in
Java or something you can just refer to
a go to google type it in boom and get
your answer that's it so there you go
that's a little bit about me instead of
getting into a lot of detail about you
know DevOps and details how to create
this type of app in Java PHP although we
do have some of those courses I spend
more of my time on the business end and
the practical and of coding something
that my 20 / 20 years experience
developing apps in one form or another
has taught me and so that's what I
concentrate on this channel is plenty of
channels on youtube or where you can
look up you know how to do a responsive
site you get a lot of piecemeal stuff my
courses provide off for a holistic a to
Zed I make it easy for you and when I
teach code I teach much more than just a
CO so for instance
just in HTML it's important to not only
understand what a tag is but you have to
understand the HTTP modeled and request
response model servers or some clients
how about it works etc etc you know the
tools that web developers use like code
editors developer tools built into the
browser's different server types these
are the type of things that are actually
important so just learning how to write
HTML code and CSS code JavaScript code
is a start but you have to learn all
these big picture issues and I touched
on a couple of oh just now before before
you can really you know understand the
subject and use the coding languages
properly so you know what I think now
we're going to close this video with my
new suggested Alma I'll be right back
all right to end this video here is my
new suggested album I don't know you can
see here it's a Donny Hathaway live this
is one of the best live albums I have
ever heard it's nineteen seventy soul
this guy died when I was 32 use a
manic-depressive I think and he jumped
off a building but he recorded a couple
shows and some small venues in uh I
think was in California anyway amazing
concert and you know I'm I have a wide
range of tastes from Led Zeppelin to
jazz through a bitter soul prog rock all
kinds of stuff you know Nirvana yada
yada yada yada so this is like one of
the best live albums I have ever
listened to it's really really good it
depends on your taste its kind of souls
kind of swings but again this is a
hugely influential artist so he died in
this was 72 a big fan of Donny Hathaway
was Amy Winehouse Amy Winehouse was a
huge fan of Donny Hathaway and I think
he she covered like two or three of the
songs
uh yeah two or three of a songs she
covered so great album one of the one of
the most important artists i think in
the last 50 years highly recommended
very different from Ziggy Stardust old
David Bowie totally different type of
music so you may or not you may or may
not like it alright that's it for now
