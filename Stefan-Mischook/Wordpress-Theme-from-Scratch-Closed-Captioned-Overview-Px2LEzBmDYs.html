today what I'm going to be doing is
building a really simple wordpress theme
with you from scratch and we're going to
go through some of the different pages
and template files that are necessary
for wordpress personally my own in my
own work I've managed to use this
technique to create several sites very
very quickly here are some examples this
is one that I did for a conference this
is another one that I did with a
designer so we have navigation on the
right it's actually a bilingual website
and here's another one that I did in
just about a day very simple we've got
navigation on the left so what we're
going to be doing is just going through
the steps that are necessary in PHP to
do this the tools that we're going to be
using are of course WordPress which is
free in fact everything that we're going
to be using to get this job done is free
and is cross-platform so we're going to
be using WordPress we're going to be
using a tool called mam mam is a
collection of tools for having a local
web server it stands for mac apache
mysql and PHP there are of course
equivalents on linux with just google
search lamp and also on windows you can
search for lamp and all of these
collections or this stack of
technologies is all free so you can just
download it and run it on whichever
operating system you're currently
working on the other tool that i'm going
to be using is called text wrangler and
text Wrangler is also free it's a very
very feature rich text editor and it's
the baby brother to another tool called
bbedit which is great if you're doing a
lot of development and you just want a
very powerful very simple text editor
again you could use anything else you
could even use notepad on Windows if you
wanted to and by the end of this
tutorial set what you should end up with
is something like this it's a very
simple theme we're also going to do a
sidebar which isn't
here right now and you're going to be
able to essentially create different
template postings or different templates
for different parts of the wordpress
theme which is how all of the other
sites that I've done work so by the end
of this series you should be comfortable
enough to build your own template by
yourself we're going to be using a bit
of PHP but you really don't need to be a
PHP coder to follow along just have a
wonderful interest in web design and web
development if you know HTML and CSS
it'll probably help but again it's not a
requirement that's about it so let's get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
