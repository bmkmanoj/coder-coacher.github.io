somebody posted a comment on YouTube and
I just wanted to comment on the comment
so he quotes learn the actual underlying
technologies before learning
abstractions don't learn jQuery learn
Dom don't learn sass learn CSS don't
learn Howell learn HTML don't learn
CoffeeScript learn JavaScript don't
learn handlebars learn JavaScript es
templates don't just use but bootstraps
learn UI patterns when getting your
start you should fear most things are
concealed complexity pal Simpson I agree
with that statement
it would seem when you're starting out
that it would be quicker to just jump
into jQuery it would be quicker to just
jump into an MVC framework like laravel
versus really understanding o P PHP etc
etc etc etc that's what's false it's
actually quicker if you actually just
get a good grasp of the understanding
tech in this case JavaScript Dom HTML
CSS css3 and then when you do jump into
whichever libraries and frameworks you
want to learn don't get me don't get me
wrong I think you should learn at least
the bootstrap grid as an example you
should learn at least very basic jQuery
jQuery is not as important of bootstrap
grid for most people but nonetheless you
get the idea again if you understand
your basics you con on your basics
in programming in software development
and in business and in fighting you will
be superior in the end and you will
learn actually much more quickly as a
beginner it's like it's kind of like
sugar you're tempted to go for the
framework err to go for the library
versus I don't want to spend time
learning to Dom I don't want to learn
css3 and how we can use css3 to create
responsive sighs I'm just going use
bootstrap no no if you spend a little
time learning these basic technologies
I'm not saying it's become a total
master just so you understand the
important elements in a good core so
teachers important elements
then when you jump into any of these
frameworks it will be very easy so
anyway that's all I want to say short
vlog short vlog one last thing before I
close out of this log look at this bug
in YouTube UI watch last word here's
Kyle Simpson right look there's nothing
else right now watch though when I
expand watch what happens here when I
expand the window up also in a new
sentence appears I feel silly watch
watch watch see it's gone and there's no
like read more or no click it just it's
not a forget it we're not showing you
veterans more here
ok there we go so this quote here is
from this book I never read it so I have
no idea if it's any good
but Arthur suggests I think you would
agree with this as well and I would say
to Arthur I do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
