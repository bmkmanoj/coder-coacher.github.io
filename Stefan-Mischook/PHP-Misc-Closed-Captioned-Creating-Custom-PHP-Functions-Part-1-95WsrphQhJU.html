miss chuck and in this video tutorial
we're going to create our own custom PHP
functions i'm assuming for this video
that you've done my previous videos on
functions where i cover some of the
basic concepts things like arguments and
returning values and so forth if you
haven't done those you should because it
will make understanding this video much
easier
I've divided this video into four basic
sections so what the idea of making it
easier for you to follow along the first
part we're actually going to jump right
in and create our very first custom
functions and learn about the function
keyword and the basic structure in terms
of code when building your own custom
function part 2 we're going to learn how
to return values from a function part 3
we're going to learn how to create a
function that can accept arguments and
then use those arguments within the
function and in part 4 we're going to
use conditional statements within a
function and hiss statement and learn
how we can return optional return values
based on a conditional again if any of
this seems unclear to you don't worry
once the video is finished you find that
it's actually quite easy
let's jump right in and create our very
first a custom function once again i'm
just going to use dreamweaver because i
assume most of you are web designers so
this is like most what designers use
although you can use again you can use
any text editor that you wander if you
just use notepad so functions always
start off with the keyword function this
basically tells PHP that we're creating
a function and we're going to call this
function footer and we put the curly
bracket so here's the basic structure of
a function you have the keyword function
you have the name of the function
followed by your brackets and then you
have your set of curly brackets it's a
very this is actually a pretty standard
layout for so many things in PHP so I
think you're probably getting familiar
with it essentially whatever code you
put in between these two curly brackets
is your function code
now that we have the basic structure to
function in place let's actually get the
function to do something so for the sake
of this video we're just going to do
something very very easy now hello world
is a the old nerd first programming
trickered i don't know how you call it
the first thing that they teach
programmers to do when they're learning
to program is how to get the programming
language to say hello world so here we
go we're saying hello world so let's
actually view that page and see what
happens so I've loaded up the page in
our browser and we hit the refraction of
course nothing happens and nothing
happened because we didn't tell PHP to
actually do anything well yeah we did it
we created a function but we did not
instruct PHP to actually use a function
you can think of as cold in a function
as code in reserve it's sort of waiting
there to be used so until you explicitly
tell PHP to use it the code will not be
processed that's what's different right
if I just said echo out if I just excuse
me road echo hello world in the in the
script without outside the function PHP
of course would print it out right away
but with functions you have to basically
tell PHP to actually use the function so
we've covered that in a previous video
and we're just going to use a function
here so let's go here and being lazy guy
but i am i'll just tell dreamweaver to
create my code block and what we're
going to do we're just going to call the
function and we've learned in a previous
video to call a function means when you
call means to use a function all you
have to do is state the function name
and that's it so now let's we save this
let's refresh our page and hello world
years so that's pretty simple let's look
at one of the first advantages that you
have when you use functions because
right now doesn't seem like there's any
advantage so let's add tons of hello
worlds to our function and we'll save
that so you knows how much space all
this function code takes meanwhile our
call to the function is rather just
rather simple it's just one line so it's
again will your page and we're going to
see a bunch of hello worlds so the first
rule that we learn about function the
first advantage rather is that functions
can help you encapsulate a lot of code
and which will make your code in your
pages a lot cleaner encapsulate meaning
that the code all this code here is
encapsulated is wrapped up inside of the
of the function footer that we created
so typically when you're actually doing
your PHP code what you want to do for
real projects you probably want to stick
your your function all your function
code inside a separate file and then you
would call then you would include that
file and I'll show you how to do that
later inside your PHP pages that people
actually see this way your pages with
all your HTML and your CSS and so forth
is very clean free of all kinds of
excess PHP code think of it as in much
the same way as as you link to CSS files
external CSS files so that you can reuse
the same CSS code on many many different
pages that's one advantage of a function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
