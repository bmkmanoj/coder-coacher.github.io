miss Chuck and in this video tutorial
we're going to create our own custom PHP
functions I'm assuming for this video
that you've done my previous videos on
functions where I cover some of the
basic concepts things like arguments and
returning values and so forth if you
haven't done those you should because it
will make understanding this video much
easier
I've divided this video into four basic
sections so what's the idea of making it
easier for you to follow along the first
part we're actually gonna jump right in
and create our very first custom
functions and learn about the function
keyword and the basic structure in terms
of code when building your own custom
function part two we're going to learn
how to return values from a function
part three we're going to learn how to
create a function that can accept
arguments and then use those arguments
within the function and in part four
we're gonna use conditional statements
within a function and if statement and
learn how we can return optional return
values based on the conditional again if
any of this seems unclear to you don't
worry once the video is finished you
find that it's actually quite easy
let's jump right in and create our very
first a custom function once again I'm
just gonna use a Dreamweaver because I
assume most of you are web designers so
this is what most web designers use
although you can use again you can use
any text editor that you want if you
just use milk pad so functions always
start off with the keyword function this
basically tells PHP that we're creating
a function and we're gonna call this
function footer and we put the curly
brackets so here's the basic structure
of a function you have the keyword
function you have the name of the
function followed by your brackets and
then you have your set of curly brackets
it's a very this is actually a pretty
standard layout for so many things in
PHP so I think you're probably getting
familiar with it essentially whatever
code you put in between these two curly
brackets is your function code
now that we have the basic structure to
function in place let's actually get the
function to do something so for the sake
of this video we're just gonna do
something very very easy now hello world
is a the old nerd first programming
trickered I don't know how you call it's
the first thing that they teach
programmers to do when they're learning
to program is how to get the programming
language to say hello world so here we
go we're saying hello world
so let's actually view that page and see
what happens so I've loaded up the page
in our browser and we hit the refresh
and of course nothing happens and
nothing happened because we didn't tell
PHP to actually do anything well yeah we
did it we created a function but we did
not instruct PHP to actually use a
function you can think of as cold in a
function as code in reserved it's sort
of waiting there to be used so until you
explicitly tell PHP to use it the code
will not be processed that's what's
different right if I just said echo out
if I just excuse me
wrote echo hello world in the in the
script without outside the function PHP
of course would print it out right away
but what functions you have to basically
tell PHP to actually use a function so
we've covered that in a previous video
and we're just gonna use a function here
so let's go here and being a lazy guy
but I am I'll just tell Dreamweaver to
create my code block and what we're
gonna do we're just gonna call the
function and we've learned in our
previous video to call a function means
when you call means to use a function
all you have to do is state the function
name and that's it so now let's we save
this let's refresh our page and hello
world
years so that's pretty simple let's look
at one of the first advantages that you
have when you use functions because
right now it doesn't seem like there's
any advantage so let's add tons of hello
worlds to our function and we'll save
that so you notice how much space all
this function code takes meanwhile our
call to the function is rather just
rather simple it's just one line so it's
again we'll get a page and we're going
to see a bunch of hello worlds so the
first rule that we learned about
function the first advantage rather is
that functions can help you encapsulate
a lot of code and which will make your
code in your pages a lot cleaner
encapsulate meaning that the code all
this code here is encapsulated is
wrapped up inside of the of the function
footer that we created so typically when
you're actually doing your PHP code what
you want to do for real projects you
probably want to stick your your
function all your function code inside a
separate file and then you would call
then you would include that file and
I'll show you how to do that later
inside your PHP pages that people
actually see this way your pages with
all your HTML and your CSS and so forth
is very clean free of all kinds of
excess PHP code I think of it as in much
the same way as as you link to CSS files
external CSS files so that you can reuse
the same CSS code on many many different
pages that's one advantage of a function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
