of the most important aspects of working
in photoshop and that is working with
layers as you'll be able to see in the
next couple of tutorials I'll be showing
you how layers are one of the most
fundamental features of understanding
Photoshop in any of its variations and
versions since version 5 of Photoshop
layers have greatly improved how anyone
who uses the software can allow for
flexibility in their work as you'll see
in just a second right now since we've
already discussed a little bit about how
we can perform brushwork inside a
Photoshop as you can see here I've just
chosen a particular brush and I can
increase its size by either
right-clicking and increasing the size
like this as you'll see there and when I
cause a stroke on this you'll notice
that it's being drawn on what we see
here in the layers window something
called background incidentally if you
don't see your layers palette you can
always go to window and choose layers or
f7 however just to get things onto a
defaulted workspace you can go to window
workspace and try default workspace now
I'll get everything to the way it's
looking for me here and as you can see
now that I've done that everything has
been drawn on this layer called
background one of the things about that
as you'll see it's being treated as a
background layer and since I'm erasing
the white area that's there it's
revealing this black area underneath it
well that's not exactly what we want to
have happening so ctrl Z or edit undo
will undo that particular move and as
you can see here what I want to do now
is to show you how if I go undo a few
more steps to remember the shortcut for
that was ctrl alt Z and now what I want
to show you is how we can create sort of
a stacking order notice if I tried to
move this layer I wouldn't be able to
and the reason being is because it is a
background layer when it is a background
there and you can see it here italicized
it's automatically locked meaning I can
draw on it I can do a number of things
to it but I can't move it or anything
else so we are going to leave that as
the background layer but on top of that
layer we're going to create a new layer
and as you can see here you create a new
layer in the layers window it's right
next to the garbage can so I can then
make a brush stroke on this layer for
example I'll just do this
couple of strokes and you'll note that
if I wanted to move this layer I could
do so without moving the layer that's
underneath it that's interesting enough
but i'm going to double-click this name
here where it says layer 1 and i'm going
to call this gray okay so we have some
gray strokes here then i'm going to
create a new layer and i'll draw with a
red layer and let's call this layer by
double-clicking on it red and i will now
take that same stroke i can make it
smaller if I wanted to
I can draw something in an opposite
direction
so
will notice I'm just scribbling at this
point you can see that by moving what's
on the red layer I'm not actually moving
what's on the gray layer and that's also
because of the selection tools that I'm
using here in the selection tool I'm
auto select layer and as you can see if
I did not have that selected it would be
the red layer and even if i click on the
gray it would still be the red so i
would have to make that active to move
that as well however auto select layer
in this particular instance is probably
going to be a lot better for you well
you'll notice we have the red on top of
the gray but I wanted the opposite to
happen put the gray on top of the red
all I need do is to drag the file up as
I've done right here and now the gray is
on top of my red so as you might imagine
you can continue to stack just about any
number of different objects or drawings
or paintings or pictures or colors
anything like that whatsoever into your
design and in doing so as you'll see
here I'm just increasing increasingly
looking through some of these things as
you can see here you can put any number
of different brush work that you've
created or anything like that and notice
you can keep that green area down here
at the bottom instead of at the top so
as you can see working with layers can
be very very important to any different
photoshop project and as you might
imagine it's not unusual to have many
layers intact by the time you finished
your composition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
