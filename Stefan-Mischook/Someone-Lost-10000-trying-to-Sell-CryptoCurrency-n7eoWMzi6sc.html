talk about crypto currencies I'm gonna
give you some perspective on things and
this is actually related to the
entrepreneurial side of this channel
because as an entrepreneur I'm not just
an entrepreneur anybody involved really
you have to understand all the
investment possibilities out there you
have to understand how to value things
and how to perceive where the market is
going so that when you start making
money as a developer as a small business
owner no matter what type of business
you get into you'll be wise enough about
what to do with your money in terms of
investment because investment is such an
important part about becoming
financially independent and also just in
terms of ability to assess where markets
might be going so you can direct your
entrepreneurial activities in a
particular direction or another whether
you are a coder or not so I decided to
do this vlog because I got a post in
facebook where I saw something on
Facebook where somebody mentioned how
just then a friend of his lost $10,000
trying to sell a cryptocurrency into the
marketplace just trying to sell it the
cryptocurrency it was LTC like coin I
don't think that's relevant which
cryptocurrency it was what's relevant is
that a very simple transaction like just
selling just trying to sell your
currency your coin currency in quotes
cause them to lose all for money now one
of the things that proponents of crips
of cryptocurrencies talk about is how so
much better than traditional banking
maybe in some ways but in the end maybe
in some ways but right now one big
advantage of banking is if you try to
sell your US Dollars your Canadian
dollars your yen whatever you try to
sell your British pounds and there's a
little screw up you're gonna lose all
your money you know to me that's a big
big advantage you know what I mean now
criminal elements love the idea of
cryptocurrencies because it can hide
everything what they do which you know
I suppose it a criminal that's kind of a
good thing I suppose in terms of a
criminality morality aside there are so
many legitimate ways that you can make a
lot of money by providing actual
services providing actual product that
people want that you don't really need
to be a criminal criminals kind of I was
going to use a profile profanity to
describe these people but it's kind of a
wimpy way out if you ask me so anyway
the latter so let's get back into it so
another problem that I see with the
cryptocurrencies these days is that
they're meant to replace traditional
currencies in some form or another
problem is is that as far as I can
understand even with the small volume
that you see in these cryptocurrency
it's like in terms of you take all the
crypto currency transactions put them
together
and it represents a tiny fraction
nothing in which you would need these
things to be able to do to be able to
replace traditional banking traditional
currencies and even at this tiny little
little volume that they have whether it
be a theory of or a Bitcoin they're
tanking already under the stress now I
don't have all the details and all the
numbers but for instance for example
Bitcoin takes ten minutes to settle a
transaction well when I do a credit card
payment it's instant so that's a feeling
of Bitcoin so now they came out with
Bitcoin cash to try alleviate that who
knows where that's going to go theorem
to apparently this game came out crypto
kitty I think it's called it crypto
kitty apparently caused problems for the
etherium Network it's just a bunch of
crypto kitties again I questioned how
these coins as they stand now as their
engineer now how are they going to
actually fulfill their ultimate role in
some point and they will at some point
but as far as I could tell the structure
of these coins they're not capable of
doing them now there may be exceptions
and I'm no expert in all these things
that's clear but the end of the day I
look at all these crypto currencies as
if you talking to the programmers here
developers their alpha code their alpha
applications it's kind of like the early
days of web
servers and people are trying to figure
out which which way to do it how to do
good how to do bad and there's a lot of
web app servers that have disappeared
into the dust you know they don't exist
anymore and I would imagine 99% if not
all cryptocurrencies will disappear into
the dust which you have here with
Bitcoin aetherium like coin and rest of
them SIA and all the others you have
alpha apps alpha software people
experimenting with things and then why
are these things going up in value
they're going up in value simply because
people think they're going up in value
there is no intrinsic value to Bitcoin
there's no intrinsic value to like coin
or theorem there's no value to them
except that people think there is value
to them and we've seen these type of
bubbles these type of manias many times
in history and there's been that calm
bubble
think about the dot-com era I was around
during that time and I know guys who had
become dot-com millionaires from
investment but then they didn't sell in
time and they lost everything then went
into debt because they were leveraged
there were many many dot-com companies
out there but no longer exists the vast
majority only a few exist still today
which you hear of today from that period
of time keep that in mind this is very
recent history look at you the US
housing from 1996 to about 2008 they
went bonkers and then they crash if
recovered to a certain extent but again
a very recent bubble but leaves with a
house you can live in a house and
there's a cost there's there's a utility
of a house I'm not sure if there's much
utility right this part of any of these
cryptocurrencies
and the fact that people can create a
new cryptocurrency relatively easily and
they can look at the flaws of the old
cryptocurrencies and create better
cryptocurrencies I'm not sure why would
you want to buy an older flawed
cryptocurrency when you're going to buy
a brand-new one that's better than many
other assets manias in the history of
the world many others many others and
there's one thing you should take away
from all these asset of manias is that
their psychological manias are literally
driven by psychology and the
fundamentals
I've lived through a few of them dot-com
bubble housing bubble
and I've seen the gold and silver bubble
and now we're looking at the
cryptocurrency bubble now here's the
thing about these bubbles during the
bubble time people in the bubble they
will tell you all kinds of reasons why
it's not a bubble and why these things
are worth so much up until they crash
they'll still tell you that they're
worth a lot save me with the gold and
silver guys go look at the old gold and
silver bumps a lot of these guys are
saying gold when gold was like 1500 the
ounce gold was going to ten thousand the
ounce and silver is going to five
hundred the ounce and they crashed and
you know go away because about 1200
bucks the ounce a lot of people bought
it at 1500 1800 the ounce silver last
time I checked with 14 ounce a lot of
people are buying at 30 50 if 30 40 45
48 dollars the ounce now it's at like 14
and it's not coming back so keep that in
mind
buyer beware in my opinion there are
something to crypto technology the
blockchain but in terms of these
individual coins I look back then at
some point they're all going to be worth
zero so if you're in it remember to get
out and in full disclosure because I'm
in proper nerd and Explorer I do have
minor machines I and at various very
money that I expect to lose money that
not expect to lose money that I'm very
comfortable losing I don't want to lose
it but if I lose the money on the miners
whatever to me it's just a tool of
exploration and you know when
everybody's in this game you jump in the
game you see what happens but you don't
go in there with money you can't afford
to lose and try to look at these
cryptocurrencies as pure gambling
remember that and that's my tip for
today do what you will Oh at the end of
this video I'm gonna have a nice little
chart but you can look at bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
