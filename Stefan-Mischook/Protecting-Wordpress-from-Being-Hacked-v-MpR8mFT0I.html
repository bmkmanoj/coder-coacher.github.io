advocate of using WordPress for many
years now and I've been also a big
advocate of web designers and web
programmers while independent web
programmers learning how to work with
WordPress as well because so many small
businesses use WordPress but there's a
dark side to using WordPress and that is
the fact that WordPress has a lot of
holes in it and it is a common target
for hackers we actually just got hit
recently killer sites calm on our blog
we got hit with a hacker who had
uploaded some sort of script that
basically rewrote our htaccess files and
what happened was what anybody would hit
killer sites and even not just our blog
but the main site itself with a mobile
device so if they came to our site with
a mobile device an Android iPad iPhone
they were redirected to some Russian
site it's been a few days since we've
addressed this issue since since we
repaired this hack I think we've gotten
it because it seems to be finished now
and what I think the cause was the
reason they were able to get in is
because WordPress and this is just a
guess we're not exactly sure but I
believe it's because WordPress was not
up to date we had WordPress 3.6 and 3.8
had come out and I believe I'm guessing
they came in through some sort of
security weakness that was present at
3.6 so the lesson to take away from that
is update your WordPress often as soon
as they need to come up with a fix
updated the good thing though now is
that WordPress is really easy to update
compared to what it was before let me
show you
so I've logged into the killer site's
wordpress dashboard and what you want to
do is you want to go to the updates and
you want to make sure your wordpress is
up-to-date at this time
3.8 of WordPress is the latest version
and so I should I don't have to update
that but you can just down you can
download it where you would then
manually add it to your server just in
case the reinstall now the automated
download install and install doesn't
work that's a great thing about the
current versions of WordPress it's much
easier to install I found for a while
now
the automatic updated install worked
fantastically so in terms of dealing
with a hacked WordPress site one of the
things you have to make sure that you do
do is have your first of all your latest
WordPress installed make sure that you
updated all your plugins and also be
sure to keep your plugins minimal
meaning don't install too many plugins
in WordPress unless you need to and
another thing you should do you should
clean up your themes directory if you go
to themes appearance themes we used to
have a bunch of teams in here all the
default themes that came with WordPress
and we experimented with other themes
but the the best situation actually is
just to to just keep the one theme but
you are working with and get rid of the
others because an improperly written
theme can also be the source of the
hackers well of your WordPress is
vulnerability so the final question I
want to address is that should you be
using WordPress for your business site
given how how many holes that WordPress
tends to have for me I think that using
a third-party hosting site like a
wordpress.com to and have a sub domain
is probably not the best strategy when
it comes to
creating a business site yes WordPress
installations can be buggy excuse me
they can have security holes but I still
think it's worth developing your own
website especially if you're creating a
small business so yes I would still have
a wordpress based site you just have to
make sure everything is up-to-date
the other option if you're just looking
to create a business site you don't have
to use WordPress of course you can just
create a static sites or use another CMS
like Joomla or Drupal although those I
know they're not as vulnerable to attack
because they're just not as popular
that's a big part of it you know it's
kind of like Windows and Mac Mac there's
hardly any viruses out there simply
because well partly because there's just
not as many Mac's floating around so
they're not as juicy a target but also
with Mac OS you have a much more it's
harder not to crack in terms of security
now that it's impossible but it is
harder to do than Windows anyway that's
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
