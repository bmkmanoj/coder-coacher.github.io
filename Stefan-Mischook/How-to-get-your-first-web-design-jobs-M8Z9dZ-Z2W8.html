with killer sights calm in this podcast
or a video depending how you're hearing
or seeing this we're going to look at
the top 5 ways to get new clients I'm
assuming that you are an aspiring web
designer or web programmer and you're
just starting things out so in this
particular chapter your podcast we're
going to look at these five different
ways so start with number 5 you can try
a job sport now there are sites out
there but you can go to and prospective
employers or people that are looking to
hire a web professional for a contract
they'll post their jobs and you can bid
on these things just do a search on
google for you know web design jobs or
web posting or job posting that kind of
stuff and you'll come up across a bunch
of them but downside with these types of
boards is that you're gonna have to
compete with a lot of different web
designers and programmers and you may
have some trouble because you'll be
competing with people who maybe for
instance you might be somebody in the US
and you have to compete against somebody
who's in India and because the cost of
living in India is so much cheaper very
able to provide a similar service for a
lot less money but on the positive side
you're gonna find that a lot of small
and even medium-sized businesses will
prefer to do business with a local web
designer or web programmer so there
they'll be willing to pay the extra
money to be able to have that proximity
so it's it could be something to look at
when you're first trying out my number 5
of this top 5 list is to try the jobs
boards another option is to also check
out Craigslist and maybe post something
on your Facebook page which we have
friends
how that can help out sub brings me to
number four ask friends or family you'd
be surprised if you just let people know
that you're jumping into the web design
or web programming business that you're
willing to offer your services and for
the first client or a first contract if
you will it might be a good idea it
actually is a good idea to offer it for
free
just because you're learning and you
have to develop your portfolio and
develop a bit of a track record so it's
nothing wrong with the first one or two
small contracts to offer for free or at
least part of it for free so that you
can develop your chops and you know
slowly have people get to know you so
yeah that's the next one ask friends or
family again
Facebook is if so much if you have an
account on Facebook it's probably a good
way just to mention it and people will
start thinking about you in that regard
meaning they'll start thinking about you
as being a web designer or a web
programmer tip number three in getting
new clients is you have to have a good
website of course if especially if
you're a web designer you have to
showcase your skills and so you know you
should have a website up and running
that looks good your web program or same
type of thing even if your web
programmer the look may not be as
important since they won't be drug
judging you on your design skills so
much but nonetheless you should still
have a pretty good looking professional
site so it shows that you know what
you're doing people who would be looking
to hire you as a web programmer they
have no way of really most of the time
of judging how good your code is so how
am I gonna judge you they're gonna judge
you by how clean looking your website is
so it doesn't have to be super fancy but
it has to look pro and they'll assume
that if your site looks good they'll so
much a code is good now I know it
doesn't make any sense and it probably
has nothing to do if the other because
you know most of the very good coders I
know are actually terrible designers so
if you're one of those types of guys who
really you're really good at coding
their programming then get somebody you
know was a good designer or use a basic
template and you know leverage other
people's design skills because you know
again you can be a great coder but you
have a lousy site people are going to
shy away from you because they're
they're gonna get an impression of you
based on the quality or the lack of
quality in your website actually I
remember way back in the day whenever I
was first starting out and one of my
first important contracts was wasn't my
first contract but one of my first
important contracts I was told after I
got it one of the main reasons I got it
is because first of all my site look
clean and neat and also when they came
over to my place I was just operating
from my apartment they found that my
apartment was very clean and neat and so
they assumed that I would work in that
way as well so that that you know again
they have no way of judging you as a
programmer they can't you know if your
web designer they're gonna really lean
heavy on your design meaning they don't
really pay attention to the design but
if you're a programmer you know they're
just gonna really just look at you know
they ask you what have you done they're
gonna look at your site and they're
gonna get an impression in that way
number two on my top-five list of how to
get new clients this may seem like a
strange one but a good idea would become
an active member of a Web Design
forum and I say this because I have been
told by many people who are members of
the killer sites calm forms as they've
gotten a lot of work by being consistent
contributors you know there may be on
any given form like ours you may see 10
regular posters but they're probably
there hundreds of people visiting and
lurking who haven't even joined they may
just check out the forum every day or
every other day just checking out things
and they may never even join so it's
interesting that way so it's an
interesting dynamic saw several regular
members contributors they've told me
they've gotten the gig several gigs
through the forums so it makes it makes
makes sense for you to join a forum
become an active member of the community
answer questions ask questions
contribute and people get to know you
and for instance if you're a great
designer of a member of the forum
happens to be a coder or programmer they
may contact you and want to get you to
do some design work for them and vice
versa you may be a good coder answering
PHP and JavaScript questions for
instance and you may find in time that a
designer on the forum will contact you
say listen I got this gig I'm doing some
design work but I don't know PHP too
well so I saw that you've answered these
questions so I thought I I would ask you
to help me out there so that's the
another way to get your your some new
clients become an active member of a
form a web design for web programming
form and number one to get new clients
again I'm assuming you're starting out
and I touched off on this previously it
makes that sense in the beginning to do
a freebie a site and then from there you
can leverage that so what does that mean
so what a friend or family member or
somebody you know needs a web site you
build it and first of all you know
develop some chops in terms of how to
handle clients and expectations and so
forth but more importantly you can be
sure about if you have one small
business owner you may do I don't know
if somebody has an aesthetician you can
be sure that they're going to know other
small business owners and eventually the
word-of-mouth factor becomes extremely
important in fact it will become quickly
not the most important way to get new
clients I can guarantee you from my
experience other people's experiences
it's all about it's all about referrals
it's all about word-of-mouth
so it's that first client or q/r the
most difficult
and they're also the most important in a
sense because they establish you as a
player in the industry as a web the
Refresh professional whether you be a
web designer or a web programmer so
there you go there are my top five tips
to review try jobs board craigslist ask
friends or family you can leverage
facebook there for instance have a good
website make sure you have a good
website so that you can showcase your
skills become an active member on a web
design forum and do a freebie or two
just to establish yourself a little bit
and you can start that word of mouth
thing going it's uh it's very effective
there you go
I'm Steph miss Chuck and with killer
sites calm thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
