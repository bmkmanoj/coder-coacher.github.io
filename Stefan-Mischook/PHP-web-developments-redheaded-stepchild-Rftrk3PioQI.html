killer sites so is PHP the redheaded
stepchild of the programming world I'm
getting that more and more and more
people are dissing PHP PHP is being
considered subpar language it's losing
some of its mojo at least among amongst
the nerd intelligentsia and I think this
is because PHP has its dirty dark past
in that it was a procedural language it
was a language I was built ad hoc on a
need-to-know basis and so it's a little
wild in the background so people still
have this perception of PHP in terms of
what it was whatever 810 years ago and
you know I used to have that opinion of
PHP back in the day when I was a Java
code I was like I don't want to do PHP
but then a client came to me he said
listen we built this the saying in PHP
we don't want to use Java we want to use
PHP and so I was pushed into it kicking
and screaming and when I discovered even
back then when PHP was relatively
primitive versus today that it was a
very productive language and opened my
eyes to things I spoke about this before
one thing I remember it popped up popped
out at me with regards to PHP is sending
an email as simple as that
now at the time to do this in Java with
servlets it was like a page of code with
peach people's one line so I was like
okay a PHP has its downside but man it
wasn't if it was it efficient relative
to Java so it got got me to thinking
thinking about you know about PHP and
light scripting languages like PHP Ruby
Python so on let's fast forward to 2015
PHP is not at all the same beast it's
fact it's very different from what it
was in the past it's a far more mature
language it has all the capabilities in
the paradigm
of all the cool languages today whether
it be Python Ruby or whatnot
it has arm layers it has MVC framework
several to choose from it has all these
capabilities unit testing etc etc etc
yes it still has that old-school PHP you
know procedural you know legacy that's
still there that people can use but very
few PHP coders these days cold in the
old PHP way everybody today are
object-oriented NB C PHP coders just as
sophisticated as anything I've seen out
there so this whole idea that PHP is
some black sheep is ridiculous now I'm
talking purely on the technical end of
things but when you actually get into
the real world of web development what
people find and I just got a comment put
to me by somebody commenting all of my
YouTube blogs they're discovering that
tutor they're learning Ruby on Rails and
so forth but when they want to do
freelancing work they're discovering
everybody's using PHP every Baltic all
the businesses all the smoke sites a lot
of them are running WordPress something
like 22% I've heard different numbers 18
22 % of websites that are dynamic excuse
me that are running WordPress period or
some other CMS and guess what they're
all written in PHP so if you wanted to
be able to work with these things you
know in terms of customizations so forth
PHP is the language not not Ruby not
Python sorry then you look at dynamic
websites and something like 80% of the
dynamic websites out there today are
running PHP not Ruby not done that not
Java 80% are running PHP so yes PHP has
a bit of a dirty sordid past but it's
cleaned itself up it's a quite a mature
language you know so you know let's be
realistic when I look at languages when
I look at technologies always look at
not just the technology end of it in
terms of the you know what I like or
dislike about how the technology itself
was in
but I also look at the market end of
things I look at where the money is
going to be where the likely work is
going to be where the business is and
PHP meets all that it is it runs
roughshod it smokes the other ones in
terms of just the raw numbers this isn't
a two-to-one 80% of sites run PHP 80
percent you know suddenly 10 percent run
rubies and if less than that on Python
and so on so you know consider about
that being said I have nothing against
Python or Ruby I think the great
languages and in fact I'm going to be
built on building courses slowly
beginners courses on these two languages
I think are great and I've said it for
years and years and years now you best
learn many languages
I'm not some PHP guy who's just talking
my book you know talking my book is a
Wall Street expression meaning trying to
sell what you already have you know what
you're trying to sell kind of like banks
when they're trying to sell you
mortgages trying to tell you buy a house
that's great because that's that's their
business
they sell loans they want everybody to
be in debt because I saw they make their
money no I'm not selling my book with
PHP in fact I've logged many more coding
hours in Java that was you know when I
was really active in coding that was my
favorite language by far but I've done
commercial apps in many languages
eight nine languages over the years
stuff you've heard of so if you've never
heard of so I'm not some PHP zealot
who's like PHP is the best and listen
there are things about PHP that make me
go yeah I'm not cool but you know when
you consider all the things I just
mentioned you know this is not a
language you have you you should ignore
you know this is a language that has to
be respected for what it is anyway
that's about it that's my blog today for
January 20 no 16th 2015
