going to be doing is opening up
Dreamweaver and if you already don't
have a number of files available you can
look at the files that came with this
particular video tutorial and you can
place the CSS layout folder on your
desktop and what we're going to do is as
we always do at the beginning of any
project inside of Dreamweaver and that's
define a site so what you would do if
you're starting from scratch you've got
your folder on the desktop even if you
don't have that folder that's okay you
can work along with the video as we
progress and you'll be able to follow
along and might take you a little longer
put things together but you'll should be
able to work with this even if you don't
have the sample files but if you got the
video from killer sites com it'll come
with a few sample files so after placing
those sample files on your desktop let's
go to defining a new site and at this
case what you should really be doing is
just you know call it CSS links or nav
or something like that and here where it
says local site folder what we're going
to be doing is pointing to your desktop
and on your desktop you'll see CSS
layout that's where I told you to put it
a couple files in there nothing really
crazy but let's just open that up so
I'll choose that and also save and we'll
click OK so as you can see I've got
these elements in place and there's a
number of files in here there's one that
says fixed and if you did follow along
with us from the last time you'll
remember that this particular file I'll
just show you what it looks like this is
when we were exploring CSS layout and I
was showing you what a fixed pixel
design looks like but you'll notice that
there are no navigation elements here in
the sidebars and if I were to return
back to Dreamweaver for a second what
I'd show you now I don't really need
this one open so I'll just close that
for a second and what I'll be showing
you now is the liquid layout and that
was another thing that we
looked at when we were attempting to
work within our CSS layout techniques
and you'll see that this one has more of
a liquid layout that you know can
accommodate your screen size whatever it
was but you'll notice that here we have
a finished version of this liquid layout
and in this particular liquid layout
there are some navigational lengths and
you'll see that they swap colors just as
easily as I'm doing right here so you'll
be learning how to do that and at the
same time we'll also be looking at how
to create a navigational element that
can spend you know a horizontal area
like the header area or something along
those lines if you wish so we'll be
exploring all of these things and now
that you've had a look at what they're
going to look like I will ask you to
open up the just links HTML section now
rather than get into working with links
and list items as you'll see here I will
go to the split screen and we'll explain
exactly what's happening here in just a
second but rather than get confused with
all the other code that's going on
inside of these examples the liquid
layout and the fixed columns and stuff
like that what am I going to ask you to
do instead though is to open up to this
particular file where we can concentrate
solely on working with the list items
and in doing so what we're going to be
seeing is how to create these links and
these list items in a fashion that will
make it very easy for us to work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
