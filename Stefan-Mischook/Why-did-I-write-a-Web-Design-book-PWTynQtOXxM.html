2015 seems like ages ago I wrote a book
I wrote a book web design start here and
build your website fast or something
like that
in the American edition I have an
American edition of the and I also have
a European Edition so this is the
European edition here and this is quite
a job so I wrote a book for a couple
reasons number one I wanted to write a
book I figured it was a good thing to do
and I also wanted to really plan out the
new curriculum for studio web as best I
could
so the new curriculum for studio web at
least the first level if you will the
first set of courses included html5 cs3
html5 css3 JavaScript and PHP SQL of
course but I really wanted to refine the
html5 and css3 in the javascript portion
because these three languages hTML is a
markup language CSS is a styling
language and JavaScript of course is a
programming language scripting language
and they work together and together they
are super important in terms of the
world of coding right because you use
these three languages to create every
single website in the world every single
web app in the world and more and more
and more these three languages are used
to create mobile mobile applications
with the help of middle layer products
like PhoneGap from Adobe and I argued in
a previous video but more and more and
more people and companies are not
writing apps native code in native code
so for Android are not writing in Java
and for iOS they're not writing a swift
object to see more and more companies
are going to web languages because
they're flexible they're easy you write
once you've got a you've got your
product for Android and you've got your
product for iOS you've got your product
for Windows Phones for the for people
use Windows Phones now again in that
video I'm not going to revisit the whole
thing people are
some people might say well to speed you
know html5 based mobile apps or not as
fast as dedicated native apps if you
will yeah to certain extent for sure but
for most absolute people creating these
days the html5 based mobile apps will do
the job easily and the bigs are doing it
so anyway so there you go with that so
bottom line is these three languages
html5 css3 javascript hugely important
and if you learn a code it's a great set
of languages to learn and on top of that
I would include if you're thinking of
raw programming again I would think
Python as well but again in terms of at
the end of the day whether you conscious
type on JavaScript or PHP or whatever
other language you choose really depends
on the type of work you want to do Yetta
you can see all my videos where I talk
about that held the language you choose
is dependent on the career or the type
of work you want to do anyway just as a
reminder you can still buy this book in
bookstores across North America and
Europe get it on Amazon it's still there
even though I roll it in 2015 I wrote
this book to be evergreen meaning it is
designed that everything in here is
totally up to date because html5 CSS
javascript in terms of the basics and
the other things I cover in here have
not changed this book was designed to be
it's not too thick it's a 224 pages it
was designed to to give you what you
need and only what you need so that you
can move forward and actually build
responsive websites understand the
basics of JavaScript understand css3 and
understand the internet and the world
wide web in total that's what a lot of
courses out there see in terms of
programming web development design they
lack the foundational lessons if you
will where I teach you about the request
response cycle teach you about the
interaction between servers and clients
I hope you understand these with some
nerds might call low level
tips that are actually extremely
important low level meaning they provide
the foundation to all these other
technologies like something called HTTP
and on FTP and servers and clients etc
etc etc so I really get into that in
this book besides teaching you the nitty
gritty of building websites and web apps
a lot of the basics of web apps so for
instance I'll cover on page 106 I cover
what exactly is programming I break it
down into non nerd terms this is
actually from Chapter six
introduction to JavaScript now I'm not
teaching you detailed JavaScript in this
book but I'm giving you an introduction
so you understand you understand this
why we do jobs this is the point of it
all and for instance I introduced
object-oriented code object oriented
programming here on page 110 and you say
to yourself why would a beginners web
design book teach object-oriented
programming because even when you're
building basic websites key aspects
about what you're doing when you're
interacting or building a website has to
do with object-oriented programming
principles that's because in the end I'm
not going to get into here but in the
end underneath the covers if you will
what's going on is based on all
object-oriented principles so I go on
from there we get into all kinds of
different subjects and as I mentioned in
a previous video the key of a good
course is to just cover those key
fundamentals and then move on from there
we can't get caught up going down some
tangent exploring something that it's
really not used too much in real life
and same thing for app development so
I'm going to tie this back in again for
app developers when you're developing at
the key to developing a successful app
is to get it out the door as quickly as
possible to go from A to Z
as quickly as possible so you can put it
in front of the faces of your users and
then from there you can start refining
various components of your app depending
on user feedback right like for instance
what I just do my five pound course I
put out about 39 lessons to a group of
people to give me comment and it to be
honest with you after about 10 or 15
videos I have a pretty good idea of
what's going on you know what
people are looking at how they're seeing
things of course I've been building
courses since 2003 so I have a bit of
experience to begin with but nonetheless
you put out your product whether it be a
course or whether it be an app as
quickly as possible get your reaction
then you start going back and fixing
things along the way so I highly
recommend that if you're you are looking
to build an app because you do want to
do a startup or you have your home you
have your own product you want to
develop are you building apps for
clients building websites for your
clients get it out as quickly as
possible get it out as quickly as
possible get that feedback right when
you see the app working from A to Z that
gives you a perspective that you don't
get when you sort of caught on some one
stage of the journey if you will you
want to complete the whole thing it's
very very important and again I've
learned this from years and years of app
development experience now building
courses since 2003 and of course
business from my business experience you
don't know what product is going to work
until you get out there and you try and
sell the product you know what this is
one of these universal principles I got
that from fighting ace to tell people
one three-round sparring session with a
anybody really is worth more than months
and months of training in the gym where
you're not sparring hitting the pads
hitting the heavy bag doing drills it's
necessary don't get me wrong but I'm
telling you getting in the ring and
completing the three round fight that's
worth so much more and as a result when
I was
boxing I would I was spar especially
when I was really deep into how its 540
rounds a week 30 40 rounds a week now
we're not trying to knock each other's
heads off of course but we're sparring
pretty hard hard enough I got my nose
broken a couple of times so you know
anyway I hope this is useful
