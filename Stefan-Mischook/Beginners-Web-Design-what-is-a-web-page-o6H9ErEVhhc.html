beginner's web design course as I
mentioned in the introduction web pages
are really just text documents and
they're text documents well let me just
show you so I'm going to load up a page
this is killer sites calm and I want to
show you the text and the way you see
the TExES you after you've loaded up
your page you right click on it anywhere
and you're gonna look for something
called view page source it might be show
page source or some other text
combination what you want to look for is
a source and the source is reference to
the source of the page so we're gonna
click on that and you see this page of
code appears I'm sure those complex you
guys right now but in fact once you
understand the basics all this will
become very easy to understand you also
have to understand it this say this is a
pretty complex page it's got scrolling
top menus here it's got a video that's
embedded in there and a few other things
as well some behaviors see I click on
the button page grows up automatically
so this is all written in this source
page here and so it's a lot more complex
than your basic web page would be
regardless so what is this code this
code is largely something called HTML so
let me just read this off for you web
pages are just text pages that use a
special website building language called
HTML HTML gives instructions to web
browsers fake Internet Explorer Firefox
Chrome Safari on what to display on a
page could be text video a forum you
name it so what we just did is we looked
at the source code let me load that up
again we looked at the source code of
this page by right-clicking going view
page source so that's what you want to
take away from
this particular video is that webpages
are simply text pages and a text big
part of that is called the language of
webpages rather is called HTML and it
tells the web browsers what to do on the
page what to display on the page there's
a couple of other languages that are
used in web design and we're going to
learn one of them in this course and
it's the sister language to HTML it's
called CSS and don't worry about it now
we'll get into it later on and there's
one other language of course but you're
not gonna need to know this right now
it's something called JavaScript so this
is all in there besides the HTML CSS and
the JavaScript you have your the actual
text that appears on a page here CMS is
short of a content management system so
we're gonna learn how to identify HTML
and a page
what makes HTML HTML and we're actually
going to use HTML in our next video to
build a very simple page so before I
leave I just want to address a question
that people are probably asking is why
should I learn all this code when there
are programs web design programs like
Dreamweaver or expression web that we'll
write to code for us just click buttons
and it builds your pages the reason you
got to learn the code is twofold first
of all beats programs though they're
very good they don't do everything well
and I'm telling you right now you're
gonna still have to go into the code by
hand and make changes because there are
times when these programs just can't get
it right another reason you want to
learn to code is because to be able to
structure your pages properly you really
have to understand the basics what's
going on behind the scenes you have to
understand the code and how code should
be structured so that you can design a
clean web page in terms of in terms of
the in terms of its structure really so
for those two reasons alone you have to
learn the coding
and even beyond that if you use a web
design program primarily and the
minority of web designers will use these
fancy programs to be honest with you
most of them like to have their hands in
the code even if you want to learn how
to use web design software having the
basics in web design which are taught in
this course is going to make learning be
software packages much much much easier
than they would be otherwise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
