we're going to be looking at the
differences between movie clips and
graphic symbols well as you know both of
these are types of symbols the movie
clip symbol and the graphic symbol and
we will see the differences when we
actually select an object and we attempt
to convert it into a symbol by saying
modify and convert to symbol shortcut is
f8 you'll notice that here i'm going to
write SQ movie clip there we go and at
this point if we were to look inside of
our library we would see the SQ symbol
written here as a movie clip symbol well
one of the main reasons we use movie
clip symbols as I mentioned already is
number one because we wanted to have a
looping element inside of it or in other
words an animation inside of an
animation if you do then it's best to
create that loop with a movie clip
symbol so as you can see when I select
this my properties window it says that
this is an instance of a movie clip
that's great also notice something else
I can give this movie clip something
called an instance name now that's not
all that important right now but
eventually especially when you start
playing with some action script
eventually you're going to need to be
able to communicate with these movie
clips so first and foremost in and of
itself that's the main reason you'd
probably want to use a movie clip
however as I mentioned there's also a
difference between creating something
with a movie clip that has an animation
inside of it or something like a graphic
symbol that has an animation inside of
it and let me explain how that works so
if I were to double click this and as
you can see inside of the movie clip
symbol called square or sq as I have it
here what I see is just one frame of
animation however if I were to go to
frame to an hour to say insert keyframe
I could take this information just by
double-clicking it
here you can select all the object
inside of it and I could switch to my
free transform tool now I could just
rotate this something like this so in
other words on the first frame we have
the second frame we have that if I were
to go back to seen one you can see
number one first and foremost that we
only have one frame here on scene 1 so
i'll call this the MC or a movie clip
layer and when we double clicked it to
go inside the movie clip we saw that
there was two frames instead so if i
were to control enter test my movie
exporting the swf we would see that we
have this very very simple style of
animation happening inside here on the
other hand when we're working with
graphic symbols the animation will look
a little bit different let me show you
what I mean if I come to the library and
I see SQ foursquare I'm going to
duplicate this object but notice when
you duplicate it instead of square copy
I'll call it square graphic and I'll
convert that movie clip type into a
graphic type alright well they're both
exactly the same they both look exactly
the same if I were to take this object
and actually let me swap those around
just because my layers look a little
different say my bottom layer is the
movie clip layer and layer to the
graphic layer so in my properties window
should be able to see that this is the
graphic so i will take the graphic
symbol i'll cut it from its current
layer and i will paste it ctrl shift v
back into it's original layer so this is
the movie clip this the graphic symbol
right now the graphic symbol as you can
see also contains two keyframes that's
great right so when we press ctrl enter
we would imagine that both of these
things would be anime
but doesn't work that way the reason is
is because on the main timeline I only
have one keyframe but inside the movie
clip and inside the graphic symbol I
have two keyframes so what that shows us
what that illustrates to us is that I
can have a million keyframes inside of a
movie clip and if on the main stage it
only was visible for one frame I would
only be I would see all of the animation
wouldn't matter but if you are working
with an animation in a graphic symbol
not really the best way to do it because
as you can see here in order to view all
of those key frames I would have to
create as many key frames as is inside
the graphic symbol so for example if I
were to come here and stretch both these
out and say insert frame control enter
to test your movie Oh everything looks
great they're both moving but remember
if i were to only have one key frames
I'll remove those frames because there's
only one keyframe we only see the first
keyframe inside of your particular
object in this case the graphic symbol
but movie clip symbol shows as many
frames as you wish</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
