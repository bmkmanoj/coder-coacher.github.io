bashing on the Apple computers lately in
terms of the 2016 MacBook Pro a lot of
people have been bashing it I think the
majority of about 90% of reviews I saw
gave it yeah no no not a very inspiring
at reviews as shall we say kind of mixed
to down and there may be some truth to
it so what I did is I went out and I had
to replace my 2012 MacBook Pro because
it was getting a little a little bit too
slow for my uses and so I went out and I
took a risk and I bought the 2015
MacBook Pro and in the process I'm
saving about 600 Canadian dollars in
addition to that I got all my ports and
everything so it's kind of cool so
here's the thing though I'm not quite
sure if 215 is going to be perfect for
me in terms of what my requirements are
I'm not going to get into details so
what's the point of this blog there's
one thing you still have to give Apple
one thing you have to give Apple from my
experience the support that you get at
the Apple Store is amazing so for
example here's a policy that they have
I'm able to buy this MacBook Pro use it
for two weeks or more and they said
because at a time in a year I can keep
until January 8th
and I can bring it back no questions
asked if I find that it doesn't meet my
needs so far more of an enough time for
me to test it make sure everything works
make sure I can do the type of editing
and so forth I need to do and if I and
if it doesn't work out as bring it back
and it's done that's amazing so I am
thinking that the 215 is gonna be able
to do everything I need and more no
problem I'm gonna get that no port
issues etc etc but just in case that
it's not good enough I can bring it back
and bite the bullet and get the faster
216 version now I don't know how much
faster it is most people say if you're
not doing heavy-duty rendering with lots
of stuff
effects on video you're not going to see
much of a difference it's five maybe 10%
faster or even less than that then the
MacBook Pro 2015 again a lot of it
depends on your use case meaning what
you have to do so when I'm looking at a
computer sometimes you can get
hypnotized by the specs you know how
many megahertz is this processor which
version of the process are using yeah
but what you know we know now from
experience but a lot of times computers
are so fast these days but even if you
go from a fourth generation Intel chip
to a sixth generation Intel chip you
know I can't see much of a difference in
terms of speed you might see some
differences here and there to pay what
you do but for most of us you won't so
keep that in mind when you're looking at
buying a new computer whether it be Mac
or Windows you see in the last several
years because of the nature of CPU
technology Intel hasn't been able to
really increase the speeds that much so
for instance the fourth generation Intel
chip versus the sixth generation and the
215 MacBook Pro uses the fourth
generation if I recall and the current
one uses the sixth generation even
though the sentence just came out the
difference in speed might be 10% between
the two and that 10% speed difference
may not appear at all if you're just
doing coding and programming and
browsing the web watching videos you
probably never even come close to that
same thing with disk drive speeds now I
always tell people go with the
solid-state drives the SSD drives was a
so much faster I've been spinning
district shows spinning discs as I've
said will you see much of the difference
between the two gigabyte per second 2016
SSDs and the Macs and they have the
fastest Asus SSDs in business some
custom setup they have well you see much
of a difference between the 2,000 makes
a second the two Giga second transfer
speeds with the 2016 model versus the
1500 Meg's a second in the 21
fifteen model I'm gambling at this point
you won't see much of a difference but
here's the great thing about Apple I can
take it to 2015 play with it for two
weeks and if it's not fast enough I poke
gives you that option just bring it
right back in boom not good for me and
that's it that is kind of cool that's
premium service and yes you're paying a
premium price for these Apple computers
but you're getting a premium service and
here's one last thing I know if I
pointed out in previous videos that
people have to remember when they're
buying Apple products there's a very
very high resale value for these
computers chances are you'll be able to
get a significant percentage of the
money that you spent when you sell the
machine back to somebody else
so my 22:12 macbook pro i basically it's
a 2012 and i basically got it looks like
i'm gonna get about 35 40 percent of
what I paid for it
and you know this is a four year old
computer with Windows machines no chance
of that no chance at that unless the
high-end SSD based ones but even that
Mac has this premium right now anyway so
chances are you'll be able to sell it
for a lot of money when you decide to
upgrade that later at some later point
and that's pretty much it so I'm about
to get in deep into my new course and in
so doing I'm getting silly props to
support it so there's my first silly
prompt ciao
