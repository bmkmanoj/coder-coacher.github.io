we've created a very simple two column
layout using a float based design it was
fixed and as you can see I'm just
proving it in the browser so you can see
what it looks like and if you remember
we styled the content in the navigation
area in the main content area as well as
in the header we didn't really do
anything inside of the footer but you
know everything that we've done in the
other areas could be used in the footer
as well well at this point what I want
you to do is or what we're going to do
is to turn this two column layout
navigation and main into a very standard
very common three-column layout and with
you know the understanding of a two and
three column float based design there's
literally so many different things that
you could do if you wanted to create
multiple styles and different kinds of
layout so let's turn this two column
layout into a three-column layout in
Dreamweaver and how we going to do that
well let's go to our design that we've
been working on and as you can see you
know we've got our header area we've got
our nav area and there's a little
comment that tells us where it ends the
main area with all of the text inside of
it collapsed and the footer well in
between main and the footer what I'm
going to ask you to do is to just invent
here a little bit and we're going to
insert a div here same thing that we did
last time insert div tag now I could
write it right here in the ID but what
I'm going to do is to say new CSS rule
and at this point I'm going to ask you
to go and choose ID so when we are
choosing the ID we're going to give it
the name our call short for right column
not really anything special here and
again you can call these things whatever
you want that's part of the beauty of
working with these IDs so after we do
that the only definition I really want
to do for our call at this point here
category we're going to go to box since
the navigation on the left hand side is
200 we're going to make the width of
this one also be 200 and we're going to
float this on the right because we want
it on the right-hand side so if I click
apply
well nothing's really showing up so I'm
going to click OK and then we're going
to click OK here well first of all let's
notice there's a couple of things that
have happened well if i go to my design
view you can see that you know the ID
for right column goes here content goes
here but what you might notice is that
it's not on the right-hand side it's
just over here underneath the nav not at
all what I want so why is it doing that
and how can we you know rectify that
problem well first of all here I've got
right column here I'm just going to move
it down after the main and just before
the footer it'll make a little bit more
sense so why is it doing this well if
you remember the wrapper which is
holding the whole thing together is set
to be 900 pixels wide it's fixed pixel
so we got 200 pixels here and we also
gave the main area a amount of 500
pixels so let's go to our main and you
could either enter it in right here or
you could hit the edit button which a
little easier for you to see I'm going
to say well first of all this changes to
500 notice how it's floating on the
right-hand side as well so if we apply
this and we click OK you'll see it's not
really ok I mean this thing is supposed
to be on the right hand side but it's
not because this has been asked to float
on the right hand side as well so what
are we going to do well we want this in
the middle there is no float middle so
we have to select the main again and if
I go to category box we're going to
float this on the left and as soon as we
do that you can see now that we have our
information in place and it looks great
ok a couple of things in here first of
all we do know that this main has
padding on the top 4 10 pixels to push
the content down that's cool we're going
to do the same thing on this one but in
order to make it look halfway decent
let's grab some text and i'll even grab
this headline and i will copy it you can
say ctrl-c ctrl-v or you can go to copy
by right-clicking and now i'm just going
to paste the information in here alright
so we've got some information in here no
this is a h2 at the moment however if I
wanted to sure I can make it a h1 as
well if we go into our split-screen
let's just clean up a little bit of this
text here first and foremost I'm going
to select everything inside and collapse
it see there's my right column
information we can also separate the
information that is here so that looks a
little bit cleaner so there's right
column I'll even put in a little comment
here a little HTML comment that says
ends our call that's cool alright and
now what we're going to do is go about
styling this particular page so let's
just hit the return key here so I can
make two paragraphs as you'll see we'll
get to that in a second alright so
here's our call and if I put my cursor
inside here notice it does seem like
there's some padding in this already but
there isn't don't be fooled by what's
going on here if we were to just preview
this in the browser and certainly we can
say that you can see that you know
there's no padding on that even though
there seems to be some on this padding
here for the paragraphs but we'll just
go about making sure that all the
elements inside here will react the way
we want them to so what do I want you
have our cursor inside the h 1 i'm going
to come in here and we're just going to
be less specific and say our column H 1
let's make sure we get that same
information for the paragraph so space p
as well click OK and what do we want to
do with this well really I just want to
add some padding here on the right and
the left hand side padding at 20 that
should be good and anything else wow I
mean certainly we could go in here and
say yeah make it all verdana although
you know it's not really going to do
anything at the moment so now we can
specifically address how we want the h1s
to look so nothing else just our call h1
and i'm going to say well let's make it
white whoops not read but white let's
make it smaller in size because I want
it smaller than the other ones
I could still have it italicized if i'm
not mistaken we've got the other ones
italicized as well okay cool and maybe
just at the bottom I'll put a little bit
of padding or actually rather I'll put a
little bit of margin just at the bottom
like a little for or something just to
create a little bit more space there
alright cool so at this point I'm going
to put my cursor inside one of these
paragraphs and I'm going to try and go
here where I know that there are two
paragraphs and I'm just going to create
a new less specific are call p so what
do we want our paragraphs in right
column to look like well we already said
verdana so that's cool i'm going to make
it a little bit smaller point size than
the other one so 11 should be fine line
height not as generous as the other ones
but still I will apply some line-heights
so give us some space and you can see
that our paragraphs don't really have
space between them that's why I made two
in here so what I'm going to ask you to
do is to go to the category called box
and let's put a little margin on the
bottom of these maybe 10 pixels should
be enough so there you go now we've got
that element in place now the only thing
that I would also want to do if you
remember we generally try to avoid
putting anything on these boxes with
regards to margin or padding especially
on the left and the right hand side but
as I previously mentioned putting a
little padding on the top or the bottom
of this box not really a problem not
really going to throw things off it'll
be consistent in all your browsers and
if it's not consistent well everything
should still push down the exact same
amount for this and this and this
because i'm going to say right column
will have to edit this rule not so much
margin because if we put margin on the
top check it out look I could come in
here and say look 10 margin if we did
that you know things would move but look
it's the outside of the box that's been
moved it's not really what I want so I'm
going to take that off instead i'm going
to put 10 on the padding of the top and
notice the Box stays at the top with
everything else but it's the content
that's pushed down a little bit so if I
go to the
design view now you can see you've got
all of these elements in place we can
preview this in our browser previewing
in Safari here and as you can see good
stuff we got our three-column layout got
all of our information in place this is
a little bit smaller than this one which
is absolutely appropriate simply because
you know it's probably supplemental
information not the main information
that we're looking for in here that's
why we call this one main and this one
just our column so now you got a nice
three-column layout and what we're going
to do with this three-column layout is
in the next lesson we'll learn how to
turn this three column fixed pixel
layout if you remember fixed pixel
doesn't move it's always fixed at that
amount and we'll turn it into something
called a liquid based layout and liquid
layouts we'll have a few things that
I'll need to show you in order to make
them appear as good as you want them to
be so come back and we'll do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
