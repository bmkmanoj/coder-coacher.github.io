morning coffee I can already feel my
synapses firing off more quickly I'm
getting smarter by the second but when
you're starting off low you got a long
way to go up anyway so in this fog I'm
an answer question was put to me Steph
if you had to pick three things three
hacks that you would recommend to
improve your programming what would
these hacks be so huge acts you jacks
there we go and simple things that you
can do that is gonna save you a
surprising amount of time in your coding
because it's going to reduce mistakes
it's gonna make your code more
predictable and you're more your code
more easy to work with so start with
hack number one right at the very
beginning of your project you want to
come up with a consistent naming
convention a consistent naming
convention so let me give you a quick
example let's say you're creating
variable names what you want to do is
you want to create variable names that
are always structured in the same way so
that when you're writing your code you
may forget variable names that you used
but you probably be able to guess them
if you have a consistent naming
convention so give you example you say
to yourself okay we want to create
people we want to create people we have
users who use our system they're people
so we're gonna have people have names
your first name you have last name at
the minimum name right they have an age
a sex may be height weight depending on
the type of app that you have so how
would you create the variables to track
your users your people in your system
well you start with their names you
would say name - first or name
underscore first or name first name last
name middle you get the idea I'm
starting with the general name and then
I'm going into the specific as opposed
to a variables call first name last name
middle initial you see how that's less
consistent but if you do it the other
way where you start with the general the
name name first name last name middle
easy to write it out easy to track same
thing with the database table names so
I'm assuming we're talking about a
relational database you have tables
which will kind of like a kind of like a
spreadsheet so you would have your field
names or you have column names again it
would be the same thing they would
mirror the variable name so we name
first name middle name last this makes
it easier to keep track of your code it
makes easier to keep track of what the
data is all about you notice that the
variable names are also self describing
they describe the nature of the data as
opposed to name last name middle initial
or just initial now they kind of tell
you what's going on but by being
specific and having a set structure like
this it's going to be much easier when
you're actually deep into the coding
trust me this is born out of experience
let's continue with this example about
the person so you got the person who's
got they got an age they have a sex I
got interrupted by my parking app when
we continue so same thing with the
person person has an age they have a sex
they may have a height they may have a
weight anyway and so when you got the
person again you will go age weight
height you could this could be self
explanatory but a better way of putting
this person age person sex person height
person weight it just will make your
code much more intelligible much more
readable and it's going to pay off
usually in terms of saving your time and
debugging and understanding the code etc
so consistent naming conventions that go
from the general to specific you know
name first name is general first is
specific name last name is general last
specific you get the idea do this you
set up these naming conventions from the
beginning and you're gonna see it's
gonna help you with your debugging it's
gonna help you with your writing of the
code etc etc it's such a a simple little
hack that you could do and it will save
you a lot of time so the next hack is to
keep your methods and your functions
simple simple simple simple typically I
like to have them only do one thing
don't have functions or methods that do
five things because you're gonna have
unnecessarily complex code and as your
functions or methods do more and more
things they will become more and more
brittle so it's gonna make your apps
harder to debunk it's going to be harder
for you to extend your apps keep your
objects keep your objects keep your
functions keep your methods very simple
to the point
have them do one or two things max and
you're going to see that's gonna really
simplify the whole coding process
especially when you need to debug or
extend the code add to your code base by
having very simple objects very simple
methods and very simple functions or
functions methods same thing pretty much
it's just gonna make your coding life a
lot easier
that's hack number two fine-grained
objects fine grained methods and
functions simple easy trust me you're
gonna thank me if you do it and hack
number three which is kind of out of the
ordinary the first thing I do when I
look at a project but I'm looking at to
build a new app a new web app or any
type of app really I'm looking to write
code the first thing I do is I see
what's out there what has been created
already you might find a library that
will solve most of your problems or half
the problems have what do I mean by
problems about it will do half what you
need to do or you may find an
open-source project but does pretty much
everything that you need to do and all
you need to do is make modifications to
it so first thing you do when you're
thinking about writing some new code
starting a new project or look
out there this could be something as
complex as an app or a web app that has
a lot of complexity or it could be just
a layup before I start building my
layouts from scratch I would look to
templates you know not just visual
templates but just structural templates
in terms of the UI will save you a lot
of time you know because these days
we'll look at web apps for example
they're pretty much consistent we even
have you have a header we may have
paddles base for a front page and then
inside the site we may have a header we
may have two columns they have three
columns a rare occasion and a footer
it's pretty simple so instead of writing
all that out you could just find a very
simple template that you've leveraged
boom put it in place let's go let's go
let's go and then you modify that smart
programmers leverage other people's code
especially code that's from an open
source project or from a project that
has been refined over time so you know
it's clean they've worked out the bugs
it just makes sense so there are the
three hacks consistent naming convention
from the get-go choose it stick to it so
that's used it across your entire app
not just the code and variable names but
also in your database structure and your
directory structure and so forth pack
number two is to keep your objects if
you're doing object-oriented programming
or your functions and methods very very
fine-grain meaning limited functionality
objects do one thing the methods inside
of the object objects have one task
maybe two tasks typically I just want
one task per method one task for
function if you're doing functions based
programming you do that it's gonna keep
your code super simple and finally look
around before you start writing any code
look around to see what's out there
already
don't don't reinvent the wheel
all right those are my three hacks I
hope you find it useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
