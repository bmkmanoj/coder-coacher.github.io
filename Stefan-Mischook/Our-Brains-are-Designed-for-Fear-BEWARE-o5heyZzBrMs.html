sure I'm gonna combine this with the
previous one but whatever we'll see how
long it goes so I just wanted to cover a
couple things I have some notes here on
my my trusty pad and what are the notes
I wanted to mention a psych tip a
psychological tip as some of you know I
studied psychology in university I am
NOT a clinical psychologist not even
close I already did a couple years and I
left school to start my first business
so yeah but nonetheless I keep my hands
in it if you will because it's very
important that you understand how your
brain works I gave you tips in terms of
how to more quickly learn I talked about
frequency of exposure being more
important than the length of exposure
but you can go watch that video so in
this quick little video I just want to
talk about the primary influencer of our
brains the first and foremost is fear
fear is the number one influencer in our
brains our brains are literally designed
to pay much more attention to potential
dangers than anything else and that kind
of makes sense if you think of it in a
in an evolutionary way because if you're
killed by some predator or by following
off rocks a mountain or something that's
more important than whether you eat that
day or you pick up right it's it's such
an important thing so what happens what
has happened rather is our brains have
now become hypersensitive or much more
sensitive to fear than anything else so
that's why you see a lot of times when
people are trying to make sales when
politicians are trying to drive you they
try to use fear because they know that
consult with psychologists behavioral
psychologists they know that fear is one
of the biggest drivers so depending on
our circumstances you can use fear in
and politics that use at all time and
other circumstances you
so just an FYI just be aware of that be
aware that in your own life your
personal anxieties is this anxieties are
extension of your fears
they are typically exaggerated typically
most of the time your brain will
artificially give more power to a
potential danger or fear and anxiety but
it really deserves it's really a crazy
thing and even though I know this and
understand this intellectually I have to
remind myself so for instance when I was
in my first business actually we'll talk
about that when I was in my first
business was in the import-export
business so I'm selling product try
goods dry goods are just products on
shelves and livestock rare fish and
stuff I used to sell to Aquarians zoos
and collectors and high-end pet shops
what happens is you get into this mode
as an entrepreneur as a young
businessperson you start to said how did
we do today with the sales all our sales
are off 10% today and you start starts
bothering you bothering you even though
you know but you can't really look at
sales on a day to day basis or week to
week basis really you have to look at
sales on a quarterly basis that means
90-day basis that's the only way to
really discern whether or not the sales
are actually going up or going down
because you can always have spikes
variations within a particular week so
for example you may find that a on
Mondays I usually make a thousand
dollars of sales well just picking a
round number but all of a sudden one
Monday
you only make 800 you go help my oh no I
only made 800 today what am I gonna do
but you find out typically okay you
don't make your normal thousand dollars
on the Monday
but also on Tuesday instead of making a
thousand you make twelve hundred or
maybe maybe you make on Tuesday eleven
hundred and
and Wednesday you make another 1100 and
the cutter smoothes out makes the
difference so you have to look at things
those stretched out over again in
business that's why if you look at the
stock market companies will report their
earnings and their progress every
quarter every three months a quarter is
three months because there's four times
three months in a year
here's divided up to four right every
three months anyway so that's why they
report quarterly cuz that's a much more
accurate way of assessing how well a
company is doing so there you go I hope
this entrepreneur psychology lesson is
of interest to you you can apply to
every aspect of your life when you're
considering things considering what's
bothering you what's worrying you try to
try to step out of yourself emotionally
and try to look at something more
without emotion so you could at least
better assess what it is that's going on
now I learnt this in martial arts
I learned this a lot in boxing as well
well boxing is martial arts I suppose
and what are the things one of the big
breakthroughs for me in boxing was the
ability to get into the ring and spar
and fight but we'd go at it hard
full-contact I got my nose broke twice
that's how hard we to go but when I was
able to get in there and not my problems
I used to get when some would hit me I
was like I want to hit him back and
right away and sometimes I get a little
ticked off like he hit me not some wrong
attitude I learned that the better
fighters will try to evoke anger or fear
anxiety on their opponent because they
know if you get your opponent mad you
get them scared you get them anxious you
get a mad their game will diminish their
ability to fight will actually become
less effective so good fighters will do
that that's why sometimes you see
they're taunting and so on before
ordering because they want to get their
opponent off their game by getting them
emotional so in your business career and
your coding career if you start getting
anxiety start getting angry or you start
getting little scared you got to calm
those emotions down so that you can have
a stronger mind when you're looking at
situations that may occur I hope that
make sense one of the tricks is to
control your heart weight or heart rate
because your body your brain rather it
will take cues about what's going on
cues it will take you will get messages
about what's going on based on how it
it's your body is acting so you can use
your intellectual brain to send signals
back to your lizard brain to calm
yourself down and to give you confidence
so one thing they've learned in
psychology is the power poles where you
to stand up straight and you hold this
for a minute what they find is the brain
said hey this guy's this girl is
confident and they start sending
different chemicals into the body to
feel more confident it's just and it
feel more relaxed and that's one way
another way and a lot of the old
religions and they understood this is
through breathing now you have all these
autonomic functions in your body right
your heart your liver always controlled
unconsciously you not you're not
thinking I gotta make my heartbeat right
not like we're not like when you do this
with your hand
it's automatic it's autumn autonomic so
the only way to control the the the
heart intellectually is to control your
breathing you slow down your breathing
you slow down your heart rate you slow
down your heart rate it calms down the
whole body it comes down the nervous
system it's like a feedback loop you
know when you're nervous your heart
beats faster right so you'd be breathing
slow - no no two seconds in one second
out
so you're starting to feel anxious etc
just stand straight relax
pretty slowly slow down your heart rate
and you'll see that you'll start to calm
down emotionally and then you can make
better decisions you'd be able to handle
circumstances whatever your coding
wherever your entrepreneurial of your
whatever you're doing I hope that helps
