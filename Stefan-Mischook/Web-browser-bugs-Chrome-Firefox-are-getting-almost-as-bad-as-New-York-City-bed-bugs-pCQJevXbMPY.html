just a quick comment i'm recording this
in late august 2016 and i just want to
say that the browser's now the web
browsers whether it be chrome firefox
edge especially edge oof they are we
getting getting buggy again they are
getting buggy again I've seen it many
times now whether it be on my own apps
or going on YouTube or Facebook or
whatnot the browser's 10 dev is caching
problems so it causes all kinds of funky
behaviors so if you're using Chrome or
Firefox or something you go on our
website and the say the videos are not
loading properly for some reason it
could be your browser's cache it's just
some some weird bug and it's a screwing
things up so the way you solve eyes you
you flush your cash you flush your cash
your flush your cookies and that
typically solves some of these issues
with the browser's yeah I've noticed
that they become you know even Google
Chrome which used to be a great it's
getting a little bit buggy now and
sometimes things don't work sometimes
you might have some weird session stuff
going on if you don't know server-side
programming you wouldn't know what
sessions are but again just know and
it's a little warning a little alert for
developers the web browsers are getting
buggy they're having issues usually has
to do with state so that means flush
your cash and it could solve a lot of
problems for you and it's actually with
my own apps for some institutions are
using it's a protocol right now it's an
official protocol I put forth must flush
your cash just the case doesn't happen
all the time may happen made to three
percent of the time but it does happen
and it's annoying another thing that
should point out is that Microsoft edge
browser fast it is but it is really a
mess it's difficult Microsoft though
they're doing some cool stuff with their
surface pro line of products it's buggy
software it's like
one point the touch screen for instance
was so amazingly smooth use a boom boom
boom boom and now it's giving me trouble
half the time it doesn't work you gotta
hit it a few times like Microsoft gets
you game together like you know like I
hope I hope Apple get your game together
Apple's selling Hardware from the 1950s
and charging people top dollar and all
that come on let's get together these
these companies are getting lazy I hope
that it'sit's vaccine because you look
at windows for instance it's really a
Windows 10 is a super modern operating
system but you know these bloody instant
updates they cripple things or hobble
things right now like I said it's very
annoying on their device on their
flagship device the touchscreen it
starts giving me problems now where I
used to work fantastic you know it's not
huge but it's annoying it's annoying and
especially when you knew was working
before an apple you know their operates
this of it very smooth it's it's a great
operating system but looking a little
long in the tooth you know what I mean
it's like it seems kind of old in some
respects and it's not meant to be at
this because overall I think it's still
the best most stable operating system
out there but more importantly the CPUs
that they're using in their macbook pros
and stuff are really getting dated I
Victor like two generations behind or
something so it's time for them to get
up to date you know so that people can
get to work thanks a lot bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
