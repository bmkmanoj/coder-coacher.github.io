interviewing for a tech job a developer
job I just hired somebody recently so I
figured it might be a good video since
it's fresh in my mind so what do I look
for when i'm looking for developers
number one I'm looking for somebody who
answers calls somebody who responds to
emails and reasonable time frame
somebody who shows up to meetings on
time so if you're going in for your
first interview whether it be for a
full-time position or maybe you want to
pick up a contract be on time be on time
to the meetings I know this seems kind
of silly to mention it but trust me this
is something a lot of nerds ignore if
you have a meeting for nine in the
morning be sure that you're there five
before nine in fact what I would suggest
to do is that you figure it's going to
take you half an hour to get to your
meeting give yourself an hour if you
show up a half hour early sit in the car
have a coffee take a break whatever
don't show up a half hour early because
that's kind of rude as people plan out
their days show up five minutes before
10 minutes before max but don't be late
this is huge because they're going to
judge you partly based on whether or not
to show up in time a good friend of mine
is a movie Skeltah not a movie scalp a
rather a location manager and he says
he's one of the biggest in in our city
and it says he says a big part of us his
successes that he just answers calls and
shows up up time so that's your first to
second tip you should research the
company you are going into interview
with before you go in there try to
figure out what they're doing what the
history is what kind of technology
they're working with so you can bone up
before you go into the meeting on what
they're doing so let me give you a
hypothetical example let's say if they
are a PHP house and they work with the
laravel framework as an example you
first of all you should have
skills in that area never lie about what
you can do i'm assuming with you know
larry bell but be sure you're up to date
in terms of the laravel community you
know what people are looking at with
laravel is what's hot in laravel that
day what are the popular aspects of the
framework we're prob popular plugins if
you will I'm using generic terms just in
case there's no laravel point is be sure
when you go into the meeting you know
about the company you know what they're
working on you know what technologies
they work with and be sure but you're up
to date at least with the latest news in
terms of those technologies and of
course don't go for a job and lie about
what you do you know or you don't know
when you do go into a job expect or to
interview for the job expect to be asked
questions that are relevant to their
particular work so that goes back to my
second tip where I said you gotta get
ready and understand what to working on
so expect them to ask you questions
about what you know what you've done is
so forth at the same time you should be
aware of the technology stack that
they're working with so you can put
questions to them so you can say for
instance let's say you were doing Python
I'm going on a Python course now sorry
if its top of my head say well what
would do you use Python to or to use
Python 3 that kind of question so you
can ask those those sorts of things are
few developing games are using pygame or
using whatever else TK in turn I never
know how to pronounce that properly but
anyway you get the idea be aware of what
they're doing an environment they're
working with what i mean by environment
i mean the technology they work with and
be prepared to answer and ask questions
this will show an interest this will
instill confidence in you if you're
you're curious about all these sorts of
things my final tip is to prepare your
resume so that it makes sense for them
so if the job again to use the same
example is a lair about job there's no
point in you
putting in but you know how to use
Dreamweaver cs4 or illustrator or
Photoshop or something you should
emphasize in your resume whatever skill
sets that they are looking for and this
is assuming of course these are things
which you want to work on as well i had
a friend of my friends for instance was
somebody who had a lot of experience
with assembler and there's a huge demand
for cellular coders but he hated writing
assembler code so he just took it right
out of his resume they don't want people
to see it because he would get offers
and people costs constantly when I hired
him to do assembler coating now I'm not
dissing assembler it's just a type of
coating he didn't like to do so I'm sure
somewhere people are going nuts now but
the point is is to be sure to structure
your resume for what you want to do and
of course for what your prospective
client or employer wants to see so
emphasize the skill sets that you know
and that they want and don't BS them
make sure you if you say you've done
there about for three years be sure but
you're done for three years or you say
you know Larry laravel well you've done
it fine now doesn't mean just say Larry
valve where I said to you before don't
put in skill sets or not you know
relevant photoshop and dreamweaver is
not relevant in that area in this
context rather or or in this example but
saying that you know these other PHP
frameworks zen or code igniter or
whatever that is relevant because it
shows it at least you know these other
frameworks so very go those are my tips
in terms of how you should approach
presenting yourself for a new job always
go in there be on time speak well don't
be don't be a jerk be don't be rude
don't be arrogant and be curious about
what they are doing and be sure that you
bone up beforehand meaning you're up to
date with regards to the technologies
that they are using so that you can
answer questions more easily and ask
questions of them as
well so you go if you do that your
chances of getting workers far higher
that's for sure alright chop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
