working on our CSS file so the first
thing I want to do is a couple general
styles so I'm gonna add body you know
add font-family:arial I had a background
of a very light gray I lied a margin of
zero padding I'll be able to six pixels
upper padding and then zeros for the
rest and I'll default it to a thirteen
pixel font size now below the body I
usually like setting the margins on
paragraph tags so I'm going to do that
here margin and I'm going to set it to
16 pixels top and bottom and zero left
and right and then let me include styles
for elements within the page so the
first one is rapper has a width of nine
hundred pixels and a padding of twenty
pixels I'm going to give it a white
background and use margin:0 auto to
center this rapper in the center of the
page and I'll add a border top of three
pixels solid black and I guess the other
last thing I should do is just make sure
there's a little bit of bottom margin on
the page I usually don't like it when
the page cuts off very abruptly so I'm
going to modify this element so zero top
margin Auto right margin 20 pixels
bottom margin and auto left margin there
you go and within the wrapper we have an
h1 tag
and I'm just gonna add margin top is
zero because it was a default margin
that's on h1 elements can add a padding
left of 20 pixels and below the h1 is
the banner and I'm gonna leave that
alone for now but I have to come back
and edit this in a couple minutes I just
need to show you what I need to add but
below the banner is a nav you know add
margin:0 padding:0 this style of none so
we don't want the list items within it
to have any bullets or anything like
that background of light gray a width of
900 pixels and overflow:hidden this will
make sure that it contains the elements
within navigli
so within nav I have a couple list items
those left items will all be floated
left and some of those list items we
have a tags and we want to float those
left as well and then let's add a couple
bits of additional styling here add some
padding and you do 10 pixels above and
20 pixels left and right so 10 pixels
top and bottom only pixels left and
right display:block so these little
items expand to contain the padding
fully
of border right one pixel solid gray and
this will just add a little bit of a
divider element between the nav items a
background of a light gray font size of
12 pixels font-weight:bold
text-decoration:none so my apology is if
I'm going a little bit fast here but
most of this stuff should be pretty
self-explanatory
and you can always pause the video and
catch up if you need to so just a couple
more CSS Styles I need to add I also
want to add a hostile to the navigation
to nav Ally a:hover
I'm just going to change the background
color I'm gonna change it to its
slightly darker gray okay so navigation
is set let's add a couple styles for the
content I'm going to add a minimum
height of 300 pixels just so that we
have some sort of page even if there's
very little content on that page as a
minimum height set padding of zero top
and bottom and 20 pixels left and right
and an overflow hidden and this will
contain our floated elements within
content I have left which I'm going to
float left I'm going to give it a
padding of 20 pixels top and bottom and
zero pixels left and right and this too
I'm going to give a min height of 300
pixels
and content dot right almost the same
thing except float right oh I missed it
important declaration up above we need
to add a width of 630 pixels to dot left
and for the right you also need to add a
width of 200 pixels like I said that's
gonna float right margin top I'm going
to add a margin top of 62 pixels and
padding of zero in the emergent top is
to adjust for the h2 tag that we have on
our test page this so it moves things
down so this text lines up with the text
here and there we're almost done here
so footer want to make sure that clears
any floated elements text-align:center
fontsize of 11 pixels just to make
things small
padding-top of 20 pixels and finally a
boy to top one pixel solid and a light
gray so let me save this and let's do a
quick preview of test there we go so
this is what it looks like so far and
pretty basic
let me just tweak two things first of
all I mentioned that I needed to add
some styling to the banner and you'll
notice there's a bit of a white gap here
between the banner and the navigation
and that can be fixed by adding line
height of 0 and a font size of 1 pixel
there we go so that moves things up
correctly and the last thing that I want
to do is within our navigation it looks
like we need to set a text color so
color I'm just going to set it to black
there we go so just over the last video
you've created a basic HTML and CSS
based page nothing super fancy here but
this will give us the website that you
need to work with we're going to go
ahead and convert these texts here
blocks to actual editable text using the
content management system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
