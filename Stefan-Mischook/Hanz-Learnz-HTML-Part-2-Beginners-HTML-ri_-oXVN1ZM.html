created let's actually launched it in
internet explorer and see what happens
there's nothing there there's nothing
there because we actually haven't
written any HTML code so it's like a
blank website exactly now one way we can
confirm that besides seeing that we
don't see anything here now you can do
this in any web browser I'm using
internet explorer 9 and you can tell
just by going to help about internet
explorer if you're using internet
explorer 9 or above you'll be fine if
you're using Firefox Safari or Chrome
it's all pretty much the same those the
web browsers exactly I'm using internet
explorer 9 because I'm guaranteed out
windows users will have it and also
there's a special little feature in
internet explorer 9 which is going to
make our lives a little bit easier okay
so first of all let's take a look at
this page behind the scenes so you do
that by going right clicking in a
browser window right and selecting view
source source its sources in reference
to that or look we want to view the
source of this web page what makes up
the web page exactly okay so let's
select that and you see this little text
window pops up and of course we see
nothing because if you live and put
anything there exactly let's take a look
at a page but actually has code in there
so going to this site yeah Jim sites com
so we're going to right click on that I
think this is your web page it's one of
our websites yes kazillion so we hit
view source look at that now now we see
a bunch of code there's a lot of code in
there yes there is like oh but that's
because there's a lot of stuff going on
now a lot of his code is HTML but
there's also some other code in there as
well and there's just text that we see
in the page so if you look at the page
there's a lot of stuffing and animations
we got video in bed we got a little
minute even all this stuff that we see
on the web and the web pages is all of
this is basically text exactly because
what HTML does or just take a look at
that again all this code does here it
tells the browser what to display on the
page right so sometimes it can be text
sometimes it can be images video etc
okay now there are a couple other
languages over being that are being used
on this page one is called CSS and one
other is called JavaScript but it's not
necessary use these things to create a
web page HTML is enough to create basic
websites it's all you need yes so this
looks complex now I'm sure and this is
actually pretty complex code but simple
web sites are actually simple and once
you understand the basic rules of HTML
this will become pretty easy to
understand it's just like bodybuilding
you know you've got to pick up the
weights and if you do it in the right
way then you can build stability body
now that we've seen all this let's
actually build a very first page but I'm
excited it's going to close this so
actually no that was a mistake so I'm
going to open that up again in internet
explorer now what you're going to do in
internet explorer you're going to go to
file edit with notepad oh it's right
there and no pad will launch you can use
notepad on Windows and on Mac will be
text edit to edit your web pages
basically we're looking for a simple
text editor that doesn't add any extra
special things to the page that's why
you're using notepad exactly if you used
word or wordpad or something more
complex like that you went it could mess
up your pages so we can't change the web
page on the web page we've got to use
some kind of text editor exactly you
have to be able to go in there and
manipulate that code or add code
situation it's like going into the gym
what I've done to save us time okay what
is this this is the basic building
blocks this is basic HTML that every
modern web site uses today all right now
this is very very simple but I'm going
to we're going to keep it simple for
this particular video so that you just
get an idea of what's going on now HTML
code is basically just the body and that
is again but it's a little different a
little different so before we get into
the tags now these are all called tags
right right there HTML tags and the code
is just written using standard English
words like head and body and title and
there's also some other tags that don't
use each the dull use English words
essentially tags are sets of texts that
are formatted in a particular manner
that the browser understand it's a
language like you know weird bodies
built in a specific way we know what it
says yeah and in HTML the tags a
specific meaning as well so here's a tag
we started with body weight and here's
another body tag now these are different
tags they're the same tag but this is
the opening of the tide and this is a
closing of the tank and he knows closing
because we have the ford / like a door
that opens and closes yeah it kind of
looking that way yeah so this is dis
symbol is the symbol what you see on
your keyboard it's the same key as the
question marking yeah that's it so when
we back up a few steps now all the tags
start with an angled bracket the pointy
bracket okay the name of the tag it
closed with the pointy bracket this is
the opening tag because tags come in
pairs opening tag and this is the
closing tag again the same format pointy
bracket closing pointy but what you have
is the forward slash here that tells the
browser that this is a closing tag okay
of course you get the name of the tag as
well body open body opening of the body
closing of the body opening of the head
closing of the head</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
