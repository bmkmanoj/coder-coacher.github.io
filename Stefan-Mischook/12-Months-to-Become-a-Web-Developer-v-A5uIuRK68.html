is sent to me by somebody who watches my
YouTube videos so I figured I was going
to do it in this format using my webcam
because this is easy so currently I am
working on Amazon warehouse but the job
is killing me yeah you can see me as it
doesn't make any sense to me
and for the last three years I'm working
at night you know what forget I'm not
going to read the whole thing I'll just
tell you what's going on so you have
somebody here who after getting through
some pretty tough challenges in their
life decided that they are going to take
six months to year to become a web
developer and live off their savings and
maybe do some part-time work that's cool
now here's the thing I would suggest
that instead of going full-time to learn
how to code and I think he's already
he's already learned how to code now so
instead of dropping your work cutting
off your income then learning how to
code and then putting yourself under a
lot of pressure they're not a code on
the side as you still work you got money
coming in you're paying your bills
relaxing by the way you should always
try to save every month even if it's a
small amount try to save maybe 10% of
your salary every month as a beginning
place anyway so learn the code on the
side get through the basic real quick
concentrate on those fundamentals as I
said if you're looking for freelance
work you want to go to the web stack
html5 css3 javascript and then maybe
jump to PHP I think that would be your
best choice or maybe Ruby or something
but PHP is probably the best choices
that you can do with WordPress and so
forth again as I've said in so many
videos check out where the demand is in
your area then that will be
different will be different in different
areas depending on that local demand you
make your choice and turns or the type
of work and what he's also pointing out
is that he's actually doing projects
side projects for friends it is with
friends days and that's very cool that
is the key to key is actually got your
fundamentals down is to jump into some
real projects so let me tell you a quick
story about how I got my first
server-side database-driven coding gig
now I had done a lot of web design gigs
but I never did server-side programming
before I knew a bit of JavaScript at the
time so this is in 96 maybe I think it's
96 maybe 97 and I got approached to do a
job a database driven website which is
the old term for what we call web apps
now and so I went in there and based on
my knowledge of clients I quality
meaning HTML and a touch of JavaScript
CSS wasn't really there at the time I
did a rough guesstimate about how much
time it would take me to build this
project so I gave him a quote on 30 days
and come hell or high water I was going
to make sure that this gets done but at
the time I didn't know anything about
databases I didn't know anything about
server-side coding so what I did is
right after I solidified deal got to
check my 33 up front 33% which I talked
about in other videos I went straight to
the bookstore at the time I don't even
Google I don't even think was around at
the time and if it was it was too
primitive so the search engine is and
going online for video courses just
didn't exist so what I did is I go to
straight to the book store and I
remember picking up rocks
WRL X they were big publisher back in
the dot-com era I believe there they
were bought up or they're no more at
this point but anyway so I bought a book
a couple books on what was the hot new
web development technology of time ASP
Microsoft active server pages
and ASP was something that worked on
Microsoft web servers and but but rather
it was far superior than the current
standard which was CGI based programming
with Perl or sometimes C and it was just
so much faster and it was the first that
I know of page base server-side paradigm
if you will now the language that we use
to create ASP pages was leave the VB
script for JavaScript although 99% of
people just use VB script so what I did
is like I went straight from the client
to the bookstore I bought the two books
and at this point like I said I knew
nothing about databases I've you nothing
about server-side coding I had done it
just to touch a JavaScript and I knew my
HTML you know at those in those days was
HTML Photoshop you have CSS and you made
everything out in HTML tables to get the
design you wanted anyway I figure I
digress so i sat there I had 30 days to
do this and it was a pretty involved at
the previous company that I was was web
built the app for his company I built it
with pearl pearl CGI and after a year it
still didn't work properly but I gambled
that I could get it done in a month with
this brand new technology for
Microsoft's active server pages was that
much more efficient than a pro CGI
anyhow I got home with these books sat
down one page at a time boom boom went
through wrote out the Coase up databases
I was using the demo everything was
shooting access I think it was the back
end database just to sort of practice
learning how to code in VB script ASP
classic ASP as they call it today and I
pulled it off not only did I pull it off
within 30 days the app worked very well
right away and it was not so much
because I was a good great coder
anything was my very first paid
server-side programming gig it worked
because I was able to leverage new
technology but other people
you touched at that time and it was
significantly better the classic ASP and
active server pages as it was just
called back then was significantly
better than Perl CGI in terms of
performance in terms of speed of runtime
speed it's just much better so that's
why I was able to do it was able to do
in a fraction of time even though I was
a noob that being said because of my
martial art background because of my
tendency towards simplicity and my
tendency towards modularity from working
in my previous business where I was
building central water purification
systems were fish so those story I was
fortunate or lucky enough that I had
that perception of advanced development
because of that the principles rather
from my business and martial arts work
allowed me to actually execute my code a
little bit more of an advanced level
than the typical beginner coder
because I had I was highly experienced
with other systems other types of
systems so that makes sense
so anyway holds what's the point of the
story this is man you know you don't you
don't need six to twelve months to get
into the market I think that once you do
two or three projects which you could
get done in a couple months you might be
able to find yourself a good entry level
paying job so just keep at it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
