Studio web com before I get into this
video blog I just want to quickly
mention yeah Harold Ramis star of
Ghostbusters director of Caddyshack dies
at 69 sad day februari 24th he wrote all
kinds of great stuff animal howls blah
ghostbusters you know Caddyshack etc
many um alright so in this particular
video blog I want to talk about
something I address and a bunch of
tweets that I put out lately what
recently excuse me it's all about
learning code now as you guys know I you
know besides the killer sites we do the
studio web system which schools are
using now and now we have the academy da
studio web which is basically the same
system that schools are using with the
certification but available to the
public this is your basic interactive
training etc anyway so here we go so one
of the things I'm seeing out there in
their attempts to try to teach kids what
people are doing coming out with these
these coal block visual gooey type of
programming languages if we're going to
call it that I guess the IRA suppose
when you drag virtual blocks of code but
not code you see these blocks you know
so a block that shows you an if and a
block that shows you this and that they
kind of sort of do sort of programming
and the ideas introduce concepts and to
teach kids program now the problem with
this is that well I don't I don't
believe it I don't believe in the GUI
drag-and-drop programming as i put here
because number one because there are no
there are no popular programming
languages that are drag-and-drop
gui-based it's all hand code it's all
coated stuffs the texas you see real
code it's not not blocks and so if you
teach so many basic concepts of program
ring with blocks and images and gooey
type of stuff you're not really teaching
them the skills that they need to become
real programmers in the real world I
can't think of a top any language these
days that are you know it's actually
used in real work that uses a visual
system of drying blocks into place it's
actually an inefficient method now you
can argue teaching people how to code
with visual blocks and so on can have
some utility in the sense that it will
teach them basic concepts and so on it
may be too little extent yeah I would
say the most you can get out of teaching
people how to cope with these GUI based
systems GUI short for a graphical user
interfaces is maybe five percent of the
way but I could get you five percent of
the way instead of over where you know
to three days of dragon blocks around we
could do it in you know ten minutes with
code teaching see the key to teaching
code properly is having good teachers
and and teachers will know how to teach
but also teachers with no code
understand how to teach the important
parts of coding and programming that's a
that's admittedly a rare combination to
find someone who can teach you in on
stats code at the same time so I can
understand why various companies and
various organizations are trying to
figure out some clever way and I in my
opinion gimmicky ways to try and teach
code but that's just me another reason
why I don't believe in a GUI the visual
code editors of you all verses writing
real code is because one of the
functions of becoming a programmer one
of the things you have to do a coder in
general is you have to develop what I
call the nerd eyes the ability to look
at code and just to see very quickly
even at a glance once you have some
experience whether code is structured
properly where there might be some
problems in the code
and it's it it comes with time and it
comes with experience you know it's kind
of like a sec my father is a hunter and
when he goes hunting he can you know be
walking in the bush and he'll he'll see
like you know 50 meters away go so look
you see the Partridge under that Bush
there at two o'clock and i'm looking at
I can't see it but because he's
experienced he said he has the trained
eye to be able to see that Partridge
hidden their camouflage 50 meters or
whatever meters away where I can't see
it he keeps trying to point it out to I
just can't see it same thing with code
that's what nerd eyes is all about you
have to start working with code as
quickly as possible so you can see
what's going on in the code base as
quickly as you know easily so when I
talked about you know the GUI based
training programming languages and I say
that with hesitation but you know I
think about the top languages that are
used today Java PHP JavaScript Ruby
Python C++ object to see none of these
things uses Lego blocks or visual blocks
of code it's all hand written code so
you have to if you're going to be T
somebody coding you have to quickly get
them in front of code so they can start
developing those nerd eyes that's just
my two cents from teaching this stuff
since 2003 and I believe that you don't
need the gimmickry of visual coding
systems or training tools to teach
people called you just need good
teachers that's about it next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
