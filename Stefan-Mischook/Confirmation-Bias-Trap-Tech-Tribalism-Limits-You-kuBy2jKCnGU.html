going to be an unusual video for this
particular channel it's a tech channel
it's about careers and code well may
seem unusual but it's actually very
relevant so what I want to talk about
now is a psychological phenomena called
confirmation bias and which leads me to
a larger point the larger point is when
you are making decisions when you are
making important decisions in your life
or in anything whether it be hardware
software whatever outside of work inside
of work you should try to make your
decisions you should try to make your
decisions as dispassionately as possible
without emotion if you you see yourself
at the store and you're looking at an
iphone or android or looking at this
computer that computer or even
considering this programming in that
programming language and you start
feeling in a physiological or an
emotional response to the decision if it
gets you excited because what's nice I
always suggest you cool your heels and
when you send us a college you realize
that most people all just about
everybody 99 cent at a time 99 percent
of people make the decisions based on
the monkey brain the lower brain lower
brains like huge versus our higher level
cognitive brain and so we make most of
our decisions based on these these
low-level impulses emotion feelings and
so what's confirmation bias confirmation
biases is a interesting phenomena
happens in humans all the time in that
once you have an idea our perception
about something then your brain is going
to be looking for evidence of that basic
perception your brain is always looking
for patterns that way so what does that
mean so if you feel that Apple has the
best operating system you're always
going to be your mind is going to be
then structured your brain is going to
be biased to look for good things about
apple mac OS or iPhones of your die
phones you're always going to be looking
at how great it is and you're going to
be avoiding subconsciously
or consciously all the negatives and
that's why you see people to get caught
in these camps and it's hard for them
get out so think it politically if
you're a Democrat then everything
Democrats do is good most you know and
the things are not so good you kind of
excuse them new come up with excuses wow
they do it you know and if you're
democrat and everything Republicans do
they're terrible and the vice versa so
and I see that in political races but I
also see that in things like a hardware
that you know I would see huge battles
Mac guys versus window guys or PHP guys
versus Ruby guys you know I mean it's a
so on so forth picky pick your language
pick your group and they're gonna have
fights and the people who are on one cap
will be looking for holes and the other
cap and vice versa and it's all about
emotional gratification and I confuse
people because I don't have that for
some reason I've always been an eclectic
by choice and I think what it is because
of always looking for the best routes
I'm not looking to sort of reinforce a
position for me my number one
motivations always has been what is the
truth you know what is the actual truth
so that's why I know all these
programming languages because i would
say okay let's explore this one okay
what's let's explore c sharp how does it
differ from java looks it explored
javascript once its core PHP let's
explore excited excited excited cetera
and this is something that is just in my
nature i did in martial arts I did
martial arts for well almost like it's
almost 30 years steady and if that many
different styles from traditional
systems to fighting systems from you
know from kung fools to see lad to
boxing to wrestling to judo etc etc etc
etc and I I did this because I was
always looking for different ideas
different points of view because I felt
that you know at the end of the day
nobody has all the answers not one
system solves all the
what's that old expression when there's
once shoe size does not fit all that
kind of thing all I'm suggesting to use
when you're going through your coding
life of your choosing languages and
technologies and whatnot try not find
yourself in a camp yes you may like
Apple today they may be the best today
but be open to the possibility that
something better might come out come out
somewhere else be open to that
possibility you know you may be a Python
guide today the python is amazing but be
open to the possibility that another
language may come out you know another
framework might come out them it could
be better it could be advantageous given
a certain circumstances yadda yadda
yadda all suggesting to use be open to
new points of view new ideas it's only
going to strengthen you now I should
point out I'm one of these type of guys
who for instance doesn't care about
sports teams I come in my jaw and
everybody's almost religiously follow
the Montreal Canadiens and I and it
always freaks me out how if the
Canadians are doing really well all my
friends are like happy it's like think
they're doing oh wow we're doing really
good and they always refer to the
Canadians as we so how we're doing this
week how do we do how we do and i and i
would i'd be a bit of a party pooper i
go what do you mean we so you're not
part of the canadians make a while our
team they're not your team you don't own
the team the muslims the rich family the
muslims family on the team you have
nothing to do with the team you're
nothing to do with them you haven't just
live in the same city as them that's all
if they win you get no money if they win
you get no money if they do really well
what does that do for you it makes you
feel good because you've been told
you've been you've been tribal eyes into
thinking that somehow your sports team
does well that you do well but the
reality is it doesn't have any impact on
you whatsoever it's all been you've been
hip literally hypnotized into believing
that if your sports team
well but you're going to do well it's
it's all kind of silly it's it's not
silly it's it's remnant of our lower
brains of our monkey brains the monkey
brains are very tribal and how does that
work why do so many people so feel so
good about if they're city sports team
does well whether it be football
basketball hockey baseball whatever why
don't if you know why don't you feel
good about that and I think it comes
down to this it comes down to the monkey
brain it comes down to tribalism and
what it is is that the if you think
about our troop of monkeys you got a big
troop of monkeys and the alpha monkey in
your group if he is able to beat up the
alpha monkey of the competing tribe then
you keep your you keep your spot you get
all the fruit and the trees on your tree
but if your alpha monkey gets gets the
the crap kicked out of him by the other
troops alpha monkey then your tube gets
kicked out at a nice tree and you know
that the fruit and you could get killed
so it made sense with the beta monkeys
are all go and go alpha monkey kick ass
kick ass all right you did really well
all right kick ass so it's very much in
our lower brain to want to support the
alphas and the alpha monkeys and in our
culture today for better for worse the
sports stars are the Alpha monkeys
they're the alphas so it's it really
preys upon this whole sports team thing
it really preys upon our lower brain
function which is very powerful
influence around us and that's why
marketing by the way it always appeals
to the lower brain there doesn't try to
appeal to the higher intellect because
they know that the lower brain is a far
greater influence on us and other things
and then our cognitive minds at her
thinking minds there's gray area and
depends on people some people are a
little bit more influence than others
and so on but all I'm suggesting to you
i'm not saying sports are back before
people with nuts enjoy sports i used to
love watching boxing but when i would go
to a boxing match and i would go I would
go great great seats and you know
Atlantic City Las Vegas while I was big
into boxing and but I never cared who
won the fight I was not a cool Mike
Tyson or go Mayweather ago all I cared
about was the actual sporting events i
was a student to boxing I boxed a lot so
for me it was about the execution to see
who I'm boxing it's literally bad to see
who was gonna play the game better you
know and I wanted to see a real good
game whoever won one that was that was
cool with me as long as it was a fair
match so again coming back to technology
coming back try not to make decisions
based on emotion ality try not to be
tribal I suggest to you do what you want
in the end but the advantage of this is
that you're going to be free thinker if
you're not tribal and I think if you
remember that old movie I guess it's old
now the matrix and the matrix is really
all about that you know at the beginning
that you're going to take the red or the
blue pill it's about opening your mind
up to to you know getting outside of the
frameworks that are better pulls upon us
getting outside the tribal mindset
whether it be about sports teams whether
it be about politics whether it be about
macro windows or linux whether it be
about PHP Java Python or Ruby whatever
you know try not to get religious
remember i did a video a little while
back when i'm just talking about i said
i wouldn't learn ruby today and i was
clear to point out but Ruby on Rails and
ruby has some great things about the
languages like I wasn't dissing the
languages but I said I wouldn't get into
today because of the market forces
nothing nothing more and I got some guys
they were attacking me viciously if you
look at the thumbs down a lot of thumbs
out those are all Ruby people who are
tribal right there trouble you're
attacking our tribe we got to attack you
they couldn't even he couldn't hear what
I was saying yeah it's good it's a good
it's a good language is a good framework
but you know I talked how you know I
wouldn't learn it today for the reasons
I specified but they get so wait it's so
tribal its soul
brain monkey right I couldn't care if
somebody came to me today I said this is
we're gonna pay you big money and we
want you to do Ruby rail there okay
whatever I'll do it like care you know
today I do what I do typically are my
apps or PHP based because a whole bunch
of advantage I spoke about before these
days but I've written apps in many
different languages and who knows where
apps i might be involved with in 34
years they might be in Ruby Dee I don't
need to be in rube of it Chancellor lb
Python or Java Script or PHP one out of
three you know that's it so I hope this
blog made sense to you if you like it
please give me a thumbs up you know that
tells me that it's a good video and I
should do more like this I'm
experimenting with the idea as you may
or may not know of the long-form videos
like this one where i talk a little bit
longer versus the short form videos
where I just sort of to stick to a micro
subject so we'll figure it out maybe I
can sort of put a note that you know
this is a long one course you can just
look how long they are some people tell
me they like to listen listen to this a
little bit in the background while they
are having a coffee so I can understand
how three minute video would be annoying
in that situation anyway i hope this
blog is useful and we shall talk very
soon i would imagine ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
