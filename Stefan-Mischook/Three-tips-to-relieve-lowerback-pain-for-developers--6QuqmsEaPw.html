strangest video I've ever put out I
think so your coder you're sitting at
your desk all day and you may have a bad
back or you may develop a bad back in
time so here are three tips that will
help eliminate or reduce your bad back
pain completely or prevent it from
happening in the first place so first
thing you got to do you got to sit
straight now it may seem unnatural for
some of you guys you guys sit straight
so that your lower back it's not like
this it's curved in a little bit so you
sit straight like this one of the things
like to do is push up right against the
desk so the desk kind of supports my my
lower back like that so that's first tip
number two which is going to be very
weird for most of you is try to drink a
good amount of water all day long every
day now I'm 62 195 pounds so I drink I
should be drinking anyway a leader a
couple liters a day of water so not all
in one shot but you know drink it so you
make your decision based on your height
and weight one thing you can do is you
know to know if you're drinking enough
water check when you go to the washroom
it should be pretty clear if not totally
clear when you go to bathroom that's a
good indicator and I know this kind of
sounds weird houses help your lower back
well sometimes lower backs become sore
because there's a buildup of toxins in
the body apparently so drinking a lot of
water will flush it over time well
that's you know takes time anyway
drinking a good amount of water is going
to help you just feel better because
it's going to help you flush your system
and the final thing you should do and
the most immediate thing you should get
up every so often when you're coding or
you're just working at your desk all day
and do some hamstring leg stretches so
let me give you a quick example so you
sit here like so you put your foot up
like this and you just want to stretch
the under here so I'm flexing a little
bit I'm putting a little bit of weight
and stretching so I feel the pull here
if you
pull here under my calf and if you can
touch your toes like so if you can't
reach to your toes you know grab your
shin like this and do this kind of
stretch like this this on each leg is
going to help a lot with regards to you
know lower back problems this helps me
immediately because what causes lower
back problems is your hamstrings pulling
on your ass muscles which pull on your
lower back muscles and because of the
lower back muscles the week is in a
chain it takes a lot of pressure and
it's in pain another thing you can do is
it's a classic you'll pull as I find
helps a lot you want to jam your heel
into your into your leg like this and
just stand straight stick out the chest
curve the lower back and hold this
position drink your tea drink your
coffee and just doing this a couple of
times a day with the stretching really
helps out a lot there you go that's the
strangest video I've ever put out on
YouTube but it's actually quite useful
if you're in pain you're sore you're
tired it's hard to be a good coder it's
hard to be glitter do anything so it's
good to take a little break every half
an hour every hour do a little quick
little stretches know it takes 23
seconds and you do this a few times a
day you'll be golden alright that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
