that came with the Canon I was so I see
how it's gonna go
it seems to hold up pretty well I was
gonna be buying a new lens but I might
just use this you know it's kind of a
ghostly effect Cheers
buddies so somebody asked me what would
be the languages you would choose to
learn the programming languages well
they're the programming languages that I
teach and those languages are number one
JavaScript PHP and Python YV Street
don't get me wrong there are many good
languages out there as really article
just this morning actually on the
popular programming languages so let me
pull that up there you go
popular programming languages of 2018
you can see the list just freeze that
there and you could take a look right
okay take a look and pause the video
look at the list blah blah blah you are
two different lists so let me discuss so
when this was derived from one source
one this derive from another source you
always have to look at the source of
information you're looking at these
lists top there so what this survey
shows because surveys can be designed to
favor a particular language versus
another language it has to do with
whether it be language rankings or
political polls you have to you have to
be very careful in terms of how the the
polls are designed anyhow so in the list
you saw on one list they said Java well
both of us they actually say javelin was
a tough language Java is still hugely
important in your programming world
doesn't mean you got to drop everything
to Java though it depends on the type of
work that you want to do yeah number two
on one list it was Python number to any
other list was C plus a C so you see in
one list the t ib t Oh
be ranking theyíve C was number two and
in the other ranking they put C at
number one two three four five six
that's that's quite a difference rather
than the other eye and they put Python
up number two and then they put and in
the other Leslie but Python at number or
is it Python number three so it's not so
different again what you want to take
away from these lists is that it depends
on how you sample where you sample you
get a different rankings etc etc again
but noobs have two takeaways but the
language that you choose is not super
duper important because once you
understand your foundations your
fundamentals as your core as I say that
everything else becomes pretty easy so
you could jump from one language to the
other so she the high level languages
would have good I mean Java Python
JavaScript PHP c-sharp Swift all these
languages will be very easy for you to
learn because they're so similar in many
respects so what language is what I
learn in 2018 well these are languages I
that I put out courses on
so that's JavaScript Python and PHP why
because with these three programming
languages you cover a very wide spectrum
in terms of job opportunities business
opportunities in terms of the type of
apps that you can create type of
software you can write with these three
languages you got pretty much all of it
covered that's why I chose these three
languages I actually like these
languages Python very popular JavaScript
super popular PHP very popular for
businesses yeah there you go that's the
answer to that question let me just get
back into the whole business end of code
because that's what this site not the
safest channels really about it's about
the practicality of coding I'm not an
academic if you want to get into the
freelancing game then it's PHP is the
king of course if you want to get into
the enterprise go for a very large
organization it's probably going to be
Java
or c-sharp dotnet but in large
organizations they have HR departments
human resource departments which means
you're going to need some sort of degree
probably to get those kind of jobs
because it's just a artificial
requirement that they put into place
whereas if you get into the whole PHP
world it's typically small medium sized
businesses which means degrees are not
required so if you have a degree you're
doing a computer science degree
engineering degree and you want to get
into the software development then Java
school c-sharp done that is cool but if
you're not sure Python 2 is cool by the
way PHP is cool as well but if you want
to get into the game without having
necessarily to get yourself a degree
then you want to be looking more at a
PHP JavaScript and Python I'm hoping
you're starting to see why I chose those
languages to put my programming courses
out on you know I know Java very well in
fact in my active programming days when
I was especially when I was doing a lot
of work as a freelancer developing my
own first sacis I did it all in Java
Java web Java jsps Java JSP servlets and
Pujol plain old Java beans that was my
that was my thing I actually built my
own little web architecture and was more
of an little but it was a web
architecture I developed from scratch
for my own projects based on my own
project so don't get me wrong I like
chaff a lot but I wouldn't be writing
Java too much these days because you can
you can get your apps up and running
much more quickly and more nimbly with
nimble languages like PHP for a web
stack or like JavaScript or Python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
