to a youtube comment somebody asks so
what's node J s is position in the whole
development world I said that I would
use PHP for freelance work and for small
and medium sized Web Apps I would use
maybe Python jangle for machine learning
well not maybe for AI machine learning
you could use it for web apps and you
robotics and I would use for enterprise
I would use Java and Java spring for web
apps I would use or c-sharp asp.net for
web apps so you said good question where
does
node.js fall into this you would use
node.js
for the rare situation where you will
need super fast a synchronous web apps
where like a messaging system something
where you have you don't want any
latency you don't want a lag time
that's what node shines why I wouldn't
use node for the overall app because
it's still a moving target there's a lot
of things that are changing in terms of
server-side JavaScript notice a
JavaScript pace and so I wouldn't use it
for that I would rather use a much more
mature framework that's stable like a
spring on Java like a laravel on PHP
like a jingle on Python then something
that's still developing quickly when
this is normal by the way when you see a
new technology emerge and JavaScript on
the server is relatively new although
javascript is a fairly old language you
know itself you're going to see rapid
revolute evolution and change and so
it's it can mess up your code and I
wouldn't use it except in very very
strict situations and don't make the
mistake by the way thinking that your
app is going to be the next Facebook or
the next Google where you're going to
need ultra-high speed communications
between your server and a client
specially given how fast servers are
today and so on so keep that in mind
finally if slide news if you saw a vlog
I did maybe a year or two ago I forget
now
I mentioned how I thought that ruby was
going to fade because Python was eating
its lunch on one end and PHP was kicking
it on the other end and it was going to
get squeezed out and sure enough we're
starting to see sides of that one of the
prominent boot camps my feeling about
boot camps aside they are actually
removing the Ruby and Ruby on Rails
training from their curriculum replacing
it with Java because they see the demand
for Ruby developers is dropping again
because I know that all the hipsters are
going into node and everybody else is
sticking where they want to stick
whether it be you know PHP or Java etc
etc so there you go as I predicted
Ruby though it's a has many good
qualities about it not good enough and
so Python PHP and rest are pushing it
down finally a little tip the developer
tip if you are developer do exercise
every day consider your exercise to be
as important as any other part of your
day so with that being said I'm heading
out to lunch I always grab a late lunch
1:30 or so to avoid the crowds rushes
and I'm going to jump on the bike head
downtown so if you haven't done any
exercise today do some otherwise you
will paid a heavy price of being in bad
shape
being less productive and having more
pain in your physical body all right
we'll talk some chow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
