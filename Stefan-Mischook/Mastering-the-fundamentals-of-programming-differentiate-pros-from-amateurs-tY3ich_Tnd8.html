going to be a total nerd talk here so
what are the things I keep stressing a
lot of my videos is that the
fundamentals are the key difference well
excuse me let me restate that so the
understanding of the fundamentals is a
key difference between the great coders
and unethically coders if you have a
real solid understanding of the
fundamental principles of techniques and
concepts behind coding behind writing
software then you will be good
regardless of the language and that's
why I said in a previous vlog that it's
more important that you understand the
fundamentals really well then you
understand the latest greatest framework
without or the latest greatest libraries
of that's out because at the end of the
day it always comes back down to the
fundamentals of fundamentals of good you
know the basics of variables and arrays
and functions functions methods panel
type language iterators design patterns
good coding conventions good naming
conventions etc etc etc these are the
things that really separate the great
coders and back coders and in fact you
could take a great coder and put them on
on a pretty primitive framework or
language and they'll produce a better
app than a beginner or intermediate
level coder who has the latest and
greatest of frameworks under their belt
or shoes or they're using values and
graders framework it really it comes
down to that so let me give you a
concrete example about fundamentals in
software development one of the basic
design patterns now the design pattern
is a way of organizing your
code what are the basic design patterns
that most of the languages out there
most of the communities regardless of
language PHP Python Ruby Java C sharp
accessor they've all adopted so they
called Model View controller Model View
controller is a way of separating your
code up into logical units three units
the model of the views the controllers
and there's all kinds of benefits now
I'm not going to teach Model View
controller in this particular video I've
done that in others the point is is that
if you are a an accomplished developer
an accomplished programmer you're going
to have a fundamental and a very good
understanding of model for your
controller
nurses call it MVC and with that
fundamental understanding of Model View
controller you'll be able to adopt that
adapt at use that skill that
understanding rather in any API excuse
me in any language that you happen to
jump into so you may learn model view
controller in PHP and then you graduate
you will go to a Java based environment
I said graduate with Chavez a more
complex language in PHP so let's say you
learned your model view controller you
learned that design pattern in PHP if
you jump it to Java you learn a little
bit more about Java and how it works but
you understand MVC so you can jump into
any MVC based system in Java and you be
pretty comfortable and if you're
advanced and you understand how to use
MVC properly you will execute your Java
MVC just as well saving if you went into
MVC on Python or MVC on Ruby or you know
what I mean you get the idea so there is
an example of a fundamental principle
fundamental or they called it design
pattern a fundamental way of coding and
that agreed upon in most situation is
the way to do your
basic app development well that's the
basic structure you should use and
regardless of language you understand
that fundamental and applies to every
single language it's kind of like
learning how to drive a car if you're
learning how if you learn how to drive a
Porsche and how to handle rainy
conditions on a port with a Porsche
rather you be able to handle rainy
conditions fairly well in any car but
you use yes or differences here and
there because BMW may handle differently
in Aldie be handled differently to some
extent but once you understand how to
drive on a slick really surface you'll
be able to drive it in that environment
regardless of the vehicle what you
happen to be using in this analogy the
vehicle of course represents the
programming language or the framework
and there you go I hope this little
tick-tock helps we're going to see some
more stuff I think I'm going to release
some more Python material soon just
because I feel like it but my main focus
now is going to be in what's going to be
shifting towards the business end of
code and business small business mom's
starting a business and social media
marketing and content marketing as well
I figure I figured I have all my basics
covered in my courses on my coding
languages I've done at html5 css3 I
teach responsive layout modern HTML
structures I also taught I have a very
thorough classic JavaScript where I
teach you know all the solid
fundamentals of JavaScript where you're
doing validations animations and dry
with JavaScript and then I teach PHP
where I teach server-side programming
with PHP you see with these languages
they're vehicles that teach you certain
things so for instance I use JavaScript
to teach you certain basics of
programming that apply to all languages
with PHP I teach the same concepts but I
also teach server-side programming so
that's what Christmas with PHP is if you
don't know what that is take my PHP
course so
in my PHP course for exact for example
you're not just learning PHP you learn
in server-side programming then I just
completed a Python course we're in the
Python course of teaching more things I
go deeper to object-oriented programming
some more advanced principles and the
idea behind that what you've done them
you won't need any real tutorials after
that because regardless of the framework
regardless of what you want to do having
a solid understanding of the basics you
will be able to approach any project
pretty easily and you'll be able to use
a lot of those walkthroughs that you see
on YouTube or other places we're not
really teaching it is sort of walking
through the code but because you've done
my courses it doesn't matter if it's
interesting Watchers it will be
understandable to you you'd be able to
pursue that so when I teach I'm not only
teaching you the basic structures and
techniques I'm also teaching you how to
learn and at the end of the day I can
tell you remembering all the nuances and
the details about this framework or that
framework at the end of day is not very
important in programming because you can
just look that up like this on Google
right and get the answer all what's the
syntax to do xy7 Python that's easy
what's the syntax what's the library to
be able to do this in Java all hairiest
that's easy to look up what makes you an
expert programmer is understanding how
to use those libraries and how to
structure your code in an expert way
chef Joe actually I said ciaochao but
this is where one of my martial art
analogies really comes into play and
this is that actually where I understood
this years and years ago decade or two
ago or three in martial arts for
instance I could teach you a combination
I could teach you jab jab cross right
and I'm throwing these really badly just
because you don't just retire so it's a
jab after jab jab cross right now you
learn this in kickboxing and learn this
in Thai boxing you learn boxing now the
combination itself is next fun you learn
jab cross but to be able to throw that
punch properly so it's properly executed
there's a lot of subtlety in nuances you
won't understand till you've done the
training which a good coach that is kind
of like programming right where just
because you know what the framework does
and how it works the framework is just a
series of techniques stitched together
right jab jab cross right I know that
makes any sense but if you can't execute
that technique that combo one way to
what or the one-two if you don't know
how to execute properly that's the right
time no good so any fool off the street
as my boxing coach used to say you can
teach you how to throw you can teaching
that combination jab jab cross in two
seconds and they'll be able to go jab
jab cross but they're going to execute
that technique that combination terribly
go to terrible you know meanwhile it
takes years and years and years of
really good coaching and training to be
able to execute each of those punches
properly so they're effective so when
the expert fighter the pro fighter
executes his jab jab cross it's going to
be far more effective and far more
dangerous than just some bum off the
street or some new right I hope that
makes sense
same thing with programming by the way
you know all right that's it jump</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
