we what we're going to be doing is
taking these images here which are not
linking anything they're just dummy
links at this moment and we're going to
go about creating the secondary elements
on this page and in this site in other
words we're going to make page two three
and four so let's go about doing that
what I'm going to ask you to do is to
open up your files window or as you can
see here you can click on this icon and
what I would ask you to do is to keep
our root folder nice and neat in other
words I would like us to actually go
about right clicking on this element and
saying new folder so I'm not going to
put the other pages right next to the
index page we're just going to put them
inside this folder here and this folder
i will just name web it's not
necessarily an industry standard or
anything like that but it just indicates
to me as you know I'm trying to be as
intuitive as possible and our naming
convention here says look all the other
web pages are inside this folder called
web so i'm going to right click on that
and ask you to create a new file in this
new file i want you to name as we can
see here we've decided for about gallery
contact so let's just add those about
dot HTML right click again new file i'm
going to call this one gallery dot HTML
and one more time new file and we're
going to call this one not gallery not
about but contact so now we've got these
three pages inside of web which I can
collapse and expand and I ask you to
keep it expanded now if you're to open
up any one of these pages just like
before these are blank pages now don't
worry about that so much because we will
populate those pages with information
soon enough and in fact we will not have
to rebuild things since we've got the
index page here built already and I'm
happy with the way it looks what we're
just going to do is just copy paste it
and
create the about gallery and contact
page based on what we have here now you
might remember I promised that in those
other pages we are going to create a two
column design instead of a three column
design well that'll all work itself out
in just a second when we get to that
point but before we do anything else why
don't we fix these links and make sure
that they actually work so one of the
things that I can do is to actually show
you a little trick here I'm going to
adjust open up the files window i'm
going to place it over here on the side
and the reason I'm doing that is so that
I can show you this little trick there's
a lot of ways of creating links that is
no longer the link that I want so one of
the ways I could do that is to just say
browse for file down here in the
properties window select your element
you know whether that be text or whether
that be the image as this one is and
once that image is selected then to
apply link to it we can come here we can
browse for the file right so just click
on this and point to the file that you
want that's a great way to do it not
really a problem but here's another way
you can actually click down on the point
to file icon don't let go keep dragging
it over to the file you want to point to
in this case the about HTML page when
you let go there you go you got your
link in place and it basically says go
to the folder called web find me about
HTML exactly what happened now i'm going
to select this particular piece of text
and we're going to get rid of that link
i'll point to the file remember this is
supposed to go to the gallery section so
here i am i'm going to let go when I'm
on top of the gallery section and look
at the link nice easy way of creating
that so I'm going to do the same thing
for contact and as you can see that's
all done nicely in place so save that
file command s you can even preview this
if you wish for example if i go to
firefox and i click on this page did it
work I don't know it's got a blank page
well as you
see up here what are we pointing to
we're pointing to on the desktop type
root in a folder called web the about
HTML page all right fantastic so in
other words we know that things are
working this is going to gallery I'll
hit the back this is going to contact so
that's all fine and dandy now what we're
going to do is to talk about creating
the graphics that we're going to be
using for the second third and fourth
pages and we will switch to a from a
three-column layout and switch to a two
column layout basically what we're going
to be going for is having this element
here having a larger image over here
with some text underneath it and that
might incur a scrollbar but should be
fine and in this section I also want a
place you know two or three other links
because we don't have these ones up at
the top anymore either so that's what
we're going to be doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
