let's see what we can do with it the
first thing that I'm going to do is a
little more styling I actually want my
video not only to do autoplay true by
the way if I get rid of this and I hit
save you'll see that now at the bottom
here oh and I add controls then I'm
going to get this playhead control and
you can actually style your own playhead
you could even use JavaScript to control
the video but this is the default
playhead for a for firefox so by saying
autoplay true it's going to play
automatically I can also say preload
which will mean that it'll load it as
quickly as possible and I'm also going
to set it to loop so it's just going to
play over and over again automatically
now one more thing I want to do is
actually style this thing so go back to
your style dot CSS file and what we can
do is we can actually style this video
tag so I'm going to go video position
absolute with a hundred percent height
one hundred percent margin 0 0 and z
index of one so it's going to be the
first in the first layer so now it's
appearing as the complete width of the
page which is kind of neat and it's
stale it's scaling dynamically now if I
make sure that other things on my page
are absolutely positioned I'm going to
lose these scroll bars which is a good
thing so the next thing I want to do is
make sure that my section is also
position absolute
and I'm going to refresh this and i'm
going to set a z-index of a hundred
anything higher than one will do and
there we go now we're starting to get
something a little more interesting
where the video is just you know
underneath you could have like a video
nature you could have anything kind of
dynamic in the background and it would
maybe be like this moving texture in
your web application so I'm going to
take this a step further and i'm going
to start building out a navigation and
we'll see what kind of website we can
build here so for the navigation as
we've done before i'm going to use the
nav tag so that the robots out there are
going to know that I'm dealing with
navigation create an unordered list list
items and say home
about products services and let's say
contact us refresh this again so now
these guys are appearing up there with a
bit of styling we're going to have a
really nice website so I'm going to add
an ab section let's again position
absolute Z index of 100 display block
I'm going to set the width to 800 pixels
it's going to be left 50 pixels fifty
percent this is a way of getting
centered positioning with position
absolute set so if you want something to
be Center aligned normally if you're
doing relative positioning you would
just do margin zero auto because we're
doing absolute positioning we're going
to say left fifty percent which tells
the browser that you want to push it
fifty percent to the left now to
compensate for this we're going to say
margin left- 400 pixels so what i'm
doing here is i'm basically saying that
i want you to start your positioning at
the midpoint of the browser because i
have a width of 500 feet or 800 pixels
I'm then going to shift it back half of
its margin then I'm going to add a
background of some kind of beige I guess
I'm going to do three 3 2 f2 8 and the
height of 35 pixels I guess a border of
one pixel solid 777 so like a gray
border and then I'm going to only going
to have the border on the the left the
bottom on the right so border width of 0
pixels that's the top one pixel right
one pixel bottom and one pixel to the
left so already we've got this kind of
background thing coming across</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
