Southern California my last day here I
came here for a few reasons to a to get
away from the cold in Montreal and to
meet famished from some friends and
family up here and also to meet some
potential business partners from Asia so
we met meetings meeting went well things
are looking pretty good one of the
reasons I got away from just publishing
retail only video courses and doing
consulting and so forth if I want to get
out and meet people from different parts
of the world different parts of the
country and so that's kind of cool for
me it's kind of cool to meet people from
different cultures different
nationalities because it gives you a
different perspective that was a
significant chand meeting with the
people from Asia was the highlight of my
trip that was just fun to meet people
from a from different culture so the
Python course was put on hold for a last
few days because i'm translating
carefully i don't have all my mics and
cameras and everything i'm going to get
back home running back to my treat all I
will be going full bore full steam ahead
with the Python courses I want to get
most of the videos out in the next
couple weeks and the people who've been
participating in the beta of the course
basically giving me feedback and so
forth husband has been very helpful and
it's been good to get that feedback as I
go along so as a result of that feedback
i decided to use python drawing
capabilities python as these built-in
libraries allow you to draw pretty
easily since i'd use the drawing
capabilities as a vehicle to teach some
of the basic concepts i wasn't doing it
first of all wasn't sure if you know
Sophie but yes it's people think I put
out one and people seem to really like
those to the lessons lessons where I i
express base
programming principles as we were
driving Python so that's than it should
be much more that in the course as I
move forward so somebody reached out to
me it's like that much that request many
times asking me about helping them to
evaluate their website and to judge it
in terms of you know you x UI user
experience user interface and to sort of
help them put them in the right
direction about which way to go yeah I
don't do freelance developer work
anymore I haven't done that for many
years now to dis my own stuff but I
thinking that might be an interesting
thing to do you see if you guys are just
should let me know where I'll critique
websites and apps and give you my
perspective in terms of UI UX and what
up what I look for in a good apps in
that regard I've been doing it since the
90s so and I think day as I said in
other videos with separate successful
apps or whether they be iOS apps web
apps android apps or native windows
natural whatever what really separates
good action lots of good apps is the US
user experience and the you I think
about it when you're using an app if you
have problems a typical problem is how
do you do this where's the bug to do
that why is it men you doing this yeah
sometimes even glitches and so forth but
generally speaking if you look at for
instance iphone iphone a huge success to
the stage because of the nice looking
phones but then all the phones are quite
nicely i'm using a pixel here is very
nice-looking phone they're always very
powerful Apple's iOS ecosystem the
ecosystem is extremely robust good apps
and so forth but I think again of the
days the usability if the use abilities
that UX as a UI that keeps iowa still
very very very
popular although I think that what
twenty percent of the phones now or iOS
or iPhones and the rest are closely
Android so in terms of raw numbers
android has one that's just rude but in
terms of profit Apple still gets the
lion's share of the smartphone
profitability or profit rather anyway
let alone this is interesting to you in
terms of looking at and critiquing web
apps and websites and apps and they will
start putting out those videos as a
miniseries if you will which will do
periodically on the channel so yeah I
think the next video you'll see you'll
be back back in Montreal be using their
better cameras and mics oh my apologies
for this they get all this of this
particular video black</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
