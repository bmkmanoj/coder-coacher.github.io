was just before noon so in this quick
vlog a vlog in a car I want to talk
about one of the most important lessons
I got from martial arts and that lesson
was to be open-minded and to expose
yourself to new ideas and conflicting
ideas so in martial arts I started out
with judo which is a grappling style
Japanese grappling style I think most
people know what judo is so then what I
did is I went to a striking style
kicking style of karate Japanese karate
and I forget the style karate it was at
the time then I moved into Taekwondo and
which is pure kicking and then I went
into a temple derivatives of it go catch
Campbell you get the idea so on so forth
and I will go from different schools
different styles and one of the reasons
I was switched styles and schools was to
expose myself to different ways of
thinking and a lot of times the
different styles would conflict in terms
of what they thought was the best way to
train or fight especially especially
things like karate punching the way they
punch versus boxing I did boxing for
about five years
etc so on and what I found is that the
more different ideas different schools
of thought that you could expose
yourself to the more likely you're going
to find out what is real or what is true
you know it's like an old an old
expression you don't know white until
you seen black right you need that
contrast to be able to compare so when
it comes to development when it comes to
programming you have to look at it the
same way so let's say you are a big
advocate of PHP that's yours that's your
language you love PHP and everything
else sucks what I would suggest to do
once you really
no PHP wealth you're comfortable with
building apps with PHP understand
object-oriented PHP you should explore
another language and just to see how
other languages approach software
development and app development that
will be a very very important lesson for
you you're going to learn a lot more
than you thought possible because just a
fact you're gonna be able to compare
let's say Python as an example versus
PHP and doesn't mean you're gonna drop
PHP and you're gonna go with Python but
but you'll find is by learning Python
your PHP is gonna get much better that
happened to me and that's one of the
reasons why I explored many different
languages and I've written commercial
apps apps been paid to build apps or my
own apps that were used in commercial in
several different programming languages
over the years I've lost count I usually
just say eight or nine it could be nine
or ten something like that so every new
language when I worked with my skills as
a programmer increased and what you'll
discover in the end as I discover with
martial arts the programming language
does not matter whatsoever the
programming language doesn't matter in
the end at the end of the day what
separates the good coders from the lots
of good coders is their ability to
program regardless of language just
making sure this guy doesn't hit me I
never did
so yeah you got to learn at some point
to not get caught in a camp I'm a PHP
guy I'm a ruby guy I'm a Python guy
everybody else sucks man enough your
coder
your developer and whatever tool you use
PHP Java JavaScript Python Ruby whatever
whichever two you use is almost
irrelevant as long as you're a good
coder you'll be able to produce a good
app that said certain languages are
better suited to certain circumstances
like cars some cars
jeeps are better if you want to go
off-roading I wouldn't take my my Audi
off-roading you know not that the Audi
is a crappy car is just that it is not
designed to be you know going
off-roading it's something for the
highway nice roads can't beat it so be
willing to challenge your own ideas in
any field really it doesn't just apply
to programming that's for sure it could
be important to be in business it could
be programming it could be martial arts
it could be in politics I for instance
will always look on both the left and
the right side and hear what people are
saying on the left and what people are
saying on the right and hopefully I'll
get a much better idea of what's really
going on so that's all suggesting when
you look at everything if you if you
want to figure out what's real what's
true which will give you the best
advantage out there when you're
competing you have to be open to
challenging your own ideas and and
changing your point of view about
something if the information that if it
comes to you contradicts an old idea and
that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
