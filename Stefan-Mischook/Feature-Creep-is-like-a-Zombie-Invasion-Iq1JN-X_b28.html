and a little tip somebody just wrote to
me and in fatima i believe if i say his
name properly and he wanted to tell me
about how impactful was to actually
write out code hand written on paper in
terms of remembering things because he
said which is interesting point he said
that when you type if you're good type
is writing out the code becomes almost
mindless in a sense for some people
because they're so fast at typing that
it doesn't help as much with remembering
the code so when you are forced to
actually write out the code by hand at
first it's going to help you to remember
yes handwritten notes and handwriting a
little bit of code really speeds up the
learning process i'm not saying you do
this all the time but just in the
initial stages of learning you'll see
that it has a big impact so let's talk
about feature creep now feature creep is
when features in yours app in your
software creeps in and basically a
people who whether it be clients or even
yourself your development team start
taking up all kinds of cool new features
that you can add to your project and
most of the time
these features to be honest if you a lot
of times are not really needed in fact
you find a lot of times are useless and
it's called feature creep because it's
very common with new features tend to
creep in as you get involved with the
development of a project a lot of the
times you see it with clients because
clients are kind of seeing the work that
you put out and then they'll be going
you know we kind of cool if the button
to dis or it will be kind of cool if we
press on this button and then a little
menu flew out if you get a little
animation and so on so on and so forth
and etc etc so so there's feature creep
from the client perspective basically
the client asking on the fly for new
features and you have to as a developer
put a stop to it right away otherwise it
will just creep in and it will take over
the project that you're going to end up
with a big mess and one of the ways that
you avoid this from happening is that
you have a fairly detailed specification
when you go into a project so that if
they try to add new features you can go
ah it's not in the contract that will
cost extra but which more diplomatic way
approaching this when a client looks to
want to insert little features that are
really not super necessary not poor to
the app as you mentioned that you
mentioned that the more features that
you put into a nap the more clutter the
app will become so you have to be very
very careful in terms of adding features
to your app it's kind of like walking on
a lake that is newly frozen over in
early winter you want to walk on the
lake on the ice the frozen ice very
slowly to make sure the ice is solid and
same thing with adding features if you
add features to apps you want to be very
sure but you really need those features
and so feature creep is very common from
both the from both the initiation from
the client perspective and even from
initiation of the
I was a developer perspective so I bring
this up because we were working on the
release of studio at 3.1 which adds some
new needed features long planned for
features and so as we're going through
it I was sitting with my lead developer
there was a yesterday day before and we
were going over these new features that
were implementing and we're also looking
at some old features that we had put in
and found there was no use case for
meaning the teachers and really used
them so we took it out and nobody ever
complained because nobody use these
features these are like super detailed
data that we're providing in terms of
student performance of spirited details
so my discussions with my lead dev I had
forgotten that I said we I was thinking
about putting them back in and my lead
dev reminded me that you know while
nobody was using them in the first place
and you and I said yeah or get a good
point there so again there was that was
an example of Worcester do web we've
implemented a feature we injected some
reporting in there to see how people
react to it and then we decided to pull
it out because nobody was using it
anyway but there are some elements to
about what kind of interesting so it's
it's always a balancing act in terms of
features that you want to put in versus
not wanting to clutter up your software
I probably spoke about this in another
vlog so keep that in mind feature creep
creeps in like a bug creeping they can
really slow down and complicate the
development process feature creep can be
initiated from the client perspective
because it kind of cool do this so you
got to control that and if you're
developing your own app
we have with Studio web here you want to
introduce new features into your app but
they should be really well thought out
and you should implement these features
very carefully because a lot of times
you as a developer may see a use case
for a particular feature but you'll find
in the end that your users won't and the
more buttons you put into a NAPA more
options you put into the to the app
you're creating more work for yourself
and your devs more potential for bugs
more potential for maintenance and more
clutter in the apps you I that could
make your appt less usable so watch out
for feature creep that's it bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
