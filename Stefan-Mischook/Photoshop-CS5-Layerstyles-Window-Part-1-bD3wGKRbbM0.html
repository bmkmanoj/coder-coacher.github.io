bit about working with these layer
styles and accessing them through the
little effects icon right here in your
layers window I want you to now open up
your Styles window now if you don't see
your Styles window here or if you don't
recognize the icon for the Styles window
can always go to the window menu
remember whenever you're missing any
windows can always go to the window menu
up at the top and access styles just by
clicking on it right here now you may
not see what I'm seeing right now so I'm
going to just click on this little area
right here which allows you access to
the very many options that you have
available from most of these windows and
I'm going to reset Styles back to the
original ones which you probably have
open yourselves so what you'll notice
here is that there are a number of
default styles I'm going to make sure
that i'm selecting the object in this
case this object right here and as you
can see we've got the object right here
and I'm going to click on number of
styles well this is the default style
none nothing there notice here if I
clicked on this one just holding your
button over it it says color target
button hmm interesting here's another
one which says double-ring glow button
you don't really see it why because the
ring glows are on a white background
which is not really conducive to what we
want to see right here the striped cone
for example well if I had a cone that
might look a little bit better the blue
glass button now there's a nice one that
seems appropriate for what we're doing
here but you may not want it to be blue
or you might want to be going for a
different style color or something like
this well you can experiment through all
of these as I encourage you to do and
I'm just going to go back to this one
but let's check out something here when
you open up your layer palette see this
there's a little triangle right here
well that will open and close allowing
you to reveal what the effects happen in
be on this particular shape you'll
notice that I do have a number of
effects being applied by this default
style as you can see here there is and
I'll go through them one at a time in
their stacking order I'll get rid of the
inner glow see what that does I'll get
rid of the bevel and emboss well that's
the bevel and emboss makes sense the
color overlay is again not just for
color and there's a gradient overlay
which has a radial gradient right there
amazing isn't it now if you want to see
the settings for all of these you can
just quickly double click in here and
open up your layer styles and you'll
notice the gradient overlay is set this
way actually I'm going to cancel that
and turn these all on for a second and
we'll double click because we can look
at them individually so check it out
with that inner glow it's creating a
gradient that's going from a dark to a
very light color no notice there's the
dark and there's your light when it's
set to multiply like this it's really
only showing the darkness and the white
is sort of disappearing and if you
wanted to you could play with that by
dealing with the opacity see that that
creates a really nice shadowy gradient
in there so that's why they're using
inner glow in this fashion very nice
isn't it the bevel and emboss for
example well bevel and emboss is showing
you all of these things but look at the
depth right normally we're used to
seeing things with not as much depth and
certainly the size of this is as we've
seen before all the way on the edge this
way but look what happens when we
increase that size like i mentioned
right you can create some really
interesting effects playing with these
different sliders and not being afraid
of you know experimenting with it and
trying to see what you can do with your
elements notice I could have even put in
another drop shadow on top of that right
or actually more appropriately
underneath
that and you could come in here and you
can click on things so even the styles
that you do have you can add more to
those styles if you wish so just by
going in here you really can learn a lot
about what you're going to be doing how
you're going to be doing it and how to
create these great styles so for example
I've added a drop shadow here and I've
got this you know little augment that
I've done to it and notice if I wanted
to save that I could say well I've got a
selected item with a number of effects
let's create a new style so I'll say my
blue conclude the layer effects include
layer blending options but we have none
so we'll click OK and check it out when
I roll over this it says my blue so we
can see the differences for example i'm
just going to press alt or option and
i'll say well let's apply the original
here and this is mine well here I'll put
the original on top that would make more
sense so here's the original here's mine
you can see very subtle differences
notice mine has the drop shadow so
that's as easy as it is to create your
own new styles but let's come back I'm
going to delete these and when we do
come back I'll show you some other new
styles that you can apply and where to
access some of those times</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
