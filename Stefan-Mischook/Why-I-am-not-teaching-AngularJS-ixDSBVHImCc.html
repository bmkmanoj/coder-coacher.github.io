mint org killer sites calm and the other
sites in this video I'm going to talk
about why I'm not going to produce a
course on angularjs angularjs if you
don't know is it very well it's a fairly
popular JavaScript based framework but
helps people build web apps I'm not
gonna get into details here but let me
just say this the reason I'm not going
to teach you is because I ejs like so
many other technologies that you're
gonna run into is going through a
massive change in disruption as far as I
can understand a new version of
angularjs and recording this in 2015 is
gonna be radically different from the
current version that a lot of people use
and as far as I understand it will not
be backwards compatible meaning the new
angularjs will break all the old
angularjs code this is this is a sure
sign of an immature technology this this
happens a lot matured technology should
be backwards compatible so if they come
out with version 3 version 3 should not
break version 2 or at least they should
provide an easy way for you to to update
from version 2 to 3 so angularjs is at a
point now where apparently the lead guy
the main angular guy took off from
google angularjs is owned by google and
he's moved on to other things i don't
know what the reasons are
but essentially reason i won't be
teaching it is because if i teach you
something now chances are it's going to
be outdated within a few months so all
these angular tutorials and videos that
you see up there are pretty much out of
date and it's not something you should
use unless you want to find yourself
code yourself into some technology
that's going to dive kind of like
learning flash at this point in time to
be clear I'm not meaning to suggest that
angularjs is going to be it's going to
disappear what I'm saying is the current
version of angularjs is going to
disappear so that means that all the
courses that are out there all the
tutorials that are out there
well done over finish they should be
taken down they're not relevant anymore
I don't know what the new versions gonna
be like I'm not sure how different it's
gonna be but from what I've heard it's
gonna be radically different and that
brings me to a broader issue when you
are a web developer or a web designer
when you're learning this stuff you have
to be very careful about which
technologies you choose to jump into
young nerds will get all excited about
the new greatest thing they'll jump into
it you know go yeah this is the greatest
thing in the world oh my god what you
doing here so old school from last year
and then they find themselves in a
technology dead-end this happens all the
time I have been doing this since 1994
I've seen I've seen this cycle play out
over and over and over again perhaps I
have a perspective that people have only
been coding five six years don't have
and I think that's what it values and
I'm Tooting my own horn here that's one
of the values you know of a teacher to
bring that perspective frankly is
something with a few years experience I
don't know if they should be teaching
there you go that's why I'm not gonna be
doing an angularjs tutorial I was going
to do it I was looking into it but again
my job is to filter out what should be
taught and what shouldn't be taught and
before I jumped on the bandwagon I did a
little research and started looking into
things and there you go and in fact I
was looking into angular for one of our
own internal projects here whether or
not to implement it with a new version
of a piece of software that we're we're
working on and this is what I discovered
when I what I just discussed so we're
not going to be using it and as such I'm
not going to be putting on a course on
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
