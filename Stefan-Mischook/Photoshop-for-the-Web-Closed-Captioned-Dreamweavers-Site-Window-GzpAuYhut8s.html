what we're going to be starting to do is
to take all of those images that we
sliced up in our little design that we
created inside Photoshop and if you
remember from the last video we exported
all of our slices and those slices are
now going to be turned into a website
which we will build ourselves from
scratch here in Dreamweaver it's going
to be a three-column fixed pixel website
that's something that we have to contend
with and something that we have to
remember is that we decided to make our
canvas area inside a Photoshop 900 now
keep that in mind because all those
measurements that we meticulously laid
out inside a Photoshop with regards to
the rulers and guides are now going to
come to this particular phase of the
application and we're going to really
pay attention to those things because we
want everything to be aligned perfectly
just the way we had intended inside of
our Photoshop document now of course
we're assuming that you've done a little
bit of photoshop work before if you
haven't done any Dreamweaver work before
that is I would encourage you to check
out other killer sites tutorials on
working with Dreamweaver or basic HTML
and CSS skills nevertheless though even
if you are new to everything that we're
doing I'm going to walk you through
things from a very basic and simple
understanding of how to work with
Dreamweaver so let's get started first
thing you want to do whenever you're
working inside of a dreamweaver based
website is to define your site and I
can't stress how important that is when
working in Dreamweaver if you don't
define your site first you're going to
run into all kinds of problems and that
can be potentially problematic and give
you all kinds of grief so first and
foremost what we're going to do is to
say site new site now if you remember
now some of you might be seeing the
basic tab setting that you see here you
can work with the basics that's
perfectly fine but you know what let's
just go over to advance
look at that one click of a button
you're already advanced so the name of
the site doesn't really matter we don't
even have to you know pay attention to
the fact that there are spaces in this
name this name is only for the site
definition inside a dreamweaver it's got
nothing to do with HTML per se it just
allows you to choose from different
sites a little bit later on when we're
working in this environment so why don't
we call it the type site seem to be
favoring that and here where it says
local root folder what we want to do is
to press this icon here and point to the
folder that contains all of our
information well at this point if you
remember I asked everybody in the last
video to prepare a folder on your
desktop or anywhere on your computer for
that matter that would contain the
images that we have so what I want you
to do is to select the type route that
will be the root folder for our website
that's why I asked you to name it route
you don't have to name it route I just
did that for educational purposes so
here's type of route and we're going to
choose that one make sure you don't
choose the images folder that's already
in there it's just the type root folder
the main folder so we're going to choose
that a little bit later on we'll talk
about how to upload your website to a
server and in order to do that you'd
have to go to the category not local
info where we're pointing to the folder
that's on our local machines but rather
eventually you'll have to go to remote
info now you know there might be
something that says those are another
site or connection types ID please enter
a different a don't even worry about
that necessarily you can of course
change what it says here you know could
be types ID number two if you have that
problem but anyways it doesn't really
matter I'll say type site final or
progress maybe like it's a work in
progress then I'm going to go to the
remote info area and where it says
access none we can choose access ftp now
i don't know what your ftp information
is but here's the
most important aspects that you will
have to sort of work with what you're
going to need to do is to act to contact
your service provider in other words
anybody who's hosting your website so if
you've bought a domain name you can't
you gotta a host who's hosting that
website for you if you happen to have an
internet access that is given to you by
some I provider often times especially
where I am and where i live in canada we
actually have a lot of IP providers who
give you internet access and sometimes
I'll even give you you know free server
space sometimes it's your very simple
small amount like five megs or something
but nevertheless if you do have a domain
name then you certainly have somebody
who's hosting your website so what you
can do is enter in the ftp host
information here you know i could enter
in mine but this will do nothing for you
especially since you don't have this
server but nevertheless i wanted to show
you you've got to enter in your ftp host
area here you've got to put in a log in
as well and at this point there's going
to be a password that's requested of you
also so i'm not giving you my
information of course but notice that's
really all you need sometimes you might
if you have any problems with this you
might want to choose use passive ftp but
generally speaking you don't have to
worry about it too much now at this
point you might want to test this and if
you hit the test button and you've enter
in all of your information correctly
it'll say dreamweaver cs4 connected
successfully so that's fantastic you've
got your server space ready and set up
now at the end of this project when we
have everything already we can upload
this and you can see what it looks like
and how it works but at this point if
you don't have your remote info then
just set this to none and just add the
local information now I'll come back
little bit later when we talk about
accessing the server and will enter in
that information once again so now that
we're set up you can see here that I
have a little area where I've defined
you know a number of different objects
here their assets there's the files
window there are some other things like
ap elements and you know CSS styles as
you can see here and that's going to be
important for us these CSS Styles we're
going to be using them a lot as we work
through CSS but right now all I'm really
interested in is this the files setting
so as you can see here it's got a
drop-down list of all the different
sites that you'll have available now if
you remember I had one already called
type site so I called this one type site
progress that's just fine and you can
click on it and access more information
you can you know go in there and add
your remote info if you wish and that's
all fine and dandy but at this point all
we've really got going for
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
