surface pro 4 camera it's a built-in
webcam I figure just easy to do
convenient so I figured it made sense
because I just bought I just got this
shipped to me the surface pro pen tips
of course the camera is now flipping the
text and I have no idea how to unfit so
whatever
so let's this is the first in my only
unboxing ever so exciting everybody's
doing drones and beautiful mics and
cameras and I'm doing pen nibs there it
is pen nibs so if you want to do some
artistic stuff you got different shapes
here whatever because what I did is I
busted my nib I know you can see it or
not but it's all bent and crooked so
it's giving me some funky behavior so
the way it works you're supposed to pull
this out and you get the little nib
grabber here and you grab your nib you
pull it out there we go nib is removed
so this is a you can see it's actually
busted here anyway it's busted take my
word and yeah let's pull out another nib
so we just push her in re nib
I'll brand new so you can't get focus on
it and should work better now so the nib
is in place we got all we got these
different types of tubes here for you
artiste out there I use a quite a bit
for moving around the web and stuff I
really enjoy this tablet overall
Microsoft Surface pro 4 it was so good a
few months ago and they did some update
so now things hang but they hang with
chrome the chrome web browser they don't
hang with other apps overall I was still
a little disappointed in how its
progressed the software for the surface
pro 4 nonetheless if again this get to
surf surface pro software back to where
it was this is I think the best tablet
overall
great writing response and this is cool
has an eraser so you just you're writing
on your screen and then you can just
erase your it's super quick it's much
better than clicking a button to erase
we're having to click something
on-screen to turn your tip into eraser
so this back is the eraser it actually
feels like an eraser so it's kind of
cool and that's it I don't know how
often I'm gonna be using this video
camera to do the videos it's just
convenient
tchau tchau</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
