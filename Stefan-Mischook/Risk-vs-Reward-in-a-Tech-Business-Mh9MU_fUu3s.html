I want to talk about risk-taking and
drinking beer risk-taking and drinking
beer to kind of related so I assume that
a lot of you watching might be younger
than me I'm in my mid 40s and so a lot
I've experienced and done a lot of stuff
that many of you young guys probably
have not done well guaranteed I can
guarantee there's many things that you
have not done yet so here is something
two points of advice but I wish was
given to me when I was in my early 20s
or younger so number one when it comes
to beer drinking now of course you get
18 or guess in the US whatever 21 to pay
on where you are what state you're in I
guess you get excited about game truck
oh it's a lot of fun yeah it can be a
lot of fun but when you drink really try
and i know this is reaching try to
consider what might happen if you get
out of control this could be get
yourself killed or a whole bunch of
other stuff that's not nearly as bad but
when you get older when you get to my
age you be going oh I wish I wouldn't
have done that another thing about beer
I would strongly consider instead of
going for the the running a meal beer
but you see advertised on TV and it's
funny if you look at those ads if you
look and pay attention to those ads
you'll notice that those ads are talking
to you young beer drinkers people new to
the game they're not talking to guys
like me who've been through that already
they're appealing to you show you how
much fun you're having drinking beer and
hanging out with ladies and nice cars
and how cool it is and creating this
image it's kind of like a hypnotise
they're trying to hypnotize you into
thinking that drink their beer you're
going to get the ladies that's not true
if you're going to do you want to get
the ladies you gotta you get a
was going to do to get the ladies that's
usually being charming and drinking a
lot of beer and being charming hmm
doesn't usually go together but when it
comes to beer drinking in of itself let
me tell you and I'm not a big beer
drinker i drink maybe once every three
months it's not my thing but I can tell
you what better to get more expensive
craft beer from my micro brewery that's
really tasty I can there's some great
beers it's like a pleasure to drinks not
like right the typical beer from a
bottle or can especially from a can and
you get the microbrewery draft beers and
you can go where they give you all these
tasters and you're not necessarily there
to get drunk you're there to taste
amazing beer and some of these beers are
just really really good very refreshing
really really good stuff so instead of
spending 20 bucks on a bunch of the beer
I say spent 22 dollars and get a less
micro brewery but really cool beer and
you know what you know if you're looking
to impress the ladies that will be much
more impressive to ladies that you
become a connoisseur of different types
of micro brewery Michael microbrewery
beers excuse me then you just get
hammered all the time pass out drunk so
when you're considering anything that
you do beyond drinking goes to business
you have to consider the risk in the
reward that's a big part of running any
type of business whether it be a
start-up whether it be a lemonade stand
whether you're selling bananas you have
to consider the risk versus the reward
so before a business owner takes an
action before they initiate a new
projects put down the money make an
investment you consider okay what am I
putting down what is my risk can i
recover from this risk how bad it will
hurt me if it doesn't work cause you
always have to go to any business
activity with the expectation won't work
you know of course you if you're sure
it's not going to work you're not gonna
do it but you got it you got it even if
you believe a hundred sent it's going to
be the greatest idea ever go in there
over the expectation is not necessarily
going to work so you got to consider the
risk what is the downside to doing this
and if the downside is too great given
the upside that I wouldn't do it we're
going to do it there's plenty of
opportunities out there when you start
opening your eyes trust me there are
plenty of opportunities out there so
you're better to be a little bit more
cautious evaluate things a little bit
more closely closely before leaping in
so that's whether to decide to get
really drunk one night and then do
something silly after that or whether
you decide you're going to get into some
sort of some sort of business venture
where are you risking it a lot now about
being said when you are younger when you
are in your 20s or even early 30s and
you got no responsibility I know family
and a wife no kids you are in the best
position to take the risk because you
can recover after that point because if
you're you're my age and you're taking
crazy risks and then you hit 50 and then
you're you're broke that's that's a
tough thing to bounce back from although
some people have but if you're 22 or 25
and he's okay I'm going to take a risk
for like four or five years try to push
the start start up through see what out
hey you don't make it if 30 you know
what you got add tremendous experience
behind you and you can try something
else you know if at 35 you know you're
still struggling and you might want to
try a less you know ambitious Hail Mary
type of business you know adventure you
might want to try something a little bit
more balance if you will because you got
to be mindful of as you get older you
can always try to put a little bit on
the side that's something I recommend
every month try to put at least ten
percent of your money even it's like 20
bucks just get in the habit that's
important to get into habit of putting
money aside so you're getting to have it
always putting money aside and you put
money into
that stache I told you about in a
previous video the f you stash the
untouchable money that's separate from
course retirement and just as your mo
spending money anyway so there you go
risk consider what you do consider the
downside whether it be a business
venture whether me gets you know stupid
drunk one night whether to speed or to
blast through that red light like an
idiot with your car think of the risk
versus the reward for me to blast
through the red light on a big
intersection because you're in a hurry
or because you're having fun is the
stupidest cebu you could possibly makers
you could you could kill yourself you
kill somebody you could find yourself in
jail you could ruin yourself it's not
worth it to stop to stop it's like 20
seconds to stop that reward of the
sparing you that 20 or 30 seconds it's
not worth the risk in that situation
alright i hope this pure vlog is
interesting ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
