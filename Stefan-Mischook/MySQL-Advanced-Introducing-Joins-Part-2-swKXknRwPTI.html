want to go back to my bare bones editor
and create an empty SQL file for the
purposes of this tutorial and it's often
helpful just to have an SQL file lying
around that you can work with and work
off of especially if you're dealing with
the command line because the command
line doesn't tend to remember things
very well so in the K PHP SQL folder
that I've created on my desktop I'm just
going to create a SQL file called joins
dot SQL and we're going to do an
introduction to joins so before we go
you know too far along I'm going to have
to create some tables obviously the
first table that I want to make is going
to be a table for categories so we're
going to look at how we would want to
structure a blog let's say we have a
blog and in the blog we have postings
like a particular piece of content and
then we have categories so I want to be
able to have categories for my various
posts now this is called a one-to-many
there is one category and many posts or
many-to-one you have many posts that are
associated or related to one category
now the advantage of using and join is
that if you decide you want to change
that category name you don't need to go
along and start updating all sorts of
records for all the posts that have
already been categorized let me try and
illustrate this so I'm going to start
off by saying create table category we
need to start with something right so
I'm going to create a table called
category and actually let me just bump
up my font size here so that it's nice
and clear and
that's a little better okay so here I'm
going to say create table category and
it's going to have an ID which is going
to be an integer and a primary key and
it will also auto increment and what
that means is that every time I do an
insert statement it's going to add a new
record to my category table and also I'm
going to have a name and the name will
be of our chart in other words it's a
field of variable length of 300 and the
engine is in ODB and I'm going to
explain that in just a minute so let's
just go through this together so this is
SQL similar to what Steph was doing in
that other video except now we're
actually describing how we want this
table to look and here we've got an ID
which is going to be our primary key and
just like in PHP you can have strings
you can have objects you can have
integers you can have a raise well in
this case this ID is of type integer and
it's a primary key and what that means
is that mysql is going to pay special
attention to this key or this column in
this database table and we'll index it
and this will facilitate in searching
and speed things up and we'll also make
sure that there's only one of every one
of those rows and each row can be
accessed from its primary key the auto
increment is a handy little feature
where when I do an insert it
automatically adds one to the existing
ID so the first thing I put in there is
going to have an ID of one the second
thing I put in there is going to have an
ID of two and so on and so forth the VAR
char is again it's a type much like the
integer except it's four strings short
strings and the maximum length of my
strings in this case is going to be 300
the last little bit at the end is
important for relational databases so
here what we're talking about is the
engine
the actual structure of our table and
how that's going to be stored and
accessed within mysql think of it as the
difference if you if you remember back
in the day when there was fat 32 and
ntfs you know there was different file
systems and you had you know different
ways of storing data on those file
systems this is a similar kind of
structure where you can have multiple
engines and mysql is is driving those
different engines the nodb engine is the
most current and the one that's
suggested at least at this stage in the
game and it's great for doing exactly
what we want to do today which is
relationships between tables so I'm just
going to select these two lines and hit
copy and I'm going to paste them in here
and I shouldn't get any errors which I
don't which is good and if I say show
tables again I should see that we've got
a categories table and if I say describe
category I should see that I've got my
ID and I've got my name and I've got a
primary key with auto increment and if I
do an insert into category name values
politics and then I do another one let's
say international and then I do a select
star from category then I'm going to
have an idea of one and an ID of two and
politics and international so so far so
good so now that we've done this much
we're going to make another table and
this table is going to be for postings
and I'm also going to set up some dummy
data here so we have the category for
politics and we also want a category for
international let's say we want one for
technology
and another one for entertainment and
another one for sports this is a very
generic blog we're doing anything and
everything and lastly we're going to
have an other category now i'm also
going to create a new table and this
table is going to be called post and
it's also going to have an ID and
instead of there being a name with a VAR
char of 300 characters there's going to
be a title of our chart 300 but there's
also going to be a content column which
will be of type text which means that it
can be any length if you're coming from
an oracle world this is the this is the
equivalent of a club a large character
blob basically a place where you can put
as much content as you want as much text
content as you want and then i'm going
to have a category ID also of type int
and we'll talk about that in just a
second because that's how we're going to
build our relationships so in order for
this to be nice and easy to work with
i'm going to create some drop statements
and a drop statement basically deletes
or gets rid of a table so i'm going to
say drop table pose a category and drop
table post so if i take my drop table
category and paste it in it will if i go
show tables i won't see anything anymore
now i'm going to take all of this all
these SQL statements and i'm just going
to paste them in one by one and if i say
show tables I should have category and
post and if I do a select star from
category I'm going to have my six
categories and everything looks pretty
peachy and if I describe
my post it looks also pretty good so
there we have it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
