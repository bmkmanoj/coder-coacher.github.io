something called an array
and Rey is a type of variable that
allows you to hold multiple pieces of
information as you may recall from our
previous videos we use variables to
store information so that we could use
this information later on and multiple
times in our scripts arrays work like
variables except that you can hold or
store many different things inside one
single array arrays are very useful and
as such they're used throughout the PHP
language and they're one of these things
that you really have to understand and
master
a great thing about learning about PHP
arrays is that just about every other
modern programming language comes built
with arrays as well that's because
they're so important and they're so
useful so when you learn PHP arrays
you're gonna learn how to use arrays in
many different languages so get once
again you're gonna be killing many birds
with one stone
to help clarify things for you I've put
together this little graphic that we see
here illustrating the difference between
an array this is the array and a
standard variable as we can see here
with the standard variable it holds one
piece of information the array on the
other hand as you can see here holds
multiple pieces of information you can
look at an array as being a box or a
container if it has many slots for
instance like a carton of eggs so in a
sense arrays are like mini databases but
use something called keys to track the
information that they're storing in the
database a key is sort of like a page
number in a book where you can use the
page number to find a particular piece
of information so in this case you'd
have this would be one page would be a
second page would be the next page and
so on each of these boxes represents a
slot in the array by the way arrays can
have literally an unlimited number of
these spots or slots if you will the
limit is really dependent on how much in
memory you have on the particular server
there are two types of arrays in PHP the
indexed array and the associative array
we're going to actually go into examples
of each and once you see the examples
it's going to be very clear I believe so
if it's unclear for now don't worry
about it it's gonna clear up very soon
let's start with the index terrain you
notice here I put a PHP comment which is
the double slash and I put the I just
put indexed array so I'm leaving myself
a note or a comment so first thing I did
was create a variable called my array
and I use the assignment operator so I'm
assigning this variable my array and I'm
assigning it the array or let me
rephrase that I'm assigning it an array
you see the word array this is what you
would call a keyword or a reserved word
in PHP this is a special word that when
PHP comes across it knows that we're
creating array here an array we start
with the keyword array Open bracket you
see you got the double quotes death
comma Bobby a comma
Jimmy comma and the number 7 then I
close off with another bracket and of
course our semicolon you can see by this
that we create an array by adding items
each of these things or items and you
separate the items with the comma here
you can have strings in here you can
have numbers which you should take from
this is a is how to build an array and B
that you know that you can put different
types of information in an array by the
way in PHP and then just about every
other programming language you would
refer to these different types of
information as being data types that's
another subject we'll cover in another
video but in programming there's a
distinction of classifying the type of
data that you're working this is string
data and we've looked at that in our
because one of the first videos and this
is actually number data you would
actually refer to this as an integer I'm
going off on a tangent here let's get
back to arrays so we've created our
array using the special rate keyword and
we've assigned this array using the
assignment operator to the variable my
array now this type of array here is
called an indexed array because it uses
the position of the data that you add to
the array
as its key if you want to access it when
we back up and explain this to you in a
different way and the index position
refers to the order in which you added
the item to the array so staff would
have an index position it would be the
first item that you add to array so you
would say it would have an index
position of 1 and this would be a second
item that you added to the written to
the array so it's the index position of
2 and so on you would use this index
position to access whatever information
you have in that index so you can think
of an index position as a seat number in
a row of seats if you will so this would
be seat number 2 or index 2
that confuses a little bit I'm going to
tell you something about index positions
in PHP index position always start with
0 not 1 so this is position 0 this is
position 1 this is position 2 and this
is position 3 so remember that doesn't
start with 1 it starts with 0 so here is
how you would access a value in an array
so I'm referring to our variable I'm
saying my array grab the variable value
at position 2 so you figure out first
thought it would be Bobby but in reality
it's Jimmy because 0 1 2 let's look at
the syntax here a little bit closer to
access array elements in an index array
you put the index position of the item
that you want to access from the array
in between the square brackets
so let's look at how this will look like
in our screen we're using the print
commands we've seen before so let's take
a look how this renders in the browser
so as you can see it prints out the
value of Jimmy so we go back a my array
the index position of two is Jimmy even
though it's a third element it's a third
element because it's 0 1 2 what's access
array element with an index of 0 so I'll
say that let's refresh the page and we
get Steff right 0 is step I'm using the
term index position but reality is what
programmers would call these are the
keys right this would be the first key
this will be the third key this would be
a second key remember we're always doing
it we're always starting our account
from a zero
so to enter little discussion on indexed
arrays we're going to look at this print
statement here in English which if we
translate this print statement we're
saying print whatever variable whatever
value excuse me we have stored in the
third position of our array</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
