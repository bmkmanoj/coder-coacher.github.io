technology Google just announced the
Google pixel to and it is really an
incredible piece of technology they
implement a bunch of Google assistant
which is their AI lots of machine
learning and are doing something that
people not into photography or not into
photos beyond just taking selfies might
not be aware of there is now a break if
you will fork in a row between
traditional photography where they're
using lenses and sensors and glass size
to produce a beautiful looking image
versus what they call computational
photography where they're using computer
algorithms and calculations to produce
the same type of images now you see that
with those you know the iPhone thing and
the sound something where they blur the
background now Google is doing this but
they're taken to a whole new level and
they're implementing machine learning
and all this and the other ones do it as
well but we'll see what the results are
but based on the presentations
it looks really amazing they're also
increasing the dynamic range of the
images meaning that the shadows will
clear and the bright skies where their
biggest washed out will look clearer why
you have more detail in the end it's
going to get much better photos but
instead of doing it with traditional
methods that you see Canon Nikon and
Sony is trying to do in there they're
dedicated cameras Google and Apple and
Samsung are trying to do it using
computer algorithms and this to me it's
akin to typewriters versus computers
it's akin to vinyl spinning records
versus high bit digital audio by the way
as far as I know the Google pixels does
24-bit audio and Apple devices don't in
terms of their audio quality 24-bit
versus 16-bit 16-bit is CD quality sound
24-bit is professional quality sound
24-bit audio matches the quality of
vinyl of record
in terms of sound quality but you have
to have two good speakers to hear the
difference finally what was really
impressive about the pixel and the
reason I decided to do this videos but
they've invented something that you saw
in Star Trek a universal translator
essentially you put the google wireless
headphones in and I don't know if you
press a button or something but
essentially somebody speaks to you and a
foreign language
Google's fallen using its translator
capabilities will translate whatever
they say to you and pipe it in in
English some of it you speak English
into your headphones so you hear what
they actually said translated not quite
instantly but pretty blood pretty blade
close and back back at them as well so
if you say something to them in English
if Google will translate it back into
whatever language they were speaking to
you Italian or something I don't know
the details but the demonstration is
pretty impressive we'll see if it
actually works out that way in real life
but this is something you saw on Star
Trek literally a universal translator
it's really amazing and another thing I
want to bring back get back to the
cameras the camera capabilities that
you're starting to see in these smart
phones I think Google was leader last
year until the iPhone 8 but now Google
pixel tools out I think it's going to be
the leader again it looks that way if
this is a game-changer the camera
companies I believe are in trouble
because quickly enough through
computational photography they will be
able to match in many respects the
dedicated cameron canon camera has
dedicated nikon dedicated sony not in
every respect but eventually it'll be
able to pretty much match them in every
respect that how many years will be
could be another two or three years
could be another five years but it's
coming it's coming
DSLR quality will be found in little
devices like this and i'm shooting this
on a cannon right now a TD alright
