what we're doing is we're just building
up a very simple wordpress template from
scratch so far we've only got two very
simple files if I go to the file system
here i'm using my finder and I go to
WordPress and I go to WB content under
themes I template you'll see that we
just have a style dot CSS file and an
index dot PHP file and with those two
files we've managed to create all this
and we've got an older entries section
so we've got a proper loop with
different levels of pages we've got top
level navigation and we've got ourselves
a nice little sidebar which we did in
the last video so the next step is going
to be two separate this out and to clean
up our files a little bit and make that
index dot PHP file a little less scary
because right now it's getting a little
large it's almost a t1 lines of code so
we can actually trim this down first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a new file and I'm going to hit
save so I did file new text document I'm
just going to hit save and then in my
template I'm going to go and i'm going
to write header.php now wordpress knows
that header dot PHP corresponds with the
header next thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to take the index.php file and I'm
going to take everything in the header
tag and op so all of this everything
after the navigation and the closing div
of the header and I'm just going to hit
cut and then I'm going to paste it into
here and I'm going to hit save and I'm
going to hit save here now if i refresh
this page I'm going to lose everything
in my header but don't worry we can get
it back by just going and creating a new
PHP tag here and saying get underscore
header and then the closing PHP tag and
then wordpress knows that it's looking
for a hetero thp and it'll find it
and there you go the next thing I want
to do is I want to pull out this sidebar
so to do that again I'm just going to
hit cut and I'm going to open another
PHP tag and i'm going to say get
underscores sidebar and i'm going to
close my PHP tag and hit save then i'm
going to create a new file and then
paste in my sidebar make sure it's
properly indented and hit save and i'm
going to call this sidebar dot PHP and
if i refresh this nothing should happen
but if i go back to my index dot PHP
file it's starting to look a lot cleaner
all we have now is the content and the
footer well we don't have much of a
footer yet but now i'm much more
inclined to create a footer because
everything else is a lot less
complicated i'm also going to change my
indenting a little bit but we'll get the
footer in first so as part of the footer
i'm just going to say create a new div
and i'm going to call this class footer
and you can do a lot with a footer but
in our purpose for our purposes i'm just
going to say in small text this theme
was made by me and a paragraph tag and
if i refresh it at the bottom it just
says it up very simply we also might
want to give a little bit of credit to
the fine folks at WordPress that have
built this wonderful blogging and
content management system so i'm going
to create another paragraph here with a
class and i'm going to call this thanks
and here i'm just going to say that
this blog is proudly powered by
wordpress
and if you wanted to thank me you could
also do that here but anyways so now if
I hit save and I refresh it we've got
this blog is proudly powered by
wordpress and this theme was made by me
we don't want we don't want these things
necessarily to be very large but we can
just style them very easily first off by
giving our footer a height let's say 70
pixels will give this may be a dark grey
will specify a certain color and I'm
going to say that the footer paragraphs
should be eight point and lastly that
there should be a padding of maybe 20
pixels maybe 20 pixels too much 10
pixels and that links should be also
white and I don't think we need that
small tag so I'm going to get rid of
that since we're already styling it
using CSS and you could put any other
kind of information that you wanted here
of course great i'm just going to
combine these two
and the last thing I'm going to do is
I'm just going to Center my text so in
my paragraph here i'm going to say
text-align center right that looks like
a footer now just like we removed our
sidebar and we removed our header I'm
going to take this section and
everything at the bottom I'm just going
to hit cut I'm going to open another PHP
tag and i'm going to say get footer hit
save create a new file paste it in hit
save and footer dot PHP so we've gone
from two files to five files we've got
our header or footer our index our
sidebar in our style and if I go back
and I refresh nothing has changed
however we've separated things out so
they're very clean and they're easily
available to WordPress the other
advantage is that if i go to design now
and I go to my theme editor I can see
that the footer and the header are all
readily available to make changes
personally I wouldn't make changes this
way since sometimes the formatting
doesn't necessarily work out and all of
that however it's refreshing that you
can easily direct your clients or if you
need a last minute change to be made you
can just direct them to this page and
they can edit using the theme editor in
the next video we're going to be looking
at how we can create specialized pages
for things like the page versus the post
so when I click on about I might not
want it to be styled the same way as a
blog post we're going to do that thanks
a lot for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
