going to talk about the realities of
being a professional developer I think
that people who are new to the game they
have a misconception about what it is
like to be a developer they kind of
think it's maybe like being a chef we
have a set of recipes and then you just
apply these recipes like there were
templates we're gonna create a shopping
cart here's how you create our cart it's
exactly like this here's how you create
a messaging system is exactly like this
cetera etc etc here's how you create CMS
it's exactly like this no being a
software developer is much more like
being a spy like being a detective so
what do I mean by that I mean that when
you are a professional is also to
developer you're constantly learning and
researching and figuring out the
equation figuring out the best way to
handle the job at hand you see when it
comes to building apps for people and
writing code there's no
one-size-fits-all solution period it
just doesn't work that way because every
single business every single application
will have its own particular needs
you're not Gordon and Ramsay the chef
who just applies a recipe you're more
like Sherlock Holmes where you're
investigating using processes that
you've learned using your fundamental
knowledge of the process of the other
skill sets you know in this case its
programming to get to an answer and the
answer of course in programming and
software development is of course the
app that you are building when you first
come out of learning to code when you
first complete your code course and if
you're properly trained you know your
fundamentals well when you get your
first project the last thing you should
expect but it's just going to be super
easy and clear to begin with the way you
develop your skills is to actually build
real
be web apps or iOS apps or Java based
apps or whatever it doesn't matter what
it is you got a considered process like
an investigation like your detective
like your uncovering what the final app
is going to be now as you become more
experienced as you learn to game better
of course you're going to be able to
come to conclusions much more quickly
because you're gonna have seen you will
have seen certain problems that you saw
before so in my courses we do provide
projects shopping carts EMS WordPress
themes etc but they're not meant to be
be cut and stone 10 commandments of how
you build a shopping cart for instance
it's much more of just a demonstration
of how you might approach it to bridge
the cat the gap between foundation and
actual production code in the end though
your clients will have their own
particular needs in terms of how they
might want their shopping cart
implemented they may want to sell
digital products they may want to sew
video or books they may want to sell
physical products they may include taxes
or not they may do shipping and they do
drop shipping you don't know what it is
so just because you do my shopping cart
tutorial walkthrough and the way that we
presented it it's not the set in stone
way it's just showing you how to do it
now if you are a martial artist a
fighter boxing Jiu Jitsu whatever Thai
boxing you can have think of it this way
traditional martial artists will house
set set katas which are pre rehearse
combinations of movements pretend fights
or it will have something called twit
set where we have two people going at
each other but in a rehearsed
you know rehearsed set of moves I punch
I blocked and I kick you block that
punch I moved away excited okay these
are very popular martial arts and I
think originally they were they were
there just as
a basic guide to give people an idea but
what happened as so often in academics
do you have academics in martial arts
they became too relied upon these these
katas and twin sets and then people
forgot what they originally trying to
learn how to do was fight now any person
who's actually done fighting Arts knows
that these cat doesn't win sets are
really very very limited in terms of
what they can do for you the real way to
learn how to fight ultimately once you
have your basics they get in there and
spar you have to spar you have to fight
they don't work out how you do things
and every time you spar every time to
fight you get better doing pre rehearsed
or preset kato's and twin sets it's not
gonna make you into a good fighter in
fact we've had many people I remember
with people black belts and highly
ranked in traditional styles that will
come to the gym and they literally
fought they were great fighters because
they had done all these captains these
pre were her sets and they would get in
a ring and they would they would get
they would get a major beating pretty
quick breezily and he went flabbergasted
that they actually didn't know how to
fight same thing with the project-based
courses without the foundation these
project-based courses are not going to
teach you much and even if you do a
hundred project-based courses you have
some knowledge but ultimately you have
to get in there to actually build things
from scratch so that's why as I did with
my martial arts but I taught martial
arts and talked people in a fight you
did your basics down solid then you
learn a key foundational skill sets in
Friday of course it's timing tactics
it's body mechanics it's mental
conditioning physical conditioning a few
other things you know as I didn't
mention techniques I didn't mention
walkthrough tutorials or I didn't
mention twin sets so I hope that makes
sense so when you're getting into the
programming game to conclude here try
not to feel so nervous that you don't
know all the answers off the top nobody
does and that's in fact what you're paid
to do developers are paid to figure out
the prom like Sherlock Holm's like the
detective on earth how things should be
done given
the needs of that particular project
because it's continuously changing yes
there are generalities about shopping
carts or about the content management
systems etc but ultimately the reason
you have programmers is because they are
writing custom code and by very very
definition when it's custom it's unique
to that particular project I hope that
helps so when you get into your first
project if you're worried but you don't
know everything that's normal don't
worry about it you'll learn you'll
figure it out as you go that's why it's
so important that you have the
fundamentals down because I will make
learning to do stuff and unearthing what
you need to unearth
so much easier I hope that helps bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
