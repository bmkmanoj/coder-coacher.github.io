com welcome to a brand new series on
object oriented PHP seems like there's a
bit of a need for something on the
intermediate level it's a step above the
object oriented PHP course that stuff on
did at keowee PHP calm / tutorials /
object oriented PHP but it's a little
bit of a step below the advanced PHP
course you can find here which talks
about significantly more advanced
subjects so what I'm going to be doing
today is I'm going to be focusing on
practical examples something that you
can use in your everyday life or at the
very least apply in your everyday
programming so let me give you a glance
at what we're going to be building today
we're going to be building a basic login
system using object oriented PHP
functionality wise you'll notice this
particular course is not all that
different from my previous PHP login
series at least for the moment with the
videos I'm going to be talking about
today however keep in mind that the back
end the code itself is significantly
different we're going to be using
entirely object-oriented programming for
this particular course so the
functionality may look similar but the
actual code that produces it is quite
different my goal is not to duplicate
all of the functionality that's
available in the other course I'm going
to be focusing primarily on simple basic
functionality someone being able to
login and logout so as an example see I
have the website open you can go in you
can hit fill in the username and
password hit submit and it tells you
you've successfully enter the members
area and you can log out so I'm keeping
this pretty simple I'm trying to do the
absolute basics because I don't want to
confuse people too much we're going to
be focusing on building two main objects
we're going to be building an
authorization object which is going to
handle the tasks involved with
querying a database checking if users
are logged in checking users author you
know username and password to make sure
it matches the database those who are
the tasks and we're also going to be
building a basic template amix it easy
for you to load your views display
certain information in those views and
i'll be explaining that step by step to
follow along with this course you're
going to need a couple things you're
going to need a computer with PHP set up
I'm assuming that you should have this
in place already because i'm also
assuming that you've worked through
Stefan's object oriented PHP series the
beginners course so obviously need that
you can you need a basic text editor I
mean even notepad or something simple
will work I'm a fan of kota and you also
need a computer that has php5 set up and
you can briefly check that assuming
you're using something like MAMP or wamp
it should be up to date you should be
running PHP 5 by now and i would say
ninety percent of all hosts should be
running PHP 5 as well it's been out for
several years so if you want to check
that briefly I have a file set up and
that file looks like this as the PHP
info function and it tells you the
version in the header one final note as
this video wrapped up I do want to be
clear that while I am trying to keep
this as an intermediate level course as
much as possible some of the stuff we
will be going over is complicated it is
a little bit confusing as you first get
started to realize how all the different
files interact and how they interconnect
and it's something that I had struggled
with when I first got started with
object oriented PHP so keep that in mind
if you do run into challenges i would
suggest watching the video more than
once may want to try experimenting on
your own a little bit sometimes
doing it yourself helps thing is click
and feel free to post on the kill
websites forums if you need any help I'm
always around I'm always happy to help
out with questions so like I said you
have some resources available to you if
you have issues well that brings this
video to a close thanks for following
along and definitely check out part 2
i'll be talking a little bit about
object oriented PHP and MVC theory just
a little bit enough to get you started
and how to set up the database in your
files so you can follow along with this
course thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
