little bit of a step away from Python
code theory and let's do something
that's a little bit more fun perhaps so
what we're going to do is we're going to
learn to do some basic drawing with
Python
so I've launched the Python shell now we
could do this in a separate py file but
I'm just going to do it right and she'll
just so we can go over everything
quickly as you see me write code
throughout this course after you watch a
video after you've taken the notes and
so on
I really really strongly suggest you
should try out the code yourself start
typing alcohol is very important you
take out code so that it will help you
to learn much more quickly so I typed
out a new command here we haven't seen
before something called import and you
know you have a reserved word or special
word in Python when you see that the
Python IDE Python shell highlighted in
orange that's a good sign but that's a
special word anyway so the import
command is basically telling Python to
import a package of code you see Python
like so many other programming languages
they have all kinds of packages called
big of package of code like a libraries
of code so python has a huge library of
code all kinds of packages and these
packages do different things so this
basic package here is called turtle and
turtle is a basic drawing package in
Python so it allows you to do simple
things allows you to draw there's
different packages to do this implies
novice this is an easy one so we're just
going to use this for now so I type in
import turtle hit enter so now it's
imported so Python behind the scenes the
Python shell is now imported this
package of code into our current shell
that we're running here yeah it's kind
of like ordering food from a restaurant
now it's on the table it's rated eat so
let's try something else now so what we
want to do is want to use some built-in
functions
are built into the turtle package so
this package of code called turtle think
of a bag of code it has a bunch of
functions member functions we use them
we'll use the the STR function we use
the int function before and of course
we've been using the print function all
day since the beginning now you know
code is a function in Python when you
have the name of the function and then
you get the two round brackets I call
these round brackets myself so that's
that's a sure sign that's a function so
first thing we have to do is we have to
activate something so you type in touch
sorry for turtle and we're go turtle dot
te n them so what's going on here we're
creating a variable called cut member
variable is a is a container that holds
information Sumner's we'll call it a
reference or a handle like a handle and
a frying pan so we're creating a handle
to get a handle of this pen inside of
turtle we're going to go more into
details about all this code as we go
through the course but we're just going
to have some fun here and we're going to
drop cut equals turtle pen notice I got
a capital P very point so we just hit
enter and boom Python launches this
window so we just minimizer's here so
the windows launches it python turtle
graphics so that's what this code just
did so we launched a window you see
little arrow here
that's what python calls a turtle I
don't know why they call it a turtle
that's what they call it's an arrow but
now we can control this turtle using
this variable so we go touch dot forward
and we'll say 200 pixels hit enter those
the arrow
look-look-look arrow bool so then we
could say Tut dot dot dot left and we're
going to move 45 degrees to the left
watch the L turn do and now we're going
to say Tut dot forward again let's say a
hundred and fifty pixels and now let's
try a little Tut dot left
again how much again we'll say 45 see
the arrow turn again so let's go to that
forward let's see two hundred and forty
three hundred forty pixels below off the
screen so now let's turn this guy around
tut dot laughs let's turn them 180
degrees it's off screen the don't worry
we're moving for again taught that
forward I'm gonna move on three hundred
and forty degrees but I was silly of me
now he's back on line so let's talk that
tut dot right oh you know there's you
know the IDE is guessing what we might
want to type that's a that's a
functionality of integrated development
environments is that they'll give you
code hinting here it's trying to guess
what we want some are better than others
this one is actually not too good but it
still works so cut that right and see
highlights right there so we just hit
enter oh I got to give it to a value
excuse me taught dot right and we'll say
turn right 90 degrees there we go
now I'm going to cut dot for 240
whatever 234 so there you go so you can
see you can go on and on and on and
we're going to learn to Adam ate all
this so you feed pythons turtle module
module being a package of code we've
imported it into our Python shell using
the import command and then we created a
variable so that we can access the pen
inside of turtle inside of the turtle
package remember the packaged turtle is
like a library of code that you can
access and this library code allows you
to draw on screen and we've done all
kinds of things right with groups of
four left right etc etc etc there's much
more to it than that but let's stop here
because we've learned a few things so I
would suggest you break out your
Python shell and you start drying on
screen a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
