recording with my DLSR just in case
you're wondering but i'm recording audio
on both the camera and my dedicated mic
let me just show you here this is a pro
mic the great mic because it is a
fault-tolerant fault-tolerant what does
that mean fault-tolerant it means that
it is a mic that's not super sensitive
so you can make mistakes you can not pay
to collect too close attention to what
you're doing in the mic how you're
speaking to the mic and you still gotta
get good sound that is a fault-tolerant
mic so what we're going to do in this
particular vlog is i'm going to answer
some questions and they're not going to
get into whatever so first of all let me
just say that my fabled server migration
is pretty much something we get this in
the way you okay my affable server
migration is done it
it took me getting up at 6:00 in the
morning when I realized that many of the
sites that they had migrated they did
not migrate properly essentially what
happens is that the the B team the C
team is involved in the basic migrations
at this particular company and so the C
team didn't do a very basic thing like
checking to see if the migrations were
successful before doing the DNS update
now the DNS is short for domain name
server and essentially the domain name
servers of DNS servers I use domain name
server anyway I'm not a server admin I
used to be a long time ago I forget a
lot of stuff now but anyway the DNS
server is what you have to set to tell
the internet where your site happens to
be so unfortunately or fortunately have
several sites many sites so we did the
big transfer last night and
well they did and they didn't check to
see if the transfers were successful
meaning that the sites were loading
properly hangout so they do to transfer
and then they turn the switch of the DNS
I wake up at 6:00 in the morning
and lo and behold most of the sites are
offline for at least 2-3 hours so at
this point I'm getting pretty angry
about this langree is a strong word I'm
a little ticked off so whatever I
started emailing them and c'mon c'mon
fix it up boom boom anyway long story
short I had to get the the the 18 at the
hosting company to get involved they're
able to fix it they got a good group but
when it came to just the server
transfers they got the c-team on there
and they're not doing such a good job so
long story short I started at 6 a.m. and
I wasn't working full-time on this but
I'm constantly sending emails
double-checking and this is not working
you gotta fix this you should install
that boom big boom and honestly they're
responding and doing it but ideally they
should you know just make sure it's up
and running so when I thought I got the
a-team on the job things started
happening so I started coming up but you
know what
I really wasn't done supervising this
whole process until like 6 o'clock at
night now again I took lunch off I did
this I did that but it's a constant
thing it's it's very tiring it's very
tiring when you're under a bit of
pressure because you want your site's to
be up the killer sites network of sites
there's like 4 4 good sites they get
about a quarter million unique visitors
a month and over 2 million pageviews and
so it's important that these sites stay
up also we have the apps some of the
apps were dependent on the new server
being up and running properly so so
that's a bit of a problem so it's a bit
of a string anyhow so you know 12 hours
later it looks like pretty good looks
like everything's going we're going to
know ultimately tomorrow because
tomorrow I have to power down the old
dedicated server because at the end a
month the
payments due so I want to try to avoid
that and there you go this is business
welcome to the world of entrepreneurial
of entrepreneurship garage be an
entrepreneur welcome to the world where
you as a CEO as the owner you are the
guy or the girl who has to deal with all
the problems you have deal with all the
BS that's you you're the person besides
having to deal with the creative
direction the big picture you got to
make sure that the wheels are greased
and the thing is going forward that's
just the way it goes so if you think
running a business is like this
glamorous thing that's a lot of fun and
a lot less work no not not not always
sometimes like I had a real good stretch
for like 10 years where you know I was
basically similar retired but coming out
of it and pushing for with these new
projects that I'm doing involved in a
few things so my work and the server
migration is just one thing these days
if you're starting a business even if
it's not really tech business you have
to have a web presence and so on so
anyway off on the tangent here so I in
terms of my course material like I said
that Python course it's still up for
presale because of the editors she got
caught up in stuff we were in a big
hurry so the final version is not out
the videos are pretty much like 98% done
at least some tweaks here and there but
you know they're pretty really good I've
been creating courses since 2003 and I
think the Python course the best course
I ever put out that's for sure so you
can get a now pre-order get it cheap
when it gets out of pre-order prices
going up and when it gets mounted in
sitio web though you're going to have
the interactive component and the
quizzing and so forth
going forward I terms of course material
but terms of tech I think I'm going to
come up with some maybe more
nice Python courses I believe people
would ask me for that I've covered a lot
of the other things the important things
html5 css3 javascript see my html5 css3
and JavaScript back home beginners but
they'd start you from beginner but they
take you to professional level you know
a minimum six let me teach you
everything but I teach you all the key
techniques and you're able to build all
the things that people want to build
this is not an advertisement there's a
point to this the point is is that if
you've been watching my videos you know
that I'm a huge believer in the
fundamentals once you get the
fundamentals everything else comes
pretty easy so that is what we're us now
that I got these fundamentals in place
these fundamental courses let me tell
you to put out the HTML the CSS the
JavaScript with PHP course properly I'll
fix that in that it was like six to
eight months of work I'm not full time
but maybe 70% of my time and people why
how could that be well there are
hundreds of videos over a thousand quiz
questions highly refined highly edited
and that's why they're so effective now
you see a lot of YouTube videos were
disguised right on and they do they do
good work but they're not nearly as
structured as my course in fact I wrote
my book which you guys have seen to help
me plan out the structure of the courses
because when you're building courses for
the general public which is slap on
YouTube that's one thing but when you're
building course is used by institutions
educational institution schools and
other places that's a whole different
kettle of fish there it's it requires
much more effort on your part to get
things done so in terms of technical or
coding based courses again like I said I
got to keep the key ones in place which
can take you in all kinds of directions
in terms of career so with the html5
css3 javascript PHP and Python that's
huge that's huge right there you can
leapfrog into almost anything I might do
something an intro to AI I might do
something I might put out gaming
could a to create a game with Python for
people for people have fun with that
but I think what I'm going to do is
something that I don't see too often out
there is that's actually proper business
and technology courses or business
related laws and discussions I've talked
about things in mini-wave logs but I
think I'm putting together something
really well structured and this is what
I think is a lot more rare because for
every forever for every entrepreneur
who's had successes in small business or
maybe 10,000 coders or a hundred
thousand coders you know what I mean
something like that I don't know the
racial is but you get the idea and since
I've been in business for 28 years and
different types of small business I
think I have a lot to bring to the table
in terms of those type of discussions
since I didn't get lucky and was born
rich kids since I didn't get lucky with
the one the big hit the big one-hit
wonder I struggled and tried different
businesses different products different
industries even I'm not just the tech
guy so in fact the tech and learning to
code was a vehicle to help my non tech
business originally anyway so I think
you can see more of the contents could
be oriented towards business and we'll
see how that goes
YouTube is is a hobby but it's also I
have to admit it's also exposed me to
people who may not have seen my work
before so I just going to continue in
that direction and we'll see what the
audience decides what they like and take
it from there so what I'm going to do
now is answer some emails no answer this
pinned comment by David Connelly who
here's an example of guy who knows how
to write in those business and why do I
say that if you look at it let me just
zoom in on this hold on
let us do that because you want Charlie
as a channel David Connolly a mailer
check that out pretty entertaining
speaker she writes in a concise way and
he gets to the point see I was using
bullet points here in modern day writing
you want to have short paragraphs you
want to make use of bullet points you
want to get to the point especially when
people are in positions of authority
when you're busy they have tons of
information being hurled at them they
don't have time to read you know big
giant paragraphs of text when I see
emails a huge paragraphs ago it's like
Howard Stern a lovin of a big family he
said one thing those I can attest you
and I agree with he said the difference
between between the difference between
people who are successful and those who
aren't successful is that the successful
people know how to edit now he he thinks
in terms of radio because that's been
his career but you think about that it
comes down to the same thing in martial
arts and fighting and you know I got
this from Bruce Lee Reggie kundo and he
said basically to absorb all kinds of
information around you but then get it
take get rid of all the superfluous
stuff edit it out and I noticed like the
best fighters in the world it would just
use one or two techniques over and over
again but they really knew how to use
them well so this is not a lesson in
fighting so I'm not going into the
details but again it comes down to that
ability to really refine what you're
doing and take it to you know take it to
its its core essence if you will and
that's what I've done with my courses by
the way I try one of the reasons are so
much work because I'm structuring them
so I teach you two core aspects of the
languages in the concepts behind the
languages it's going to carry you
forward and that's why once you have
that all those other details come easy
so writing is the same way if you can
write concisely
be to the point use a simple language
use bullets as we see here it's much
more effective it's much more effective
of writing style so let's just get into
what David said here a long time flower
since back to when I was using the Zen
framework yeah I did one of the first
videos I put out on YouTube is why I'm
using the same framework that was a long
time ago back down was like 25 pounds
overweight heavier and yeah so it he saw
if I was in front of the camera was a
guru is weird
I was not comfortable from the camera
for a long time anyway so you had a few
thoughts offer but today say in this
video
Steph logs about app servers and
direction by China okay so my channel
okay so he says audio says it's a funny
thing it's a funny old thing but there's
definitely a different energy when it's
audio only now don't get me wrong now
okay you're handsome dude okay I can't
rationally explain it why it's the case
but I think it does work well so
probably going it's going to be
interesting okay so David likes the idea
of me doing audio-only content I am
going to do that because it's just a lot
easier to do audio only having to set up
a camera and make sure my hair is calm
rather than just put the mic down right
that's a lot easier so I'm going to do
that but also audio only it's convenient
because you can listen to on the go you
don't need to see me for me to talk
about things about business and stuff
like that anyhow topics personally
speaking I enjoy general business topics
more so than web development there you
go yeah you know I think business topics
is a wide variety they let me tell you
since I've been doing for 28 years and I
have many my friends and fault I got out
I got all kind the stories some stuff
crazier than you'd ever thought possible
trust me so it's going to be cool to get
into that I think I'm gonna have fun
doing it so it'll be better specific
questions you don't have to answer any
of these are just random thoughts okay
so yes questions for me alright
based on what you just said about
hosting would you agree Rackspace is the
most solid short ever
we started like shorts talking about in
stock trading you can buy shares hoping
to go up and you can do something called
short shares basically it's a weird
thing where you can pre even borrow
shares from the bank or a broker and
then sell them take the money put in
your pocket but at some point you have
to buy those shares back you have to pay
for it and when you shorten your shares
you hope it's like think about they're
getting shorter you're hoping that their
value gets shorter you're hoping that
they lose value so then when you buy
them back you buy them back for less so
let's say you decide that a certain
stock like Rackspace is going to go
under you figure out their business
sucks so what you do you can you can
short their stock so what that means is
that you can borrow the stock's the
Rackspace stocks from somebody's got
them brokers and get all kinds of stocks
fault lying around and you buy a bus
eight or ten bucks each so you buy them
you get them for you borrow a hundred or
thousand or ten thousand what are you
going to do and your ten bucks each and
you sell them by ten bucks and you
pocket that money now what you're hoping
is that they're going to go to nine
bucks or eight bucks or you're going to
go to 87 bucks so when they get to a
lower price you pock you have to you
have to buy them yet you have to you
have to provide those shares you have to
buy them back
right because you borrow the shares you
borrow them to sell so you have to buy
them back so if they go down to seven
bucks
you may $3 for every share that you
already pre-sold right that's called
shorting you're betting that the shares
actually go down in value and there's a
lot of shorting in the market so when I
short Rackspace well they're just
involved with dedicated servers because
I was talking about how dedicated
servers are a thing of the past right
it's they're still used quite a bit but
I would say if you if you if you need to
have a private server because you want
to control and so forth don't go
dedicated server I would go virtual
private server virtualized server if you
can if you can find an option that is
good out there there's several companies
are all jumping on board because it's a
much better solution overall
yeah so why is better because you got
all the flexibility of the cloud you
have to worry about single point of
failure your hardware breaking down
every being is virtualized blah blah
blah it's pretty cool so what I short
Rackspace well if they're only in
physical servers I don't know I think
you know I would have to see what the
the business is actually doing but I
would imagine Rackspace's
evolved in in cloud hosting as well but
yeah I would have to check it out with
with with Google and Amazon getting in
on the game boof anyway so yeah next
question do you think that the rise of
AI will be gradual in gender do you
think is a dramatic and scary depends on
the area I think it's going to come in
spikes like everything else like I was
talking to a friend of mine and he has
an AI based app he's been working on for
a few years and he's an engineer and
he's basically his app now replaces the
jobs of highly paid six-figure technical
writers and he was telling me when his
assistant writers were bringing back
technical documents it were like 70%
good and there was a lot of but you
editing that had to be done and these
people highly trained his AI now says he
tells me performs at ninety percent
efficiency so the AI is actually better
than his highly-trained six-figure
technical writers so it depends on the
area yes I think there will be spikes
but I think the last place to go is
going to be creative in terms of AI
replacing you to creative areas and in
the coding you know and also the trades
of skills you know plumbers and stuff
like that coders will be good for many
years because the AI is not there yet
but simpler things systemic things like
filling in reports and writing out
reports that can be anything that can
you can identify a pattern the AI is
going to come in and kick that around
that's for sure
in terms of the generic direction that
human
is going and taking onboard technology
overpopulated geopolitics your primary
sir are you an optimist or peasant as
when it comes to the future in universe
I'm extremely optimistic to be honest
with you humans have a tendency be very
pessimistic if you want watch old films
it's always like but the fact that
matter is a technology as a tendency to
free us over time and today life is a
lot easier than it was you know 80 years
ago look at our houses are much bigger
or cars are better entertainment we have
unlimited entertainment now ever friends
like a bum I went to high school with a
music he's a pure bum this is unwell
fair but he has a nice little apartments
comfortable is that a high-speed
Internet he watches TV all day as all
the food he wants he has okay clothes
doesn't have to work and but 100 years
ago forget it you would be finished so
and when when a eye comes in in robotics
and as cheaper energy comes in more
efficient solar and and the natural gas
starts picking up and you know I'm not
getting political but when all this
energy starts flowing in it's happening
and cars becoming more and more
efficient our technology is more
efficient at you just the price of
anything is going to plummet so I think
the disparity of wealth between the rich
and the poor is going to be smaller and
smaller and smaller so like Warren
Buffett famously said you know the
average person now has a much better
life quality of life than the richest
man in the world 130 years ago you know
because of technology right and this is
just going to accelerate big big time
with robotics I'm very optimistic about
it in fact I think there's going to be
basic income in 15 years there's no
choice in the matter you know
self-driving cars and automated
checkouts at McDonald's is just the
beginning so it's kind of cool I think
they like the Star Trek vision of the
world's what I think it's going to
happen but it's just me it's based on
again my observations about my
conversations my great-grandmother with
to be 98 how you know the lease is so
socks back then because socks were
expensive today you know you throw him
out and you get new socks or so cheap in
terms of the general okay any columns
occurred geopolitical situation I don't
want to comment too
on politics because I tend to be a
centrist but if I'm a centrist in the
left things I'm a righty and write these
things in molesters and so I'm a
pragmatist more or less I think that
generally speaking I think it's it's
ridiculous that people were poor living
in the streets given how much technology
is up there how much wolf there is I
think the problem is that there's not
that there isn't enough to go around and
it's just distribution and technology
will solve that problem distribution of
resources and again as the robots kick
in and so forth all this is going to
become a thing in the past so
geopolitics again a lot of geopolitical
strains has to deal with resource Wars
lack of resources but as resource become
super abundant with super efficient
technologies that are coming out AI
robotics better renewables you know
people have no reason to go to war you
know well at least a lot less what's
your favorite non tech book oh that
really depends on my mood you know era
depends on who the most impactful book
for me when I was a kid was the hobbit
j.r.r tolkien I really loved that book
certain in terms of understanding
humanity get the naked ape the naked ape
is one of these seminal books written by
colleges I think either coffee your hope
here we go the naked ape this is one of
the most important books actually
because my book from college and I kept
it because it's such an important book
and these guys a couple zoologists who
decide to study humans like they would
study monkeys and it's fascinating
because you start seeing that our
behaviors are very similar to monkeys
and in fact when I used to keep import
rare tropical fish for collectors and
public aquariums and Sue's and in pet
stores I subs bringing recipients tens
and tens of thousands of fish and I
observed a lot of these species or they
had similar patterns to humans to either
deny those sounds really weird in terms
of behavior our behaviors though
abstracted by language and technology
but the motivations the underlying
motivations are the same so you have
certainty view one example before I
finish this vlog so you have certain
species of fish that will build little
houses and nests to impress the the
chicks you know we do that with carbs
right we do that with cars we do that
with nice hot apartments and houses you
know so the same motivations so there
you go this is great thanks David
I love these questions and check out
David's channel he's pretty easy pretty
smart guy Ellicott I saw a few of those
vlogs or look pretty good so that's
about it if you have any questions any
comments about the style just let me
know
