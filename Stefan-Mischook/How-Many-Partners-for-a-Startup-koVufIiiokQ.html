I'm going to talk about partnerships in
your new business in your startup I'm
going to look at optimal number of
partners pros and cons and we'll take it
from there so for me it's about eight
thirty in the morning on sunday I
ordered some food yesterday ordered a
mix plate to souvlaki some lettuce salad
and has some fries french fries I've
been cutting down on my french fries
recently because it's not good for you
and what happens when you stop eating
potatoes he stopped eating starches and
then you have a bit you know at least
for me it knocks me out so I ordered his
food around six o'clock at night had it
i was knocked out around eight woke up
at 13 in the morning so I've been up
kind of up since 130 in and out
sometimes you know up until four in the
morning and went back to sleep for an
hour and back up so here you go that's
why I'm not demonstrated today it is
what it is sunday so contracts excuse me
no partnerships so big question is how
many partners should you have in your
startup how many partners should you
have in your new business that depends
on a few factors a do you need extra
skills do you need skills that you don't
have a be reason to get a partner so if
you're coder and you're not a designer
you don't understand business that might
be reason to get a partner or the
opposite if your business guy who has a
good understanding of a business problem
that could be solved with software and
you don't have the money maybe you get a
partner to to code it for you or maybe
you get a partner who's got money to
find the coders there's reason for that
so what's the optimal the optimal number
Ben's you talk to this it's good to have
less number of partners the better
typically because then you have less
headaches less arguments lest you know
less debates and less you know less
people to split the pie with I suppose
but the bigger issue is the debates and
the debates and the info
as if you have two partners who each
have fifty percent of the company then
you are going to be in a situation where
you're going to have deadlox probably
and they should put we are both really
reasonable but you're still going to
have deadlock sat on occasion so to
resolve that you could bring in a third
party advisor partner some experienced
business person or money guy who has a
stake in the business not necessarily a
big stake they have five percent or ten
percent you know twenty percent and the
whole point having a third partner who's
got who has some skin in the game they
can break stalemates they could be the
tiebreaker so if you have a decision to
be made and the two main partners can't
come to an agreement if their partner
can come in and break that stalemate so
that's that's the advantage of having a
three partners in that you can you know
you can do that that helps facilitate
the process of the business moving
forward that said you got to be very
careful when you're choosing your
partners because when you're choosing
your partner is like getting married
there's a lot of financial and you're
going to be there's a lot of financial
entanglements and you're going to be
locked in with this person for a long
time likely so you better be sure that
you get along with them and the most
important thing about a partner is that
you feel that they're honest and that
they're honest people that you can trust
and of course they should come to the
table they should come to business was
so so some sort of skill set that's
valuable and a good work ethic because
anybody will tell you when you're
starting a new business when you're
running a business you will work harder
and longer hours and if you are working
for somebody else this is guaranteed I
may not seem like it because when you're
an entrepreneur or your business owner
you can maybe lead different hours
depending on the type of business but in
the end you will work longer hours so be
sure that your your partner is is
dedicated to work and has
record to show that because the worst
thing that could happen to you is that
your partner has half the business or
seen it or significant part of business
and they're just not pulling their
weight and any much you can do about
that because they own half the business
so keep that in mind those are my
morning tips about business optimal
partnerships is none one person partner
with yourself and then I would I would
lean towards three if you're worried
about the whole you know if you don't
want to be caught in an argument where
you know you can't come to a decision
that third partner could break the
stalemate and one of the thing when you
do have a partnership you should have
something called a shot gun contract I
don't know if this applies all over the
world but at least in North America and
I'm sure in Europe lateral by Europe but
in North America at least there's a
clause is typically used in a
partnership agreements called a shotgun
contract where if for whatever reasons
one of the partners wants to get out the
way to shotgun works is that one partner
can couldn't approach the other partner
say I'm going to buy you out and I'm
offering you X amount of dollars well
just say it's a million dollars for a
sake of argument now what the shotgun
contract stipulates and this is a
contractor you sign when you actually
put together the company if you offer
your partner a million dollars your
partner has the right to pay you a
million dollars for the company and you
have to accept it bye-bye log that's in
the contrast of shotgun contract and
vice versa so if you offer a view
lowball him and are her and offer her a
hundred thousand for a company that's
worth a million and this partner can go
I'll give you a hundred thousand and you
have to accept it that is the law so
this prevents you from UM from low
balling people and unfairly trying to
buy them out and if I recall correctly
because I've used in look I've never
used a shotgun
one part business partner full partner
what a long time ago like 15-20 years
ago and unfortunately I didn't have a
shotgun at that point anyhow so I think
the shotgun is also that the partner has
to accept the offer or they have to buy
you out so if you come and say I'm
giving you a half million a you have to
give you half million or they have to
accept a half a million that's the
shotgun so that's a quick and dirty way
to to get out of a bad partnership now
you know partnership could be within a
corporate structure corporation or it
could be in terms of a partnership true
partnership now in terms of the business
entity to type of business that you have
legally this is dependent on the country
that you are in so I have to leave you
that to explore by yourself so there you
go those are my tips with regards to you
know starting a small business and
partnerships and so on I've encoding
since 1994 but I've been in business
longer like a few years longer so I'll
small a little bit all small businesses
some little businesses some a little bit
bigger and some I had to fold some that
make good money for me over a time over
time but there you go I hope you find
this useful and cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
