calm in this video blog I'm going to
talk about PHP frameworks I was recently
asked about web frameworks what they
were and why you might want to use them
first of all a web framework you can
think of things like CodeIgniter laravel
zen framework symphony and others and
these frameworks are basically just
collections of PHP called their
libraries are structured in a particular
format so with the aim of making it
really easy for you to develop web apps
web applications this format I'm talking
about is just like the directory
structure and how in a logical way how
the application is structured and the
convention these days is the MVC
framework it's the model-view-controller
pattern and this is basically a way of
interact of organizing the way the web
application in this case the PHP
application works and is how you
separate your code into three logical
sets you have the code for your views to
the pages that people actually see and
that's the V and Model View controller
and MVC the motto is basically the code
that has all your business logic your
database logic it's all in the files
there and then you know the other side
you in between the two you've got the
view here you've got the model here in
between the two is you got the broker
brokering code the codes called the
controllers and they control the
interaction between all your business
objects the database stuff and what's
displayed on the pages in the view
that's the controller so Model View
controller is very common it's used in
all kinds of languages these days Ruby
Java PHP and others
and it's very effective in creating a
very easy to manage web application so
when you have a web framework like Zend
or a cold igniter and so on they are all
structured or many of them are
structured using this MVC style so what
that means is that when you use one of
these frameworks and if you're familiar
with MVC because it's a very common
pattern it should be easier for you to
learn and work with the framework or if
you have somebody else who comes to your
project let's say you have a project
that's based on the sand framework for
instance so you say okay you hire new
guy and he knows a Zen framework he'll
be able to launch into the application
and very quickly understand what's going
on and get up to speed very very quickly
because he will be familiar with the Zen
framework and an MVC pattern so even if
you have so many goals from one MVC
framework like the Zen framework it
moves to larva or to Cohen matter though
they're different frameworks because
they're all MVC based it's going to be a
lot easier for them to learn one from
the other so what's the number one
reason well the top three reasons I have
for learning
why believe rather for learning and MVC
framework is number one in the end
although there will be a loading curve
in the beginning but once you understand
it it will make writing web applications
much much much much easier why because
these all these frameworks besides
having a consistent structure
you also have code libraries and
procedures that go with it so you don't
have to work on often to authentic Asian
objects in many cases database objects
and objects are present the information
on the views on the pages all this is
done for all the validation objects this
is all done so you don't have to rewrite
it
and the great thing about these code
libraries is oftentimes they're very
well vetted they've been written and
refined and so you're probably going to
get pretty much bug free or near
bug-free code at least in theory
nothing's perfect of course but you are
going to have that huge advantage so
instead of having to write all this
boilerplate this framework code it's all
presented it's all there for you in the
framework so the other big advantage to
using a framework you know well with
these code libraries rather give it an
Indian save a lot of time right because
you won't have to write things and
finally another big advantage in fact is
that you will learn different styles
different techniques of coding and you
will improve your programming skills as
you jump into one of these frameworks
and in fact of an advocate of do you
pick a framework that you like it's
sticking and stick to it but it makes
sense once in a while to look at other
competing frameworks because you you'll
see that there's different ways of
approaching the situation and each you
know each framework will have their own
way of doing things and you'll soon
discover what's better what's you know
what's not so good depending on your
particular style of programming perhaps
so for instance if you let's say you had
been an expert in the Zen framework it
might be a good idea to look at laravel
it's another PHP framework and to check
that out and I think that when you
compare and contrast between the
frameworks how they approach everything
it will just make you a better
programmer in the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
