system and you see I'm in C WAMP and as
I mentioned in a previous video our
action our web files she actually going
on w w folder so I'm gonna pop that open
you know there's all these projects here
notice PHP work how to build your
ActionScript pure Ajax these are all
killer sites and what I'm going to do is
notice notice them here if you go into
this project page you notice it's the
same ones right so these are all sub
directories or subfolders within the WWF
older and WAMP
so I'll just click on one PHP work now
this is where I actually wrote our
particular script the one we just wrote
you know to get our root address you
know it's the subdirectory PHP work and
here is our script printing hello world
let's go back to our actual code notice
how the world so let's change this to
hello world oneness I'll save that go
back to web browser you know you notice
here how its printed out here what to
point out a few things now let's look at
the source page source now here's a
couple of things you want I want you to
understand he knows how hello world
number one and hello world are all in
one line though in our PHP code it's on
two lines this is where you have to draw
on your HTML knowledge and you know that
HTML doesn't recognize whitespace right
so if we go back in the source code the
PHP code literally just printed out
these two strings of text one after the
other and this is how it appears in the
HTML so we're not going to have in the
page display we're not going to have any
breaks if we actually want to insert a
break we have to insert HTML code and
tell PHP to insert HTML code and that's
what I'm going to show you now
back here we got hello world 1 and what
I'm going to do is insert a simple break
save that go back to our HTML boom we
have a break let's view the source again
it's all in one line but here's our
break tag so now we're learning that PHP
print statement can be used to print
normal text and HTML tags
before I go on to the next part about
writing code want to point out one other
thing like I puts a couple spaces here
so I got lots of white space I'll save
that again you'll notice I'll refresh
the page it doesn't have any impact in
terms of how the HTML is displayed or in
terms of our page source it's important
that you understand these distinctions I
was just starting to write out your PHP
code you see how it'll affect things as
we go along
so thus far we've looked at it PHP code
blocks we've looked at PHP statements in
this case we're using the built in thing
the built in PHP print function that
allows us to print text normal normal
text and HTML text to the page what I
want to show you now is how we can mix
and match HTML and PHP within the page
so it's a lot easier to edit the reason
I say is a lot easier to edit is because
it's not necessarily a great thing to
put the print use print commands to
printer HTML with the PHP a lot of times
you can mix in PHP with HTML to get the
effect you want let me show you what
we're gonna let me show you by an
example and I think we'll become very
clear
I've modified the PHP code now so it's
simplified so you knows we've got our
PHP block here with our print statement
here and we're printing a string of text
here and of course we've ended with a
semicolon because it's an it's the end
of the PHP statement C we're learning
stuff already so let's create another
PHP code block which I've done very
quickly here and I'm just gonna cut and
paste this because cut and paste is good
when you're programming because once you
know this is well done and it works
Mazal cut and paste it so you you reduce
the chances that you're gonna introduce
errors so I'm gonna call this hello
world - I'm not gonna spell it properly
because we're pressed for time but no
we're not but anyway so now we got one
code one PHP block of code another PHP
block of code and in here is this a
standard HTML page so I'm just gonna
copy I'm just gonna actually put in
another break I'll put in two breaks so
what I want to show you here is how we
could have we can intermix PHP blocks
with HTML and so I have a PHP block here
another PHP block here and I can
continue onwards and it will work just
fine I've saved this page let's pop open
the browser hit refresh and here we go
it renders properly let's look at the
page source you notice the difference it
looks pretty much the same and for all
practical purposes we can move on but I
wonder if any of you have picked up on a
distinction here if you remember what I
just had to pre PHP print statements
went off to the other the text appeared
on one line and there's no break but for
some reason now when I interspersed an
HTML straight HTML and then I had
another dated PHP statement so for
instance let me go back rather this was
a PHP statement
this was HTML and this is another PHP
statement and now we have a space some
white space showing whereas before we
didn't let me go back to the code here
our first PHP statement HTML our second
PHP statement and now we have that big
space and the actual source code oops
let's go back space in the source code
here right the reason for that was
compared to before word we had no space
is because because we're moving in and
out of the engine so when the pager gets
processed by the way the pages PHP pages
and all HTML pages get processed from
the top down so so when this page hits
the PHP engine it starts reading all
this stuff and then it hits some PHP and
hits a PHP block and goes Oh PHP code so
then the PHP code does it stuff makes a
changes then it then it says ox and a
PHP code then goes back into Shrey HTML
then it keeps processing up more eight
more PHP does it stuff spits out the
results and then continues downwards the
reason we saw some space between our PHP
code this time in the actual source code
is because we were moving in and out of
engine so it's like PHP engine no PHP
engine PHP engine
