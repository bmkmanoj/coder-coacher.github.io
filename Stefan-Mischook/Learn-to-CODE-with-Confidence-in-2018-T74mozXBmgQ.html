this email here well is actually was
sent to me on the YouTube comments so
I'm just gonna get into it I'm gonna try
to read it out and we'll just jump into
it I may skip some sentences all right I
see about the psychology background and
I have a question that maybe only you
can answer so I appreciate if you do
because I have wah I have no one else to
ask I know nothing about coding but I
want to a couple of months ago I started
teaching myself more like start
preparing for programming courses kind
of like university courses it seems so
hard to me that I quit after the first
month very common by the way I thought I
was stupid so I went to see a
psychologist to perform an IQ test it
turns out that I wasn't a moron
but I have a disc calcula hope you know
it I had dyscalculia its ability
difficulty with math if I recall I also
seem to have some kind of attention
deficit but that's my guess I also make
stupid mistakes at work I work at a
reception with invoices and bills and
stuff I read an article from a guy with
dyscalculia and ADHD who was a
programmer and after he got a DHD drug
prescription he started to learn faster
and made less mistakes sorry for the
long message question is do you think if
I take some ADHD pills I'd be able to
learn coding faster and be a good pro
learner because I have a feeling that
I'd suck at it
sorry for the question but I'm desperate
alright so I'm gonna answer these
questions let me just start off by
saying my opinion
Visa Visa psychology is really an
amateur opinion would it be clear I
studied psychology in university that
was my major but I never completed the
degree because I left early to pursue
and push my business so that said I do
have some background but I'm hardly a
trained psychologist so take
for what it is it's my opinion based on
life experiences with a bit of a psychic
background emphasize a bit so I continue
that said I would be very very reluctant
to take any drugs
my suggestion is as follows you'd only
take drugs unless you absolutely have to
and only for short-term pain because you
don't want to come dependent on any
substances whether it be drugs food
alcohol sex training you want to
remember the old Chinese principle of
the balance of yin and yang not too much
not too little not too much exercise not
too much not too little exercise not too
much food not too little don't take
drugs eat healthy much better than
taking drugs and that you know again I'm
not a medical doctor blah blah blah but
people jump too quick to take the pill
it could be a dangerous road that's why
we got all these people addicted to
prescription painkillers not a good
thing to be in alright so here are my
responses three bullet points remember
that we all make lots of mistakes when
learning to code learn them it is normal
but you will few hit roadblocks you will
feel frustration things will not sink in
right away you see when you're learning
to code I'll just read this here I
personally still mess up basically loops
from time to time it's just I have this
weird brain freeze that happens
brain freeze as in frozen that happens
but something as simple as that
so don't worry about it if you're
hitting these roadblocks that's normal
especially in the beginning because
you're you're doing something new you're
literally rewiring your brain to to work
in a different way when you're learning
how to code for the first time so point
number two try to relax as much as much
as possible and remember if you don't
get it today you don't get it tomorrow
or even a week from today eventually
you'll get it and guess why whether it
took you a week or months nobody's going
to care how long it took you to get
there see it's like think of it like
I don't know climbing a mountain you
know he did in 10 hours or 2 hours
whatever watch your very event that's
the great thing about learning how to
code learning programming once you've
learnt it once you understand it once
you've crossed that bridge what you've
you know broken through those barriers
pick any other cliche you want to pick
also it's it's your knowledge it's your
skills you can never go away yeah you
forget a little details here in there
but you can remember those very quickly
that's why God invented Google because
the details are irrelevant it's the core
foundation understanding and conceptual
understanding of it matter and if you
forget a particular syntax you forget
some particular method or how to do it
in Python or Java PHP or Java whatever
you just go to Google and you get the
answer like this no problem I have
written software in nine languages over
the years and I'll mix ups I'll say oh
yeah we do boo oh no that's Java it's
not Python right so but it doesn't
matter because I understand program may
understand Python and I'll forget it's a
little specifics here and there that's
not important
so let me continue so once you're buried
you are there so once you understand
what a function is you can't really
unlearn it right you know the function
is you understand a point of a function
when to use it why to use it this is
stuff that's not something you can
unlearn so it doesn't matter if it takes
you two weeks to learn it or a month
doesn't matter so just take your time do
a little every day you want to expose
your brain to this new knowledge that's
new way of thinking every day and you do
that you're gonna be training your brain
that it needs to adapt for this new type
of thinking and that comes from
frequency of exposure even if it's just
a little bit everyday even it's just ten
minutes a day or twenty minutes a day
it's gonna do wonders in terms of giving
the signals to your brain that it has to
adapt to this new type of knowledge oh
that makes sense
because when you are learning something
new especially something like
programming you're literally creating
new neural connections and
you're literally restructuring your
brain slowly so as you learn drink lots
of water get lots of rest if you're
feeling tired along the way if you're
Restless or you're getting a headache
oof that's your brain saying I've had
enough for today and don't think about
coding take a break take a day off two
days off whatever until you're relaxed
again and do some exercise I'm telling
you healthy body makes for healthy mind
and vice versa
so again it's about consistent exposure
to coding so that your brain adapts and
learns and you're gonna see it's going
to start off slow it's gonna start off
slow I'll sit you gonna start learning
very quickly you'd be surprised at how
it begins to wrap may take you month may
take you three months may take you three
weeks depends on you but it will come so
one of the reasons why this guy's
obsessed with having trouble coke or
tsa's I'm gonna say it many cold courses
suck and why do they suck because most
of the Nerds teaching a code they have
no teaching skills learning to code from
a nerd who's never taught it's like
learning is like trying to listen to
somebody playing a song on a guitar who
doesn't know how to play it's gonna be a
mess right so I can't tell you how many
times are heard from students who face
the same problems as this guy they try
to Cole courses they don't understand it
didn't make any sense it was a headache
then he do of course taught by somebody
who actually knows how to teach and I'll
said it all makes sense it all makes
sense that's pretty much it to
summarized I wouldn't take the drugs I
think you're just dealing with the same
anxieties the same initial barriers that
most people deal with when they're first
learning how to code and you just got to
be patient with yourself expose your
brain every day expose your mind every
day to a little bit more a little bit
more a little bit more right Cody got a
read Cody I read code that's why in the
studio web my app we got a 300 video
lessons we got over a thousand code
challenges and quiz questions nobody
else does that and this is done this way
because I want you to continuously be
interacting with the content whether
you're answering questions in terms of
concepts or writing code and this
constant external thousand times it's
going to help you absorb this
information so much more quickly why
don't other people do it because most of
the co course is out there designed by
people who never taught before they
don't understand teaching they don't
have a background teaching and because
it's hard my co challenges have about
twenty five thousand words to put in
perspective my book on web design I
wrote this 224 page book there we go
this has about 30,000 words the quizzing
component to studio web for the
foundation courses has about 25,000
words something like that
I forget the last count because I made
adjustments over time so you got a book
of quizzing along with the 300 video
lessons which takes advantage of my
knowledge of how the brain works the
psychology background the teaching
cetera so you're slowly every day
exposing your brain to this stuff
writing code doing a video right and
cold answering some quiz questions
related to content that's how you're
going to learn very quickly so give
yourself time daily exposure take breaks
drink water don't take drugs and you'll
get there
and doesn't matter if it takes you an
extra month to learn two months to learn
it doesn't matter because once you're
very very and nobody's gonna care if it
took you one month or six months to
learn the stuff I hope that helps bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
