today in that the youtube channel hit
20,000 subscribers in the grand scheme
of thing it isn't much but when I revive
this old channel of mine about six
months ago I had 10,000 subscribers so I
doubled it up in about six months not
bad so this is just leave log a
discussion about a few random topics or
may or may not interest you first of all
I want to point out the consistency
amongst news in this world when I am
teaching a particular subject the job of
the teacher is to leave out what's not
necessary and to simplify things that
seem complex so in the process of
leaving out things that are not
necessarily necessary at this moment for
the student to understand you will be in
precise sometimes and of course nerds
are quick to point out when you're not
exactly precise so case in point in one
of my recent Python videos I gave an
overview about what happens behind the
scenes when you actually declare
variable how the Python engine does all
kinds of work by the scenes to
essentially place your information that
you're putting in two variables into
memory on your computer's Ram and I'll
stop there we don't need to go into more
details but of course in the YouTube
comments some nerd was a diligent enough
to want to point out some minor elements
or some elements very left out in that
discussion again when you are teaching
the subject a big part of the job of the
teacher is the filter out the
unnecessary parts of the discussion the
unnecessary elements or particularity is
about a programming language
about something within a programming
language or any subject really I left
this actually from martial arts and a
teaching when you're teaching a student
for instance had a box you don't try to
teach of every single little thing about
the body mechanic behind throwing
punches and so forth because it's just
too much information to take in at one
time the good coach introduces the key
elements to the student and as the
student masters those elements in let's
say so I go punch or something then the
teacher will slowly slowly introduce
more details more in different aspects
about how to properly chilled punches
how to properly moved and so forth if
you try to throw it all in at the same
time you're just going to help us
hopelessly confuse students so far
record nerds when I leave out elements
in a course or in a particular
discussion about programming or anything
you can embed most of the time that I
did it on purpose because I decided that
certain elements were not required in
that particular lesson try to keep that
in mind I got a comment from this guy
named Kevin where can I find your course
and is very interested sick of all those
online courses because most of the
teachers don't bring the break down the
material in enough depth well that's one
of my major criticisms of the online
educational money grab that we see in
the last seven or eight years I've been
teaching code and development since 2003
even quarters a bit of quarter since
1994 now what I think is even more
important is that I come from a family
of teachers my father's a teacher and
uncles cousins lots of teachers of my
family I've been surrounded by it my
entire life in addition to that i have
taken martial arts for nearly 30 years
different styles and as you learn from
one systems martial arts to the next
would be japanese style
korean style chinese etc etc you find
that each culture each system each
school has its own way of doing things
and that's a very important lesson in
teaching because what you'll find as a
teacher is that different students will
absorb information in different ways
some need to hear it and people need to
see it so people need to feel it now
this is all of course dependent on what
you are teaching like you're not going
to feel cold but you're going to feel a
punch so that's my major criticism is
that most of these people put out code
training courses they're not actually
teaching they're just going over the
specification and that's that's not
teaching that's just going over
specification now you can get away with
that to certain extent with adult
learners because a big part of learning
how to do anything is just doing it so
that's why I emphasize it on the courses
write code if you want to learn how to
write code you write code and what you
find is that the act of actually typing
out the code making the mistakes
watching the interpreters give you error
message and so forth that will help your
brain more quickly understand the
fundamental concepts of software
development the same thing goes for
fighting by the way martial arts when
you want to learn how to fight if you
wanted to build more shorts you have to
go out there and do it so that's why you
see a lot of the sporting martial arts
whether it be the jujitsu is the judo
the wrestling in the boxing the Thai
boxing the kickboxing these guys
typically are much better fighters than
the so-called traditional martial art so
it does both and the reason being
primarily is because the sport fighters
because it just mentioned the boxing
wrestling jujitsu they're always
sparring they're actually fighting go
figure they develop the skills they
develop an awareness they developed the
abilities that differentiate between
people can't fight people can
fight and that's why you saw when the
rise of the u.s. the USC came about in
the early 90s a lot of these traditional
martial artist these academic commercial
artists and never fought in a real
situation and then when they finally get
out there and they fought in the acidic
they were they were flabbergasted they
couldn't believe that their techniques
and theories didn't really work in the
real world and so I've always always
been a big believer of getting your
hands dirty into anything that you want
to do you want to start a business start
a business start something small if you
want to learn how to code start writing
code that's why with the student web app
i integrate that concept core into the
structure of the curriculum so what does
that mean that means that as you're
watching videos you're immediately
writing code as you go along with it the
system is checking your code out and
that's just one or two code snippets
here and there we're talking tons for
instance just with these the HTML CSS
and JavaScript course ins to your web
there are 300 odd video lessons and over
a thousand quiz questions and this is
all structured in a very particular way
to maximize learning that's why you'll
see on the YouTube channel you see in
comments how people are pretty pretty
impressed about how quickly they learn
there's a lot more to teaching than just
going over specification and by the way
if there's a course where they're just
really over respect you don't need that
course you're not teaching they're just
going with respect you'll also just do
it yourself you wouldn't
expect this type of weather in February
in Montreal Canada this is very very
unusual very long and a nice relief from
the freezing cold you should get this
time of year that is pushing full
I'll give you a quick view of the city
