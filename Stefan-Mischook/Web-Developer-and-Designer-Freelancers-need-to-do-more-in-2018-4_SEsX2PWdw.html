the freelance developers set of tasks
that they have to perform that they have
to bring to the client it's continuously
evolving it's continuously evolving so
for example back in the early 90s or mid
90s and so forth the skill sets that a
web designer developer had extremely
different than today
so back then Judas knew basic HTML the
CSS didn't really work so you hacked out
things with tables and transparent gifts
and that's by the way killer sites calm
the site that I own and manage now it
was first made famous for his book
creating killer websites like probably
the seminal book or one of the most
popular books in Web Design in the 90s
that's reserved translated my Twitter of
20 languages and you get the idea
yeah so the way we used to design design
site so in that book by the way he the
author he was actually one of the first
to put out this whole notion that we
should use design characteristic design
or the located visual aspect of the site
was extremely important because back
then sites were designed to look very
pretty and but to do that because of the
technology limitations you had to hack
the hell out of things and so they use
tables to create grid structures on the
page and any of yous try all these
tricks like transparent gifts and stuff
together position things and it was just
a bloody mess but at least the websites
were starting to look somewhat this
aesthetically pleasing relative to what
they were before so a whole new set of
skills or whole set of skills were
developed and practices and workflows
that were developed for that time
because the web browsers were so limited
I need you know to the credit of the
author of the book this certificate is
first name of sacred seagull seagull and
he was saying in to his credit but you
know we have to do these hacks until we
can figure out until the browser makers
actually implement CSS properly and
proper HTML and make it consistent it
was just a total mess back then you have
to worry about
ancient history point is is that how web
designers and developers operated back
then it was very different than just
five six years later and then another
five six later five six years later the
skill sets changed quite a bit again and
I've spoken about this how friend of
mine who in the 90s was a top top guy
for a pretty big content site and he got
out of the game for like three four
years he came back and he was he was
freaked out at how much how different
was and how he basically had to learn
everything from scratch it's pretty
depressing for him but fortunately for
you guys those radical changes in terms
of the actual code and how you structure
things have stabilized quite a bit as I
said that the rate of change is the
slope s flattened out which means it's
pretty consistent which is fantastic so
it pretty much stabilized I'd say maybe
212 213 214 something like that it's
very stable we should be good now what
is changing though in terms of
freelancers is what you need to bring to
the table in terms of a range of skills
and services it's not enough to be able
to just build a good-looking website or
web app these days you have to bring in
some credible knowledge in terms of the
lifespan of the project and in terms of
getting the word out so you should learn
a little bit about social media
marketing a bit about of course you got
to have SEO from excited to understand
traditional content marketing and how
that fits together you know in a
coherent package and it should be built
into some of the systems in terms of
your app that you build your web app I'm
thinking more or less web generally
speaking but it applies to mobile to a
certain extent the point is that if you
want to be more competitive as a
developer you have to bring a little bit
more to the table than just the
technical or the coding skills or the
app building skills or the websites
because you have to bring in the whole
promotional and marketing anything not
not not to say you have to become a
social media marketer you have to be a
content marketer but at least you should
know the basics of this kind of stuff so
you can bring this to the fore with your
clients help them to understand what
they have to do after you build their
website actually build a web app how do
they have to position it in terms of the
broader web in terms of social media
sites in terms of content marketing and
so forth and there's stuff to do that
because some of the things or tools that
you build into the site or web app will
will impact their marketing reach or
social media reach or their content
marketing reach it's it's all tied in a
little bit now I'm not saying again
you're going to come a full blown social
media marketing but marketer but you
should position yourself and to be able
to provide a proper structure in the
deliverable in the product that you
deliver to them so that it kind of works
with these type of strategies going
forward because at at the end of the day
if you're building an app building a
site ultimately people are building
these sites because they want people to
come to the site right so this is where
this whole thing comes in so there's a
bit of a shift a bit of an evolution
although it's been there for a while but
it's I wanted to make this more obvious
to guys to you guys again this applies
to people are going to get into the
freelance game at the end of the day
adding this feature adding this feature
but adding this service there we go
adding this element to what you deliver
to a prospective client will give you
much better chance of actually landing
of a job right because you exam also the
person you know Pervis for structure
after missile sort of get you get your
position for you know the social media
and content marketing and help you a
little bit there but you know you're not
providing those services although you
could but by being able to bring that
turnkey package because a lot of times
we'll say okay you're building my site
go to my web app how do I get people to
it you don't get that question what do I
do and that's where that comes in and
that's pretty much it all right I'm off
I want to go get my coffee and my bed
go and do my little morning drive over
the mountain
