so decided to grow this hipster beard
because I'm a hipster coder and we'll
see how it goes a little bit itchy so it
bothers me a little bit all right I
don't even know if I cover this
particular subject so let's just get
into choosing a programming language for
a startup I've got this question a few
times so let me answer so when you're
choosing a language for your startup you
have to consider the same things that
anybody else is going to consider when
you're choosing a programming language
for a particular project number one
there's a language there's a language
lend itself well to the particular
project you're not going to be writing
iOS apps with PHP since nobody writes my
I can't write our iOS apps with PHP you
gotta use Swift or objective-c now these
days if you're writing an iOS app you're
gonna use Swift because it's the newest
language and Apple is basically pushing
Swift and there's good reason for it's
more productive anyway off on a tangent
there so first thing you have to do is
you have to choose the language that
best matches the job at hand no more
than number two you have to look at the
local talent you're sitting up a startup
you don't want to choose some language
that could be perfect for a particular
type of app that you're going to build a
website or whatnot but you can't find
anybody to actually write the code so
you have to look at the local talent
next thing you should consider is the
cost of a particular language in terms
of developer time if you find yourself
in a niche language or using a niche
framework where your developers are
going to become more and more rare the
costs and the difficulty of hiring these
developers is just going to increase
quite a bit so for me as a start-up
founder I would find a language that
meets those three criteria number one
has to be suited and suitable for the
project at hand
number two you have to make sure that
the availability of developers in your
area is there if that matters because
you may be looking to hire people
overseas although there's some issues
with that when you're hiring people
overseas you're gonna have
communications issues possibly that's
one of the major things that you'll see
when you're developing apps especially
long-term communication is huge that's
why I always tell people first skill in
becoming a great developer is
understanding your core and your
foundation second most important skill
is great communication skills spoken and
written because that really makes a huge
difference in terms of the speed and
consistency of the development of any
app the ability to communicate the ideas
amongst the developer as to the
developers with the decision-makers
communication is huge so distance or
offshoring can be problematic unless you
can find people who can really
communicate well with you so
communication is very important to keep
that in mind so to conclude this short
Florida after Florida vlog there we go
it's very important that you consider
both the technical requirements of a job
and the practical implications in terms
of hiring talent and cost and so on and
so forth keep that in mind when you're
writing your own apps or your own
business you have to give the business
considerations equal weight to the
technical considerations a lot of
developers especially young developers
don't recognize that they they're too
concerned about the bells and whistles
of a particular language or a particular
technology they don't weigh that against
the the availability of programmers and
the cost etc etc etc etc I hope this
vlog is useful bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
