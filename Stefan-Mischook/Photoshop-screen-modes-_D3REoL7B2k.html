very beginning of our introduction of
Photoshop is something that's called
screen modes and screen modes as you can
see are directly related to these three
icons that you'll find at the bottom of
your toolbar and as you can see here if
you just mouse over this one it gives
you the very standardized view which is
what we see here these screen modes are
a lap are what we can use to effectively
work within our space and have them show
us the modes that we want here we see
the standard screen mode and notice that
there's a little a little letter next to
it in this case it's the letter F in all
of your toolbars you'll notice that it
give you the name and it'll also give
you a little shortcut that's associated
with that particular tool so if we want
to scroll through our screen modes will
be using the shortcut f nevertheless we
can click on these and notice here
screen mode with menu bar and as you can
see it might be a little bit shy on this
screen but what it does is it'll go full
screen on your computer and it allows
you to work without the menu mode then
as you can see here it's exactly the
same except the only difference is we
have a black background at this point
you still have your toolbar as you can
see here and you still have your other
palettes there while we're talking about
this I'll also show you a quick shortcut
if you press tab tab will eliminate all
your toolbars and everything else there
in a full screen mode like this this
makes it great for presentations and
when you're showing things to your
clients or otherwise this is a wonderful
way for you to work so just by pressing
tab allows you to do that you'll notice
I'll press F again and go back to our
regular screen mode there are going to
be times when you're going to find the
toolbars and everything else that's
located in here a little bit and they
seem to take up too much real estate on
your particular page so if you're
worried about that you can always press
tab and get rid of them and have much
more room to work with or you can press
shift
and shift tab will only get rid of the
pallets that you'll find on this side of
your screen as opposed to your toolbar
so if you're still new to things and
you're getting used to working with that
toolbar and you still need to go over
and choose your icons visually then just
pressing shift tab will allow you to do
that tab gets rid of everything else so
that's a little bit about screen modes
and the tab or shift tab shortcuts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
