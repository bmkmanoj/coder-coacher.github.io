talk about why for the first time I'm
buying iphone I'm recording this in
mid-september 2016 and I've decided I
made the decision in the books I'm
buying an iphone 7 plus so why why would
an android guy buy an iphone 7 a couple
reasons number one it has to do with
apps that i am working on now well we're
going to be working on or extending so
we're about to start working on
extending studio web with iOS 7 excuse
me excuse me with iOS 10 so I figured it
kind of made sense to become familiar
with the iOS platform even though I'm an
Android guy and generally speaking as a
developer you want to be familiar with
the major platforms so I have a Windows
10 machine I had a windows seven but
figures you know now it's time to move
on to 10 I have mac OS i have android I
do have an old ipad 2 but really I want
to it's unusable stew slow now so I
figure I might also get an iOS foam
basically an iphone so i can become
familiar with the platform also as a
developer is good for you to understand
trends that you see developing an apple
like them or hate them they do have a
huge influence on the trends in terms of
you I and turns the app development and
yes Apple borrow from Android in a big
way and vice versa but nonetheless it's
just good to have your hands in that in
that arena you have to be aware you have
to be aware of the possibilities and
what's going on out there and it's not
just what hardware by the way it's also
with software I try to keep my eye on
certain things like for instance with
java script on the server no expressed
accelerator I haven't written anything I
just you know I did the equivalent of
the hello world with node and that's
about it I just want to peek around talk
to some people who wrote some
ode just so I'm aware of that as a
possibility because of my background as
a developer I don't need to go in there
and become an old guy because I have no
intentions of using node but now I know
that it's there I know what node can do
and so a project may come up where node
might fit in perfectly and if that's the
situation then it would go to node so
it's good to be just informed about the
options of course you've got to have
your core skill that you use so if
you're a to say PHP guy for now if your
PHP guide then you know stick to your
PHP lera valley or PHP symphony or your
PHP whatever but you should always keep
an eye on what's going on on the other
side of the tracks so you you're just in
touch with everything you never know
when it will come in handy and it might
give you a good idea for your own
development in PHP if your PHP guy or if
your Java guy you may want to check out
what the Java but the C sharp guys are
doing eccentric cetera I hope this is
useful ciao guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
