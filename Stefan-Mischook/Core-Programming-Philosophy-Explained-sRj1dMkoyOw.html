I try to limit my coffee intake to twice
a day so I already had one so I'm saving
it for this afternoon it's a nice
October late October at my shell and
yeah okay one of the things like talked
about in my vlogs and my courses is how
it's so important but you learn the core
of the technology the core of the
languages that's the key to launching
your career quickly not learning this
framework not learning that framework
not learning distrib work now I
originally got that principle from
drumroll guess martial arts but I also
reload it in coating as well programming
as well so let me give you a quick
little story and then we'll get into it
what I was 18 or 19 years old
this is my eighth or ninth year as
training in martial arts
judo Japanese karate Kiku shin the
Japanese karate Taekwondo catch Campbell
Wing Chun Akito freestyle wrestling see
lat
I'm sure some forgetting something as
well but anyway you get the idea so I
had it done a bunch of different styles
so one day one of my teachers is one of
the style said to me Steph pulls me
aside he says Stephanie listen here's
the thing you've been doing martial arts
for a while now and you know this you
know but now you know but it is the
thing is he says your intermediate level
martial artist oh yes you know all kinds
of techniques with judo you know
techniques from from this style cry from
pitch Campbell from Wing Chun but you're
still just you execute at an
intermediate level if you want to become
an advanced martial artist you have to
pick something and you have to work on
that core you're gonna work on those
fundamentals and then what's gonna
happen he said once you you do that
you're going to quickly advance from
intermediate level to advanced level and
it's going to reflect in all the styles
that you do you're going to become
advanced in rest of it
in Wing Chun advanced in catch camo
invents in Taekwondo excetera excited
chatter Sarah
so I didn't quite understand it at the
time what he was saying but I decided
that since this guy was far more
experienced with me and martial arts I
should maybe take his advice so I took
his advice and sure enough within a
reasonably reasonably short period of
time but in a year or so my skill level
my cost rated one style and that my
skill level shot up but what happened as
he said I just became an advanced
martial artist seemingly overnight
relative to you know the fact I had been
doing for nine years and that goes to
the core by consciously not one style I
concentrated on the core getting caught
up in all kinds of little techniques and
stuff it's kind of like getting caught
up in the latest framework or the latest
library you know in software development
whether it be web stack or otherwise so
let's talk about core in programming so
the first thing you need when you're
gonna discuss you need multi colored
markers this is gonna be for JavaScript
orange this is gonna be for Python it's
green and it's gonna be for PHP blue and
I use black for other stuff all right so
let me just draw something on paper so
in my development courses my programming
courses my code of cultures however you
want to describe it I teach not only
core languages foundation languages but
I teach core principles and techniques
so I have html5 css3 javascript PHP
Python and SQL databases in these core
courses you aren't supposed to just
about everything that you need to know
about software development and then with
this base you'll be able to explore
whatever path you want to get into so
let me explain a few things so this is
the worst diagram ever I couldn't think
of any
better on the fly this is a vlog so
whatever here it is so you see I know if
you can see that so you see I got Jay s
an orange Python and PHP foundations of
pro developer why is that the case at
least in the context of my courses when
you're looking at writing code there's a
few things you have to learn so for
instance JavaScript es that teaches you
something called client-side programming
client-side development in computers
you've got clients and you got server
servers like web servers like database
servers and clients are like web
browsers right or apps in your iPhone
apps in your Android device but talk to
servers server software sits on a server
so when you're learning JavaScript what
I teach you my JavaScript course is much
more than just JavaScript I'm teaching
you client-side programming and a little
bit of web well no more a little bit and
web GUI interface creation GUI graphical
user interface JavaScript allows you to
manipulate things in your page it's
built with HTML and CSS and allows you
to turn him into responsive apps perhaps
a bit move around I'm not talking about
responsive design if you understand that
but it just teaches you client-side
programming so when I'm teaching you
JavaScript I'm teaching you much more
than just JavaScript I'm teaching you
client-side programming let me hop over
to PHP now PHP is a server-side
programming language the most popular
for small business sites by far I'm not
saying it's the best language out there
I'm just saying it's the most popular
it's very powerful when you want to
develop web apps my first choice is
always PHP for a bunch of reasons which
I will not get into here in my PHP
course I don't just teach you PHP I
teach you the server-side programming
again I show you client side versus
server side PHP code runs on the server
and I show you how B's how client-side
code and server-side code
interact I teach you to client the
request response model I teach you
session in server-side all these sorts
of things that are universal across the
language language is and cross the
framework so if you learn this in my PHP
course all the server technology to
server concepts you feel right at home
if you jump into server-side programming
with Java server-side program of Ruby
server-side programming with Python you
get the idea right these are universal
session tracking stateless nature of the
web etc etc etc so my PHP course I teach
much more than just PHP I teach these
concepts they're universal they
applicable to all those languages so I
got Python next I also have a Python
course so why don't we teach Python
because Python is a general-purpose
programming language so it can be used
to create server side apps like PHP web
apps it can be used for machine learning
ai which is server-side programming as
well but it's general-purpose PHP
JavaScript generally speaking a more
specialized Python can be used in
different areas there's advantage
advantages and disadvantage to each of
these languages again in my Python
course I explore different things that I
don't necessarily cover in the
JavaScript PHP courses now don't get me
wrong each of these courses are
standalone meaning if you do my Jas
course you'd be comfortable JavaScript
would be ready to launch into just about
anything JavaScript do my PHP course the
same thing do my Python course the same
thing but because of the nature certain
languages I cost ran certain things in
each of them so for instance javascript
is traditionally a client-side language
runs in the web browser but now because
of node you can do on the server but I
don't teach node in my JavaScript course
because I teach the same concepts but
you see a node in my PHP course so if
you do my my full stack development
course the JavaScript HTML CSS and the
PHP SQL you'll be able to jump into node
like this you don't need a know of
course you'll be able to go to the node
docks and pick it up within a few hours
I'm pretty sure at least get something
going right it takes me maybe a couple
days before you start being able to
build it happens will be that difficult
for you because the principles
underlying node RS are the same as the
principles underlying PHP underlying
server-side job service like Python
server side JavaScript
I hope you get the idea I have taken my
martial arts experience and training
that understanding but the core is key
to advancing and have a click apply
those to my courses that's why I decided
to not produce a node course because if
you do my way my web stack course my
full stack course my iwd web development
course and my Python you'll be able to
tackle anything easily you won't really
need other courses you can do stuff on
the but you find on YouTube the lousy us
of courses which you don't understand
now because most these people were
teaching normally we know how to teach
also them to be very easy for you you'll
be able to go ok boom boom this is RK
this what you're doing a node that's how
we do in PHP ok dudududududu it'll be
simple for you so that's why I'm not
coming out these new themes of talking
more higher-level broader subjects
because I want to take you guys from
being just cold
junkies people were sort of concerned
you know with libraries I want to take
you to a higher level than that and
that's why I say do my web stack you do
my foundation my core training
everything else will come easy so that's
why I'm getting into the career in the
mindset of an advanced developer and I'm
getting into the entrepreneurial aspects
of all this stuff of me a modern day
entrepreneur even if you have no
interest in being a developer if you
understand a little bit about code and
how things are structured will make you
a much more effective entrepreneur
because the reason so many young people
now can become entrepreneurs is because
the technology makes it possible
