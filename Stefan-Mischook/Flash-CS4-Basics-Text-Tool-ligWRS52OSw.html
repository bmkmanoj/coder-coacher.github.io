tools inside of it and we've already
seen some of the rectangle drawing tools
and line tools and even the pen tool but
here now we're going to be talking about
the text tool so you'll notice if you
select the text tool what you can do
with that text tool is to just click and
drag to create an area of text now
there's very different there is a
difference between clicking and dragging
to add some text so you'll notice if i
was to type something out like hello
world as i just did you'll notice that
as the text fills in the area that i've
just defined because that area was
constrained because i clicked and
dragged it caused the text to wrap
around this text box if I in on the
other hand just clicked on the stage and
just started typing out a bunch of words
you'll notice that it doesn't wrap and
that is something that you'll find with
all adobe products is that there's area
text where you click and drag to create
an area of texts that you wish to define
or you can just click once and just
start typing out text so area text is
probably the one that you're going to be
using a whole lot more as well so we can
switch around I'm just going to ctrl Z
to undo some of those and as you can see
in our area of text that we have here
you'll notice also that there is a
little square so that square can help us
to define exactly how big this area of
text is going to be and what we want it
to look like now in terms of getting
your text to look the way you want it to
what I'm going to do is open up the
properties window as I've just done
right here and in doing so you can see
that we've got the text area now this
text is defined as static text you'll
notice that there are two other types of
texts dynamic text and input text
however you're only going to use dynamic
text and input text if you are using a
script and since this first flash video
is dealing primarily with the use of
text with regards to animation I would
definitely recommend that you keep your
text as static text so when we're
working in this fashion you can see that
you can choose any kind of character
that you wish from your list whatever
your list happens to be and for example
you know I could change this to any
other kind of text just as I've done
here you can change the size of the text
you can scroll it anytime you see little
dots underneath something that allows
you to just scroll back and forth or you
can click on it and you can enter in any
kind of text value you want letter
spacing on the other hand here let me
just get this back to normal letter
spacing on the other hand determines as
you might imagine the space between your
letters just like that so you can create
what's referred to in the design
industry and you know anytime you're
using typography letter spacing is often
referred to as tracking and as we can
see here the letter spacing set to a
negative tracking and that squeezes in
your text a little bit closer together
or you can you know spread your text out
a little bit more depending on what you
need and of course you can choose color
now as far as some of the other effects
you can see here that you can make your
text field be selectable we don't really
have any other options at the moment and
that's simply because well certainly you
could try to show one of these things
but they don't work well right now
that's because we can render Texas HTML
but only if it's dynamic text and we can
put a border around text if it's dynamic
or if its input text input text is kind
of like you know a text field that you
would allow users to enter in
information so sometimes you need a
border around that so they can actually
see where to do just that so this text
can also be set to superscript as you
can see here or perhaps it's more
appropriate if I did it to just you know
a selection there you go so just a
portion of it becomes superscripted
or subscripted you know if you had
quotations or something like that so for
example if I were to put the number one
here I could subscript the number one so
that it looks something like that more
like a quotation of sorts and yeah so
there's also the possibility of
formatting this through the use of
paragraphs so you can Center your text
you can align it to the right you could
even create justified text if you wish
you can create spacing at the beginning
of your text so that your text is always
indented here I'm just going to set it
to the left again and I'll put that back
to zero you can also see that there are
some other options that are available to
you line spacing determines how much
space between each of those lines so for
example I could come in here and
continue writing something like spacing
lines in flash and you'll notice that if
I were to select all of this we can
increase the line spacing so that
there's more space between those lines
or less space if you want things sort of
overlapping each other closer together
all of these things really useful when
you're dealing with design issues and
stuff like that so margins on either
side left or right all of these things
can help in terms of what you want to be
doing and there's also orientation you
can change the orientation from
horizontal to vertical left and right
and as you can see not really much going
on here when we do something like that
although I'm just going to move this out
of the way so we can see that a little
bit better so as you can see the hello
world text is really not responding all
that well to this but nevertheless as
you can see we could change the
orientation of that text so that it was
not in set in that regard if I wanted to
rotate it check it out as you can see
here I can just move that text and you
know put it on to its side however you
want that to look I'm going to change
the letter spacing back to 0 so
hopefully we can read that a little bit
better
and as you can see flash is written
everything in that direction and again
of course you could arrange and align
those things a little bit differently if
it's vertical right to left you can see
that's more appropriate to what we
generally would want to be working for
and as you can see here hello world is
right at the top and also the let's set
this back to its original of two and you
can see a little bit better as to what
that would look like so it's a little
easier to read in that regard but
nevertheless as you can see here we're
probably just going to be working with
horizontal text as we would normally be
doing and once you choose a selection
tool you can take that text and you can
move it around anywhere you want and
work with it another thing you can
select just a portion of text and you
can you know change the color just as
I've done fairly easy to do and really
not that tricky to work with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
