cryptocurrency job market and give you
my two cents from the perspective of
somebody who hires programmers all the
time and I'll take it from there
all right so I've jumped over to this
website called glass door and glass door
is a job site this is glass doors dot CA
so it's in Canada but it applies to
anywhere in the world I would imagine
especially North America Europe alright
so let's look at blockchain full-stack
developer who are sky guys and defiant
labs sky guys is a fast-growing provider
of industrial and governmental unmanned
aerial vehicles really services and
technologies since founding in 215 old
company the sky guys have logged more
than 14,000 flights and served more than
600 client ci something new I would
never expect it here blockchain and UAVs
in a job description but you know
description of role and worth watching
full stack developer is responsible for
developing the first prototype of a
drone based crypto currency based on
unused storage among drone service
providers across North America they must
have a solid foundation core blockchain
programming eg C++ Java as well as
related languages such as Python node
Python Perl nodejs skills in data
encryption and front-end programming
will be an asset there must also be
comfortable working in a fast-paced team
with minimal Direction exercising
initiative adaptability and
communication skills with specific
engineering stuff creativity hard work
and perseverance will be necessary on a
daily basis I'll translate that into a
visual I'll translate that visually no
I'm just kidding comment quick comment
any type of startup business and I guess
a 2 year old business was qualify as a
startup business they don't work yet
they got to work you're pretty hard so
you have to understand that so typically
when you go work for a start-up there's
gonna be some option for equity meaning
you
catch some of the growth of some of the
games if the company should grow now the
situation in that regard with any
startup business most of them fail so
keep that in mind so typically when you
go will first startup you're gonna work
really hard you're gonna be paid a
little less than normal and there
typically won't be a payoff even for the
founders typically there isn't it's just
it's just a statistic I'm not saying
don't do it because it could be very
rewarding a lot of fun you can see from
the inside how sort of grows etc etc
competencies inexperience minimal formal
education bachelor's degree in computer
engineering computer science or related
subjects and are also welcome to apply
so here it's interesting here's a job in
cryptocurrency full-stack developer and
they basically say right away in terms
of competence and experience minimum
formal education meaning they don't
really care too much but they say if you
do have a degree in from energy
engineering ba ba ba ba you can also
apply you're welcome to apply so that's
something I've been telling you for a
long time in my vlogs for many many jobs
out there in the technology space they
don't care about degrees they just care
about skillsets so how do you illustrate
skillsets well you show them what
projects that you've built you're gonna
get interviewed you're gonna have to
discuss deep level aspects about a
programming language or about your
knowledge in terms of the environment in
which they're operating in that's a huge
part about this whole thing is being
able to demonstrate your skills now when
I say you should be able to show
projects that doesn't mean you should
take just project-based courses you know
my general opinion about that is what
project-based courses they should be the
last step in your education process
because the big problem with all these
project-based courses that you see out
there is they don't teach the core
programming and that's so important
that's more important than anything else
because once you have the core
programming it's easy for you to bang
out a project so what I suggest you take
a good core programming course and you
know in full disclosure that's what I
teach and that's what that's my unique
proposition out there if you will so
many courses out there well the vast
majority don't teach the core they don't
teach it properly and the project-based
course
kind of dance around these type of
things and I get so many students who
come to me having where they've tried to
do the free courses out there or the
paid pay project courses and they don't
have a full understanding of things and
not sure how to proceed but if you do my
core training then also in all these
project-based courses become super easy
in fact in my Python career paths
modules from two and three where I get
teach you two career paths and I teach
Python specializations I get into that
where I show you now that you have the
core training from the Python course you
can go to any of the free step-by-step
walkthroughs of you know like a lot of
these project-based courses they're not
really they're not teaching you're just
walking you through steps it's not
teaching but once you have the core been
the walkthroughs a lot of free ones on
the web out there on YouTube then all
sudden become really easy to go through
so instead spent 20 hours trying to go
through a walkthrough or a projects
based course you do it in like a couple
hours will be like this that's the whole
point of learning the core it's
something that I got in boxing when I
was doing boxing martial arts my boxing
teacher was an amazing coach and an
amateur record seventy seven and two and
if anybody's a fighter knows that's like
stellar it's world-class and before we
would get in the ring we spent a few
months just making sure we had a core
body mechanic in technique down with
boxing and then we would get in the ring
and only in controlled environments with
him and and this is me coming to boxing
with lots and lots of experience as a
fighter so even though I had tons of
experience I still had to really learn
my core of boxing before I jumped into
the ring seaming what program you should
learn your core first before you jump
into the ring but the irony is that if
you learn your core first it's this much
faster to get to where you want to get
anyway let's get back to this so ya
competencies minimum formal education
but if you have a degree you can also
apply key traits of the candidate your
high energy adaptable resourceful
reliable analytical t minor and
outstanding problem solver
I love these I love these job listings
the key trades do I have high energy I
have a lot of coffee have low high
energy so yeah am i adaptable sure pay
me enough I'll be adaptable resourceful
I guess reliable I do water my plants on
a regular basis analytical yeah team
minded sure an outstanding problem
solver you value collaboration and can
articulate the challenges benefits and
key skills needed for working with
others versus independently I want you
to pay attention to I'm gonna read off
several more of these requirements here
I want you to pay attention to it
underlying theme communication skills so
let's call this next one you have a
growth and continues development mindset
that applies to your personal
development your skills quality work and
the teams you work in teams you work in
to work with in teams you need
communication skills next point when
faced with a challenge you can a devise
follow a plan with minimal oversight
that's having confidence in your skills
again that comes down to understanding
the core of the languages that you study
regardless of a language whether it be
Python JavaScript C++ whatever it's
having that core deep understanding that
will give you the confidence to be able
to figure out how to solve the problems
you're not afraid of working hard for
the sake of something greater than
yourself that's something that I think a
lot of young entrepreneurs don't get
this line here exemplify this
exemplifies this you are not afraid of
working hard for the sake of something
greater than yourself so they figure
they're going to sell their project of
writing using crypto using blockchain in
UAVs as being a project like they liken
it to some sort of religious pilgrimage
or something or some sort of greater
calling note to young entrepreneurs
young startup owners if you want your
employees to have
the sense of working hard for the sake
of something greater than yourself you
have to give them a little skin you know
you have to give them a little little
taste of equity otherwise why would they
want to bust their butts to build your
business okay soft skills experience
excellent English oral and written
communication skills again communication
skills why do you have your core
programming you got to get into
communication skills that's so important
excellent organizational personal
management skills managing timelines
requirements planning out work ability
to work independently or in small teams
one to ten people there's one person in
a team qualify as a team ability to
embrace and contribute positively to
high-performance culture what does that
mean you're gonna work really really
hard the whipping again the ability to
learn apply new information sales
quickly and with jet little guidance to
advance project goals again comes down
to having confidence in your core
knowledge of programming in general
there's a matter of language once you
have the core for instance of Python you
understand the basic principles there
you understand the basic principles of
all of the modern programming languages
keep that in mind it says here ability
to learn to apply new informations and
skills quickly with little guidance to
advance the project goals that suggests
having a broader understanding of the
business model if you will it means
having more than just an understanding
of syntax and how to build a shopping
cart or how to write an AI module if you
understand I'm saying that's one of the
other points that I emphasized and that
so many courses are very syntax oriented
syntax is just covet you write they
don't get into the underlying concepts
and the underlying the infrastructure if
you will that the code is actually
manipulating the code is actually
working on that is so important that's
why even with my HTML course where you
know it's the simplest of the computer
languages out there really I get into
the
infrastructure behind HTML that's HTTP
that's the web as a response request
response cycle servers and clients just
knowing what an HTML tag is or jump into
program you just know what a function as
a variable is is not learning how to
code it's learning syntax as learning
snippets you have to understand the
underlying concepts behind all these
technologies so that then you can act
upon them I think that's a reference
their technical skills and experience
basic knowledge of steps design criteria
sources of risk and common approaches to
the end-to-end engineering design
process back and forth for back-end or
cloud software this goes back to having
understanding the big picture one to
three years including including courses
co-curricular and work experience in
back-end development tools again you can
demonstrate this out of a course by just
getting an entry-level job somewhere if
you want to go work for somebody
starting to do some freelance work here
and there do a couple stashes etc I
talked about this in my Python modules
two and three with the career choices
relevant design relevant design
experience includes design development
C++ or Java hands-on experience a
JavaScript no Perl Python implementing
UI UX for content management data
visualizations account management and
billing development of Bitcoin or cerium
based blockchain currencies development
of data compression encryption or other
big data related technology testing and
houses design recommendations related to
computational performance and user
experience the following types of design
experience will be held in high regard
startup university design team capstone
projects research these excuse me
research sees this industry industry
particular in aerospace robotics drones
automate of application processes again
into it so this is a typical listing for
a job you see the listing every possible
thing you could possibly want don't
worry it's not realistic that you know
everything here nobody does you just
need to come in with certain key
knowledge so for this job for instance
I would get in there and show that I
have a deep understanding of programming
programming whether it be with
JavaScript or Python or Java or C++
depending on how you want to work in
this particular space the C++ developers
in this company are doing different work
than the JavaScript guys and girls or
the Python people so you can walk in for
instance with just some Python skills
having that core knowledge demonstrate
one or two apps that you built in Python
then having an overall understanding
when you do a little research about
cryptocurrency blockchain and UAV and
just so you know what's going on in that
space look at look up some information
about this company see what they're
doing so when you walk in to talk to
them you will be informative in terms of
what they're doing which shows that
you're taking initiative also you have
you demonstrate you have deep skills and
programming you you just didn't do a
bunch of projects but you did the core
training and you know how to write code
you know what code is actually doing
then because they'll ask you about that
and you can ask them questions as well
so you know what are you implementing
what are you doing with C++ ask
ambassador what are you doing with
Python you're doing server automation
with Python what's the what's the role
Python in your organization and if they
said to you yeah we may have some people
want to do Java so that's fine I said
you know I don't know Java now but
because I have really good training and
Python I'll be able to do the Python
I'll be able to jump over to out pretty
quickly so yeah let's look at another
job listing here blockchain man Deloitte
Toronto let's see that Deloitte and
that's interesting all right service
consulting job type permanent Toronto
all right be part of cutting-edge
technology innovation Deloitte our
blockchain practice promises to
fundamentally alter the infrastructure
that powers the economic social and
political operating systems of the
planet we are hard at work shaping the
future of a dinner ok whatever ok let's
look at the ok let's look at the
qualification it's good to have six
teams experience driving revenue growth
for b2b startup sector experience in
Paulo in positive track records building
business ok this is more of a marketing
end of thing so this
for us let's go out of here ye wise
people in more than 150 countries are
committed to operating with integrity
quality and professionalism three five
years experience professional experience
and development of enterprise
applications or decentralized
peer-to-peer applications knowledge of
blockchain technologies and concepts
strong analytical and creative thinking
skills must be a team player comfortable
with scrum agile method okay so there's
a coding job experience in the fall it
must be strong an object-oriented
programming languages such as Java C
Ruby Python etc you see what I mean
doesn't matter what language these guys
know if you've got a good solid
understanding of the core regardless of
the language you will be able to jump
into the next one it doesn't matter
strong knowledge of node preferred along
with react BD or Python etc again it's
not expected you know all these things
if you know your core programming Python
you can go in there and learn node but
if you for instance if you did my PHP
course where I teach server-side
programming I teach request/response
stateless nature's at web and then you
do my JavaScript course we're gonna
learn node will be like easy because the
concepts are the same and it's easier
transfer to knowledge next point if
there is specific knowledge will be an
added advantage go solidity of theory of
experience with miss wallet mix ID open
source etherion clients again if you
wanted to get into the space you would
just go and learn these things and once
you know core programming these things
become easy to to get your head wrapped
around cryptographic techniques such as
hash symmetric key encryption public key
encryption etc our DBMS concepts SQL no
SQL databases github IDE vibrant Eclipse
IntelliJ IDE and others you know strong
knowledge strong knowledge of UNIX legs
cloud infrastructure management again as
your Amazon IBM bluemix etc general
system networking again a typical resume
where they list a whole bunch of skills
it's not expected that you know all
these things especially ever if ever
especially not in the beginning as I
advise you you come in with the core
programming skills that's the key to all
this and then you can do the research
necessary
to get into a specialized company like
this so you get into cryptographic
techniques such as hash etc and you
learn that it takes you a week or so and
then you can go in there
SQL you're gonna see that our DBMS
relational database management systems
it's like MySQL and a sequel server and
so on databases this is an old
technology of 3040 years old it's gonna
be around for a long time it's one of
those key skill sets you gotta learn of
course github ID environments that's our
look at cryptocurrency or blockchain
base rather I'm gonna say that
blockchain based jobs in Canada same
thing around the world I would imagine
if you're going to take anything away
from this video is that having a core
understanding of programming regardless
of the language is going to open up so
many job opportunities and it's gonna
make learning the new stuff super easy
that's it for today bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
