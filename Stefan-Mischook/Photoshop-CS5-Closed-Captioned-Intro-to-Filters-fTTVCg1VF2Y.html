discuss with you some basic filters that
you can work with inside of Photoshop
and by no means is this an exhaustive
look at the filters but I just want to
give you a brief rundown of some of the
ones that you may encounter and you'll
find that simple rule whenever you're
working with filters is generally
speaking filters in conjunction with
either blend modes or some other brush
work or something along those lines can
really enhance your photographic
wizardry and really make things come to
life inside of Photoshop but remember
you should really concentrate on the
fundamentals first and that's what this
particular video tutorial was all about
as opposed to jumping to the icing on
our cake before we actually have any
substantial you know foundation to go
with it so let's just briefly look at
what we're doing here I've got old man
jpg open and again it's pretty large
image right it says 16.7 percent for me
here and what I'm going to ask you to do
is and again this is more than likely
just because if you don't have a very
strong computer to begin with having a
really huge image that we're going to be
throwing filters on top of can take a
little longer so if we go to edit or
excuse me if we go to image rather and
we go to our image size i can click on
this and we can you know just make this
a smaller image right now the width is
two thousand pixels across right and the
resolution is set to 400 well i'm just
going to set this to 72 as if it was a
web-based document and you'll see right
now it'll figure out well if you want it
at 72 I'm going to give you a width of
360 and a height of 535 so if we click
OK that's rather small at seventeen
percent but if we press command one
there it is at one-hundred percent and
at one hundred percent it's pretty small
image but nevertheless it works for us
relatively in this manner so what I'm
going to do is to go to the filter menu
and we can see a bunch of elements
working with our filters here
and as you'll notice there are a lot of
artistic and blur filters and brush
strokes and all kinds of different
things that you can do well if you go to
the filter gallery it's one easy way
that you can take a look at a good deal
of these filters all at the same time
for example you'll notice here well I
don't really want that stylized one so
we'll get away from that one of the
first things you'll see here is the
artistics and if we come in here there's
a little preview there and if we click
on this that's what our colored pencil
might look like in this specific area
well notice it's got some options here
on the side for example is this a
colored pencil is this something using
chrome wow that's really weird is it
something using charcoal something using
chalk and charcoal right so there's very
many dry brush and you can play with you
know brush sizes as you can see brush
detail whether it's stroked or something
like that and again also with texture as
well so all kinds of crazy things if you
go to cut out you can see the number of
levels that you want for your cut out
the edge simplicity whether it's really
simple geometrics or whether it's going
for something a little more curved just
like that the edge fidelity so these are
really fun things dry brush the film
grain fresco neon light paint Dobbs and
again you can play with any of these
palette knife poster edges and poster
edges of fun one that you can use by
creating sort of illustration and
drawing and painting just by overlapping
this and working with different things
but in future exercises as I mentioned
and more importantly in future video
tutorials that will be offered of
photoshop by killer sites calm you'll be
able to explore some really interesting
types of special effects that we see
here and used in conjunction with other
effects inside a Photoshop to create
some really really interesting
and truly dynamic elements so as you can
see this is a great way to start just by
you know understanding and learning a
little bit about what's going on in here
crosshatch of fact is quite nice the
dark strokes you can see what's going on
there so a lot of these things can be a
lot of fun to work with and I encourage
you to work with them and experiment
with them at first but as I mentioned
some of these are not really going to
make a lot of sense until you actually
come in and apply some other elements to
them so we'll see exactly what I mean
for example there are a whole set that
are outside of this round I'm just going
to control that undo that for a second
and you'll notice here if you go to the
filter menu all of those filter
galleries a lot of these were in the air
artistics as we saw as well as the
sketch these are all in there as well
among other things textures that you can
apply but we didn't see anything about
blurs as you can see here there's a
whole set of blurs which are really
great and again that's something that we
can explore a lot more in a future
lesson more advanced Photoshop classes
but just to give you an idea of how
filters can be used in conjunction with
other elements let's take a look at this
there's a great way for example if we
select this command J to make a copy
here is the copied layer and if I were
to just give it a very generous amount
of say Gaussian blur you'll see that's
very generous you know do we need it
that much maybe we just need it about
like three and even this as you can see
that's generally something you want to
avoid something you want to ignore but
as soon as we turn this into an overlay
layer Wow look at the difference you can
really see how those colors just come to
life now obviously it's a little bit too
much so we'll bump that down and even if
we go to something like twenty eight
percent just look at those differences
really really nice and they really
enhance some of those colors so it's a
lot of great stuff that you can do like
I said normal
Lee this just looks very blurry as we
can see there but if we set that to an
overlay mode bang all of a sudden things
are looking much sharper and the colors
are looking much more vibrant so a lot
that we can do with filters and we'll
see more of those in future more
