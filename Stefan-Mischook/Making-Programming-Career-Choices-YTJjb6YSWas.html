sites calm and killer PHP calm in this
video blog I want to talk about choosing
the programming language given the type
of career you want to lead so this is
based on the conversation I had earlier
today actually I was in a bookstore and
one of the people working there
approached me he was acquaintances of
somebody I knew and my friend told him
that that was a major nerds who want to
ask questions you know he was thinking
he wants to get into web development he
wants to get into programming he wasn't
sure which way to go there's so many you
know so many languages C++ C sharp Java
Ruby Objective C etc so it goes on PHP
of course it goes on so and he also
wanted to know whether or not getting a
degree made sense or should he just you
know she did get a degree like a college
degree where it's like a one-year
program to have a deal where you get a
little certificate or should he go to
university for 3-4 years and get like
you know a computer science degree or
you know a software engineering degree
or whether you should just go at it
alone he's you know he wants the winner
two job prospects what are the options
what the situation is so I'm gonna
answer all those questions in this video
so if you're you know if you're looking
to learn web design or web programming
rather and you're trying to figure out
whether or not just you or school or not
and the type of schools here we go so
first major point number one the
language that you choose and I probably
talked about this in other videos at
least in some blog posts but the
language that you use will affect the
type of industry or the type of business
you get into so for instance if you're
doing Java or a dotnet type of work
donna's
it's typically c-sharp which is a very
similar language to Java then you're
gonna find yourself more likely than not
working even for large corporations or
for government and in that situation if
you want to get jobs there the having
the university degree the Comp Sci or
software engineering degree is very is
very helpful it's almost a requirement
unless you're highly experienced with
years of experience back in the late 90s
and the mid-90s when this whole
information revolution was really
getting going in those days they didn't
care whether or not you had a degree as
a software engineer or whatnot because
there's such a huge demand and it was
hard there were hardly any qualified
people but they would take anybody so
those days for large multinational
corporations or for a government type of
jobs are pretty much I would imagine
you're done unless again you're highly
experienced so yeah if that attracts you
want to go for large corporations
government you have to you probably
better off with a more not problem to me
you are better off with a technology
related University degree and so you're
looking at probably the java language
you're looking at c-sharp the.net
technologies those are that's where they
they really rule not I'm not to say that
you don't see PHP or Ruby or other
languages used in the enterprise and the
enterprise's there is another word for
big business or big government but
generally speaking they lean towards
those technologies for all kinds of
reasons I'm not gonna get into now it
has you know these reasons that have
that doesn't have much to do with the
technology itself as somebody who has
everything to do with the business
positioning of these technologies what I
mean is that you know the Microsoft
platform dotnet c-sharp etc and Java
platform have basically established
themselves as the go-to languages either
go one way or the other that java.net C
sharp or Java for large enterprise if on
the other hand you're more interested in
nimble programming PHP Ruby that sort of
thing then and you're not interested in
working for large corporations and
government then the need for a degree
diminishes tremendously because small
medium sized businesses typically don't
care so much for degree especially small
businesses they want they want is this
experience of skill you got you know you
got to give it you got to show them what
you can do and and to me that's more
honors that's real business you know for
me I'm a big believer in the concept of
the meritocracy I've spoken to to is
view I've spoken of this before where I
believe that people should be rewarded
based on their accomplishments on their
skills not on who they know or whether
they took this degree or that degree as
I can tell you from personal experience
just because you have a degree doesn't
mean you're a good programmer in fact
many people with degrees are not very
good programmers and the reason being I
think it has to deal with the fact that
a lot of people get into tech degrees
are doing it because they want to secure
good work not because necessarily are
passionate about programming or being a
software developer
whereas people are self-taught they're
always the best because they're really
into it they research it they're
passionate about it and they're very
good so when I hire people
I never even consider whether or not to
have a degree I couldn't care less
to the house of you for me it's all
about you know what they know and their
experience that I always do code reviews
and I check what they've done and I
talked to above them and I have some you
know questions and I I'm able to judge
fairly quickly how experienced and
capable somebody is just you know but
I'm fortunate enough to have been a
software developer for many years so I
have that ability you know I have that
knowledge what's the next thing okay in
terms of the types of schools again if
you're looking to work for large
corporations you're looking to get a job
in that respect instead of a one-year
certificate they will prefer somebody
with a university degree especially a
calm side degree or a computer
engineering degree or something so keep
that in mind so if you're deciding I'm
going to spend ten grand to go to a
Technical College and you look when you
want to get a government job unless you
you know you know depending on the
country depending on circumstances
you're better off to get the university
degree although the commitment for the
University of reuse for years and the
reason you're better off it's not
because you can become a better
programmer actually I think that the
guys coming out of Technical College is
going to be better because they focus on
programming know the reason that you
have a better chance is because in very
large corporations in big government
they have a lot of bureaucracy and red
tape mayhew minh resource departments
and they got a fall of a playbook and
the playbook is you hire a programmer
they have to have you know Bachelor of
Science or a column to computer science
science degree they prefer that to
people a technical college background
even though the Technical College people
from my experience are typically better
not always the case with you have
passionate people are going to computer
engineering or computer science for sure
but just keep that in mind finally if
you're looking to become a freelancer or
you're strictly want to work for small
startup small businesses you know I
forget about the you know the Gries are
almost there totally around not almost
totally irrelevant they are totally
irrelevant people don't care again it
really comes down to your chops how good
you are so I suggest that you just spend
your time developing applications
whether it be PHP sites based science or
Ruby or Objective C for iPad iOS
development or whatever what have you
that's my suggestion and just start
doing work you know take the language
well first thing you do is you you look
at the various languages that are out
there and you look at the different
various styles of programming because if
you're writing java code versus PHP it's
typically different types of software if
you're writing Objective C which is the
language for iPad and iPhone development
again it's a different beast it's a
different style of programming and it
comes down to taste one is not
necessarily better than the other it
really depends on what you want to do
what your preferences are for instance
in my career in the last special unit
officially as they got more experience I
would walk into a project as I was a
freelancer and I would look at the
project requirements that the client had
what they wanted to do and then from
there I would choose the language rather
than saying I'm a Java guy how can we
use Java to solve your problem I wasn't
like that I was the guy who said ok
what's your problem let's pick the good
language sometimes Java sometimes it's
PHP sometimes it was you know whatever
it illegal there's all kinds of
different things and I approached at the
time so you don't necessarily have to be
a jack-of-all-trades as I was becoming
in the end that comes with experience
but what I would suggest you're starting
off and you're not sure which language
to choose first consider where
ultimately you want to be big
corporations or you wanted to start up
more dynamic type of stuff you know
one's more stable secure ones more
I'm exciting that a stable secure you
know java.net big corporations
government more exciting PHP Ruby
Objective C perhaps and then you keep
that in mind then you might want to
start playing with the different
languages spend two weeks learning PHP
two weeks playing solid Java two weeks
Objective C etc now you're not going to
you know really you don't even know the
language is too well after two weeks
unless you're already experience the
programming programming knowledge
transfers right if you know Java
learning PHP is going to be trivial
you know C++ again jumping into jail
will be much easier than going at it
from scratch etc because there's a lot
of similarities between languages give
or take anyway so yeah that's what I
would do I would spend a little bit of
time with those languages that attract
you at least the principle so you really
get an understanding of what they're
about and then from there you can decide
which one you want to concentrate on
concentrate on that language start
learning it even if you go the route
where you're going to go big business
and government and so forth I would
still start writing the code on your own
just to get a head start because at the
end of the day you know academic
knowledge is just the beginning of
knowledge it's just the first 10% the
real knowledge comes from doing doing is
huge and I've used this analogy in
previous videos I used to box you the
martial artist and and I would tell
people you know one one three minutes
dream you know one three round sparring
heavy hardcore hell and a full contact
sport session is worth six months of
training one street fight is worth one
year training so I always advise people
go out spar spar spar spar if you get to
fight IP I was a bouncer so I learned a
lot being a bouncer
you know we're always doing stuff as a
bouncer Union you find yourself anyway
that's it so I hope this video was
useful this video blog for those who are
just starting out and oh yeah one last
point I would also look at what's hot
going forward the big mistake is to look
backwards you know meaning looking at
languages are popular have been popular
for a decade because they're probably
fading the way technology goes is that
languages come into favor to get hot and
then they slowly fade and some other
languages or some other language
replaces it so for instance back in the
90s when Java came out and Java came out
as a simplified language to simplify the
process of development over C++ and the
c plus plus people would would would poo
poo over java on a job I know it's blah
blah blah all these problems yeah Java's
you know was not you know there's
certain things that c+ did much better
of a job up at the end of the day java
was the hot language it grew and that's
where all the money was that's where all
the jobs were was in Java so you have to
look today what where's the popularity
where is it going
I'm telling you where it's going it's
PHP it's Ruby it's and the super hot
stuff is objective-c and iPad iPhone
development and Android development in
Android development I've never done it
but from what I understand it's subset
of Java so if you know a job I'm getting
to add Android you know smartphone
development and pad taking it pad
development you know make Motorola Xoom
that kind of thing and I think Android
is now the most popular operating system
for smartphones but apples huge so you
know an app to Apple iOS iOS is the
operating system for iPads and iPhones
and of course that's
objective-c so anyway yeah so go for
what's hot figure out which where do I
see yourself in terms of your career
whether big government small medium or
on your own as a freelancer and that
tells you what language you want to go
into anyway
I hope that was useful Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
