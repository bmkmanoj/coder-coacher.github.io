vlogging I want to ask the youtubers a
question would you guys be interested in
social media of marketing
discussions being blended in to my
business
talks and discussions does that interest
you at all I have good friends of mine
who are very experienced social media
marketers and accounts with companies
like Sony and have done stuff with AMW
and several other companies never heard
of and I also have a perspective from
I'm one of the original content
marketers that's how I really establish
myself back in the day on the web with
content marketing and so I've been
talking to them and I've been thinking
about vlogging about social media
marketing they're really plugged into
what it is to be social media marketer
of these days and to use social media
marketing to promote well to your
business so I thought that might be an
interesting subject to discuss don't
worry I will bring in the coding stuff
start bringing a sprinkling that in as
well but as you know I got big cores on
HTML and CSS JavaScript and I just use
the Python which gets ontology towards
your program
I got you got all the fundamentals
database you got all the fundamentals
covered solid with material that it
brought out and it's evergreen now
because these technologies in terms of
the basics are pretty consistent now so
I like what it was even just six seven
years ago
we've hit plateau you see that in all
industries by the way where they start
off you know in terms of evolutions like
super fast right but in time as as the
technologies or as the field becomes
more mature it levels off and it's
pretty consistent now so because of that
I'm thinking to myself I got these great
solid foundation courses in place HTML
CSS JavaScript PHP esq
Oh Pikeville and together I'm going to
get into the business end and I was
thinking social media marketing getting
into that that evolves still because
social media markets the social media
sites they're evolving as well so that
it's kind of a little bit more
interesting I think in terms of newer
content right because things are
changing anyway let me know what you
think whether social media marketing
interest you at all mixed in with the
business talks and the business vlogs
and yeah we'll see what you guys say and
we'll take it from there Chacho</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
