killer sites calm and this is my very
first video blog at the Jews pad I
haven't had a chance to put up any wall
art on the on the walls but anyway so in
this video blog I'm actually going to be
responding to a question that was put to
me and they're asking about my big
server move so let me give you a bit of
background story essentially I
transferred we rather transferred the
killer sites network of sites for one
dedicated server to another and so does
that mean that means that we have a box
a physical box computer bought that we
rent from a big provider and we
basically owned the box and we host our
sights on the box and the reason we have
a dedicated server rather you know
rather than shared hosting is because
well a couple things number one we have
a lot of traffic on it the killer sites
Network millions of page use every month
and beyond that we also have some very
specific requirements in terms of our
hosting essentially it's our job of base
stuff now some of you may or may not
know my big thing was Jeb is so I back
in the day I put it to play some Java
specific technology and javed based
sites and stuff spit specifically our
old Java form and so we don't use it
anymore for active forearm participation
but we do keep it up there as a narcotic
because there's opium was a lot of pulse
people still refer to it so we keep it
up but the problem is that Java
you know has its many advantages but
it's one big disadvantage for me anyway
is that if you're going live with it you
know to serve up java based on having
pages which would be jsps or javaserver
faces or whatnot it requires a lot of
juice and what are we meet Lord what do
I mean by a lot of juice being a lot of
horsepower in terms of RAM RAM memory
and so on so you can do with shared
hosting but it is problematic there's
also other issues where when you know
the pay on how the servers could figure
if you change things to the app your
java based app you have to restart the
server sometimes this is a real pain in
the neck versus PHP or ruby imagine
anyhow so we have some old Java based
stuff that we have to keep going so
dedicated server we have a lot of
traffic so dedicated server when you're
switching from one server to another
because we're using a traditional server
as opposed to a cloud-based system which
has a huge advantages in terms of
migration with a cloud-based server you
can much more easily move your system
from one physical box to the next it's
pretty simple when you're going
traditional like me it's problematic and
so he carves a bit more configuration so
on especially when you have all
java-based forms you gotta move around
the configuration for that thing it's
just a nightmare anyway so there you go
so that's the big server move it took
like a week or two to finalize
everything you know could have been done
quicker but there's all this planning
that has to be done and you know there's
we have lots of databases to move across
and you know we've had trouble this time
because we're moving from one version of
she on the old server versus a new
version of apache which in the new
version of apache tar much more
restrictive in terms of folder
permissions and it better cause all
kinds of problems where we had to go in
there and change permissions all the
folders otherwise the server which is we
fail we get these 500 error apache
errors it was just a real pain in the
butt another thing you know you may have
to contend with this was new for me
because never happened before is with
the old Apache server PHP was was
configured with Apache missing lead i
think all i think it's mod JK forget off
the top of my head essentially there's a
module that worked with an apache and a
towel it's been working for years but
they changed it to a sort of CJ CGI
based system for security reasons again
and so again that screwed up some of our
stuff not major but again had to do HT
access it didn't work you know when
you're using HT access to route non PHP
pages and HTML pages as HTML pages we
were using HT HT access to tell apache
treat them as PHP pages so anytime an
HTML page would be requested we would
send it to the PHP engine to the process
at a PHP code that might be in there and
we just did that it's very unusual
requirement but why would we doing I was
going to has a really old legacy pages
on killer sites calm and I just wanted
to add in some dynamic footers and stuff
like that and keep the dot HTML page
keep the URL URL structure for Google
purposes anyway I'm going for you with
that but so we had to change that up so
basically when you're going from one
server to next even though you're
mindful the configurations and so on you
can
have some upgrade issues that you had
not expected that's for sure yes I could
have kept the exact same version of
pacha on the new server how many old and
so on but it's always better as far as
far as I'm concerned to incrementally
keep up with the changes in technology
otherwise you might find yourself five
six years behind which it's a real
nightmare to upgrade when you finally
are pushed to do it so there you go that
was the big server move it took up a lot
of time slow down everything and but
it's done finally and I think I know you
can see a much greater speed increase
when you load up any of the killer sites
would be killer sites calm killer PHP
calm killer video store calm etc so
that's it this is the first of many nuvi
blogs in the new location and I hope you
found this somewhat informative I said
oh you know what another reason i got
the dedicated servers right now let me
point out something I used to have my
own servers right right in my place and
when you have your own servers you have
to get a line coming in which can be
expensive and you know internet
connection and you also need to get the
hardware you got to maintain the
hardware you got to watch over to
Hardware something breaks you got to go
there to fix it you better have some
spare pieces ready and you could have
backup batteries you know just in case
the power goes out typically got 24
hours of backup battery so i can get
very expensive in terms of your hardware
configurations so what I did I guess 70
years ago I forget now maybe six seven
years ago
I decided to basically co-locate the
server at a dedicated host company
hosting company not only they do
commercial stuff meaning where you could
bring your server computer into their
location one of their locations and
they'll just plug it into their network
what's a better solution though is to
just rent a box from them that's what we
do and the reason it's a better solution
is because then they become responsible
for the hardware and its maintenance and
so forth so the advantage of using an
outside dedicated host hosting provider
is that you get the twenty four seven
support they monitor an earlier their
systems and a hardware they're going to
have much bigger bag with bigger pipes
of you so you can make it have a little
spikes in traffic much more easily and
what else is there but if that's the big
one's right there so you know if you
find your sites are really taking up a
lot of bandwidth and you need a long
horsepower and you need those extra that
extra flexibility that about your own
dedicated box provides then it's
something to look into I should point
out though but there is an extra cost of
that when you go from shadow state to
dedicate a box you're going in front of
mail maybe tens of dollars a month or
ten bucks a month too many hundreds
depending on your configuration and you
know where they really ding you is like
on things like ram and disk space if you
have like a server with 22 gigs ram for
gigs rams i'm going to cost you so much
but if you want to go to eight we have
eight they really up the price if you
want to go for 500 gig hard drive to a
terabyte you have to price it
make timers these there's these sweet
spots just like cars use these sweet
spots and server configurations where
you get a lot of bang for your buck but
you know in me you may need to push it
up a little higher and that's what we
have to do it fortunately so it cost is
a little bit more but again it's totally
worth it and I would advise hosting in
your own apartment or your old place
unless you want to go to the hosting
business because the whole can of worms
that that will take up a lot of time now
