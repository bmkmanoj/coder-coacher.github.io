me to make a comment about c-sharp in
2016 2017 so c-sharp is a language that
Microsoft put together in I believed
late 90s 1998-99 if I recalled perhaps
1999 and c-sharp is basically
Microsoft's answer to Java but they made
moves to try to improve upon Java
whiskey sharp and they didn't at the
time to a certain extent there are some
nice things about the c-sharp language
but that was a long time ago and I'm
sure Java and c-sharp crews that have
gone back and forth to try to improve
upon each other's languages they to
one-up each other and today they are
both very good languages but they have
different use cases to a certain extent
so c-sharp as far as I know is used in
two areas used in the.net framework
there are other languages and dotnet
dotnet was trying to come up with this
idea that you could write you could
write apps in several dotnet languages
and again JavaScript net if I recall in
a while they definitely at vb.net at
c-sharp dotnet and perhaps others so
it's been a while I did write a c-sharp
app back when dotnet was in its late
beta stages and what I did was actually
ported a Java app that I had written a
web app and i ported it to c-sharp net i
actually started with vb.net just to try
it out and I dumped that pretty quickly
as all VB done that was was this dotnet
with VB syntax which was much more
verbose
then c-sharp dotnet so I just stuck the
c-sharp there and probably was
influenced by the fact that I was a Java
coder at the time so c-sharp is still
widely used for dotnet web app creation
is also used in game creation with
something called a unity a framework and
I believe Microsoft puts that out I've
never done a unity coding let me just
summarize by saying from what I recall
back in the day c-sharp is a fine
language it has advantages it has its
disadvantages just like every other
programming language in the world I am
if people have not figured it out
already I have very much language
agnostic when it comes to programming
languages well any languages really the
reason I am is because I found in my
career that different languages
different frameworks different api's
lend itself lend themselves to different
situations so there's always pros and
cons I would pick a language based on
whatever circumstances happened to be at
the time so for instance when I was the
freelance software developer I would
pick languages I would work in based on
what the client wanted based on what the
project needed I wasn't a guy who said I
just write Java that's all everything I
do is Java or I just write PHP or I just
write dotnet you know that kind of thing
no I just chose whatever whatever
language the project demanded so when
you're choosing your programming
languages I always advise two things
number one you choose the type of
programming what you want to do because
certain languages will pull you in a
certain direction so for instance if you
want to do web apps for small businesses
do small business development as a
freelancer chances are PHP PHP WordPress
PHP laravel PHP Drupal these sorts of
things probably where you're going to
make a lot of money that's what a demand
is on the other hand if you want to get
into mobile development of course you
have either Java for Android or you get
iOS 4 or Swift rather for
again depends on the type of work you
want to do I can go on and on and on as
I have in other videos where I talk
about specific use cases for a
particular language a use case is
basically just where you would use that
language with regards to the other
factory excuse me is to look at besides
the type of work you want to do is
whether there are jobs or opportunities
available available to you where you
happen to live in my part of the world I
don't know where you live you could be
in India you could be in China it could
be in Europe it mean you ask Canada who
knows and even within a particular
country you may find certain
geographical areas will have a certain
proclivity towards a certain language so
you know you may find in Southern
California they do a lot of Python and
then Ruby and you may find in New York
they do a lot of PHP I don't know so
what you have to do is when you're
looking at software development is a
figure out what kind of software
development you want to do C++
programming is a very different animal
and Python programming for instance and
number two you have to look at what are
the opportunities in your area so yeah
back to c-sharp is it good
oh yeah it's a great language just like
jealous Java straight just like Ruby is
great great just like Python is great
just like PHP is great just like you
know so the other languages are great
depending on the circumstance that you
happen to be in so those are two issues
I would look at one considering c-sharp
I would look around see if there any
c-sharp opportunities in your area and
then B then look at the type of
programming that you would be doing with
seats sharp and seeing if you'd want to
do that
that's pretty much my advice on c-sharp
so again let me bring in the last point
being language agnostic and realizing
that the programming language is
irrelevant in many respects in terms of
you as a programmer programming the
programming language is only relevant in
terms of jobs opportunity in the type of
work you want to do all these languages
have their pros and their cons so really
depends what it is you're going to do so
let me give you example of my language
agnostic sensibilities now besides the
fact in my career as a freelance
developer I would jump around from
language to language depending on the
project also let's talk about now so I
have an app where it is PHP based it was
originally written with a CodeIgniter
MVC framework and at its time it was
great but you know it had its problems
and eventually even the code of manners
people just basically sold it off and
they said we had enough of that
so we have this old app that is very
solid though pretty much bug free and
but we need to expand upon it but we had
a pretty old framework so what do we do
we jumped over to another framework
called lair eval which is a much more
modern PHP framework model to a certain
extent after Ruby on Rails and so we use
laravel to help modernize and to speed
up some aspects of the old code ignitor
hap so this is all PHP of course so you
see I was not like married to
CodeIgniter saw an advantage with the
laravel framework so I said okay we're
going to use by her Val we're going to
use Lara fo to create micro services and
we fed the old app to micro services and
we were able to really improve a lot
about this application so for last
couple years we've been thinking about a
rewrite at some point and I'm not saying
we'll do it you know this year next year
even hereafter I don't know but at some
point absently gets so old that you may
have to rewrite although this is the
last bloody thing you want to do with
app development because when you rewrite
an app from scratch because your old Co
base is so old you're usually replacing
one set of bugs for another that's well
not usually you always are but sometimes
the infrastructure
of an old app is just something that is
too much
and you just got to let it go sometimes
you got to make that decision the
biggest example that I can think of is
with Mac OS when Mac OS hit version 9 I
believe that was written in Pascal it
had all kinds of fundamental problems
with the core engine of Mac OS so though
Steve Jobs took the very brave decision
at the time to say we're going to dump
that and we're going to go with a whole
new Mac OS which was based on FreeBSD
which was a type of Unix
and so they went Mac OS 10 which is a
total brand-new rewrite from scratch and
they dumped the old OS 9 but this is
after many many many years that they
took this decision he only took the
decision because OS 9 basically its
heart was was not up to spec to with
modern computing so yeah you do this you
do this very rarely do a rewrite from
scratch so I'm looking at this app where
is PHP based and it's still pretty it's
really really good now Eric D the core
engine is great because we've used
laravel we've been able to breathe new
life into it superfast works fantastic
it's real good app but you know you go
down into the dungeons of the app and
are some things about them about it that
I would want to touch you know you got
multiple developers involved and code
just gets messy as normal and diverse
software development so at some point I
may and I'm not saying I will I may pull
the trigger on a rewrite will be in PHP
it might but I'm actually considering
writing it in Python for a whole bunch
of reasons which I want to get into now
but I see some advantages in writing it
in Python not just not coding advantages
per se it's more about business
advantages and that's another thing when
you're looking at writing your own apps
or running app you
you have to also consider the business
implications of choosing a particular
framework or language so for instance if
you are developing a new app and you're
using an older framework that seems to
be losing its steam you may not want to
do that you may want to maybe use a much
more popular framework or environment
something that you know that has a much
longer lifespan because the worst thing
you can do is base your product on some
other framework or API or something
that's basically shutting down that's
terrible I've been there in the past
back in the old Java days so there you
go that's the end of that I've really
went on a tension on this one so to
close c-sharp very good language like so
many others it's can be used in web app
creation dotnet framework if we use in
game creation with the Unity framework
and perhaps in other places as well so
there you go just check out the job
opportunities check out to make sure
that it's the type of work that you want
to do that's pretty much it
