so what we're gonna look at here is how
to deal with different data types and
how we can mix them if you will in our
Python code so what you're gonna see is
that the knowledge of data types is not
just academic it has a practical purpose
we got to be practical in our code
so let's first create a couple of
variables
we're gonna go name equal not plus
equals and we're gonna say Stefan we're
gonna say age equals 40 I'm going to say
my real age and we're gonna say month
equals 4 all right so let's say that I'm
gonna function f5
I'm gonna see nothing happens here
because we haven't done anything as we
know right so let's now print out the
name variable f5 step on pretty good so
let's now print out the name variable
plus the text space loves pizza all
right everything works out fine we see
the output works out pretty fine so you
see we're able to add up or stick
together the contents of the name
variable in this case it's the string
Stefan and we add it to the string as in
a string of text loves pizza you notice
we've got the quotes here that's why
it's a string you notice I put a space
here
if we look down here Steph and there's a
space loss pizza now if I took out the
space save a 5 you see there would be no
space now you know I put a space not bad
a bad so let's continue so let's go
print mmm
yeah what's the print age 40 pretty good
actually what I'm gonna do something
here
now what I just done here I turned the
data type in month into a string from an
INT I did that by putting in a quote
right so what I have for like that
we know that month is of the data type
and we use a comment here int right it's
int at this point because there's no
quotes but if I put quotes around it it
becomes string right it's a string see
this comment will be ignored by Python
so let me just make that point
f5 right for it now watch what happens
as I take off this this half sign we're
gonna get an error because pythons going
what are you doing
invalid syntax no didn't like that right
so I'm just gonna take that out for now
so okay stuff that we've seen all be for
now hmm let's try this we're gonna say
okay what it is and let's say they go
name plus month save a 5 stuff an for
yeah that's not good let's go like this
you want a space right so you go plus
here we go stuff an plus 4 what you
should notice and everything that we've
done thus far is that we're constantly
printing variables or information like
this is a piece of information believe
it or not in Python a space like that is
information we'll get into that later on
but what we've done thus far is we
printed information but is always
strings there are always strings right
this is a string this is a string we've
always printed strings now watch what
happens when we try to print a string
you know that the name variable has a
string and then we're gonna print Maddie
age right the age though we know is the
data type int since we didn't put quotes
around it let's say this at 5 ah look at
that we have a type error or type error
must be string not int it's talking
about this so what is Python telling us
here it's saying that you cannot print
at the same time a variable of the data
type string name is the data type string
right because it's it's a string with a
variable of the data type it right so
let's say type error must be string not
in so saying if you want to print
something with name it has to be string
it can't be int can't not be int so you
see right there where your knowledge of
data types is going to help you with
bugs right you're taping code but BAM
you're doing so complex stuff anyway why
is it not working
ah you can't mix your data types so how
do you deal with that yeah pretty simple
Python we have built-in capabilities
something called a function we're going
to be looking at functions in depth very
soon functions provide functionality so
we've been using the print function here
to print out stuff now we're going to
use the STR function which is short for
string and what is the STR function
doing it's converting this variable with
an int datatype
into a string datatype right so let's
save that then we f5 boom it works is it
interesting I don't like that what's
doesn't look good I'm gonna put a space
I'm gonna put another plus like this
function of 5 there we go stuff an for T
we've learned something new here we've
learned that you cannot mix data types
and when you do want to mix data types
sometimes you're gonna have to do some
data type conversion and you're going to
be converting data types so they can
play nice together and be friendly and
we use something called the this STR
function that's sure for string of
course much more to learn about this but
let's get into some quizzing now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
