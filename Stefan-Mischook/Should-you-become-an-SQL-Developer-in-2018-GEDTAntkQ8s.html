today and though I got the heat blasting
because I got all these windows in my
apartment it's just so difficult to
place hot under normal circumstances
toasty warm today when you got -38 with
the windchill factor this is Celsius so
it's really cold it's difficult to keep
the place warm I'm using my old DSLR
here because I'm doing a bit of a vlog
format today so you see all the windows
that I have that's really really hard to
keep warm any out so I'm gonna go make
my tea and then I'm going to answer a
couple questions about SQL so somebody
asked me if SQL developer was a good
career for 2018 and he got warnings from
friends that you shouldn't do it so what
I did is what I tell everybody you first
thing you do is check to see what the
local job listings are for SQL
developers see what the demand is see
what the requirements are see what the
pay is and see if that fits you right
away so I went to indeed.com and I'm not
promoting indeed you can go to many job
sites and I will suggest you or at least
two or three in deeds the one that I
know of so I check it out
and I just checked to see what was
available indeed there were several jobs
for SQL developers if you're not sure
what SQL is SQL is a structured query
language it is the language of
relational databases relational
databases include MySQL sequel server
Oracle and there are several others but
MySQL Oracle sequel are ones that are
super popular these days
SQL developers are a bit of a niche type
of developer and it's not one of these
sexy new languages like JavaScript it's
not one in a sex
the new developer jobs like AI developer
machine learning developer or a
cryptocurrency developer it's not in the
super hot sector but sometimes being in
well-established sectors that are not
super hot could be extremely lucrative
in that in that you're not gonna have as
much competition so you would have to
just look around in your area see what
demand is see what people are looking
for and then you can make your decision
based on that
so if you're an SQL developer you're
gonna be working with databases all the
time you're going to be writing SQL
queries this is basically colvett it's
used to talk to databases and you're
gonna be likely working for very large
well-established organizations or you
have human resource departments and so
on so check out in decom or the job site
see what requirements they have in terms
of your skill sets
see if they need degrees or not because
if you don't have a degree and you want
to become an SQL developer and you may
find that you need to get yourself a
comp side degree or maybe need a
certification and database
administration you have to check into
that when you are getting into languages
like SQL java.net these languages are
more or less used in large organizations
they call that the enterprise you have
to expect you're going to have to go
through HR Human Resources HR red tape
which means you're gonna have to have
certain certifications and degrees well
at least more likely or you need to have
a lot of job experience that you can
show this is very different than if
you've got a job in in in the startup
world where they care a little less well
much less about degrees or if you're
going into freelance or a small business
development or a wordpress normal PHP
development in these other areas it's
much more about the skills and
degrees so you if you don't have a
degree and you don't want to you want to
save yourself three years or two years
or whatever it happens to take you to
get a particular type of degree or
diploma then you might want to consider
other languages like the PHP like like
the Ruby like the WordPress developer
that kind of stuff and you know in terms
of salaries is all within certain ranges
depending on your level of experience so
you may look at for instance data
scientist with Python that's amazing but
then you have to become a data scientist
right it's not just the Python code if
you look at a machine learning and AI
that's I think probably you're more
flexible there as long as you have the
chops and skills I'm probably gonna hire
you because it's such a demand for it
same thing with cryptocurrency
when I get into the bat lab said in
terms of cryptocurrency development I
would be very careful there's gonna be a
big demand for that but I think
cryptocurrencies right now are in a
massive mania and a bubble and that
means there's gonna be a crash happening
so some of you guys are into crypto
mania into crypto mania please think
about this the ripple Founder ripple
which has no value it doesn't do
anything as nothing the ripple founder
for a period of time this week was worth
as much as Mark Zuckerberg think about
that this guy this kid who has a large
stake in ripple coins which are just
results with mathematical equations like
all the other kryptos he was worth as
much as Mark Zuckerberg the guy who has
the base should be a shareholder of the
biggest social network in the world that
generates billions and billions of
dollars in revenue every year it's super
solid as amazing user doesn't make any
sense to you that the founder of a
cryptocurrency barely anybody uses it
doesn't have any utility at this point
it has 10,000 competitors and me and you
can come up with killer coins tomorrow
and say wow killer coins are much better
than ripple coins much better than
Bitcoin because of all these reasons and
everything will start buying into it
somebody put up a corn called dogecoin
dogcoin it's like based on some dog or
something it's based on nonsense it was
a joke and now it's got a market cap
the billion dollars how does that make
any sense this is a classic this is a
classic bubble of classic mania look up
tulip mania look up the dot-com mania
and you see what I mean
so back to SQL Developer yes think about
it in terms of what the type of work it
is look into it may it may appeal to you
to work for very large organizations
that's cool that's great
but you have to look at what the HR
requirements are again the first thing
you got to do when you're looking at a
job is a to see whether or not there is
demand for that type of software
development that type of programming
that type of coding in your area or the
area you want to work whether it's
online or offline and then you got to
look at the job requirements and just
what I would suggest that you do is
first of all do a little SQL do a little
SQL work and you probably have to have
peripheral skills as well because a lot
of the jobs I checked on the web it
requires you know bit of Linux they
require but you may know some
programming as well beyond SQL so you
may want to look into that as well so
that's pretty much it that's my tips on
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
