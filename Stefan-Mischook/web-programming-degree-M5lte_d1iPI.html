killer PHP calm and cool air sighs calm
in this video blog I want to talk about
web design and web programming degrees I
get this question very often and the
question is do you need a web design
degree or web programming degree to get
work in the field the short answer is no
in fact it's one of the fields were
degrees in the field are very
unimportant most of the time see it
depends on where you want to find work
and actually believe it or not it can
largely be affected by which programming
language you're gonna get involved with
yes if you're going to get into dotnet
or you want to get into Java then the
chances that you may need a computer
computer science degree or a computer
engineering degree or something like
that or even a technical college degree
will increase because with Java
programming dotnet programming that's
largely that kind of program that kind
of programming programming is found in a
larger medium to larger organizations
they tend to use those languages to
build their stuff whereas if you are
getting into PHP then the need for a
degree diminishes tremendously because
though PHP is used and very big websites
and including Facebook and others you'll
find that PHP is largely used in small
small for small companies startups small
organizations and there's plenty of work
to be had working for small companies
building their PHP based web
applications or web programs so if you
want to get into that if you want to get
into building sites and
websites for smaller companies and
entrepreneurs and so on then degrees are
next to useless really really they'll
never asked you what the greenlab what
does it ask you is what have you done
before what can you do show me something
and that's about it
when I hired people I never look at
whether or not they have a degree or not
I'm just I'm more concerned about their
skillsets you see unlike so many other
professions the web world the way all
the web professions are more or less a
meritocracy meaning you advanced and you
get your jobs and your rewards based on
merit based on whether or not you have
skills rather than a piece of paper from
a college university or nanotech school
so I think that's a great thing I think
that personally on a philosophical basis
if everybody if the world operated that
way in terms of skills rather than
seniority rather than connections which
is the cronyism then you know you have a
much more productive society but they
get I'm going on a tangent here so
fortunately you know the web though is
you know based on that it's because
because results are immediate and
obvious I think that's the reason why
you see if you build a piece of web
based software a PHP app but there's an
online shopping system for instance if
you do a good job it's pretty evidence
because everything will work but if you
do a crappy job it's going to be pretty
evident because things will not work
whereas in other professions and I'm not
taking shots of other professions but
like no counting in this year counted
it's probably not obvious whether or not
your accountants doing a good or bad job
it's really hard to tell of a lawyer
same thing how about you know you get
the idea so they're really you know in
other professions they relied more on
seniority they rely more on credentials
because the results are not necessarily
obvious and unfortunately though what
also happens is cronyism creeps in there
and in all kinds of minor corruptions as
you are system at corruptions we don't
get that nearly as much in the web
programming world especially in the web
design world again because it's such a
results-driven marketplace so yeah if
you're going after small businesses if
you're looking to serve your own private
web design studio or web programming
studio then you don't have to worry
about degrees or anything like that it's
not important and to close up this
particular video blog I just want to
warn people about taking on excessive
student loan debt and I'm gonna warn you
about I'm gonna warn you about this
because it's a major problem in the u.s.
especially I can't say four-year boy
year person you know that's much cheaper
to go to school there which makes sense
in Canada as well I don't know about the
rest of the world but with regards to
everybody in the u.s. it's a very very
dangerous thing to get student loan debt
extremely careful about that because you
have to understand first of all student
loan that cannot be discharged to the
through bankruptcy so what does that
mean that means if you rack up a bunch
of student loan debt you cannot get rid
of it except by paying it off right and
whereas if you have started a business
the business failed and business old
hundreds of thousands of dollars or
whatever you could just go bankrupt and
wipe off the debt you know but for some
reason for students they've changed the
laws in
recent years maybe 10-15 years ago I
forget now and now if you you know rack
up a whole bunch of student loan debt
you have to pay it off no matter what so
be very careful about going to school
and racking up debt needlessly
especially if you're just exploring
potential careers or paths and you're
not sure what you want to study you're
better to do better on your own time and
get a job and study here in your own
time you know buy a few books and so on
rather than getting yourself into all
kinds of trouble and all kinds of debt
that will become a noose around your
neck
not news but heavy weight on you if you
will and maybe a noose around your neck
you know so especially if you get into
technology especially getting to the web
stuff again if you're not going for the
big companies you know if you're not
going to go into Java net and you
probably don't really need you don't
need a programming degree you don't need
a degree in that regard and even if
you're doing Jeff and done that even
that you know as you know be HR
Department's of human resource
departments will make it more difficult
for you but I've seen still today even
if you're very good at your programs
your dotnet or Java you will get a job I
can almost assure you of that
although I recommend PHP for the most
part because if you look at the trends
going forward in North America and
Europe and so on you can see a
resurgence in small business development
again see lots of entrepreneurs new
entrepreneurs coming around simply
because of the economic circumstances
remember we're going through you know an
economic change now with the collapse of
this the system collapsing and
readjusting to a certain extent but with
every economic change like this it
shakes out a lot of loose debris and it
opens up a lot of opportunities so take
it as being a good
and it's especially good thing if you
learn a web programming and web design
and you'll learn PHP you learn
JavaScript new word J learn jQuery you
get the idea that's it I hope this video
was useful and we'll talk soon ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
