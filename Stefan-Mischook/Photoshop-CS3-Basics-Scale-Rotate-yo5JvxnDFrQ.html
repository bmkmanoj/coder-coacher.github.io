talking about number of things regarding
transforming images and first and
foremost I'm going to show you how to
scale and rotate an object just as the
one that we see correct right in front
of us well as you'll note this is doomed
TIFF
if you're looking for an image to use
you can find this one in the Photoshop
samples folder on your C Drive or your
Mac hard drive if you're working on a
Mac and what I'm going to be doing here
is to say file new and just create a
standard web object as we see here and
I'm gonna drag using my black arrow the
move tool that's a V on your keyboard
shortcut I'm gonna move it into view so
or into the new canvas you'll notice I
could just drag it in like that however
as you can see it's a little cut off so
if I were to undo that here's a little
trick if you hold if you hold down shift
when you do that now you'll notice that
it's always going to be located in the
center of the document that you've just
grabbed so as we drag it into this new
document you'll notice that I'm only at
66% here but this object is placed
directly into the canvas so I don't
really need the original one so I'm just
going to shut that down for a second and
what I'm going to show you here is
something that's located under the edit
tool there are a number of transform
commands so we can see and as you can
see there's a number of them that say
scale rotate or skew or distort or
perspective or many of these we'll be
talking about in just a second here if
you were to say scale you'll notice the
first thing that happens is these
squares appear around my document and
those are the transformation bounds and
if you'll notice I can scale an object
just by dragging this in notice however
that if you do that your object can
become distorted almost looking like
it's come from a funhouse mirror
too skinny or too fat however an
important shortcut for transforming is
the shift key and that constrains the
proportions of your document as you are
transforming it at this point if we're
happy with that I can apply the
transformation simply by double-clicking
inside of the object here or by clicking
anywhere on the toolbar and saying do
you want to apply the transformation you
say yes or no or cancel and do another
bit of transforming anyways if you're
happy with that we'll say Y notice
another way of getting the transform out
or those transforming bounds is to use
this shortcut here for the free
transform tool ctrl T so if I were to
press ctrl T or on your Macintosh
command T on Apple T you'll see that we
have those same elements in place at
this point I'll show you that if you
want it to rotate something just moving
your cursor out here see how it changes
the view of the cursor so you know here
I could drag it out but as it goes here
I've got sort of the semicircle effect
that allows you to create rotation just
as you can see there notice I could also
determine the rotation by moving what's
centered here which is called the
registration point if I were to for
example position it right here now my
rotation looks very different than what
I had in just a second ago
so that's another way of creating
rotation also take note that anytime you
use the transformation tools or free
transform ctrl T you'll notice that the
transform options appear right at the
top and these options determine for
example the registration point it also
allows you to move the objects x and y
position and you can slide that as well
just as I'm doing here same thing with
the Y notice however there's width and
height in terms of scaling and if you
want to constrain the proportions
remember what I told you about holding
down shift
you can just click here and notice I can
make this bigger or smaller and I could
do that numerically too by highlighting
this area and saying specific percentage
amount and we'll get into some of the
other things but here's the rotation by
the way and that can allow you to work
in this fashion too so that shows you a
little bit about the transformation
tools the free transform tool and how to
use scale and rotate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
