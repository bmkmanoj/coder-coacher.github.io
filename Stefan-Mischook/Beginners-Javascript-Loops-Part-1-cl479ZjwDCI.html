look at something called looping looping
is basically a way in programming to
quickly run through a whole bunch of
different records its allows you to do
repetitive task automatically you can
think of it as like a conveyor belt if
you will or automatic card shuffler you
see looping used a lot in situations
where maybe you have a whole bunch of
records from a database like a list of a
thousand products and you want to put
this in a table in your HTML page and
you want to format all the prices you
want to make the text boat you would use
looping in javascript to automate the
process to do it all automatically so to
be clear loops are looping is a built-in
mechanism that comes built in with
JavaScript and it's actually very common
in just about every programming language
I've ever used it's one of the key
powers of programming or computers the
ability to do repetitive task
automatically and looping allows you to
do this in JavaScript there are several
different types of looping mechanisms
that you can use we're going to
concentrate on to we're going to look at
the while loop and the for loop
okay we have a simple HTML page here and
you've noticed in the body I've created
our script block here and here's our
first loop now it's called the while
loop and you can see why it's called a
while loop and this is how it works so
first thing you need to do is need to
create a variable because i just called
a VAR a i could have called anything you
want and I said VAR a had a value of
zero so you'll see how and why this is
going to be used in our loop so here's
the while loop it looks kind of like and
it works kind of like an if statement
where you have the instead of if you
have while then you have your opening
and closing brackets and where you're
checking to see this is true or false
and then you have your curly brackets so
basically as long as this is false as
long as it is true rather anything in
between these curly brackets will get
executed so let me look at the code so
we're saying while the variable a is
less than 10 you're going to do this and
when soon as a is no longer less than 10
when it becomes 10 this while loop will
stop looping so it's very much like the
if statement except the wild repeats
itself over and over and over again
until this becomes false right so in
this case when as long as a is less than
10 and we know it's 10 random from begin
we know it's less than 10 because we set
to zero we could have set it to two or
three or whatever we want but I'm just
going to keep it at zero so while a is
less than 10 we want to write something
to the pace or writing the a so it's
going to write the value of a and plus
the plus sign in JavaScript basically
allows you to to combine things and
write it to the page I think we've
looked at document dot write before and
this is a built-in function in
JavaScript allows you to write to the
page saying we're going to use it here
just for the sake of
our little example so we're saying while
a is less than 10 you're going to write
to the page the value of a and you're
going to write a dash beside it right
get the quotes here and we use quotes
because this is a string right a string
of text I hope you remember that from a
previous video another thing I'm doing
as i'm using the Firebug console console
dot log to log the value of a at the
same time now here's the interesting
thing you see a plus plus this is an
operator we've looked at operators
before where an operator operates on
variables if you recall so we got the
variable a and we got it here too and
what we're saying is that every time
this loop runs right as long as a is
less than 10 we want you to write this
logs onto the console and we want to do
to a plus plus plus plus means simply to
increase the value of the variable a by
one that's what plus plus means and
underverse ciders minus minus but for
our example we're going to go plus plus
so basically what we're saying here is
that every time we run the loop we want
you to increase the value of a by one
right because eventually you want a to
increase so it hits 10 so it's not less
than 10 so this loop stops looping
so let's take a look at how this looks
in the actual web page so here's our
page and you knows we have the the page
is been written 0 1 dash 2 3 etc and if
you look at a code that's what we told
it to do we said write the value of a
plus a dash as long as a is less than 10
so we go here so let's start off at 0
because we started with the variable at
0 that was the initial value so writes
ok 0124 you up to 9 so let's change this
and say we'll do it until 20 so I'm
going to save that and we'll just reload
the page as you can see it increases up
to 19 pretty cool right we could have
started this ad for for instance say
this and we reload and you see it starts
out for the loop the while loop
automatically repeats itself as long as
whatever is in between this and this
bracket is true so it's very much like
the if statement except this is
repetitive
so a lot of you may be asking why did
you put this line of code here why did
you have to put a plus plus well that
prevents what some people would call the
endless loop from occurring you see if I
didn't put this a plus plus a would
never increment right this is the
incremental perator increment means you
know increments from from zero or long
this gate will start at zero from 0 to 1
22 23 24 that's an incrementation of the
number so if you don't increment the
variable as you're looping a will never
go up it will always stay at its
original value zero so will always be
less in this case 20 what happens is
that you will get an infinite loop and
basically the browser or just keep
running the while loop infinitely you
will never stopped because this will
always stay true write a will never go
change from 0 will never become equal to
20 in what happens in that kid situation
and I'm not going to demo it because I'm
just going to crash the web browser
browser and just keep running a while
loop infinitely so you always got to
remember when you're creating while
loops and any loops or that matter you
have to make sure you don't sit set
yourself up for a situation where you
have an infinite loop where you crash
the system so you'll learn more about
that as you get into more loops later on
but that's why we have this a plus plus
here we're making sure that the value of
a does increase every cycle of the loop
in part 2 we're going to look at
something called a for loop it's a
variation it's another type of looping
mechanism built into JavaScript and I'll
help you to understand what all this
does nerd stuff here what this means and
I hope you understand the difference
between the while loop versus the for
loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
