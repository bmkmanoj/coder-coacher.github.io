the top three skills for an entrepreneur
or freelancer
what would you say are the top three
skills this is a hard one to put your
finger on because it really depends out
what part of the business cycle you're
kin you see when you're first starting a
business you have this initial stages of
a market assessment and then you put
together the basic structure and then
you start growing it from small to
medium et cetera so there's different
skill sets that are acquired at
different parts of the business
lifecycle it's interesting in fact I
found that different people are better
at different stages of the business so
I've know some people who are amazing
really good at coming up with new ideas
and getting something off of the ground
on the other hand these entrepreneurs
are not very good at managing businesses
they just don't like it they like to do
new things and on the flip side I know
people who couldn't come up with a new
business idea and come up with a motto
if their life depended on it but they're
really really good at managing the ship
if you are managing and keeping things
running smoothly two different skill
sets sometimes you have people who can
do both
I find all in my life I found that
people are basically better at one thing
or the other so it's uh it comes out to
psychology of course so what would be
the top three skills I think for
entrepreneurs so I'm gonna assume for
people who are just starting out I think
number one is is being honest with
yourself being honest with what you see
what a big problems that news get into
new entrepreneurs is that they get the
they look at things that rosy colored
glasses they come up with these crazy
projections about how well their
businesses are going to do or how the
product is going to do they look at
things again with rosy colored glasses
what I mean by that they're a little bit
too optimistic about prospects of a
product or service
their assessments of things are
exaggerated and it's just because they
really want something to be true so they
they kind of create a fantasy what you
have to do is not to be negative or
pessimistic no but you have to try to be
right in the middle you have to try to
assess things more honestly this is
gonna give you better information it's
going to allow you to build the business
it's gonna allow you to be more
successful more easily as an
entrepreneur if you can be as honest as
you can in terms of your assessments of
things number two you have to have
really good communication skills really
good communication skills reading
writing speaking not reading writing and
speaking skills so that you can
communicate your ideas and be able to
know whether you're selling something or
working with partners or working with
people contractors are working with you
cetera being able to communicate clearly
succinctly meaning without going on
forever is a very important skill to
develop as well so that's something to
consider
another thing that entrepreneurs should
have in 2018 is least a low level
understanding let me rephrase that to
have a foundational understanding of
technology
why because technology is the great
equalizer today even from when I started
in business in the early 90s I was even
91 and 90 something like that versus
today is you have you have the great
equalizer which is all this technology
to computer technology the internet
social media all these things make it's
so much easier for entrepreneurs today
to get off the ground than it was just
even 30 years ago I could tell you that
from personal experience
it's incredible what the opportunity is
like for instance right now I'm in my
car here I'm using a prosumer DSLR
camera Canon EDD so it's not super
expensive or anything
and I'm able to record pretty
good-looking HD video just you know no
effort whereas 15 years ago 10 years ago
this would've been very very difficult
impossible right its sake so you can get
quality of output with minimal effort
and cost as I've never seen before with
social media and the web it's incredible
how you can get the word out very
quickly it's great opportunities but you
need to understand the technology so for
example I'm involved in one of the
companies are involved with a partner in
I'm acting in the role of the CTOs chief
technology officer
amongst other things and even though
what I'm doing now has nothing to do
with coding per se I'm evaluating SAS
software and looking at the best way to
to just to get the thing off the ground
in terms of the technology end of things
it's not a technology product I'm gonna
get I'm not going to get into the
details of business here but the point
is because of my tech background I was
able to assess do we build from scratch
do we go for SAS if we do go for SAS
which sort of SAS do we go with what
kind of hosting because there's a web
site of course based on this whole thing
what kind of hosting know do we go with
how do we proceed eccentrics there are
all these things and I'm able to assess
these things much more easily much more
quickly than my partners because I'm a
nerd I have good tech skills that's why
I always talk about it's important for
entrepreneurs even if they have no
intentions of writing code to at least
understand the basics of web design
development this way they'll have
they'll just understand the landscape
you understand the options there are
possibilities what's it all about and
it'll allow you to make better decisions
with regards to your technology
deployments so important because
technology is a key factor in any modern
business today
whether it be an online-only business
whether it be a restaurant or a butcher
shop
you need to leverage technology
because it will save you a lot of money
get you all our clients save you a lot
of time it's just important that you
understand that
so yeah tech skills communication skills
another big thing and being honest about
is how you assess things that's three
I'm a well I'll better throw in a fourth
to end this video you need to be super
super super conservative with your money
in the beginning why because you're
going to make mistakes in the beginning
you're gonna make mistakes you don't
want to make mistakes that are gonna
kill your business meaning you run out
of money that's what puts people into
bankruptcy they ran out of money that's
all it is running out of money so being
able to manage your money have good
money management skills is such an
important part about being an
entrepreneur I know it's not exciting
doesn't sound exciting this stuff but
this is the reality of situation I
believe you can become successful as an
entrepreneur I think it's inevitable if
you follow some basic rules including
these four I just gave you here if you
follow these things you don't burn some
money you're you're honest you
understand tech you evaluate blah blah
blah you're gonna find yourself it's
inevitable that you could be successful
in my opinion and I say that because
I've done several times and I've seen it
I've seen not just my own experience but
my friends experience you know as I say
birds of a feather or fly together what
you are in business what happens you
start meeting other people in business
and you start becoming friends with
people are in business and you start
discussing and this happened to me for
last 28 years so I have good friends of
mine who've been in business some have
been very successful some have failed
and I can tell you after I've seen this
you know almost getting almost three
decades I can tell you what works what
doesn't work what causes failure
what causes success these four rules I
just discussed are two foundational
concepts if you will foundational things
you have to have in place if you want to
be successful hope it helps bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
