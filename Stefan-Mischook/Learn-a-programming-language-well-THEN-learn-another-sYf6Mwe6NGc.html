since my last video blog I keep saying
that but what can you do I'm just very
busy these days so in this quick little
blog I want to talk about learning a
programming language now if you've been
watching my videos over the years or
reading my articles you know that I am a
big advocate of learning multiple
programming languages something I've
done myself and the reason you want to
do that is because by learning more
languages you get the compare and
contrast how each language does things
and it will just improve your overall
skill set that being said before I would
jump into learning multiple languages
the first thing you need to do is to
become pretty good at least pretty good
all right if not better than pretty good
in a language of your choice whether it
be PHP Ruby Java whatever and a reason
I'm telling you this it's because I
should have put it when you are an
expert in one language that level of
skill that you've acquired but let's say
you become an expert in PHP where you're
very comfortable with PHP you understand
are sorted PHP understand MVC understand
how to use frameworks all this kind of
stuff and you understand the basis at
least the basics of design patterns when
you have that skill set in PHP then I
would say it's a good time to go learn
another language whether it be Ruby or
Java or whatever uses our Python
whatever you decide what you want to
learn these days in terms of server-side
languages languages that operate on the
server if you want to be nimble and an
opportunistic software developer I would
suggest PHP Ruby and Python those are
languages I would suggest there's
nothing wrong with Java or.net per se
but those are more enterprise level
languages that's if you want to go work
for IBM or some huge business some huge
bank that uses one of those two
server-side programming environments not
my thing it depends what you want to do
PHP Ruby by
much more flexible that said by far and
away of course PHP is the most widely
used anyway off topic again so why
should you learn one language well
before moving on to another because if
what happened I got this from actually
martial arts many years ago I had been
learning martial arts for a long time so
after about a decade of martial art
training I had been doing several styles
at some times at some point I'd be doing
two three styles at the same time be
like Monday
boxing's used a wrestling Thursday catch
campbell and so on and what happened is
after about ten years of solid training
i became pretty good at several styles
of martial arts but i wasn't really an
expert in anything so what happened it
would happen to me is that after a
decade i was just there was a decent
well-rounded guy but I wasn't an expert
I really wasn't up to that level of you
know called black belt whatever that
means but I wasn't an expert and so one
of my teachers pulled me aside one day
said staff you know you're a jack of all
trades master of none pick a style
master it become an expert really know
it and then what will happen is it it
will raise the game of all the other
styles that you're involved with and it
was hard for me to understand but I went
with him because this guy had a lot more
experience than me and I said okay I'll
follow your teachings and that's what I
did I picked the style and became an
expert in that style and lo and behold
what happens that raised the game of all
those other styles I became almost an
expert at all those other styles because
fundamentally fundamentally when it
comes to martial arts and fighting
boxing kickboxing Tai box a Jiu Jitsu
whatever their fundamental I'm not going
to use techniques so now you're see
technique the principles fundamental
attributes that you developed in your
mind your body
that crosses all disciplines is
universal same thing the programming
when you learn MVC and Sisyphus
sophisticated sophisticated application
development in PHP you're gonna have a
sophisticated understanding of
application development in Ruby and Java
environments and Python environments
because whether it's Java PHP Ruby
Python all the Web Apps stuff is all MVC
based they all have the same design
patterns and you're gonna become you're
gonna see that there's this universality
with regards to these languages and and
those key fundamentals some some of
things I just mentioned are are what
separates the junior programmers from
the real really talented good
programmers so there you go learn
multiple languages but first pick one
that's gonna be your mainstay your bread
and butter for a while until you get to
a level that's you be really competent
in that being said you're if you're in
the web app environment you're always
going to have to be working with
JavaScript at some point to some degree
so I'm not saying become an expert in
JavaScript but you're gonna have to
learn so let's say you decide your your
language is PHP for the sake of argument
you're gonna have to learn some
JavaScript because PHP and JavaScript go
hand-in-hand in many respects
um well javascript goes hand-in-hand
with all the server-side languages
because when it comes to browser
programming it's all about JavaScript
now now javascript recently you can do
some server programming like on the web
server with javascript but it's still
very much in its infancy and I want to
look at that if you're looking
server-side programming it'sit's the PDF
of PHP Java you know server base stuff
Ruby and Python I just burped there
sorry and that's it again I'm a big
advocate of learning PHP for all kinds
of reasons I got into before but just
remember 84% of sites give or take to
pay or you get your statistics run PHP
PHP is by far and away the most popular
server-side scripting language are out
there a programming language out there
and PHP is very serious language in the
last three to five years it's become
very serious it plays with the big boys
it has all the things that you want in a
very sophisticated language your two MVC
I should design patterns you've got your
own frameworks etc so it's it's it's a
good language to go with anyway but
they're all good Ruby and Python they do
some stuff that's very eloquent of it
you don't see in PHP built into the core
language does it make you that much more
productive probably not but it's kind of
cool and largely in my opinion in my
opinion you know outside of any specific
project needs because certain languages
may lend itself better to a certain
project that's where having knowledge of
different languages sort of comes in
handy barring that the differences
between one language and the other PHP
versus Java versus Ruby versus Python
it's largely a personal taste thing you
know what's better Burger King or
McDonald's for me there's a the equal
chance with both I'm gonna have to run
to the bathroom pretty quickly so you
decide that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
