style sheets now you see what I mean a
second so what we've done is look select
all when we've closed down here a little
bit now when we've created our three
heading rules right you know that I
didn't select any particular font for
them actually did we set the font
anywhere they didn't set the font
anywhere so let's actually do that let's
let's create a new rule and we're going
to re-define a tag and a select body
which is if you if you recall a body as
the root tag in terms of the visible
page and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to set the font to Georgia does it
apply if you notice the fonts have all
changed now so I'm going to go f12 where
you see that again if 12 and here we go
we have our page you knows now auto font
or in Georgia why because we've set that
this is the old font right we set the
CSS rule in the body and the body is the
outermost tag of the visible page right
bye-bye everything else that is seen in
the page by people by actual people
seeing your site is in between the body
tags so whatever rule that we apply to
body will affect everything else in here
so since we said in body we look over
here font family is Georgia we know that
every other element in between the body
tags will have a font family of Georgia
does that make sense because it's
underneath parts inside of body opening
body closing body I hope that makes
sense so that rule that CSS rule where
we stated that the font family should be
Georgia to anything in body of course
gets applied to anything inside of the
body
now what the Cascade also allows you to
do that allows you to override global
rules so let's say we created in this
case rather we've created this rule for
body where we said a font families
Georgia right but if we wanted to we
could say well okay font family is
Georgia except except for anything
inside of P tags and how do we do that
while we can do that by did we be
defined a P tag here let's check no we
can create a rule for P tags and we can
change the font so what's let's do that
right now you will see what happens so
again when i create a new rule redefine
a tag and we'll look for the P here P
for paragraph I'll ok so I want to do
here is I want to change the font in the
P tags tip to area and then let me try
that again area i'll hit apply so let's
say that and let's preview so as you can
see now this is ariel and this is
Georgia if you don't believe me let's
actually change that again let's go to
pee so I'm going to go to pee I'm going
to change the font family here i'm going
to change it to verdanna see how it's
changed again again this is the only one
to change not this not this particular
font here and to make to prove that to
just pay attention to fonts here as I
change it so now i'm going to change it
back to the Georgia font notice how this
is not changing at all right because I'm
only affecting the peas here so what
happens what you can learn from this
rather is that if you have a rule a CSS
rule that applies to a tag or a class
that wats an ID actually or even to an
ID whatever is closer to
tag if you will we'll have or override
the over-riding rule so the best way to
explain this is actually just illustrate
the example so we had a rule for body
saying that the font should be Georgia
for the page anything in between body
and body we should have a font of
Georgia right font Georgia but I also
had another rule that said anything
inside of a paragraph P tag selected
over here PHP tag bowls which mrs. to or
Donna anything inside a P tag should be
verdanna since the peas are closer to a
text right that means that this rule
this P tag rule over I'd the body rule
right so I hope that makes sense
the point of the Cascade in cascading
style sheets where it allows you to have
rules CSS rules override other CSS rules
this may be a hard one to understand but
to just think of it as a level of
command in this case the general the
General's orders do not override the
sergeant's order in the battlefield the
sergeant's orders will supersede will be
more important than the generals why
because the sergeant's talking to the
guy directly where's the generals a few
steps away one thing you want to take
away from this is that these rules is
cascading rules in cascading style
sheets in CSS they apply to any rule
that you can apply on a web page so it's
not just BOTS it could be background
colors it could be margins padding could
be anything so you have to understand
that cascade so you have to so you might
at one point set your on your body tag
since it's the uppermost tag it's the
outermost tag right you may say okay I'm
going to set my fonts to Georgia for the
page but then at some other point you
set your foster for Donna and a
paragraph and you're asking yourself
well why are my paragraphs were down
when I set the page font to Georgia what
you're going to know that because the P
is going to override the body rules
because the P is closer to is sitting
right beside the text that it's
affecting right this doesn't make sense
just play with it a little bit and I
think it will sink in overtime
the last thing I want to cover in this
video is the visual aids that you get
when in design mode so let me show you
by collapsing these first I want to
create a little bit of real estate for
us if you recall when I select it let's
say this damn you see how we had this
visual representation of the margin
right and we have all these lines and
the padding so we see what's going on
but sometimes especially when you get
really experience with this kind of
stuff it gets in the way and it's just a
new sense so what you can do is you can
go into view and you go to visual aids
and you can choose all kinds of
different things that you can decide to
hide and show the paying on what you
want to do so let's say I want to take
out box model so let's try to have pc
you don't see the outline now so let's
like go back here and I go to view
visual aids layout CSS layout outlines
so also we don't see the grid pattern
that we saw before right we see a closer
approximation to what we would actually
see on our web page I hope that makes
sense to you so let's let's turn them
back on just so that you get an idea
outlines now you see the outline right
right here the dashed outline we go view
visual aids box model so now when we
select a box we actually get our margin
representation here there are a lot of
other aspects in terms of the tool sets
that you haven't Dreamweaver and explore
a few more of them as we close out this
video course that said I want you to
understand that I'm not covering
everything that you can possibly do in
Dreamweaver this is a beginners course
designed to get you up and running and I
want you to understand the most
important things so that you can
actually put out pages but once you have
this basic knowledge you should be able
to a lot more easily explore all the
various tools that you have in
Dreamweaver and a final point with
regards to that like any other piece of
software depending on your
working style and depending on how you
like to do things you will probably end
up only using a fraction of the tools
that you find and remover or a lot of
things in Dreamweaver but I'm not
discussing and the reason I'm not
discussing them is because they're
things that I don't use my cell phone
often and I don't find them very
important I may have additional videos
at a later point if I get enough of a
demand but at this point I'm I wouldn't
be too concerned and I'm not don't be
too concerned rather but I'm not
covering all the drop-down list and all
and every single button because that
would put just about everybody to sleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
