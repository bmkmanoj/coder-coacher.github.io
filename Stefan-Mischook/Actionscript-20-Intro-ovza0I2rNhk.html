actionscript tutorial in this video
tutorial what we're going to be doing is
following up on some of the basics that
we looked at in our first flash tutorial
offered here at killer sites calm in
that first one we looked at the basics
of animation and how to work in within
the flash environment as well as setting
up a basic website however in this
particular version we're going to be
looking at ActionScript and how
ActionScript can make your flash files
infinitely more powerful we'll also be
looking at some of the fundamentals of
ActionScript but also taking the time to
address actionscript in a larger project
that project will be building a flash
website completely using ActionScript 2
point 0 let's address who exactly should
be looking at this video if you are new
to flash then you should purchase the
killer sites com flash basics tutorial
before you look at this one however if
you've covered some of the basics of
flash and now inches are interested in
learning a little bit about ActionScript
this is the video for you in this
beginner ActionScript video will be
addressing ActionScript 2 point 0 which
is primarily going to be used for those
of you who have versions of flash MX
2004 as well as flash 8 in the
subsequent versions of flash flash nine
ActionScript two point O will still be
available and applicable for those of
you that have earlier versions of flash
specifically flash MX or flash five I
will be addressing from time to time how
things were written in ActionScript one
point O and you'll find that a lot of
these tutorials will still be applicable
to your particular version of flash
however we are going to be addressing
two point O ActionScript as it's much
more sophisticated than its predecessor
to begin with let's address how to
access the action scripting window
within the flash environment so as I
mentioned if you've gone through the
basics of flash
know how to work within this environment
already however you'll notice that above
the properties window that you see here
you'll also see that there is certainly
some help files and the actions files
the actions are what we're going to be
specifically interested in and here is
an action scripting window notice that
you can undock this action scripting
window so that it can be moved around
you can make it as large or as small as
you would like in the actions window
you'll notice a couple of things first
and foremost you must have a file open
so I will close this and I'll create a
new flash file so here in this document
just titled untitled one will notice
that we have the timeline visible if I
wanted to apply a ActionScript onto this
timeline I can also go to the window
menu up here and I could say actions f9
and here we are now in the action
scripting window let's look first and
foremost at what happens when you write
something directly into flash you'll
notice that whatever words you are
writing are going to be written with
black text also there are keywords in
flash for example you'll notice that VAR
is something that flash identifies as
being part of the action scripting
language hence it turns blue as well
you'll notice that if you put things in
brackets excuse me in quotations as I've
just done that we have a color coding
for green that is for a string what
indicates these colors well if you
access the actions preferences right
over here by pressing this button let me
just make it a little smaller so you can
see the entire drop-down menu when I do
so you'll notice that there are a whole
bunch of information that we can add to
this some of the things that you should
always have is line numbers so you can
indicate what line your script is
actually written on this will be very
useful when it comes to debugging also
you'll notice that it's useful to word
wrap some of the text that's in here
that way it will
on to a second line and notice only when
I press return does it say line to hear
that's useful as well also you might
want to look at escape shortcut keys now
what our escape shortcut keys keys let
me open this up and I'll show you a
little bit more within the flash action
scripting window you'll notice that
there is a little open and close tab
right here and this will open and close
your action script tool box now by no
means are we expecting anybody to
memorize absolutely every single thing
that the flash action scripting language
can do or write but the good people at
Adobe have given us the action scripting
tool box to give us a hand so notice if
you've forgotten how to control your
timeline you can open up global
functions and say play and just by
double clicking it wherever your cursor
is the play will be written also I can
erase that and show you that you can
drag and drop a script in that fashion
you can also access the action scripting
window by adding the plus sign here
global functions timeline control I can
say play and there's my play written one
more time so that's all very useful also
at the bottom of this action scripting
window it'll tell you what the current
selection is saying it's the frame layer
one frame one another good thing to be
aware of is the fact that here layer 1
frame 1 is indicating where this script
is actually written that's very useful
because we don't want to inadvertently
put a script on a frame that we don't
want or on a graphic symbol like a movie
or button movie clip or button so this
is extremely useful for us and we should
get very used to seeing how that works
and how you can access that information
also notice that here it says pin active
script if you have something that's
written on this particular
frame as I'm showing you right now and
then you also had something that was on
the stage for example if I'm going to
make this a f8 convert it into a movie
clip or button symbol and then notice
here it's the symbol one I could access
this by pressing here and writing a
script on that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
