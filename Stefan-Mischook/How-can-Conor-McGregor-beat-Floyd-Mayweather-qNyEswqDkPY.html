think Conor McGregor can be Floyd
Mayweather chances are unlikely but
there's a chance and I'll tell you why
there's a chance because McCullen
McConnell gregor is a bigger man than
Floyd I think by to three inches perhaps
and if Connor can use that size
advantage to bully pull it around in a
ring so he has two strategies you can
implement the first one the obvious one
get in tight and just make it a brawl
don't try to box the ultimate boxer
which is Floyd Mayweather it's not going
to happen that's option one option two
is that Floyd Mayweather is a counter
puncher so is Conor McGregor Floyd
Mayweather may not have this good
footwork as Conor because kickers have
much range ear footwork they move much
more distance more quickly because
they're used to the kicking of age Floyd
is it
so what client could do potentially
because he's taller because he hits hard
and because he's range here meaning his
footwork should be much more mobile I
would be moving in with big stiff jabs
hammering him and getting the heck out
of range because Floyd is not used to a
kicker with the kickers footwork but has
an extreme range so that might be the
other option now I suggest that option
I was these two different strategies
because from what I remember Floyd had
problems if you had any problems with
people who had good jobs and my the
fighter comes to mind
dolia in the several round three was
using his jab he was doing really well
against Floyd I think he was beating him
and in my opinion if he would have just
used that jab Oscar would have just used
his jab against Floyd he would have beat
Floyd because Floyd's
style like this
it's not necessarily great it gets a
tall fighter soul aggregor's got that
height is that that that the footwork
that rangy footwork that kickers have
that boxers don't have typically so you
may be able to go in there pop off a
shot get the hell out of range and floyd
is not an attacker
so if Connor could be very very
conservative in terms of throwing that
punch hitting him and getting out of
range with Floyd can't really answer
back
you might win on points there we have to
see we'll see right away when they get
in a ring we'll see how the speed
translates we'll see how the footwork
translates but that's my thinking so
those those are the two keys I'll be
thinking of if I was Conor McGregor it's
probably going to be a boring fight
because they're both counter punchers
it's not in their nature to be
aggressive and go in there you'll see in
terms of Conor McGregor's power he's
used to fighting with very thin gloves
off the big gloves so the power doesn't
translate as well when you get the big
gloves who knows we'll find out soon
enough
but that's my take as an amateur but I
did martial arts for a long time and
I've been in the ring many many many
times many many times so I have some
perspective anyhow alright that's it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
