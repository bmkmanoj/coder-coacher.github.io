learn Java in 2018 so people who watch
my vlogs already know the answer to this
it really depends on two things number
one what type of programming you want to
do and number two if there are jobs and
opportunities in the area that you want
to work in Java you see what you find
with programming languages that the
demand is somewhat regional so in
certain areas Java will be popular in
certain other areas PHP will be popular
in certain other areas Ruby will be
popular which is nowhere Ruby is not
popular anymore I'm just joking to tick
off the Ruby people Ruby does have some
pockets here and there where it's
popular but that's fading new hipsters
are into JavaScript and e non hipsters
people just want to make a lot of money
aren't the PHP again I'm taking little
jabs at people for fun I am language
agnostic and you should be too one of my
main messages because it doesn't matter
the programming language you learn first
it doesn't matter all that matters that
you understand your core programming
concepts and you understand how to
execute how to write code in a clean way
and these are concepts and techniques
that are universal across all the
languages so let's get back to Java Java
is used mostly in legacy enterprise
application development which are going
to get it to him second and Android but
even with Android that might be fading
so let's talk about the enterprise
development enterprise just means very
large corporations big companies Java
was a new hot language back in the late
90s and all these corporations not all
the huge number of corporations big
companies adopted Java now because the
big companies got involved with Java
because Java was designed by committee
where all these huge companies like Jess
Sun and Microsoft and IBM
be EA and all these other companies got
in there all these big companies got in
there and they sort of tried to design
the language via consensus of academic
ivory tower nerds and huge corporations
Java became a huge mess a big pile and
became very unusable became super slow
to develop in and then you had a
rebellion of many Java people and they
they got out of there I think it was the
mid-2000s early 2000s and they went into
a lot of them went into Ruby and
elsewhere so what does this have to do
with Java in 2018 has to do where Java
is today Java is now something
relegated or I guess relegated to the
big enterprise now don't get me wrong
Java has been simplified to some extent
he got super complex and then Java
developers rebelled against the Java
intelligentsia and then it was
simplified largely through the spring of
framework rod Johnson he wrote a book
that was seminal that was very important
and he was called smarter lighter faster
Java something like that it's been a lot
of time a red book anyway in that book
he basically criticized mainstream
enterprise Java development said this
sucks and he came up with which is the
basis of the Spring Framework which
today I believe it is the most popular
Java framework it's the light and nimble
Java framework it's like the light and
nimble 18-wheeler so now I've been
talking about this and my cameras give
me a warning what's the warning the
warning says it's gonna be running out
or something soon I'm not sure what okay
so I'm gonna try and get to the point
yes Java is very viable but if you're
gonna get a Java job
you could be working for very large
corporations huge corporations you could
be working on projects that may last six
months a year two years in big teams
large corporations which means you're
probably gonna need a calm side degree
to get Java jobs you're not gonna use
Java to do small app development or web
apps for small and medium-sized
businesses PHP dominates that maybe a
bit of Python maybe a bit of Ruby PHP
Dom
it's that Java also used for Android
development as well again there's
another language out there called Kotlin
I think it is and Google just said okay
good on that one we're gonna use that
it's kind of like it's basically javis
answer to Swift for iOS so you had
Objective C for iOS which was heavy old
language Apple realize this they came up
with Swift great small dynamic language
kind of like Python but like Python and
other languages anyway
small nimble easy to program language
for iOS now Kotlin does the same thing
for android development
Google is basically gave the thumbs up
to it I imagine people who are doing
Android development are going to move
over to this new language away from Java
since it's faster easier lighter speed
ease of use always beats old legacy
languages that said it's probably plenty
of jobs right now in Android development
with Java but here's a thing for a lot
of app development in general they're
going to the web stack now versus native
languages why because a web stack has a
very performant 499th set of apps
they're being developed for smartphone
devices and if you develop native lead
iOS or in for Android and Java or a
Colin then you're gonna have to rewrite
the whole codebase again for for iPhone
right so you don't want to write two
code bases so what they do is they do
with html5 and the web stack and they
read it through a translation matrix and
it works really well and for 99% of apps
it's very performant especially you
consider how fast smartphones are
getting these days so I would look at
Java mainly for enterprise Java is used
in other areas in niche ways I think but
generally speaking you're looking Java
for enterprise in 2018 and some Android
development it's a great language to
learn nonetheless it's such an important
language it's going to be around for
years it used to be my favorite language
in the late 90s early 2000s and you
can't lose learning Java but understand
if what the work trajectory is in terms
of being a Java programmer versus say
being a ruby program or a PHP program or
a JavaScript program it is different and
you're probably going to need a cs3 Comp
Sci degree or some sort of technical
degree to be able to get a job working
for somebody writing Java code not our
intent but probably we'll need to add
whereas if you're doing PHP now you just
need to show you got the skills and
you're making money this is a different
thing everything is good
everything has its purpose everything
has its point it all depends on what you
want to do and what your jobs prospects
are in terms of your location don't
forget that I mentioned that earlier you
may be in a part of world where there's
no job it's worth you may be in a part
of the world where there's plenty of
Java work that I leave up to you to
determine all right my camera's still on
fantastic but I will let you go bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
