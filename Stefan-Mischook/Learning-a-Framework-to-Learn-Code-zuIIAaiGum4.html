California I'm visiting a friend of
Mines house in you know where's the call
again anyway so we're in Southern
California right near Hollywood somebody
asked me if they can go in to learning
how to write code by just jumping into a
framework and I'm assuming frameworks
like for instance peach peel Arabelle or
Python Django or baby whatever so the
quick answer to that is no you have to
at least learn your basics first you
have to learn the basics of the
languages first and once you have your
basics and that means variables
functions arrays data types object
orientation are just oriented
programming and once you've button these
simple things along that level then you
can jump into frameworks and by Jame to
framework the framework will allow you
to even increase your skills and
understanding of the basics even more so
I think about a framework like laravel
like Django is they show you a refined
structure so framework is just a library
of code if you will that's set up in a
particular structure that you can then
use to quickly build apps and the thing
about using a mature framework it's
going to save you a lot of time a lot of
headaches but it's also going to teach
you how to write clean code assuming
that you use a good frame look like
jingle or like a lair eval not all
frameworks do it in the same way in fact
some are very differ
you know there's all different somewhere
other but the good thing about learning
frameworks is that you will learn
different approaches but again you
shouldn't just jump into a framework
without having learned how to program at
first us for sure you have to least
learn the basics of the language but
fortunately to get asked you know basic
Python basic JavaScript basic PHP basic
Java server it's not that much work you
can get it done pretty quickly and then
you can start jumping into a framework
right after that so that's I think that
pretty much covers that I know how it is
you're when you're learning how to code
you really want to jump in and strike to
me practical things as quickly as
possible the thing is is that you'll get
tripped up a lot because if you don't
understand the basics of coding and you
don't understand the basics of
programming and the nuances of a
particular programming language study
framework is based on then you can run
into loop troubles and hiccups so it's
kind of good to go over it quickly get
it get your head wrapped around it and
then you're ready to go now
if you've come to my particular language
having program another in another
language you're gonna you know probably
if your programmer that's just so much
easier for me to learn any programming
language doesn't take me doesn't take me
long at all takes me a few days I'm up
and running because they're all very
very similar in many respects and that's
about it just quick update on the Python
course I updated I uploaded some new
stuff while I was here in California but
really I can't really record anything
new here so I'm going to be when I get
back starting this coming Monday you can
see a lot of pipeline videos starting to
hit the collection really really soon
I'm I'm getting ready to go big time bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
