killer sites calm again i recently did
did AV blog on how gaming principles and
gamification has been inserted into
online learning and we example of course
was our killer sites university i just
want to point to out fat the use of
games and the use of play to for
teaching purposes is actually something
that we've seen most since the beginning
of time i guess because you even see
that kind of behavior exhibited in
animals monkeys tigers and so on
leopards they play games the adolescents
the kids play games to learn adult
skills so it's kind of interesting that
it's taken so many years for us humans
to sort of figure this old technique and
well that's it this is just a quick
little video i just want to point that
out some of you may or may not know I I
actually studied psychology and
university and I remember I remember the
few classes i did on learning theory and
they talked about that it was
fascinating it was fascinating to me and
even if you watch nature shows you see
that a law you see you know like need
commentators a watch the lions cubs
learn how to hunt you know and they're
playing games to learn so kind of makes
sense that we adopt that that principle
that strategy of learning by introducing
gaming principles in online courses it
has somebody pointed out on my youtube
channel the term the proper terminal one
of the terms of people use is
gamification of of the learning process
it's pretty cool I'm not saying it's the
end all be all it's one of the tools
that you can use and it really depends
on the style in which you like to learn
although I think it should be injected
into just about everybody's learning
process what I mean by style
everybody's got their own way in which
they acquire information some of us
learn through visual stimulus some are
very responsive to things that they see
and some of us need to have things
explained rather it's very interesting
I've seen you know I've been studying
various subjects over the last couple
decades and I you know I used to teach a
lot of martial arts and I noticed in my
martial arts career but I would teach
some people you would teach something
and they would have to see the movement
perform for them to really understand
others needed to be explained in detail
the dynamics of the motion and while
others they actually had to feel it so
you have some people who are more
inclined towards grappling wrestling
jujitsu type of arts because they were
most keen aesthetic meaning they had to
feel to learn whereas others they were
more visually inclined so they were much
better at maybe being boxers or Thai
boxers or punchers kickers more distance
fighters so I know often a tangent and
doesn't you know it may not reflect
directly on web technology but I just
wanted to point this out that we all
learn in different ways depending on how
we are wired personally so it's
important to sort of experiment with
different methodologies as you go
through things you know in life really
and figure out which which system which
method works best for you anyway a
little bit of a tangent but I was
feeling like vblog ish today so there
you go ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
