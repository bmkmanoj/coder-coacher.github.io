video I'm going to show you how to
connect the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet
to your Mac what you do is you use the
cable the USB cable that comes with the
PlayBook and you just plug it into your
Mac and the Mac operating system your
computer will see it as a cd-rom and
sheet a little disc image on a desktop
now so it's pretty easy you don't have
to download anything from the web or
anything like that and from my
experience it worked quite seamlessly
and I'm using a brand new playbook it
just came out so you know the software
is actually pretty good to begin with I
didn't run into any troubles so here we
go I'm installing the software the only
thing that kind of weird I had to
restart my computer so I'm just going to
click the restart button of course on
the Mac air it takes about 15 seconds so
it's no big deal so when you restart it
software is installed you see that the
PlayBook is connected to the Mac and
it's seen as an external device so let's
take a look at the network settings on
the Mac and there it is the rim device
so what written when you plug in the
device with the PlayBook through your
USB the PlayBook gives itself a IP
address and this allows you to basically
move files back and forth from your Mac
to your PlayBook so it's it's pretty
easy pretty intuitive so here in a
finder you see you got the media folder
and the books and you know images and
downloads so on so you can view them
delete them and you can even upload a
new content of course just by dragging
and dropping into the into the PlayBook
so it's kind of cool
so unlike using an iPod where you have
more or less have to use well at least
as far as I know you have to use
QuickTime to interact with the iPod
although I think you may be able to get
around that the PlayBook basically works
more like a a big USB key where once you
plug it in it's just you can just move
files to and from the PlayBook like you
would move files from a USB key so here
are they're just gonna as a for sake of
demonstration I'm gonna just move an mp3
file to the playbook in its music
directory and just a simple
drag-and-drop and I'm gonna move this
little display here and there we go see
that's it simple as that I have to
uploaded a temp and mp3 and away you go
I know that they have syncing
capabilities whoops the BlackBerry
tablet I have not used it I just got
this literally a day ago and so so far
so good I just wanted to show Mac users
that actually works quite well with the
Mac already so I have no fear PlayBook
has advantages you know a place flash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
