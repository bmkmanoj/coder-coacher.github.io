screencast rather I want to talk about
flash and what may be in store for flash
going forward because of the recent
onslaught of iOS devices and talking
iPads and iPhones of course and of
course the new prominence of of html5
and css3 in the video embed tag and so
forth so yeah I'm Stephanie shook with
killer sites and i am here so anyway so
let's let's look at the couple big
issues i just have some notes here now
at this time flash does not look
terribly good going forward and this is
from a purely business perspective from
a practical point of view not from a
technological point of view are being
flash has a lot of things going for it
and it can still do a lot of stuff
that's pretty cool but i think a lot of
the uses found in flash namely video and
the interactivity in the pages that used
to be very difficult before are now made
very easy with javascript packages like
jquery and here's the relevant URL
although you can just google that of
course and soon to come or coming out
now rather is html5 and css3 which adds
a whole bunch of new capabilities into
the mix now so I believe Safari Chrome
and Firefox would imagine having checked
with the recent ones support these
technologies and I'm sure soon Internet
Explorer will too what's important is
that the big companies the big players
like Google are behind full force html5
and css3 and so is Apple which is huge
Apple in fact is killing flash if you've
probably heard
they're iOS devices because it doesn't
run very well on any mac-based operating
system iOS is really just a Mac based
operating system iOS is again the
operating system for iPhones and iPads
and these things are pretty dominant out
there so if you have a platform whether
it be windows or mac or iOS or something
if you have a platform where it does not
support a powerful platform rather that
has a significant market share and it
doesn't support particular technology on
the web experience in history teaches us
that that technology becomes
marginalized because nobody will want to
build websites that prevents a
significant number of people from seeing
the content say you know would you if
you had an online store would you build
it with flash if you knew that everybody
on iOS you know iPad users iphone users
and who knows who else weren't able to
shop on your store you wouldn't know you
wouldn't whereas jQuery html5 css3 these
things because they're all based on open
standards these technologies are going
to be for sure you're going to find
these things support across all the
devices whether it be laptops windows or
mac and whether it be Android phones or
iPhones so I'm a little worried about
flash in terms of the business
application so I was just taking that
into consideration if you're trying to
decide whether or not to jump into flash
I would advise at this time you know
from a financial point of view it's
better off you're better off to look at
jQuery html5 and css3 who knows what the
future will bring maybe Android which
does support flash will
sweep the earth and iOS will become a
thing of the past nobody will buy iPads
nobody by will buy iphones but i bet
even if iOS can hold ten twenty percent
of the market i have a feeling that
people are going to be shying away from
flash I would as a company owner I had a
choice between developing a certain type
of effect on a website using jquery and
html5 and css3 versus flash I probably
go with the layout of former jquery and
so on because i know that this is going
to be supported across the board it
within the next couple of years and I've
doing this particular screen cast in
what day is it its twenty eleven so or
mid-2011 so keep that in mind well
should I point out so if you don't know
about jQuery I will just go to jquery
com take a look at that we also have
training videos on that kind of stuff
not to sell you on it jquery right here
jquery is just a javascript package that
makes it really easy for you to create
all kinds of really cool special effects
that again previously you need a flash
to do this but these days you don't
another references i talked about a
little bit on my blog cure sites com
just do a search for android galaxy tab
and i talked about the effects of the
popular of these tablets and how they
are affecting the way web designers and
web programmers where they should focus
their attentions in terms of the
technology you see as a professional web
developer or web designer actually you
know it was just categorize you as our
us as web professionals what are the
most important things you got to do is
figure out where the technology is going
what the popular thing is if you stay
stuck in old technologies you're going
to find yourself
in a bad position probe potentially
financially you you're going to need to
adapt and get into the new stuff and in
fact if you can get into it at the right
time that usually means earlier rather
than later you could take advantage of
the growth in that technology so for
instance back in my day at one point
Java started gaining momentum and if you
got into jabber early on it was very
very lucrative financially as a
developer as a programmer whether it be
freelancer working for somebody else
whereas if you were stuck in an old
language like cobalt or something you
were you know or Phoebe visual basic you
would have harder a harder and harder
time finding work you know whether again
whether it be working for somebody or as
a contractor so it's always important to
look ahead to see where the trends are
and that way you can get a jump edge you
know jump on things and make the big
money while you can you see you know one
of my things be an entrepreneur for 20
years as well as a nerd developer and so
on I always pay attention to how the
technologies that are looking to how
they affect my ability to make a living
because ultimately that's you know I
think the majority of us though we may
enjoy what we do we're here to make
money otherwise you know i think a lot
of us would be being on their own would
go fishing or play video games or
something that's it i'm stefan miss
check i hope you found this video
somewhat useful and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
