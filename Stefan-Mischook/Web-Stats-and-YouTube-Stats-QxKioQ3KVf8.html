a few other things this is being
recorded on january for 2017 I don't go
over stats too often but I'm going to
because it could be educational for some
people all right so here we are on the
YouTube channel this YouTube channel was
this was established in 2008 I believe
now I just had one of my assistants
upload a bunch of videos and pretty much
forgot about it for a long time so as
you may or may not know I started
actively contributing to the channel
again myself this time with the vlogs
the tech blogs starting in July of 2016
so just about six months ago and we've
had some pretty good girl when I started
to head an average of thirty thousand
views a month now we're at a 109
thousand views important thing is the
watchman is quite a few Watchmen it's
335,000 watch minutes this is the last
28 days and my subscribers went up from
10,000 subscribers to seventeen thousand
subscribers and change was not bad not
bad in terms of a YouTube thing again
the youtube channel was more or less a
hobby for me it was also a way for me to
practice my delivery because i'm working
on brand new courses i figure the more
videos to do the better you're going to
be at doing videos which will mean less
edits less working post-production so
very habit and so as a result all the
youtube videos decide to get some new
equipment like this joby thing and the
new canon a TD which i showed you
earlier why I showed you this in any
another vlog great flogging camera
because of three things dual pixel focus
basically lightning fast stable focus
that's very important if you if you're
filming with a camera and you're looking
at the camera and you got nobody behind
the camera having that
that dual pixel super cool focus is huge
the ability to attach external
microphone huge and to have this flip
screen huge so you can see yourself when
you're shooting a video as I recorded
this particular video I've never
monetized my youtube channel oval
YouTube's at a should monetize your
channel and I think it might monetize it
now turn on the ads I think people are
used to ads because I got to pay for my
Joby right this is Costin money here so
i think i'm going to start monetizing
sometime this week I just been too lazy
to click on that button I don't know
what it is and no it's not laziness just
hesitated I don't like changing things
up too often so let's get into some more
stats so we see nice tats let's check
out while some of you may not know I
wrote a book in 2015 and web design
start here moderately well did
moderately well it still continued to
sell this is a type of book I wrote for
beginners and web design and it really
is one of these evergreen titles meaning
that i wrote it so that it would be good
for years to come what are reasons i'm
able to do this with a book nowadays and
technology is because when it comes to
html5 css3 javascript and web design in
general it's fairly stable now for the
last five or six years i would argue the
technology has finally hit that level of
stability this is what you see in all
businesses all business classes are all
business all industries there we go in
all industries you see a cycle of rapid
development rapid change when they first
start and as the business the industry
the business business and quotes in
terms of category as they mature the
rate of change diminishes quite a bit so
if you think about smart phones smart
phones are pretty static now in terms of
their capabilities like you think about
the last few generations it's just been
minor incremental improvements between
on 6 iphone 7 iphone 6s 6 or eccentric
cetera so that's not because Apple is
messing up or Google's messing up or so
forth it's that's because you its
natural in any business in any industry
business and quotes of me that you see
this leveling off in terms of the
innovation because you know the mountain
is only so high if you follow what I
mean anyhow so with this book here I
wrote it to be evergreen so even today
if you were to get it and I'm encourage
you i'm encouraging total beginners to
get it if they want to learn web design
i start off very broad and I circle in
so we're talking about stats here so we
go down I only have 15 reviews because I
didn't write the book to necessarily
sell a ton of books and well you can see
here amazon bestseller eggs see i'm
already up to number in 560 9555 so
there's only five hundred sixty 9555
books that sell better than mine another
thing if you look at the web design and
development books web design books i'm
only number 995 so I'm feeling pretty
good they're pretty good there so you
know all joking aside whatever it
actually so reasonably well as a tech
book but the thing I'm most proud of is
the reviews now none of these reviews or
my mother and these are just people i
don't know any of them i believe well
some of them have contacted me one or
two but anyhow you can see all five star
reviews quite happy about that because
let me tell you writing a book
especially when you have a bad back at
the time my back was killing me because
i wasn't doing good stretches you gotta
stretch if you're sitting all day in
your chair and your big nerd you got to
get up you got to stretch the legs you
gotta stretch do some exercise chin-ups
open up that back otherwise you're gonna
have tremendous problems so anyway so
this is some stats here so let's go into
some other stats so i run several sites
so what are these sites
I Rises killer sites calm and this is a
cycle established in 1996 for the
best-selling book probably of the 90s on
web design called creating killer
websites I did not write the book but I
took over editorial inherited the site
in two thousand i believe so for quite a
while and it's basically a vlog site I
have an old form and archive etc etc
because of my focus on studio web which
is my interactive training system that
lot of schools use colleges middle
schools private schools and so forth
because my focus on this I haven't been
really been focusing on killer sites so
I use killer sites to write my vlogs I
have my view tube videos here so on but
let's look at some stats because I know
you guys might find that interesting so
here are the stats for january 2016 now
in january 2016 at sixty-two thousand
unique visitors 150,000 13,000 distance
360,000 page has been viewed yes so if
you look at the entire year 4 2016 you
can see it here for for the whole year
over three quarter million people have
visited the site i had the unique
visitors i had over 1.4 million visits
and over four and a half million
pageviews on just killer sites i have
four other sites collectively the
forsytes put together killer sighs
Claire PHP however the website CSS
tutorial they get a lot more of course
but you can see every month I get a 360
370 thousand page views now this is
actually quite a bit less than it used
to be so let's go back now I only have
stats going back to 2010 on this server
because when I migrated a server into 10
to the dedicated systems I lost all my
previous data but let me go to 212 as an
example so you see in 212 the data was
much nicer we had 1.5 million page views
per month 1.45 15
1.5 you get the idea so this is where
the focus your focus in terms of your
work comes into play here because I
started started actually in 212 is what
most 211 I started working with on
stewed your web a focus started dropping
on killer site so you see over time the
page count 1.5 million 1.4 bc at the
beginning of the year of 212 at one
point five million pageviews 245,000
visits that month and at the end of the
air it dropped down to one point 184
million pageviews so quite a drop but
this was expected because of my efforts
were focused elsewhere nonetheless even
today in 2017 still very it's only a
fourth day in January ten thousand
unique visits in the fourth day it's not
bad we're going to we're going to be
doing probably the same type of data the
same type of numbers rather as they did
in 2060 anyways here's some stats for
you little curiosity everybody thinks
about social networks Facebook Instagram
etc stats they think about YouTube stats
there are websites and my killer sites
network of sites collectively the four
sites again well I think it's well over
a million pageviews per month still
killer sites itself gets only 398
400,000 pageviews per month but it's
still significant and I we're going to
be doing a lot more work on some updates
to the killer sites network of sites i
suppose but my main focus still is
youtube no studio web YouTube is still
my hobby but just a little FYI are
probably going to turn on monetization
because I want to pay for my Joby's very
important all right we'll talk soon bye
