California and a couple days on a
business trip and also a little a little
rest and relaxation I guess I'll be gone
for at least seven days i'm not sure i
may be able to show up some pre-recorded
laws and may be able to do some vlogs on
the road with my pixel smartphone if I
don't and you're watching is and you may
have not seen a lot of my videos that I
put out over the last four or five
months all very up-to-date and topical
and so if you're looking to watch some
content I encourage you to check my back
library going about six months well four
five six months back all very recent you
see that this YouTube channel has been
around since 2008 but a lot of the
videos or course videos that you are
really dated you know so stuff from 8-9
years ago may not you know be the most
relevant to you today who wants to watch
a dreamweaver cs5 course of course I
don't you might be using Dreamweaver cs5
for some reason I wouldn't today but
anyway so yeah if over the next seven
days you're looking for content and you
haven't watched a lot of my videos from
the last four or five months there's a
lot of material out there I've been
vlogging not every day but just about
every other day so there's a lot
material either look at and all of it is
about careers anchor and code so talks
about coding and the business of coding
all right that's it we'll talk soon ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
