sites calm in this quick little video i
want to teach you about something called
gears and how it applies to wordpress
so let's first go to the gear site now
gears basically is something that Google
put out it's a project that allows your
web browser to be much more powerful
it's something that Google put out
because they wanted to make it easier
for web programmers to create more
powerful program so that the web
applications a web application by the
way is a programmer runs within a web
browser something like WordPress so
allow web applications to interact with
the desktop more quickly so they can you
know drag and drop files store files
that kind of stuff you can store that
locally and of course when our most
important things and the whole subject
of this video it will allow you to run
JavaScript in the background much more
quickly so the boys at WordPress that
since version I think 2.83 they've
implemented gears meaning they've put
gears into WordPress they've used them
to speed up the admin UI of WordPress so
here I am at the killer PHP blog and
here is the WordPress 2.83 you can see
WordPress here is saying to me should
get the latest version 2.8 for which I
haven't done yet but anyway so we got
two point 83 what I want you to do I
want to go in in your dashboard you i
will just scroll down to tools menu now
i have it opened up so you can open it
up like this click on and when you get
to tools menu if you have gears
installed which I have in this browser
then you're going to see this turbo gear
status gears is installed on this
computer but it's not an able to use
with WordPress so you would click this
button and gears would be enabled with
WordPress so you know what's good years
here as I said gears is installed
see if I go to Safari now i'm using a
mac here but this works just as well on
a pc of course on Windows CE so here oh
yeah now Safari does not work with gears
because they haven't programmed gears
will work with Safari so we're out of
luck there but if you have Windows gears
will install so first thing you got to
do you got to go to gears google com and
install it if you if you don't have it
installed you see a button here that
will say install gears install it you
know it's safe because it's google and
once you have installed gears go to your
WordPress and I'm assuming that you have
WordPress 2.83 and up and you scroll
down to your tools menu and you click on
tools and you're going to get the screen
so what you just click enable gears and
this little pop-up will appear the
website below wants to store information
on your computer using gears we're
pressed our killer PHP calm so I'm going
to go yeah I trust the site allow you
see files are updating here so now
what's happening is gears is depositing
all these files onto your local computer
for this particular blog so let me
discuss that again you see if you have
multiple blogs like I do have of course
the killer size blog I had to go through
that process with the killer size blog I
had to install the WordPress gears file
so for every blog but you have if it's
on a different URL you're going to need
to just go into your tools menu and hit
the root of tools and you're going to
decide years
I recommend adding gears because what
essentially does it speeds up the admin
UI of WordPress so that's kind of cool
if you're especially if you're doing a
lot of blogging
I'm Steph miss check with killer sites
calm I hope you found this video
