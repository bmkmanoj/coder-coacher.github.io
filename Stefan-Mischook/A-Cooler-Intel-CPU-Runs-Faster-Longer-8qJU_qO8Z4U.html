in last few years intel has been working
towards not necessarily much faster cpus
but cooler running cpus meaning that
their temperature they don't get as hot
when they're running fast and what I
looked at that initially I just said to
myself okay that's for laptops I suppose
and it's also for less energy
consumption again for laptops as well
and I just thought of it as again a way
for them to be able to run the laptops
cooler save energy so the batteries and
laptops could last longer but upon
further investigation I discovered that
there is more to it than that so when it
comes down to is that when you have a
cooler running CPU the CPU can sustain
higher clock speeds meaning it could rev
up much longer much faster for longer
and it's kind of like a car engine if
you have a car engine as very is very
efficient you can push it in terms of
its RPM and it can Rev much higher much
longer without damaging the engine say
me with CPUs in a sense where the more
efficient and the cooler running
processors can sustain high gigahertz
serve them whatever megahertz or
whatever gigahertz I guess speeds so
when you have a processor that can you
know overclocked to three three
gigahertz for instance if it's cooler
running it can maintain that three
gigahertz overclocking for much longer
because it just stays cool because when
the super CBO gets hot the fans have to
come on which makes a laptops louder so
the fans come on and then if the fans
can't keep the CPU cool the processor
will down clock will start to slow
itself down go from three gary from
three gigahertz a two point nine point
eight point seven so forth so when I was
looking at the current crop of CPUs
coming out of Intel specifically I was
looking at the new macbook so 2016's at
2015 and there's a lot of disappointment
not just with the max with the new dells
and do Microsoft's and so forth they saw
about in terms of the artificial
benchmarks they run the laptops through
these benchmarks and they get these
scores as far as I can understand reason
you have very similar well not as far as
I can understand the reasoning a very
similar scores because intelligent
working not unnecessarily making the
chips faster in terms of the egrets what
they've been working on is making them
cooler and this cooling will have an
impact in terms of overall speed with
real-world application so does that mean
is that what's give you a scenario but
I'm looking at let's say you're doing
video editing and you're starting to
process the video the fourth generation
I think they're called Haswell chips
from Intel they clock at pretty much the
same speed as the sixth generation as
good I think it's skylake or whatever it
whatever the name is the sixth
generation intel cpu so even though
they're both going about whatever 2.5
gigahertz which is 2.4 for the older one
and are about the same speed what
happens is that the older generation
gets hotter faster so what happens it
gets hotter faster so as it's running if
maxed out it smacks down this max I was
getting hotter and hotter and hotter it
has to start slowing down because you
don't want to burn the chip so as it's
slowing down because it's getting hotter
and too hot and it's turned to down
clock the newer generation is staying
cool much longer so it's able to keep
performing so in the beginning to to the
older chip and the newer chip are going
about the same speed but as things
progress in terms of how long the chips
are running at high capacity the old
ships have to slow down but newer chips
don't so newer chips are staying how
highly perform it for much much longer
so this leads to what I was seeing in a
lot of these benchmarks with real-world
use of the 2016 Mac Pro which is used as
a much cooler running cpu than the 2015
models you saw that with the real world
benchmark you saw that the new chips are
actually running processing or resulting
in getting work done significantly
faster sometimes thirty forty fifty
percent faster sometimes twenty percent
faster but meanwhile in the synthetic
benchmark you saw about a lot of times
they were neck and neck or barely any
difference well that's because the
benchmarks refresh they weren't real
world use or they weren't reflecting
real world use in that the benchmarks
I'm guessing are running for short
periods of time so it doesn't give
doesn't give the two chips to
differentiate themselves in terms of
cooling so that's where the cooling is
actually much more important than I had
originally considered cooler chips will
in real-world use especially if you're
doing heavy work will result in far more
performant computers again this is in
the type of work that you do if you're
just running processors and so forth
excuse me spreadsheets and you're doing
reading reading articles you probably
won't see much of a difference at all
but if you're running video and you're
doing video editing or maybe you're
running heavy duty spreadsheets and
you're doing database works you're
writing V abs and you're really pushing
your CPU over a consistent period of
time then you'll see what the newer
generations of the Intel chips are going
to really come through in the fact that
they're they're much cooler and besides
the fact that they use less energy so
that you get Blatter stroke you get
longer battery life and so on so
somebody consider cooling of the chips
is actually very important for long-term
performance in your computers besides
the other advantages of you no longer
lasting batteries and so on all right
that's it I hope you found this useful
but I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
