webcam video vlog because i'm too lazy
to bring out the other camera I'm lying
there's a couple technical reasons so
there's a few things i'm going to cover
in this video number one let's talk
about this cool device now i'm heading
off on a business trip / vacation at the
end of the month i'm heading to southern
california and i didn't want to drag my
vlogging video camera with me on this
trip let me show you what that is for
bit curious this is the canyon 80d
mazing camera you get the flip screen so
i can see myself when I'm talking blah
blah blah but Mike etc but to carry this
on the plane and to lug this around when
I'm traveling is not exactly ideal I
could do it but I'm just don't want to
do it so I wanted to find an alternative
now I sold my old little camera my
little vlogging camera because I had
this and frankly it didn't really need
it except for the occasional trip oh I
bought myself a google pixel I was in
need of a new camera and this camera is
amazing it's right up there with the
Samsung s7 and the Google pic so I think
it a two best webcam excuse me two best
cameras on smartphones now the problem
of smartphone cameras is that they don't
work the best in low light situations
but if you have pretty good lighting
unless you really got a good eye to see
the difference between this video and
the video on that big camera you have to
be really picky I can get into more
details but it won't because I'm this is
not a products and camera of logging
chatham okay so i bought this rig here
let me take it off first of all so i
bought this thing here for my big camera
which you just showed you so I can put
on my desk and it's very flexible i can
use it to shoot videos in different
areas but i wanted something so i can
mount my phone
on there so but I could so what I get
video with this fall so this comes in I
get this attachment I slide it in being
buying now I can shoot video with this
selfie videos or looking talking etc etc
now cool with this about this thing is
that it's very flexible so it's a very
flexible stand so i can adjust this knob
move it all kinds of different positions
different angles like this you get the
ball head I can do it with this knob as
well different positions I agree with
this now as well different positions etc
etc etc etc so positions are good so
anyhow for logging but what I discovered
is that there's also a great tool for
watching video so if you're sitting on a
desk and you want to watch some video
imagine this is here you can adjust the
position the angle the height and these
are also very flexible if you're not
familiar with these you can bend these
legs and wrap them on things and so
imagine if if you had a waterproof phone
like the new Apple phone or the new
Samsung you could bring this into the
shower and wrap it on a pipe or
something or shower something some
aspect of your shower you could watch
video while while you are taking a
shower so that's pretty much it I just
wanted to show this particular device
this is joe be Jill be attachments it
ain't cheap but if you want to watch
video look at your camera look at your
phone while sitting down laying bed
without having to hold it like a sucker
is a pretty good device it is jobey with
the fluid head and then you got the
mouth here another Joey product that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
