I want to comment on one thing first add
a couple questions with regards to 00 p
ph p 0 p question there's two parts
number one when do you need to create
classes when do you know when you need
to use classes in your PHP code and
number two when do you know if the class
was a big enough i think it was so let
me just answer the first question if
you're writing 00 p PHP object oriented
PHP then you're always using classes you
see the basis of opie based systems is
in the class of classes are the basic
building blocks so you're always using
classes so how's the first questions
that good question is how big you should
make the classes essentially you should
try to make the classes as find grained
as possible what do we mean by fine
grain that means they should be very
subject specific so for instance if you
have a class that sends emails will say
it's called send mail and in there you
have a bunch of functions and variables
and so on that are related to the email
or mailing sending features in your
project so for instance maybe you're in
touch in your system not only do you
send emails but maybe you have a
internal messaging system so maybe you
have a send the messaging class in your
your CMS for instance some time to send
an email sometimes it's sending personal
messages or use the database or
something to send to other members in
the system so that's what your messaging
class will do and it should the Clyde
should be restricted to those the code
that's required to send out your
messages I would not include in there
for instance data validating methods
that's why we create another class and
probably have another class outside of
that i would call me the the validate or
in this class would have all kinds of
routines in there to validate user input
into their forms so you have a separate
class the validator class and you have
the messenger class and the messenger
class will be using functions from the
validator class what you do is you you
would inject this is validator class
into your message your class as if
always you can do that you do it through
inheritance your composition is better
also where you invoke this class inside
of your message your class to do stuff
anyway that's another thing so yeah when
you're creating classes in PHP or any
language you want to try to keep them
specific as possible it called they call
that fine grain so you don't want to
have a class that has all kinds of
things in there so you might have your
messenger class you don't have you don't
have functions there in their
functionality in there that does
something outside of messaging you know
I don't know you might have I don't know
maybe you thought you want maybe to
validating routines I wouldn't have them
in there I was separate validator why
because you know you're going to
validating routines and other you need
those other classes potentially so it's
good to just segregate them over into
its own particular class I hope that
answers the questions about you the ol p
questions at the user had I'm staff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
