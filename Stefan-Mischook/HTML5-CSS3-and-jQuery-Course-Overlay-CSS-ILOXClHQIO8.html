to implement the CSS to make this start
working now if you remember in the last
video we set up our first three triggers
or thumbnails but we still had all the
overlays still being displayed so we
want to go about correcting this and the
way we can do that is to now implement
some CSS just to remind you though it
was so easy for us to just implement a
couple of lines of code to make the
overlay work with jquery tools it's
really quite simple so you got all that
in place now let's take some time to
actually create the CSS to make this
thing look the way it's supposed to all
right first thing we need to do and
you're going to really be surprised at
how much of this particular effect is
controlled with CSS there's really a lot
going on in here so first thing I would
instruct you to do is to create a new
file and I'm just going to create a new
CSS file and here it is let's save the
file before we even write anything on it
and I'm going to ask you to go to your
progress and you'll see in the CSS
there's only two right we don't actually
are not really concerned with the
slideshow CSS because that dealt with
the slide tabs but here I want you to
just give it the name overlay basic CSS
so let's save that all right now inside
of our HTML page the overlay HTML page
let's copy this link reference to our
existing CSS you'll notice that the one
that was being used for the slide tabs
was taken away when I prepared this for
you and now I want you to just come in
here and write in overlay dash basics so
overlay dash basics dot CSS that's
perfectly fine and we're good to go with
this information alright so now whatever
we do inside here is going to be applied
inside of our over
effect okay so let's just familiarize
ourselves with the names of the classes
that we were working with remember that
the thumbnails are called triggers we'll
deal with that last but the first thing
I want to deal with is the overlay
information so the overlays themselves
the main container has a class called
simple overlay and these IDs are related
to the relative attribute here called
frog one ID frog one and if you remember
that's all related to this little line
of script which sets look any image
based on its rel attribute set that into
an overlay so that's what we're doing
here all right so what we want to first
and foremost be addressing is this
simple overlay class so you can copy
that if you want to you don't really
need to but here is our overlay basics
dot CSS so the first thing I want to
really be addressing and here I'll just
put in a simple comment first just to
make this a little easier we'll say the
overlaid element all right so with that
information ready and ready to go I'm
just going to put a dot before my simple
overlay tag so I'll come in here we can
close that as well but within this
information actually let me just close
it this way there is a couple of things
that I want to do so first of all let's
put in just some comments to help us
work with this and you know have us
understand exactly what's happening so
the first comment i'm going to say must
be initially hidden
and if you remember the reason why we
want to do this is so that when we first
come to that page we don't want to see
those overlays inside of the article
that's where they are but we want to
hide them and only have them become
visible when the thumbnails are clicked
so the first thing we need to do is to
just say display and we'll give it a
value of none pretty simple not really
any kind of problem actually if we save
this just to get into what exactly is
going on aha look at that so we've got
our three thumbnails here but all of a
sudden all of those overlaid sort of
elements with the larger pictures and
the texts are gone beautiful okay that's
exactly what we needed now we're going
to implement some other information when
we do in fact bring those things up
we've got to make sure that they are
always going to be on top of all the
other elements so I'm just going to put
in another comment here that says place
overlay on top of other elements okay so
in order to do that we're going to work
with zed-index and the zed-index while
you can make it whatever you want but
just to make it you know pretty clear
that it's going to be on top let's give
it a value something ridiculous like
10,000 all right so now that that's done
as you'll see if we were to let's save
this first and then if we were to
preview this in our browser I click on
one of these hey look at that the
overlay is on top of everything else
cool we still need to address a couple
of things like working with those
shadows and getting this information to
appear on the side here so let's
continue in that vein in order to style
this properly we are going to include
now
small little comment here that just says
styling so let's see what we can do with
the styling of this element and what I'm
going to just create first and foremost
is a background color so this background
color well let's just give it a let's
see 333 is what I'm using for the dark
area behind everything in other words
the background so we could just as well
use that a couple of other things I mean
certainly you could save this as you go
along and you can see now that if we
were to open this up there you go got
this box and its position there with a
background color but we have elements
like killer frog not really showing up
and our text not really showing up and
it's also too big so how do we get
around this well we're going to come
back here and first of all let's address
the width so within the styling area I'm
just going to say width and that width
let's set it to 675 PX pixels along with
that you can also give it a min height
now what's min height actually mean well
you know if by any chance there's not an
image available we're going to say you
know specify that it has a minimum
height of 200 PX 200 pixels with that as
well I'm going to give it a simple
little border just so you could see it a
little bit better and that border I'm
going to come in here and we'll just
give all the declarations in one so
we'll say 1p x 1 pixel border that is
solid and I'm just going to give it
triple six for the visual amount and
again we could also save this and come
in here and preview that in Safari and
check it out so all of a sudden now you
got a border around it as you can see
that's that thin little line but we also
want to now be moving
the details information over here and we
also need to implement the closing
button long other things but just right
now isn't that super isn't that
fantastic really easy to implement and
really easy to manipulate all right the
last thing that I do want to address
before we move on to another class is
css3 styling and for latest browsers
okay and what kind of css3 styling do we
want well here I'm going to be
addressing the drop shadow effect now
you could do this as well without the
css3 styling but then you would need to
be working with you know transparent
graphics and stuff like this and I'm
trying to give you the most simplest way
of doing this the most future forward
method so in here I'm just going to say
Moz box-shadow and let's give it a value
of zero you don't need the pixels when
you're saying 00 again this is for the X
and the horizontal vertical shadow
amount I'm going to give it a 90px blur
and for mozilla we could also say like a
5px spread but we don't really need all
that information but I'm just including
it here for now along with this and I'm
going to just copy this information for
a second i'm also going to be addressing
the WebKit box shadow and in here the
only thing i'm going to change is I
don't really need to address the spread
so I'm just going to leave it like that
so if we save this and we preview this
in Safari now well you could see a
couple of things well first of all you
can notice that there is a drop shadow
and I'm in Safari so that's why I'm
seeing this it's a webkit browser
so that's working really well so let's
come back in the next video and I'm
going to show you how to implement the
close buttons and also what we can do
with the triggers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
