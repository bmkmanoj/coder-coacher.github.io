event handlers I of course assumed
you've done the previous video so what
we're gonna do now is actually I just
want to demonstrate something you notice
how I was able to use this JavaScript
here inside the event handler now watch
what happens so that you understand it's
gonna copy this JavaScript I'm just
going to put it up here in the middle of
the page willy-nilly so that it just
seems so as you see what's happening a
few firefox ones update i'm gonna say
don't bother me I'm teaching from
teaching the people here I'm just gonna
hit refresh you notice that our first
script work I do in a mouse-over but you
know sir I see a code here watch this
city code now the reason this code is
showing up here just being printed page
as normal text whereas over here it's
actually I'm being fired off as
JavaScript well first of all well let's
look at the source code in those p
onmouseover it's gonna be in the source
code
huge page source right you see it right
I don't know source code it is these um
these these mouse overs are really get
on my nerves let me just change that to
one quick so it doesn't keep doing now
you know as I was able to do on click
with a lowercase C and it worked and a
capital C and also there we go thank you
C capital C worked fine too in
JavaScript they there's a convention
where they like to name function names
and event handlers and solve on with
this camelcase method here this is
called camel case cuz it's in between
each word the next word has a capital on
click that's camel case like a hump
right this is no cat no hump here
capital C makes it look like a how on
click I mention this because later on
when we're getting deeper into
JavaScript
in certain parts of JavaScript its case
sensitive
it may not respond to this where it's
actually looking for this if that makes
any sense anyway just understand this is
camelcase
understand how this has to be you know
for just to run it has to be within
script tags so just be totally clear
script language let's say JavaScript and
it pulls it off you see how truly fur
makes it easy for us now watch what
happens you're gonna see how the on get
this alert I'm just gonna go automatic
this alert gets fired off no matter what
because it's not in any event handler
it's not in a function we looked at
focus briefly this just gets auto fired
so let's just hold this up refresh see
automatic alert where is this other
event that don't click on me one where
after clicking I'm gonna click now I'm
clicking see how do you collect me so
you see how event handlers in a way
allows you to control when a particular
piece of JavaScript actually happens
does that make sense
one global concept you want to take away
from our study of event handlers is that
essentially they are a mechanism that's
built into JavaScript where you can have
the web browser scan for events so you
can say here let's now scan for any
clicks are one memo we did mouse over
let's now scan for any time two mouse
actually passes over this paragraph so
this is like a built-in mechanism in
JavaScript sort of a free tool that you
have access to and I say free tool
because in other languages you would
have to manually build in your own event
handlers and it's pretty tedious so
javascript does this for free for us
it's kind of cool
and we have access to a whole bunch of
event handlers that we saw the list
before
so this is just a short list of some of
them well I think this is all of them
and so well no it's not all of them this
is all of them that could be applied to
the paragraph right
Dreamweavers just making this easy for
us let me just point out that you don't
need to ream Weaver to do this you don't
you could just write this all out
manually so if you're using a text
editor like notepad or something don't
worry just type it out and everything's
cool by the way if you're watching this
I would pause the video now and type out
this line of code that you see here and
test it out play with it once you get it
working break it see what happens when
it breaks and this will go a long way to
helping you learn how to code let me
just nail that
body tag and look at event handlers on
the body k so you're on
so you notice our event handler list is
different on blurred error focus unload
on those on page load on resize when the
page resizes on unload etc so you see
that the list of event handlers really
depends on the particular element that
you're applying the event handler to
that all said on the body typically
you're going to use the onload
when you programming you have to
understand the whole process is bug
prone bug filled even when you really
know what you're doing you're always
going to be coming across situations
where it doesn't work their first five
times and you got to figure out why and
this is normal Harford of course people
with 20 years experience still run into
problems I've been programming for many
many many years now and you know what
can you do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
