address a little bit about the fonts and
trying to get them to look a little bit
more interesting at this point what I
want to be showing you is how we can
actually insert elements inside of our
code so that we've added extra div
information all right so what do I mean
by this well essentially we want to take
our existing layout and we want to split
it into multiple areas so in other words
my main section looks like it's one
column of information and we want to
sort of stagger that so that we have
potentially two columns inside of there
as well let's address a couple of things
first and foremost we know that the area
inside of the main section right let's
go back to our CSS for a second and
we'll see what's going on with this we
know that the main section aside from
that one pixel border that we have in
there is 759 plus the one pixel border
so that gives us an area of 800 that we
can work with inside of the main area so
what if we wanted to split that into so
in other words have the main area still
have the same information that we did
before but the only difference being is
that we're going to split that main area
into two columns as well so that we have
a different sort of outlook and a
different sort of layout inside of this
what we're going to be doing is
addressing some custom classes and these
custom classes are going to help us
because eventually I want to add some
extra divs down in the footer area as
well so let's go into our code and first
and foremost we're going to go into the
main section and let's scroll all the
way down to the bottom and you can see I
look there's some main text and it says
ends main here and that's wonderful the
only difference though is before the
main area ends so you'll notice I'm just
creating a separation here leave this
div that says ends main separate from
the rest of the elements and what we're
going to do is to add you know a small
paragraph and some other information in
here as well so we'll start
by introducing a div don't worry about
the classes just yet because we're going
to add one soon enough so within this
sort of nested div that I'm creating
we're also going to have well actually
let's create something like a h3 in here
as well and I'm going to say nested left
div for my h3 will put in a little
paragraph of information so I'm just
going to borrow some of the text that
I've got in here doesn't have to be a
ton of texts you know just a couple of
lines nothing too crazy and I'm going to
paste that in there and we're going to
close this paragraph as well as closing
this div so notice I mean it's not
really necessary but I'm going to put in
an HTML comment in here that says ends
nested left div okay and right after
that I'm going to ask you to copy the
entire information that we just put in
and let's also now introduce another div
that says nested right div and we'll see
how that's going to work alright so with
this information in place we're going to
now take a look at our work so if I save
this and we just preview that in our
browser again and we refresh this you'll
see well nothing's really changed it
kind of looks the same that's the left
of nested right dip well what's
different nothing everything is exactly
the same and it just goes to show that
yeah you know you could just add more
information I didn't necessarily need to
put those in divs if they were just
going to look the same as the other one
so I could have just made them h3s in
paragraphs and that would have been fine
but on the other hand what we will be
doing instead now is to make these divs
appear right next to each other left and
right so as I mentioned we got about 800
space to work with here but do remember
on the left hand side there's that 11
pixel that's being used in there so I
think what I'll do is I'll make the one
on the Left actually be a little bit
smaller than the one on the right so
let's go into our CSS what we're going
to be doing here is a belief I'll still
address some of these in some of these
elements inside the main area just
simply because we are going to be
dealing with main information first and
then we'll create a separate one for the
for the divs that are going to be down
at the bottom inside of the footer so
first and foremost i'm going to say look
inside main anything that has a class
called well let's say left and notice
I'm not spelling it left i'm just saying
lft float okay so we'll do that and
we'll open and close this and as we
separate it what we're going to be doing
at this particular moment is just that
we're going to specify a width for this
so I'm going to say look the width for
this is going to be well we want to
split it in half right so instead of 400
400 because we got that one pixel
remember i'm going to say 399 on the
left with our pixel information there
and finally we're also going to float
this thing on the left hand side as well
so I'll just float that left and we'll
do this now I'm going to copy this
information and we'll just paste it
underneath and this time i'm going to
say r ght right float actually let's
spell this correctly it doesn't really
matter so left float right float so it's
a class called left float in class
called right float the only thing about
the difference for the right one is yes
it's going to be four hundred and of
course we're going to be floating this
on the right hand side so let's save
this let's also go back to our code and
remember we have these divs but there's
nothing going on with them so i'm just
going to insert the information for
class and you can see I really only have
two classes left float and ride floats
so I'm just going to use left float for
the first one and then we'll have a
class of right float on this one so if
we save this now let me go back into our
work and remember this is what it looked
like originally and if we come in here
hmm you can see that we've got a little
bit of information issue happening in
here seems like it's off by maybe one
pixel between my left div am i right div
so there could be some more information
that we needed to address and I might
just be missing something so even if we
were to keep this one let's say 399 and
if I save that and see if that extra one
pixel made a difference doesn't seem to
be so perhaps what I'll do is think
about really making this a little bit
more I'll try like 390 and let's just
keep this at 400 for the moment and if I
were save this and we come back in here
you can see that's it's working but it's
not really quite there yet we could give
us a background color just to see what
the elements are it's generally speaking
a better idea for you to be doing this
all on paper and getting it matched out
first I'm kind of eyeballing things here
and as you can see it's showing me that
you know perhaps I'm not taking into
account the fact that there are some
elements inside here that are larger
than others because we've got you know
20 extra pixels of information so it
looks like I've got a genuine issue here
with a good amount of information so
perhaps both of these could be set to
390 and if they are and we save this you
see we're getting there but it's not
quite there just yet so perhaps what
I'll do is say listen 383 80 if we save
this and we come back here you can see
now that looks a little bit better but
you know if I were to give a different
background color to float right we can
see we're probably going to be just a
little bit off
and I'm just going to take a another one
here which is just a little bit lighter
so if I save that and we come in here
you can see that oh look it's just one
pixel right so let's get that one pixel
out of this area remember I had to
consider that we had some extra 20
pixels of space on either side of this
information so it wasn't really four
hundred we're really dealing with the
extra 20s as well but we do have that
one pixel because of the border on the
left so instead of 380 on the left i
think i'm going to say 379 and we'll
save this and let's take a look voila
now you've got something that fits just
perfectly right next to each other
because we've taken a little bit more
time calculating exactly the size that
we need and we can you know keep that in
mind and make sure that it's all ready
to go if you like the fact that these
things are colored you can even keep
them color there's really nothing wrong
with that but if you wanted to sort of
keep things consistent and remove those
colors that's really not a problem i
just have them in place so that I could
you know take a look and see where my
positioning was but if we save this now
and we come back in here you can see
that check it out even without those
elements that we had before we still see
a good amount of gutter space in between
our elements in here which is just
wonderful exactly what I wanted and we
can also split up this nested area into
not just one column of text as we see
here but actually two columns of text as
we see right there so that's a really
wonderful way for us to sort of break up
the monotony of this basic section and
it also allows us to you know keep
things a little bit more interesting
from a visual perspective but the last
thing i want to show you before we move
on is that even though we've separated
these two areas in two separate columns
nested left and right dibs if i wanted
to i could have another h3 and paragraph
directly underneath it and it's really
easy as you can see in just a second i'm
just going to go into remember we have
ends main right over here so you know if
you don't have the separation there
already just put in a separation and
you'll notice before our floating left
and right divs we're in place we had a
h3 another sub headline and an open
closed paragraph I'm going to copy that
information and let's come in here and
let's just paste in that information yet
again there it is and then we close our
main div so I'm going to save that and
now if we preview in our browser so
remember we just have the left and right
but if i refresh that aha now we've got
one that spans the entire column so
really nice job just setting up some
basic information how to work with
nested divs and how to separate those
why don't we come back in the next video
and I'm going to show you how we can
also set up a bunch of divs down in our
footer so that we can create a number of
multiple columns in here more than the
two and three that we've seen so far
let's just create maybe four columns
down at the bottom alright so come back
and we'll do that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
