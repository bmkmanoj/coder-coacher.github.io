my little webcam here because I'm just
just a lot easier so in this particular
vlog I just want to talk about the new
macbook pro and the rumors of the
macbook pro this is something that's
long overdue they're really they being
Apple they're really falling behind in
terms of their hardware their computer
hardware you know Mac I think it's only
responsible for fifteen to twenty
percent of the revenue so i guess you
can understand how they are not super
keen on updating that versus the iphone
which is about 50 plus percent of their
revenue nonetheless it's kind of
disappointing that they have not been
keeping up with the rest of the
community if you look at the latest
Windows machines there in terms of their
guts in terms of the CPU and I think the
hard drive as well they're one to two
generations ahead of the latest mac
hardware which is kind of a shame
another thing that's kind of you know
lame is that if you look at the sum of
these not some all of these latest
Windows machines out there I have the
surface pro 4 which is the tablet /
computer hybrid that Microsoft put out
and it's really innovative in terms of
its form factor the surface pro 4 and
its really innovative in terms of its
use it's a it's a tablet and it's a
computer and it works very well overall
don't get me wrong or things about
Windows I go like Windows feels like a
much more modern operating system than
mac OS today but it still has its quirks
every now and then that said I've had it
for many months now my my surface pro 4
from Microsoft and I'm been using
Windows 10 since it's pretty much
launched and I've had one hard reboot
requirement in the last like five months
that's pretty much it other than that
sometimes once in a while it gets a
little wonky once in a while for some
reason the touchscreen just doesn't
respond well and then you just put you
put the use acoustic
on the keyboard because it t keyboards
optionally you can just pop it on put it
on and it also don't works fine so it's
kind of those little quirks that really
just get on your nerves after a while
and it's funny you know windows is
always updating itself so you may have
liked for two months the touch screen at
one point to touch me was a dream it was
a dream was working perfectly as like no
prob now it's like you never know you
know what's going to happen so that's
the problem windows it it has some
really cool capabilities but in typical
windows fashion it's flakies a little
bit flaky although not painful not
painfully flake me like the previous
versions of Windows but nonetheless with
Mac alas it seems like a much more solid
OS but it's getting a little long in the
tooth it's hard to describe if you use
mac OS vs windows 10 and use them new
compare them side-by-side you start to
see what I mean you would anyway sir to
see how OS 10 is looking kind of old and
their hardware is old and so we are all
waiting we people people own macs as
well i own mac and i do windows i do
both because for my work it's good to
have both and did you know the rumors
coming out is that they're going to do
some interesting things with the new
macbook pro which could be out in
September could be out in October who
knows all rumors right now and what are
the rumors is but it's going to have
kind of like a LCD built into the top of
the keyboard so that you can have
dynamic keys would be like a touch
screen there it's kind of weird that
apple doesn't want to put touch screens
on their main laptops when everybody's
doing it and you may be saying to
yourself why who needs a touch screen on
a laptop and I have to tell you I would
have thought that too until you have one
and I may only use a ten percent at a
time but it's just kind of convenient
sometimes you go to reach up to your
screen and go and move things around
like that just move a window doc a
window start a nap it's sometimes just
much more convenient than using the
mouse and or keyboard shortcuts and
whatnot so anyway so what I'm going to
do now is I'm going to pop into a
screencast
where we're going to look at an article
I found where they have some come
conceptual images of what the new
macbook pro is going to look like
essentially at the top it's going to
have an LCD screen they're going to go
us bc which new connector type and it's
going to be thinner faster and so on who
knows but that's it i have a four year
old macbook pro retina still working
pretty good but it's starting to get a
little long in the tooth editing video
can start the chug especially if it's
raw warm in room but it's still great
computer the battery needs to be
replaced so i have to basically keep it
on the charge all the time and I don't
feel like replacing the battery because
then it cost me about 200-250 dollars up
here in Canada and so I'm waiting for
the new macbook pros will come out I'm
going to upgrade and then I'm going to
job you know I'll sell the old macbook
that's it that's the one advantage about
the max by the way whether it be iPhone
or max there's a high resale value so
even though my back book pros for years
old and needs a new battery it is likely
I'll be able to get eight nine hundred
dollars for it because it's not beaten
up I keep good care of my machines and
it's worth it to a lot of people instead
of spending two and a half thousand
bucks on the equivalent macbook pro
today or 2000 they'll spend 800 900 with
me and they'll save a lot of money so
it's keep that in mind so when you're
pricing out iphones when you're pricing
out Mac computers macbooks and so on
consider that you do have a high resale
value so you can recoup at least some of
your money and not insignificant either
like i said i have a four year old and
i'm pretty sure i get sell fairly easily
for an eight nine hundred even a
thousand dollars alright that's it ciao
so here we are at this pace magazine I
just did a quick google search and this
came up and the five rumors of the
macbook pro if these five rumors are
true it will be amazing his rumor so
here's a screenshot that that LCD screen
at the top two keyboards so this could
you know depending on your app that you
launched a different view can be put
here so you could put your music player
or maybe
you photoshop they may have customizable
photoshop keys here here's another view
this is again this is not the real thing
this is a conceptual view and it's a gas
because they're looking at the new that
other laptop at the Apple put out here
you see this LCD strip that'd be kind of
cool I would like a touch screen here
but whatever and it's just going to be
thinner faster here it is again of you
again so it's going to be thinner faster
using modern processors yada yada yada
yada so should be good hopefully better
cooling new Intel chips and again these
are just conceptual renderings and given
what mac has done with their latest
laptop is that little mini thing that
they came out with this is probably a
pretty good guess what the pros would
look like and I would buy one I would
definitely buy one especially if they're
up to date with all respect specs
another thing they're looking at doing
is putting a finger or thumb sensor a
fingerprint sensor so you can log-in
just by putting your fingerprint on
something I don't know where you put it
but i'm sure you'd put it somewhere
microsoft has an interesting thing they
have a pretty advanced camera so it can
unlock my Windows 10 device using facial
recognition and it works in a split
second and it's at first it was a little
shaky like eight months or whatever it
was when I got it but now works really
well so so finger recognition kind of
cool instead of typing in a password as
opposed it's a mild convenience for me
it's just having a smoother thinner
faster system because I have to work
with mac would be something I would
appreciate so these are again these are
not the real thing these are renderings
that people have come up with nerd spend
their time doing this and I think it's
probably an accurate to fairly accurate
representation in terms of what the new
back pearls are going to look like and
there you have it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
