here at event handlers by popping up I'm
just going to grab this just to make our
lives a little easier or cut and paste
some code in just to demonstrate
something all right so what we have here
is a paragraph I got the mouse over now
I just they take care of this style
stuff first in my first video when i
introduced the course i mentioned that
learning javascript will make you a
little bit more knowledgeable about
basic HTML and web design and here's an
example how little JavaScript will make
certain things obvious that may have not
been obvious to you so for instance so
this we have an alert on a mouse over
solve I mouse over here I get to you
learn right over this paragraph now
watch this I'm going to Mouse alloy over
here and it still pops open right away
over here strange you know you got your
you got your your text here and it stops
here but you know I mouse here so what
we learn by that is that I is that a
paragraph right this basic paragraph and
no style information as far as the web
browser is concerned extends page and to
n right that makes sense right but now
becomes painfully obvious stop so if we
go here now I'm just going to reapply it
that style information I'm setting the
width giving it a border he had a yada
yada so we can see it so here we go
here's our border so now we can navigate
around to see it it's evil mouse over
here no problem see how much watch
there's like bull ding ding there you go
so you can see how the on click our
mouse over any event handler really is
very precise down to the pixel if you
need to be so you can see how people can
use this to create games
a mouse over here and have something
appear down here we'll get into that
kind of stuff a little later on
so let me check my notes now that we
have a look at event handlers we can
look over to basic notes and I think
they'll make much more sense to you so
here we go event handlers are built-in
mechanisms of basically scan for events
or actions to happen so we applied on
node here so basically told JavaScript
that we should scan for this when this
page loads we want to do this you know
and we told it here when somebody clicks
on this paragraph do this by applying
the event handler we are essentially
sending a command to the JavaScript
engine to start scanning for a click on
this paragraph and on the body when the
body loads so it's pretty cool so you
can think of them as little sentinels or
little guard post or little guards check
it out for things particular actions
that you want to catch and this in fact
then Enys actions are defined by the
event handler you choose to apply to the
particular element I hope that makes
sense one more time event handlers are
built-in mechanisms that basically scan
for events actions to happen for example
when somebody clicks on the mouse on a
piece of text that's on click when
someone moves the mouse over an image
that's on mouse over when a page is
loaded into the web browser on load one
point if it's not already obvious event
handler names example on click are
examples of keywords in the JavaScript
language
in our next video we're going to
actually get into even more practical
JavaScript what I suggest that you do
now is some some paragraphs maybe some
images apply some event handlers two of
them on mouseover on click etc and just
pop up a bunch of alert boxes and just
play around with it the more you write
code easier it gets you say you have to
develop those new JavaScript coding eyes
so that the code looks less and less
like gibberish to you and more and more
like any other language well whatever
