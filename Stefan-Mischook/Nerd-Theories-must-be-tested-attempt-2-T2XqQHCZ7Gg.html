response to his log that I just put out
yesterday and the vlog was titled beware
academic nerd and people got the wrong
impression so I took it down and because
I didn't want to deal with having to
answer angry angry responses from people
in the comments section so I figured I
would just take it down and we try to
express my ideas my ideas a little bit
more clearly so the point of the vlog
the point of videos to say that a lot of
times when you know final two
percentages but a significant number of
times when ideas come out of dropping
tanks come out of whether the think
tanks or whether the research is
conceived of within private industry or
within public schools or from academic
institutions where other these new ideas
these theoretical ideas come from you
have to be be wary of to be careful
about implementing these ideas in the
real world now this is not some
revelation everybody knows who has
experience in the industry and so forth
that this is the way it goes and I just
wanted to I was expressing this because
in a vlog before that I was talking
about how there's been in an injection
of what I would consider to be over
complexity into the development process
and I had seen this in the past so the
previous vlog I cited a couple examples
of where technologies were developed in
the web development space and they
flopped until eventually it was the
community of developers who developed
the final and workable specification so
that said I am never suggesting that
academic pursuits are
our garbage has couldn't be further from
the truth academic experimentation was
it being technology or any other field
is supremely important that I think is
most of all support things we can do
period in fact in the examples I was
siting in the previous vlog had nothing
to do with schools the technologies had
emerged from private corporations
working together to put together
specification I was critical of I guess
the process if you will so I just want
to clarify that and I think that any
pursuit into anything you whether it be
new technologies new ideas new
businesses whatever that is more than a
worthwhile thing I think it's supremely
important and just like with businesses
or eight out of ten businesses will fail
the first couple years you can expect a
lot of failures a lot of brick walls
will be hit in academic pursuit so it's
still worthy though it's super important
so yes most of the i don't i know the
percentages but a lot of the ideas that
are pursued in think tanks and academic
institutions and so forth lead nowhere
but it's still a very important process
that we should encourage and support and
so forth that's it so the last thing i
want to do is disparage that type of
work because i really believe in it and
second of all you know a huge part of my
family our teachers my father's a
teacher and uncles cousins so that's
another reason why i decided to
re-record and put out the new version of
the video because i want to explain
something to my family members although
i think 99 percenters what it won't
understand what I was trying to say so
there you go so all I'm saying is that
when you see new technologies new ideas
emerge out of think tanks whether they
come from private or public institutions
they have to be field tested they have
to be put to
real world reader and only then will you
know whether or not they are valid a
problem we have a lot of times outside
of technology is that it's very
difficult to put to test a lot of these
ideas because a lot of these ideas may
take many many many many years before
you see any result if you can see in the
result because a lot of times there's so
many variables that go into it so for
instance economic policy put forth by
out of government you don't know what's
going to happen until many years later
the effects of a leader by also we'll
talk about presence of the US and so I
think most of the audience's us you're
not going to see the full impact of
Barack Obama's economic policies for
many more years for many years because
it's such a huge mechanism the US
economic system u.s. system is so big
but any changes made for the most part
you won't see the full effects of it for
many many years same thing with every
president you know you didn't see the
effect of george w bush's economic
policies until many years after you know
it they were implemented and I you're
still feeling the reverberations of that
and why do I say that well when I put a
change into my app is your web you know
what I glass okay let's implement this
change we don't see the results of those
change for those changes for six to
eight months and it's the studio lab
it's a small app so imagine the u.s.
system the east all right that's it for
this vlog ciao oh my god somebody in my
last vlog I played a little drums and so
they say hey once you give some drum
lessons and I'm not going to do it
because first of all that was the first
time I played drums in years and maybe
in the last seven years at palais drums
for
one hour so needless to say my skills
are extremely rusty think of all there
are much better drummers out there but
you can learn to drum with so I was I
wouldn't even consider putting out a
drumming course or drumming how to drum
video because I ain't qualified alright
but thanks for the good wishes though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
