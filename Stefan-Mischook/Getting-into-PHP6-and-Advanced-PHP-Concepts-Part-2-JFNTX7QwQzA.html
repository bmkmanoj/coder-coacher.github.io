essentially output whatever is the
contents of this function I'm going to
see hold on let me just comment this out
I'm going to see a string with a couple
of different paths so we every path is
separated by a colon here so I've got
just the dot
I've got application xampp XM files Lib
PHP and then I have the pair library as
well so one technique that really helps
is to include other paths so if we want
to store classes and another part of our
program or another part of our
application that's not necessarily in
the in the public folder then we would
have to add that as a particular path so
we're gonna start with that if I go back
here I'm going to create a new folder
and I'm gonna call this folder comm
which is a little strange at first but
it'll make sense in in a minute
and for now I'm just going to take this
user dot PHP class that I've written and
I'll move it into the comm folder now if
I go back to index dot PHP and I want
these lines to function properly of
course instead of doing require once
user dot PHP I would have to go up a
folder into the comm folder and then I
would have to grab it there if i refresh
this again John Smith everything is
working see if I just did user dot PHP
then I would get this warning and it
would say you know I can't find user dot
PHP and it would fail which is of course
bad so it can get a little difficult to
find these classes as we're moving
forward so what we're gonna do is we're
going to create what is called an
application path and an application path
is the absolute path of where we are on
the file system and this is going to be
different from one web hosting
environment to
another but there's a really easy way of
handling that kind of ambiguity we're
going to define a global constant and
we're gonna call this application path
and it's going to use this real path
function which is provided by the PHP
framework and we're just going to do
this and then I'm going to echo
application path so what you can see is
I'm asking PHP for the real path
whatever is up one folder using two dots
here if i refresh this I'll see that in
my case hold on let me just comment this
stuff out if I echo what the application
path is for me it's users John sites
which is where I keep my websites and
then killer PHP so if I wanted to get
the real path of just the folder that
I'm in and I just put a dot then I would
get killer PHP slash public so that's
just we're defining this application
path now I want to add that as an
include path so that PHP will
automatically know that you know if it's
looking for a file that it can look in
the application of that so that's kind
of the first step so let's see okay
I'm going to start by saying paths
equals array and in there it it's going
to be the application path and then get
include paths or get include paths
rather so now we're just adding the
application path as a path in our
collection here and the last thing is
I'm just going to set include and here
we're going to use a function called
implode and what implode does is it
basically allows you to take a
collection of a collection of items in
an array and then put them all you know
next to each other
concatenate them all together using
something in between in this case we're
going to be using a path separator so
the in PHP in the documentation they
call this the glue so I'm just going to
implode and my glue in this case is a
path separator and the reason that this
is a global constant is that it's
different if you're on Windows or if
you're on a UNIX box the path separator
is actually different and then I'm gonna
pass in the path variable so now I'm
setting anything in here as additional
paths that PHP can go ahead and look at
for finding files when we do the require
one statement so if I uncomment this
it's still not gonna work we're gonna
get an error and it's gonna say we can't
find user dot PHP however when I look at
the include path here you'll see that
it's added users John sites killer PHP
so that wasn't there before which is
kind of neat if I add another include
path with com see I've concatenated com2
application path then it's all of a
sudden gonna work and then these two
instructions down here where we create a
new user and then we get the name are
gonna work again so we want a way of
dynamically setting our include paths
and requiring different files and at
first you might say oh well you know I'm
gonna have to create for every single
folder in my application I'm gonna have
to create a new include path which might
seem saying at first but actually that
could turn into quite a hairy mess as
well so there's actually a function that
PHP will allow us to write that will
automatically load paths that we're
looking for I'm gonna
comment out this require once and this
function is is just that it's called
Auto load and what auto load does and
we're gonna accept a class name I'll
explain that in a second is it runs when
it can't find something so when I can't
find new user when the parser has
trouble finding this new user object
it'll immediately go to the auto load
class that we've defined here and it'll
say hey I'm looking for this thing and I
can't find it and hopefully in this path
or in this in this auto load function
we're gonna be able to find that
particular file so I'm gonna just do an
echo on class name and then I'm gonna
put in a return statement let's see what
happens so you can see here that it's
echoing user and then it says fatal
error class user not found so this isn't
you know this is basically we have to
take this user and we need to
concatenate dot PHP and then run the
require one statement so one way of
doing this is to essentially go in and
say require once and then class name and
then we can complete that with dot PHP
and then it's going to work again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
