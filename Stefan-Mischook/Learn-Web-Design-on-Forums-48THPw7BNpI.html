sites calm in this quick little video I
want to give you a little tip to help
you learn web design or web programming
and basically I would suggest that you
join a web design or web programming
forum and you join in you join in in the
discussions that are happening on the
forum or at least follow along because
you get a lot of real-world questions
being asked on these forums and if you
have a good form you're going to get all
kinds of good answers and it's a great
way to learn how to do things it's been
very useful for me in my over the years
and so I really highly suggest that you
take a look at forums as a good way to
learn your web design or web programming
skills so for instance i'm going to show
you the killer sites form you know it

you played video background removing CSS
tag and linking direct image anyway you
get the idea there's a there's a lot of
these are just the reason the top at
home top 5 topics or whatever it is you
see his law activity on the forum
there's quite a few people and it's just
good to go through forums join up
they're free and you can choose a forum
it's a particular interest to you

you to participate or just follow along
and you'll find you're going to be
introduced to a whole bunch of subjects
