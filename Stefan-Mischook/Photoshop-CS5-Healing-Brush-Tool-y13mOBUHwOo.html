the healing brush tool it's a great tool
really works very well and unlike the
other ones which except for that is the
patch tool the patch tool we sort of
defined a source we said look I want
this area to look like this area
well the Healing Brush tool does a
similar thing unlike the Spot Healing
Brush tool which you just point to and
it figures out what's around that area
and says hey well I'll help you with
that no problem but here the Healing
Brush tool is a little bit more specific
so first thing I want to do is I'm gonna
revert this back to its normal shape and
we can do that together if you're
following along and old man JPEG here is
what I have open I'm just gonna zoom in
on some of these areas right here and
let's take a look at what the Healing
Brush tool can do now very small notice
it's not feathered at all and here if I
were to press shift and left square
bracket I can feather that all the way
to zero let's see there it is hardness
zero so you can have a feathered edge or
you can work with something that is a
harder edge if you prefer and just my
right square bracket to increase the
size of that now let's take a look if
you'll notice if I were to just click
somewhere little warning says option
click to define the source point that's
alt click on a PC that should be used as
it repair so if you wanted this area to
look more like this area over here you
can do that quite easily just press alt
or option depending on your platform
click on it here and then notice how
it's bringing that area over and if I
come here and click on that take a look
you'll probably be really really you
know very difficult for anybody to see
the change that was made in that area
now look if I were to take this area
that I took over here and sort of put it
in with someplace that you know looks
very different like the shadows that's
not a great idea because
well I mean it worked okay here but and
that's thanks to the power of the
Healing Brush tools it's extremely
powerful but let's see what happens if
we take it over here not such a great
thing I'm gonna go back commands ad I'm
just gonna undo that particular move now
let's set another source point for
example if I were to come in here I'm
going to press alt and I'll set this
area as my source and then when I let go
I'm gonna come over here and click on
that not left click as I did but not
right click excuse me but left click and
you can see the difference there's the
big blemish and there it is without now
I purposely took a little bit of the
pattern that was here and brought it
over here just to try and make it look a
little bit more realistic and then with
that again we saw how we can you know
dodge that little area if it's a little
too dark and we can work with those
elements in here just like that so
nevertheless these are great ways that
you can go in and manage certain areas
that have blemishes and remove certain
things so for example I'll just go back
to that tool again and I'll say well
what about this area here over lapping
this area so let's take a very similar
area notice it's starting to get a
little dark here and it's a little
highlights in these areas so I'm gonna
copy
maybe this area over here and you could
even make it smaller or larger whatever
you want just press option I'll click
there then I'll come here and try to
mask right over this area and you can
see there that you know I've really done
a very good job of removing some of
those elements I'm going to zoom out
just by pressing alt by the way you
don't really have to press alt it's it's
all-inclusive in here just left and
right should be fine and notice the
difference right you'd really be
hard-pressed to notice that you know
there was something here there was
something there as well so you can work
around with some of these elements
and you know if we were to zoom in on
this area over here for example you'll
notice that small little darkness can be
overcome just by coming in here alt
clicking coming over here and just
separating that space you'll notice when
you do click there's that little plus
sign just off to the right of my brush
preview and as you can see that little
element just shows you know what areas
you're copying so if you continuously
brush with this you're continuously
copying that area but what you may
notice is that it did a really good job
of eliminating that little blemish and
it's hardly noticeable and I really
believe that anybody would be very
hard-pressed to notice that it was ever
there so that's just a little bit more
of working with the healing tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
