talk about the risk of choosing the
wrong programming language what are the
risk well don't worry about there's no
risk yep there's no risk the reason I'm
putting out this vlog is because I guess
says that people are concerned about
making that right choice oh my if I
don't make the right choice I choose the
wrong programming language to learn my
career will be over neither nothing
could be further from the truth don't
worry about it
the reason you should be concerned
whether you choose to see sharp jealous
with Python PHP Ruby JavaScript it
doesn't really matter in the end because
let's say you do choose a particular
language and I'm not it I'm going to
choose one okay I'll choose one visual
foxpro this is a language nobody uses
these days and let's say you choose one
and you learn everything about the
language you become confident you're
able to build apps with the language and
then you discover that because you
listen to my suggestion you discover
that there's no work in visual foxpro
anymore so what do you do or you don't
know because what you're going to learn
when you learn how to program regardless
of the language so many languages these
they share so many of the same
techniques principles and concepts that
for you to move from say Java to
JavaScript will be easy for you to move
from Python to JavaScript or PHP will be
pretty easy yeah there are differences
but for all the major languages that are
out there today the ones I just
mentioned Java JavaScript C sharp
Objective C Swift
Python PHP Ruby and others they share so
many of the same principles I would say
once you learn one of them you probably
know about 80% of all the others the
hard part about learning how to program
is just learning the basic concepts and
learning how to put everything together
to create good apps but creating good
apps and being a good developer
it's not about knowing details about the
language it's it's about learning how to
be a good developer it's kind of a
universal thing kind of like learning
how to drive well whether you drive a
Porsche Audi BMW a Ford or Chrysler if
you know how to drive well you know how
to drive well yes there are nuances and
differences between the cars there are
nuances and differences between the
languages but at the end of the day it's
very very similar so don't worry about
it if you decide to pick up Python and
you figure out six months or a year from
now or in two years from now the market
changes and it goes into some other
language or some other framework or
whatever does matter you'll be able to
pick it up you see again that's why I
always emphasize in my courses the key
basics I give you a big picture I dive
into it I teach you how to build things
for real so that these skills are
transferable to any language and I'm not
just speaking you know theoretically
this represents my own career I've been
coding since the 1990s early 90s and
I've written commercial apps in eight or
nine languages over the years I forget
the exact number now and what you'll see
is that the hardest language to learn
the hardest programming language to
learn is the first one but after that it
becomes very easy for you to switch over
from Python to Java won't be such a big
leap now some languages are more similar
than other languages so for instance
JavaScript and Java are a little closer
together than say Python and Java C
sharp and Java by the way are like super
super close because he shark was
basically Microsoft's answer to Java am
I'm going into a history lesson so
that's the point of this vlog don't get
too caught up in making your language
choice because whatever language you
choose to learn first would not be a
waste of time because all those skills
are very much transferable to any other
language again I'll close with this
whenever you're choosing a programming
language
it's important that you consider a the
type of work what you want to do look
into that because writing iOS apps is a
very different beast
for example than programming AI with
Python which is very different than
developing web apps with WordPress
excuse me with PHP and maybe the laravel
framework as an example and the other
thing you have to consider is in your
geographic area in where you live the
city the part of world that you live
what's the man where is the demand for
for you for your area it will be or
could be very different from where I
live so check into that how do you do
that you go to jobs boards you look for
local job listings and so on and then
the final thing is to consider whether
or not you want to go work for somebody
or you're looking to become a freelancer
that's a whole different thing as well
in terms of what skills translate into
freelance as I said before doing Java
it's probably not the best choice you
want to cover freelancer PHP is probably
a much better choice but on the other
hand if you want to go work for very
large corporations then job is a choice
for you
and it can go on and on about all the
other languages but you could just check
out my careers in code playlist where I
have all these videos on choosing
languages based on careers and options
that are affected by that language and
the environment around the language what
do I mean by the environments around the
language each language has an ecosystem
and understanding that ecosystem around
the language plays a big role in terms
of terms of what skills you have to
learn of course so you'll see that
pythons ecosystem is very different from
PHP s not necessarily better but just
different and Java as well and that all
reflects on the youth case of the
language use case meaning how the
language is used in industry and that
comes back finally to finish complete
the circle it goes back to the tip of
what you want to do so there you go
don't sweat it don't don't let it bother
you that you're risking choosing the
wrong language there's
especially in today's environment all
right job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
