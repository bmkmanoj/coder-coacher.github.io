machine learning it's interesting I
think it's an interesting field I think
AI machine learning are there could be a
lot of money thrown into that over the
next many years so that means if you get
into AI and machine learning coding
which laws does Python then there could
be a lot of money for you in terms of
jobs working for companies larger
companies and so forth I don't think you
can apply and small businesses are going
to be looking for AI programmers not at
this point anyway and so if you're
looking to become a freelancer then you
don't want to look at AI machine
learning because there's not going to be
any freelancer jobs doing that that
being said ai machine learning are
really big these days it's a good it's
an interesting field to be sure but I
think that it's going to be incremental
process it tears that there's a guys at
Google has spent a lot of money on this
and it's getting cooler
it's getting really cool with the Google
assistant when you talk to it
understands content context so if you
say give me flight prices from here to
California it would tell you and then
you can say Hubble in March and then
they will know that you're talking about
flights to California and it shows you
prices in March cetera chatter so that's
a nice step that's where it is right now
that has taken Google years to get to so
it's going to be a very incremental
process which means the AI coders
machine language coders of a beard and
demand for a long long time but
understand when you do that kind of
coding you're going to be working for
bigger companies later on and I think
you're starting to see a little bit was
I believe ibm's watson project you be as
freelancer you may be able to go in
there for smaller companies and hook
into AI based API is where you basically
pay IBM X amount of cents every time you
be sent there ai a question it gets back
response so maybe that if you may be
able to plug that in to certain small
gigs or small businesses and I can't
think of any examples of the off the top
of my head but I'm just here to give you
context about how understanding the
Beast
basics of AI machine learning sooner or
later will be able to be used in even
small games by exposing yourself to
api's and then using the services from
these API it's kind of like if you were
to use Google Maps and somebody's
website instead of using Google Maps you
use ibm's watson which is their AI but
again I think at this point in time AI
is encoding is much more much more for
bigger businesses so if you like that
idea of going to work for a big business
to work on these big AI projects then
you know you're going to go Python it's
all the buzz now these days machine
learning and AI and it's interesting it
reminds me of times past when certain
technologies came involved and then they
made a lot of money initially and then
they fall out of favor
it's like iOS development with object of
C the first several years the iPhone
because of the growth of the App Store
it's a good huge money be hiding don't
get me wrong still money be had with iOS
development but I I think that the big
boom is I imagine it's over as mentioned
in other videos you're not going to make
monies unlikely to make money building
apps that use your own apps which you'll
sell on the on EA App Store there's just
too many apps it's just too many apps
it's been going on for years where you
make money and iOS development is
actually building apps for other
businesses whether it be small
businesses or large businesses yeah
again as I talked about in all my videos
what coding languages and frameworks you
choose to learn should be taken into
consideration this choice should be
taken into consideration depending on
the type of work you want to do anyway
when it comes to the boom that we see
today in AI machine learning there's a
lot of buzz on a boom that some
experience or several other cycles lots
of opportunities there'll be a lot of
brick walls companies and the
these models will hit meaning they will
not be successful that's okay as you as
a developer you can make a lot of money
offering your services along the way so
don't get me wrong nothing everybody
drop everything to AI it is one other
route that could be viable but
understand that it's kind of you know
this gold rush for apps and apps app
development in terms of businesses it's
kind of like the gold rush in the
California Gold Rush general 1800 silver
was the people who made the most money
were the people who were supplying the
services and the equipment to the gold
prospectors so the people may matter the
people selling the people that the Picts
is the pictures the pics that are the
pics and the wheelbarrows and all the
all the stuff that you needed all the
equipment that you needed to go prospect
for go to go digging for gold mostly
people went digging for gold never found
gold in the mirror never made it but the
people who made a lot of money were the
people who were selling this the gold
diggers the equipment that they needed
and you see that was the startup culture
where a lot of rich people are willing
to spend you know millions of billions
with other tens of millions of dollars
on conceptual businesses the startups
and the way they work is also put
they'll have a pool whatever a billion
dollars 100 million dollars and they'll
spread that out between 30 companies or
20 companies or whatnot with a full
expectation with 80% of those companies
with this fail the product will never
worked and then they make all their
money in the last you know five percent
or ten percent of the companies actually
do 50 times your money or 100 times
their money so that's their model but
the good thing about this model
it's like those other 80% of those
companies would actually go to nowhere
they're paying coders they're paying
coders big money to write the software
to get the idea up and running so that
they can see whether or not it's
actually a viable business so you're
going to see that a lot I think with AI
and machine learning case you see that a
lot in any emerging sub sector within
development where
a tons of money thrown at it and then we
actually see where everything settle and
where the opportunity really lies in
terms of long term you know earnings for
everybody anyway I hope this is useful
to you bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
