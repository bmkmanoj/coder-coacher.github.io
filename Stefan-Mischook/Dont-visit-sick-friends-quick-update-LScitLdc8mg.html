recording this on februari 16th i
believe it is yeah i'm still sick as you
can hear and so I just thought I'd check
in I still have that virus that picked
up for my friend let that be a lesson to
you guys if your friend tells you that
they they're not feeling well it would
just got over something don't go visit
them so another tip and something I used
to always do it always worked gloves
whenever I would go outside Maria
touching door handles or shaking hands
so I'll shake hands fist pump fist bump
and this will protect you from getting
viruses and for many years actually I
was religious about my glove wearing I
would always wear my gloves and I never
got sick never got sick green I'm
relegates me and here we go so he go
there's a friend I was in California got
super sick can't blame him i put my own
rules and so you should always err on
the side of caution this is basically
throw me off of my game for about nearly
two weeks i just been doing the bare
minimum of work you know directing my
coder ism just answering necessary
emails that's about it so but I am
slowly slowly getting better my focus
though is going to be huge on the Python
course because behind I got to get
something out very quickly because of
the demand from clients and so forth so
anyway I just want to give you guys a
little heads-up about where I was I why
I haven't been blogging much it's just
pure illness that's all i'll try this
weekend to do a vlog on answering a
bunch of questions that are put to me
i'm going to answer them kind of like a
QA and hopefully I I'll continue to get
better over the next few days because i
miss logging here alright guys we'll
talk soon check out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
