tags where they belong so what do I mean
by that well there are certain tags that
belong in certain section of your
webpage so for instance the head section
always is supposed to be on top of the
body section this is good but if I put
the head section down here this is no
good so you got to remember when you
build your pages you want to keep your
head always on top of the body section
but the head section has to be in
between the HTML tags because that's the
beginning of any webpage is in between
the HTML tags so you want to be sure
that you don't do something silly like
put your head outside of the HTML tags
like this this would be no good now
again it might work because web browsers
are pretty forgiving the web browser
apps you know Chrome Firefox Safari
Internet Explorer but this is bad that's
not a good place that's not where the
head tag is supposed to be you know I'm
just gonna correct this so we're gonna
make sure at the top of the page always
is the head tag and then it's followed
by the body tag and all those tags are
within the HTML tags as you build web
pages and as you learn more about HTML
you're gonna learn where it tags belong
but most of the tags I would say about
90% of the tags they belong in between
the body tags because that's the part of
the web page the body portion but you
actually see when you view a web page
right if you remember we open in browser
see this is the body section here so
this is what we're this is where all the
images and the video and the text
appears is where everything appears so
it kind of makes sense that most of our
tanks are gonna be in between these two
body tags finally as you know most HTML
tags come in pairs
opening tag closing tag opening tag
closing tag and when you have a tag that
comes in a pair it's important
to close them properly so this is
properly closed because we have our
closing tag in the P and we know it's a
closing tag because we have the Ford
leaning the slash so to properly close
it you know we have it there but if you
take it out and you do something like
this it will still work but it's not a
good thing to you because it could screw
things up down the road so you could do
this actually you can go like this and
have two peas like this two paragraphs
and you see it works now a problem
though is that down the road when you're
doing some fancier web design work maybe
working with CSS or you're working with
another language called JavaScript it
could cause you problems it's always
best when you have tags have closing
tags P and paragraph is the example body
as an example it's always good to close
your tags and there you go those are the
rules of HTML not too complex I hope</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
