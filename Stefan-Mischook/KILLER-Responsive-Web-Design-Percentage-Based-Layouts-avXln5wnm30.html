the concepts that we learned in the last
video and apply it to elements like the
width the padding and the margins on
this particular template I want to make
sure that this design is able to adapt
to different browser sizes different
browser widths now you could set the
margins and padding and similar using MS
but that's generally used more for
typography
something that's related to type itself
so I'm going to be suggesting that you
use percentages and at least
demonstrating percentages in this video
so the first step that I want to do is I
want to change our wrapper that's
roughly about 900 pixels at the moment I
want to change that to something pretty
close I think I'm gonna change it to
ninety percent and if I go in preview
you'll notice that not a whole lot has
changed it might have shifted slightly
for example if I extend a site you
notice that that background area does
change
notice how the site has expand it's just
the contents within it haven't so
that'll give me a good place to start
from obviously that 90 percent value is
just kind of a rough value that I picked
you might and you probably do want to
eventually go back in and with css3
media queries add some sort of max width
value to ensure that the site isn't
displaying all the way across the
browser obviously on very large monitors
you don't want to have the user forced
to view the entire site all the way
across the width of whatever size
browser he's using so a max width helps
make sure the site is sort of a
reasonable size and it's easy to read
for visitors so starting with a 90%
width we're basically going to use the
same exact formula that we use for ms
we're just using it for percentages so
keep in mind that everything I'm doing
is dealing with
I think I want to start with the main
wits of things and the primary one I
want to start with is the width of our
left and right columns so here's the
left column notice it's a 580 pixels so
to roughly get that proportion we want
to take 580 and divide it by the parent
which is here it's roughly about 900
pixels based on our original design so
if I open up my calculator I'm gonna do
580 divided by 900 and that gets me this
value so I'm gonna copy that paste it in
but the difference here is we're dealing
with percentages not m/s so we need to
adjust this decimal two points so it's
actually going to be 64 percent roughly
and I'll leave it up to you obviously
the more number after the decimal the
more accurate that number is and we're
dealing with computers here so it's not
like they don't understand this value so
I would just leave it the way it is
don't worry about rounding those numbers
down I'm going to do the exact same
thing with our right column so it's 180
pixels
pull over my calculator again so 180
divided by the contacts 900
so that's basically that's point o2 if
you move the decimal over two places
that's 20% there we go
so now if we preview looks about the
same as it did but if we actually adjust
the width to the site you'll notice that
these columns are also expanding and in
order to keep things going I probably
need to adjust this banner and the
navigation as well so let me find those
the nav has a width of 900 pixels and I
can actually just set that to 100%
instead that should work and it does and
then I also want to do the same thing to
my banner element and really the reason
why that one isn't expanding is because
we have this banner image so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to find the
color of this background banner and I'm
going to use that and make that the
background so it extends all the way
across when we go to my stylesheet look
up the banner section I'm gonna just a
couple things rather than setting the
line height and font size I'm gonna take
those out I set a 140 pixel height
because that's the height of our banner
and then I'm gonna add a background
color
and it's gonna be didi for f1b that's
that orange it's now if I test it you'll
notice the banner goes all the way
across and if I expand the width of the
website you'll notice how the banner
seems to expand too so now obviously
this isn't a perfect solution for
example if you are dealing with a more
complicated image one that doesn't fade
out to a solid color but I'll be talking
about dealing with responsive images in
a later video and we'll cover that in
more detail next up let's talk about
margins and padding now this template is
a little bit difficult to give a
demonstration of percentage based
margins simply because we don't have any
left and right margins in our template
but for the sake of example let me go
ahead and shift this box over say about
40 pixels and give you a demonstration
of how to try percentage based margins
so let me go ahead and find the right
content here
so if I start with 40 pixels you'll
notice how it's been shifted over and if
I want to do percentage based margins
instead it's going to be the exact same
formula we've been using target divided
by context equals result and we're going
to pull out our calculator it's gonna be
40 divided by the context that parent
element which is roughly 900 pixels so
I'm gonna copy that paste and then
adjust the decimal place over to places
so it looks like that you'll notice how
we get basically the same spacing just
with percentages rather than pixels one
other thing that I should mention while
I think of it is if you're doing this
method where you're pretty much starting
with the pixel based layout I'm gonna
justing to percentages you might want to
keep those pixel values in place in your
stylesheet still in case you need to
refer to them in the future so for
example this with 20% is roughly about
180 pixels and this width is 580 pixels
it's just in case you ever need to do
any other calculations based on these
members it's nice to have those pixel
values handy now I've talked about
margins and giving you a quick
demonstration of that padding is a
little bit different if you remember the
CSS box model now note how margins are
considered outside of that box and
padding is considered inside and at
least the way that I was taught was that
when you do this calculation for
percentage based padding the calculation
changes a little bit because the context
changes it's not the width of the parent
element so you want to wonder about it's
the width of the actual element you
adding padding to however I found I'm
actually trying to put this into
practice it's a little bit hit or miss I
haven't figured out the exact reason
behind it yet
I can give you a quick example so for
example say we want to take this 20
pixel padding and convert that into
percentages instead so I pull out my
calculator here we go so according to
the way that I was taught it would be 20
divided by the width of the element
itself which is roughly about 180 now to
copy that paste it and adjust those
values so we get roughly around 11% but
when we go to test it you'll notice how
things are a little bit changed I mean
we have some padding and that's
obviously good but it seems to be a lot
more padding than the ritual 20 pixels
we specified and what I figured out that
it's doing is it's taking that 11% and
I'm still applying it to the full width
of the parent element so the proper
calculation there if I get my calculator
out again it's going to be 20 divided by
that parent element roughly 900 and copy
and paste
so this time we got around a 2% value
instead of love and percent and you
notice it's much more what we expect so
I'm not exactly sure what this means
realistically for example the padding
here seems to be based on the parent
element but if I tried to do percentage
based padding's and the navigation that
seems to apply just to the width of the
individual navigation item so I'm a
little confused about that I have to
admit if I figure out the solution I
will post and you know update this
screencast but just keep that in mind
that you may have to fiddle with the
numbers slightly and the contacts may
change depending on the element you
apply it to let's go back into our CSS
and finish applying percentage-based
padding to our different elements I'm
only dealing with the left and right
padding on things so we have padding
here of 20 pixels on the wrapper let's
go ahead and plop the calculator key so
we have roughly 20 divided by 900 my
copy and paste
there's that padding you notice it stays
right about the same let's see if
there's anything else each one has a
padding left of 20 pixels so I believe
we can do the same thing yep I've kept
things the same keep in mind this is the
h1 here then let's go ahead and adjust
anything else here's where I said it
gets a little bit tricky for example
let's say I apply that same 20 pixels
left to right and if you remember
correctly just did that calculation so
it's 20 divided by 900 gives us this
percentage value but now if we check
you'll notice how small that padding
value is so it's gonna be up to you
especially on these elements that don't
have a fixed width how you want to
handle that you might consider switching
over to m/s for that value because
that's then not dependent on the exact
width the element he'll probably just
need to pick something and just visually
see what looks best so let's try to M I
mean that's approximately what we had
before so you might just need to do some
little minor tweaking here and there
let's see if there's anything else
there's 20 pixel padding on the content
left and right and if you remember
correctly that's gonna be the same value
because that's 20 pixels 20 divided by
900 gives us that percentage value and I
believe that's the end of the see yep
that's the end of the changes new data
on pattern let's save it and things
looked like they've stayed just about
the same as they were before when we're
using pixels and now we shifted over to
percent so hopefully that wasn't too
confusing for the most part it seems
like most elements deal when you look at
that target divided by context equals
result calculation that context is in
most cases the parent element but there
might be a couple cases like with this
navigation well it seems based on the
actual width of the element itself it
might be a block versus inline element
thing for example this is a link so
that's inline by default whereas these
other elements where block elements
they're divs so just something to keep
in mind and hopefully with a little bit
of practice you'll be able to figure out
easily what context you should be using
when you do these calculations one final
note for this video I thought I should
mention Paul Irish has a blog post on
this box sizing property and CSS that
you might want to take a look at
basically as I mentioned earlier in the
video the way the Box lava works
currently is that the width of an
element is based on not only the actual
width but also any padding and this
particular CSS property changes that so
that padding is kind of considered
inside the element and doesn't affect
the actual width and that can be really
useful for example when you're dealing
with element that you want to be a
hundred percent width but then if you
add padding on top of that then that
element becomes more than 100 percent so
there's can be some tricky situations
which you have to deal with
and using this little bit of CSS code
adding this box sizing property into
your CSS is one way that you can handle
that there are some limitations on this
example it doesn't work in IE 7 or lower
but all modern browsers support it IE 8
and above Firefox Chrome etc so if you
are looking to ease some of the
difficulty that can be involved with
responsive layouts and you know
percentage based widths and padding and
such you might want to look here and do
a little bit of experimenting with what
he suggests in this article</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
