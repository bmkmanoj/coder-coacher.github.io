this V block I want to talk about
changing technology so this is kind of
in response to the response I got from a
vlog I did on why I would not get into
Ruby on Rails today and let me just
point out this is not a an attack on
Ruby on Rails technology per se it's
very good you can do what law with it my
main point was the business end of it
you have on one side you have Python
Django putting pressure on Rails pushing
down rails and on the other side you
have PHP 7 with probably the most
popular PHP framework today which is
lara Val putting pressure on rails now
the thing about laravel they bought a
lot of ideas from rails and I'm sure
Django did as well although I haven't
looked at Django in many years I can't
comment on that so you have Django one
side with Python now pythons very
similar to Ruby in many respects
although there will be guys would argue
with that Python guys you know but
they're very similar in many respects
and they're both very cool languages the
problem for Ruby though is Ruby as far
as I can see it's pretty much in the web
space you want to do web apps whereas
when you got what Django was should be
with Python not only can you do the web
a web app with it using of course Django
and there's another framework which I
forget off the top of my head but it's
actually used quite a bit in other areas
as well Python is you know IOT Internet
of Things
apparently Python is used a lot there so
you know Python is is eaten Ruby's lunch
on one end of the spectrum on the other
end of the spectrum you have PHP 7 and
laravel or PHP cake or a symphony and
it's eating Ruby and rails breakfast on
the other end of the spectrum PHP is
holding solid and again PHP has got this
user base which is math
and it's got you know the signature apps
like Facebook and it's got it's got
these all too important apps and real
world web development you know WordPress
is number one which is built with PHP
and Joomla and Drupal you may not want
to do that kind of work and that's cool
but again my I'm not criticizing rails
per se I'm just saying that it's getting
a lot of pressure and starting to fade
and I have seen this several times
before and it's just the way it goes
and you you know as a developer you got
to recognize that this happens once
every five or so years you see a big
shift in technology so I started coding
in 1994 and in the mid 90s in terms of
client side front and development it was
it was HTML and it was table based table
based design you probably you guys
probably not aware of this then came
around mm or five years later in 2000
you had the rise of the web standards
movement where CSS base layout started
to take hold and that basically just
wiped out table base layout within a
couple years to three years so there's
this big shift so all the table base
designers web page designers and all
that that whole process of developing
web apps back in those days was was lost
was gone
and in fact I had an old friend of mine
who was one of the pioneers in in the
web business back in the day and he sort
of got out of it in ninety ninety eight
or somebody in 99 so stepped away 98 and
he came back in 2003 and he was
astounded at how different it was in
fact he said to me I remember clearly he
said you know I'm gonna have to relearn
this stuff all over again from scratch
because it had web design and
development had totally changed in just
that short period of time it was pretty
amazing and I've seen this time time
again like in the early 90s
and the way you would build dynamic web
apps it would be CGI base would be Perl
CGI well that was the most pearl CGI RC
are down to C code and the way that
would work you would embed your view
code your HTML inside of your your code
so if you wrote your stuff in Perl
your HTML code was mixed in in like
print statements inside of the Perl
which is you know anybody knows that's a
terrible thing to do what I mean what a
pain in the butt and that went on for a
few years and then page the page base
paradigm came out the first one I'm
aware of is ASP classic Microsoft put
that out and that's where I cut a lot of
my teeth in my first web hop creation
ASP came out I think it was 96 I started
using it then and that sort of flipped
it on its head where we instead of
embedding view code inside of our code
inside of our programming language we
would embed the coding language inside
of our view code so we'd have pages
instead of HTML pages you have dot ASP
pages and you put our program out
programmatic code inside of the views
and that has its own problems but
there's ways to handle that and I'm not
gonna get into that and then of course
Java took that on as well that went from
a servlet based only where you had your
view code inside of your java code where
then they had the JSP which was this a
copy of a SB and it progressed from
there and rails came out it hit its peak
I think in about 2007 from fast
forwarding several years and you had
like it represented I think there were
the best refinement of the monolithic
framework and you had many frameworks
before we have objects in the Java world
you had web objects which is apples
thing you had struts Java struts and
velocity which was a templating engine
you have a tapestry another two engine
and our many many many others of these
frameworks and they each had their own
approach and so forth the rails I think
really set the bar
and really help pull the the web
development community forward but now
we're in 2016 and now we're starting to
see the move into micro services which
is I guess the extension of distributed
the shooter application development but
again it's another push and now we're
seeing another paradigm shift now my
comment about that I've talked about
micro services in another video what you
can find in this collection that being
said I don't believe in the micro
service only application I think that
you should still have your core
framework whether it be rails or Django
or laravel or spring but then Java
spring but then what you should have is
use micro services to support your main
framework but that's beyond the scope of
this particular vlog the whole point of
this blog at the end of the day is that
you have to recognize as a coder is that
is that these are all tools whether it
be Ruby and rails whether it be Python
Django and whether it be PHP seven
laravel Java spring doesn't matter
they're just tools and some and it's
it's kind of funny for me instead how
people get emotionally involved with
their tools
you know rails people get pretty angry
if you suggested rails is fading we're
not saying rails sucks
we're just saying it's fading and you
look at the data it's empirical data it
is fading and if you look at the
underlying trends you can see why it's
fading I talked about it pythons eating
its lunch on one end and PHP seven is
eating its lunch on the other end then
you have JavaScript JavaScript is coming
up fast you know so did you know rails
you know had its peak literally in about
2007 2008 and it's been on a slide ever
since and I've seen that before I've
seen what Perl CGI remember to Perl CGI
guys they were dominant for a few years
and they said no parole it's Perl and
then a SP came around ASP just took it
took care of it in ASP s and JSP do you
have it just you know bro you still see
a few Perl what
out there and the pro people are still
hard corporal people out there but it's
really become a niche thing and you see
that with several other technologies has
seen over the years VB classic VB flash
you saw a flash got killed recently and
just in the last say you know 2007 I
think it was but a Steve Jobs decided to
take out flash so these things happen so
the good thing in terms of being a
developer is that things have really
standardized relative to the past you're
not going to be like my buddy who woke
up four years later to find out
everything he knew about Web Design had
changed or much of it it's really
stabilized now more than I've ever seen
before
meaning you know rails sort of hit a
level and now everything is sort of is
in the same realm so if you're coming
from Ruby on Rails and you move into
heaven forbid PHP seven laravel or
Python Django it won't be a big deal for
you because you will have you you
already understand the basic structure
of these type of apps and how it all
works and you know you know your basic
design pattern - MVC you understand
refactoring you understand filter
patterns and all this kind of stuff it
will be easy for you to jump from rails
Ruby rails to Python Django or to PHP
laravel you know what I mean so I
wouldn't get caught up in that you know
again like I don't know if a plumber
would get really angry if somebody
suggests that they use a Wilson wrench
and then a Black &amp;amp; Decker wrench or
something whatever you know doesn't
matter don't get caught up with it again
I keep stressing this the most important
thing for developers is to master the
basics the basics the basics the basics
basic design patterns basic refactoring
basic coding practices and structure and
just you know a good understanding of
object orientation and how to properly
write code
this is universe these are some
universal principles that translate
across all technologies and the
longevity in what you do comes to that
so this is a pretty long blog um to
segment
eleven minutes but you know what I'm
gonna go on a bit longer so let me give
you an example I was you know in the
late 90s I became a big Java zealot
everything I did was Java Java was the
King I love Java I wrote everything in
Java and server-side Java now I didn't
use one of the big frameworks so I
thought they were too heavy I used a
lightweight MVC framework I developed
myself something that was we called
poggio base basically very fine-grained
micro objects of view will and and
that's how I had my framework and I was
doing very well with that but what
started to happen as I because I got
more and more gigs coming at me people
would come to me said we want to build
it in this language we want it in PHP or
we wanted it in this or we wanted in
that and I used to fight them said no
we're gonna do in Jeb everything was a
nail because I had my java hammer right
but then a guy came to a client one time
and they insisted that I you know
updated their their site which was built
on PHP they insisted that I do it on PHP
and you understand this is not PHP today
where you have namespaces as polished
properly object-oriented and it has it
has proper error trapping you know like
back in those days there's a pre PHP for
even peach before you probably don't
know that's when they start a sort of
sort of becoming object-oriented and or
maybe it was peach before but anyway it
was broken routed to Jeff there's no
proper air trapping there wasn't it was
really terrible and I just like I was
like I was gagging writing this code as
ugly looking code to but the client
insisted I said whatever they're paying
me so I just learnt it and after the two
or three hours of discussed you know I
said yeah it's doing the job it's
working it's easy and then I started
seeing you know in its in its primitive
state routed to Java it was very
lightweight to give you an example if I
want to send an email with java servlets
back in those days it was like a page of
code right now the PHP for all its flaws
it was one lie
code to send an email yeah wasn't that
look went it you know it wasn't elegant
rather it was you know but it did the
job and I remember my brother who was a
big Java coder he was like he was like
shaming me you know I was like what are
you doing you know and I said to him you
know what yeah
PHP it sucks in a lot of different ways
back then but it's whatever you know
what I can write this thing and two
hundred lines of code instead of ten
thousand lines of code so yeah I don't
have doesn't have good debugging doesn't
have proper hair trapping and I just use
a die statement it's kind of very
primitive but you know what it's a lot
easier to bug to to debug two hundred
lines of code than ten thousand lines I
remember saying that to him he said yeah
it's a good point
so whatever yeah wasn't great but they
have worked and it worked for years so
then I started approaching projects more
and more like that I started saying you
know what's sitting with the client I go
in with the client I say okay what are
you gonna do and I would pick the
technology best for them sometimes it
would be Java I push for Java sometimes
would be PHP sometimes would be
something strange like I did some early
apps for Nicolas Merc frost big promise
suta cool it's even Merc frost or was
the other one and I did within city code
and HTA which was an early version of a
client side a client side app using
client-side technology so basically
writing with everyone's JavaScript code
I was talking to windle's comm objects
calling Windows comm to generate
PowerPoint slides and stuff and this is
back in the day because for their
particular needs it was easier for me to
do it this way
then to try to write a Java client for
instance or maybe a VB client or
something and so on and so forth I got
approached by another pharmaceutical to
build my very first actually educational
app it's like 2000 and it was an
educational app for medical doctors it's
video base with quizzing and tracking
and stuff and what did I do it in Java
my favorite language no I did it in
something like one of the worst
languages has ever seen something called
lingo
which was a language an app scripting
language built-in for director something
called director dobby director this is
during the time at DVDs this this thing
had to be glued on DVDs because the web
was sketchy in those days so I did in
something called lingo inside of
director and let me tell you you think
this is like this is one of these
languages we tried to hide coding from
the coders and then he tried to add
coding on top of it it was a extremely
verbose wasn't fun it was kind of silly
so silly the language in terms of the
syntax I used to I'd be laughing writing
it because it's so stupid I forget so
many examples but you know what we put
out the app we're great people loving it
was good point is I learned to become
language technology agnostic they're
just tools they're just tools don't fall
in love with your tools they're not
religion they're not your girlfriend or
not your boyfriend they're just tools
and it's the most important thing you
want to take away from using all these
tools is try to learn some universal
principles from each of these tools try
to learn what you can learn from them so
from Java I learned about MVC in Java I
learned about free fact I learned most
of my high level high end if you will
coding chops in principles in Java
community that's you know that's where a
lot of it was exposed through Java so
MVC pattern and other design pattern you
know factories and facade and you know
my favorite of course is just filters
and that's decorators filters and you
know but you can get something from all
these languages you can learn I learned
to learn some interesting things you
know in terms of PHP in terms of its
simplicity and stuff at the time but
again a lot of us is history nowadays
the languages Python Ruby PHP Java C
sharp they're all neck-and-neck in terms
of capabilities you know if you're a
good coder you can make any of these
languages any of the frameworks that
come with these languages work for you
so try not to get defensive about it
when somebody says hey look Ruby's going
away buddy slowly it'll probably still
be around ten years from now
but it's it's market shares this seems
to be fading that's just the way it is
