killer sites and studio web.com in this
video I want to talk about which
programming language if you have to pick
one which one should you learn today
short answer it's PHP and I'm choosing
PHP not necessarily because I think it's
the greatest language ever created no it
has its problems like any other
programming language and the choice a
programming language has a lot to deal
with personal taste and personal needs
of the application in question as I've
mentioned this before depending on the
project that you're working on certain
languages will be more favorable to it
than others because each programming
language has its own thing that is
pretty good at PHP competitors include
Ruby Java C sharp and others don't
confuse Java with JavaScript they're
totally different languages and they
have totally different use total
different uses whereas the Nerds way as
the Nerds would say totally different
use cases
now squid teams because the Suns in my
eyes and you know so anyway so why PHP a
few reasons number one because it's the
most popular web scripting language out
there all these huge sites use it and
for the vast majority of projects people
lean on PHP because it's so accessible
what I'm talking about I'm talking about
big sites I'm talking about Yahoo
talking about the biggest is Facebook
about Twitter Twitter uses Ruby a whole
bunch of sites use PHP it's the most
popular web scripting language so this
is the one you want to use and that's
where a server-side programming that
what I mean by that that's what a
programming languages that you use on
the server that's the language that is
used to communicate with the databases
the databases directly and do all the
fancy processing on the server on the
front end the programming language
that's used in the web browser to do
things like create animations validate
forms etc
what you want to use of course is a
JavaScript there once was well there is
another option well not really but it
because it only works in IE that was
vbscript back in the days but that's
dead forget about that I'd even
mentioned that you want to learn in
JavaScript for sure and you want to
learn PHP how am I saying PHP is better
than Ruby no am I saying PHP is better
in Java no but I think overall it's the
best option because a it's easy to learn
because there's both be easy to
understand procedural part of PHP which
is the oldest discuss the old school the
old style programming and it's just
easier to learn that and this procedural
programming elbows falling way out of
favor and ultimately you're gonna have
to learn object-oriented programming
it's a good way to get your feet wet to
first learn programming is the little
procedural programming because there's a
lot less to learn again I'm not
advocating procedural programming
although it can be useful for small
small projects it's great for that but
if you jump to would say another
language like Java which is
object-oriented for the most part it's
it's a lot harder to learn because
there's so much more and you have to
learn so many more concepts and so on so
if you're new to programming you're
better off to approach it with something
like PHP because it's got that that easy
way of approaching it and the other
advantage with PHP also have the
advanced way you can you can once you've
graduated if you will from them easy to
understand procedural methodologies you
can move into the object-oriented way of
programming it's got that flexibility
another reason I would choose PHP is
because as I mention it's so widely used
that's also very fast to program with
its you know Ruby is equivalent because
they're both scripting languages which
is a type of programming versus let's
say Java or C sharp Java C sharp very
powerful very capable but again steep
learning curve harder to learn and the
code is a lot more verbose meaning at a
later you're gonna write a lot more code
to get things done
you got to set up a lot more stuff to
get things done so yeah there you go if
you're teaching web programming and
you're looking you're trying to slide
what language to teach Ruby or PHP
they're both good but in my humble
opinion it would be easier to teach PHP
to begin with and even if the ultimate
goal is to get somebody into Ruby
there's no argument for actually
teaching beginners PHP at first because
a lot of the concepts in PHP can well
flip right into Ruby or Java C sharp
later on because a lot of this stuff is
the same thing so there you go that's my
quick little video blog
