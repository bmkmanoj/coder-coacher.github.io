killer sights calm alright in this video
I want to comment on an article I
recently read about JavaScript somebody
wrote an article on his TechCrunch that
published him anyhow the gist of the
article was maybe you should consider an
alternative technology to JavaScript
when it comes to your client-side
programming because if you're writing an
application that will have a million
lines of code or more JavaScript will
not cut it or you may have problems with
JavaScript
now the first thing I have to say to
that is I'm not sure if that's the case
really because I have never written
anything close to a million lines of
code in JavaScript but that's the larger
point number two is that how often are
you gonna need to write one million
lines of JavaScript code now who does
this this is exceptionally rare and to
suggest that you change and drop an
entire languages very well-established
has amazing support through through
packages like direct jQuery and so forth
because there may be some rare instance
where you're going to need to write a
million line plus JavaScript code or
maybe I think they cited a mobile
application development again it's
somewhat relevant but I think that a lot
somewhat more relevant that a million
lines of code but to to choose a
technology or to drop a technology
rather that's very well-established like
JavaScript because of some very unusual
situation that may come up like having
to write one million lines of JavaScript
code is silly it's it's silly it's
stupid of course this author had an
agenda they were pushing a technology
that they were behind of course I'm not
sure I think they were financially
involved with it at least their company
was I'm not sure about that but the
larger point to take away from this
video blog is that you're gonna have
people go out there for whatever reasons
sometimes inexperience sometimes
because they have an agenda sometimes
they want to sell product and they're
gonna say because of some rare
circumstance like you're gonna need to
write 1 million lines of code in some
technology that you're gonna you know
you shouldn't use this technology right
it's that's silly you should when you're
looking at technologies and so on you
should look at what the common use is
and look at the big picture in terms of
what you're going to need to do with it
most of the time and how established the
technology is now today to ignore
javascript is crazy because it's such an
important part of the web today it is it
there are alternative solutions out
there for what javascript does but
they're so so nice now flash was you
know the thing that comes to mind flash
was the predominant technology for
client-side coding and it had certain
advantage and so on but then it's gone
it's gone there you know the flash guys
will argue some minor points but for the
and there's there's some validity to it
in very niche applications very rarely
you know rare circumstances the vast
majority of time of the time javascript
will do everything you need to do and a
lot more especially you know you can
just grab jQuery and other JavaScript
libraries are out there and just put
everything together real quick so be
careful when people are going to go out
there and cite these rare situations as
being a reason to drop something or to
jump into something and the reason is
because these rare things are rare
that's it that's my minority advice for
today I'm gonna have more video blogs on
different things as we're doing a whole
bunch of stuff at Kyoto sites in terms
of new content a new new system to
deliver the content we're always trying
to raise the bar a little bit improve
the quality anyway that's it thanks for
watching the video and we'll talk very
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
