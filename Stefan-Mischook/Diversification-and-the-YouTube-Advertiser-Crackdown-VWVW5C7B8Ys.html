office so diversification and the secret
sauce let's talk about diversification
diversification is a basic concept in
business and in trading and so forth
it's basically don't put all your eggs
in one basket so the recent YouTube
backlash from the appetizers if you
haven't heard about it we're all these
advertisers have decided that YouTube
was a great source of bad content and
they didn't want their ads running
beside questionable content it could be
racist it could be political etc etc now
there's a lot of debate about all this
how legitimate those claims are how
often actually happens that's not the
point of this video the point of this
video is to point out how a lot of
youtubers out there who were solely
dependent on YouTube ad revenue are
getting crushed some of them have said
that their revenues are down the money
they're making every month is down as
much as ninety-nine percent and you
don't need to be a business genius to
know that if your revenues are down
ninety-nine percent in a month that's
not good so diversification comes to
mind and I've been preaching this for
many many years now telling people that
you're better off to have ten twenty
small clients and to have two or three
big clients the attraction to big
clients is something but noob
entrepreneurs are always into they want
that big juicy client first of all it
practically never happens unless you
have very exclusive IP intellectual
property which ninety-nine point nine
percent of us don't and the reason why
big companies don't deal with small
company is because big companies or
fills with people who don't want to take
risk these are people who don't want to
hire a small company and if something
goes wrong when their heads are on the
chopping block people work for big
companies by their very nature don't
like risk that's cool and so what
they'll do before they will
our small unknown firm to do a
particular job or provide a particular
service they will hire a big firm
because if the big firm messes up they
go away I just hired the best can I tell
you so they won't be in trouble if the
big firm s is up but if they hire some
small unknown firm and small a known
unknown firm the small unknown company
messes up they're going to get be in
trouble because their bosses why don't
you hire these people nobody knew about
getting back to diversification you want
to be as diversified as possible because
if you're dependent a one or two or
three big clients if you lose one it
hurts bad it hurts bad and in fact a lot
of them will know that they are one of
your bitcoins and so they'll push you
around a little bit but if you have like
10 20 30 small clients nobody can really
push you rather they don't have leverage
on you if you use one of 20 clients and
they're all about the same size big deal
you got another 19 so when you have many
small clients and your diversified that
way you are free to fire your clients
and that's a good thing so that's what
this YouTube a situation here is
starting to teach a lot of these YouTube
creators little boy I got to find
different ways to generate income one
thing I always found kind of interesting
social networking is super important
social media marketing is super
important but you got it you got had
your own web presence that is not
dependent on some other company build
your own website so you should be having
your own website out there I don't know
if that's good English you should have
your own website out there and you
should combine traditional content
marketing with social media marketing to
to create a real strong web presence
with your own website this way your
protective so Facebook changes the way
they act YouTube changes the way they
act Instagram changes the way they have
ax nap chat whatever whatever social
media social network decides to do or
search engines side decide to do what
search engines these days it's mostly
Google at least you'd be protected
because you have sources of traffic
and your presence is going to be on all
kinds of social media networks I get
youtube twitter facebook Instagram etc
and this protects you so keep that in
mind as you may or may not know I've
been involved on the web for a long time
first website built in 1994 it's even
late 94 early 95 frankly I don't
remember doesn't matter and I've been
running popular fairly popular websites
within my knishes since 2000 2001 to
killer sites calm killer PHP calm how to
build up so everyone get the idea and so
I have a pretty good grasp of how the
web works how the underlying engines
work search engines and so forth and
people been asking me for many years and
I just never done it to reveal my secret
sauce and so I decided recently to to
venture into that would be more news
about all that coming forth but first I
gotta get this Python course then so
anyway I set up for this log I just
wanted to quickly put this out for you
guys and I gotta go do a Python video
