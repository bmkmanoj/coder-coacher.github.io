of the basics so let's actually take a
look at an HTML page and will poke
around a little bit I want you to see
what it actually looks like and we'll
continue from there let's jump into a
code editor and HTML editor we'll get
into this in a second so I'm gonna put
in some HTML code so don't worry you're
not going to understand any of this now
but slowly you will so we're just going
to say this so here you go an HTML page
in all its glory is it an amazing okay
it's not amazing this is very simple so
what you see him blue the text in blue
is HTML and what you see in black is
actual text I'm just going to highlight
it here that's going to be displayed in
the page and what's in green is a little
bit of extra information it's actually
part of the HTML as well don't worry you
don't have to understand this now but
all you're gonna know is that what's in
blue is HTML this here what we're
looking at this thing is called sublime
text and it's an app used to build
websites it's actually a code editor app
and I'll explain what code is in a
second and code editor apps are there to
make coding easier I should explain what
coding is coding is writing code code is
any computer language so HTML is a
computer language you could also call it
HTML code CSS is another computer
language used to build websites you can
call it CSS code or JavaScript to
another language another computer
language you can say it's JavaScript
code the code is just the text that you
that you write in this case is all this
and so you could say you're coding in
HTML or you're coding in CSS you get the
idea that's why sublime text here which
is a very popular app that nerds love to
use today and it's a code
editor it is an app that makes coding in
many different languages much easier and
it does that by doing things like
coloring the codes like this turns it
turns it blue and doing things called
Auto code completion what is that it
just basically helps you along as you're
coding it completes the code
automatically as you're typing it out so
let me just give you a quick example I'm
gonna read some HTML and you see that
drop down menu here this is basically
the app sublime text is suggesting to us
well do you want to write any of these
different HTML code so I'm gonna just
say we're going to select the P the one
at the top I just hit enter and it
writes it for us that's a little bit of
HTML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
