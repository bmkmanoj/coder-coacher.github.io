killer sites and killer PHP calm in this
video blog I'm going to talk about the
web design profession the web
programming profession in the context of
this big economic slowdown it's actually
more of a slowdown this is now
definitely the worst economic situation
since the Great Depression and it
actually can get worse believe it or not
it's one of the things I follow on the
side I've been a web nerd for 15 or so
years but I've been a small business
owner or an entrepreneur for longer and
so I have my keep my finger on the pulse
of what's going on out there in that
regard and so how does this figure into
web design and a web programming when it
comes down to is when you're looking at
any given profession or any type of
business you really have to look at
what's going on out there to gauge
whether or not it makes sense to jump
into it and one of the questions that
comes up I think well not i think is a
question that comes up fairly often is
how viable the web design profession is
or the web programming profession is
looking forward and this is an important
question because if you were thinking
about getting into the real estate
business now in the US or canada now
it'll probably be a bad idea given that
we just you know we just came off the
biggest boom in real estate history and
the whole thing is crumbling and it's
going to continue to crumble for another
year or two or more anyhow so back to
that again you have to really consider
where things are going not where they've
been you have to
you know so you can position yourself
properly to take advantage of these
changes the good news is that when it
comes to web design web programming this
economic upheaval is actually presents a
lot of opportunity for people who are
willing to take the time to jump into it
you see two things happen when you have
these economic appeals first of all
people lose jobs because a lot of
businesses go under and another thing
that happens is when businesses go under
people lose jobs because there's a lot
of downsizing a lot of people start
building small businesses whether it be
you know I don't know landscaping
business or growing your own garden
vegetables in organic food or making
custom clothes I don't know you're going
to see I believe over the next few years
and moving forward a many more
self-employed people small business
owners and anybody who knows anything
knows that for small business the
easiest way to reach out to people to
get new clients or to communicate with
established clients is through a website
that's clear so I see actually a nice
increase in demand for web design
services throughout Europe North America
and around the world i think that the
web has grown a lot in the last 10 years
or so 10 15 it's still a lot more
there's still a lot more growth ahead of
it because of this you know they call it
a secular change it's a huge change in
the fundamental nature of the economy
for instance print is now taking a total
beating a total shellac egg now because
of the internet magazines are going
under and
and the web is becoming the place for
newspapers magazines that kind of stuff
so a lot of print people are having to
migrate from print design to web design
and I've spoke to this in another video
so I'm not going to get into it here the
point is is that the move is towards the
web and as such web designer as web
programmers who are trained properly who
understand what to concentrate on and
where to focus neither they can do very
very well whether as independent
contractors or certainly maybe you can
stretch your own web design company or
getting a job for an established web
design firm or what programming firm is
a great profession to get into another
great thing about the web design
profession unlike so many others is that
it's truly a meritocracy basically you
get ahead if you're capable and you're
good at what you do you see the
Economist don't have that probs the
economist is about who you know because
these guys never before you know it's
like the weather man they can never tell
you what the weather is going to be so
you know but they still get their jobs
unfortunately fortunately depending how
you look at it in the web field if
you're capable if you're you can show
that you can do good work and you could
produce you will get the good gigs jobs
and you will get the good pay so it's
it's it's a good thing it's a you know
that means that if you're willing to
spend the time and effort you will find
yourself in a good position so I like
that because I'm kind of anti crony
capitalist after you've seen what all
the junk what you see in governments and
all the you know what the Wall Street
bankers have done so it's a it's a good
thing another great thing about the web
design business is that it allows people
a much more flexible lifestyle and this
is great for
younger people as it is for baby boomers
you can find yourself being able to do
web work for people web design or basic
programming from your home and part time
it's not one of these jobs or you know
you have to you have to be somewhere
sometime and you have to show up and you
have to dress or in a way none of that
exists thankfully yeah matter that
exists in Horeb so if you're a baby
boomer and you got a total beating in
your 401 K because of the stock market
scam you know everybody is down at least
forty percent your you might be looking
for an alternative stream of income
where you don't have to break your back
to get into it and you may want to just
work part-time this is a great thing to
get into because assistant nature to web
for us at killer sites we have our core
group but I bring in a lot of
contractors to help us out with the
programming and the building of things
of course a lot of these people have
been working for me for many years now
but nonetheless it's one of those
professions where you have that
flexibility you can work from home you
can get you know you can work part-time
full-time you know whatever you like and
pay is pretty good once you get the
skill sets in there and in terms of age
discrimination I don't think it's going
to be there especially there's not a lot
of face-to-face with people and if you
just produce good work you know if you
put out good sites or right you know
clean code I don't think people are
going to mine too much about whether
you're 25 or 65 or older in fact i've
had people you know I they've told me
from email anyway I have every reason to
believe them that people like I had a
woman in her just 90 years old finally I
get to the point she was 90 years old
learning web design I don't think she
was doing it to get a job but it was
just something to you know / find a
hobby for a worker mine anyway the point
is and to summarize if
you're looking at web design or web
programming as a profession I think
you're going to find that it's the trend
is very favorable towards the web design
professions and the web programming
professions if you approach it properly
and you're trained properly you don't
want to use old school web design
techniques you don't want to think like
you have to think five six seven years
ago you got to think about now and today
and of course we would cover all about
in our courses thanks for watching I'm
