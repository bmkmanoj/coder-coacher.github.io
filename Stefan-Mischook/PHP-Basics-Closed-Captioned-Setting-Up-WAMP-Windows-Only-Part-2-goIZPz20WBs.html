installed you notice that this screen is
a different size than the other videos
because i want to show you different
parts of the desktop and windows to show
you where I'm going so that you can see
how I started things up so to get back
to WebP once you've installed the web
server you go to your Start menu you go
to programs and you choose web server
and you select the start web server
with web server up and running what
you're going to see in your Windows
Explorer bar down here I believe that's
what it's called you can see this little
icon here in the tray so if you click on
this you see this nice little menu here
that web creates which allows you to
conveniently access different lamp
resource for example PHP my admin which
is that web software that web
application written PHP designed to
allow you to control your mysql and so
forth and there's a bunch of other
things you can do
the other thing I want to point out is
that if you can go over under services
you have a patchy in MySQL know if you
go an Apache knows that you can stop the
service you can restart it you can start
it again when it when it when it's off
so right now we know it's running
because this this whole start / resume
service option here is grayed out so we
know that's running well and if we go to
mysql under services again the same type
of thing we know mysql is running
because the stop service button is
available to be clicked and the start /
resume service is actually great out
another thing we can do from the MySQL
button is we can open up the MySQL
console this is basically a Doss like
window a text-only window where you can
control my SQL by writing in code now
this is one way but you may have to use
depending on your server but for most
web hosting packages they will provide
PHP mine min so they can easily edit
through web page your mysql setup don't
way we're going to get into this later
on in the video when we actually get
into mysql but for now i want you to
understand the web console here but
allows you to restart your services and
check whether things are running or not
and it's a nice convenient way to get
things going now when you when you're
done using lamp after you've done your
coding for the day you can just right
click on the icon and select exit and
then I will actually stop all the web
services for you
okay at this point I assume that you
either have wamp installed if you're on
Windows or you have zamp installed if
you're using Mac OS or Linux or better
yet or easier yet you just establish
that your web host allows you to run PHP
scripts so you can simply upload the
scripts there and you don't have to
install anything on your computer for
now having said that we're ready to go
the boring stuff is covered now we can
actually move in and start writing
actual PHP code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
