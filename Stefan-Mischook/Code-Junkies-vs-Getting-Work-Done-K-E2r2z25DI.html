recently made a good comment about a lot
of the course creators or a lot of the
programmers out there and he made
mention how they seem to get caught up
in the details about coding about the
cool new things in coding or cool new
frameworks and seem to be really
concerned about the technology or the
tools that they were using rather than
getting the job done and this yes I
agree they see a lot of this I've been
guilty of this myself in a previous vlog
or a vlog of mission repulsion I talked
about camera people where they get all
caught a lot of people they get all
caught up in the lenses they get all
caught up in the cameras and constantly
buying and selling lenses and you're
chasing after this perfect image you
know and meanwhile they're saying so
much energy trying to get the perfect
image they're not spending too much time
trying to get out good video or good
pictures route to speaking and I've been
guilty of that with microphones and
talked about this in previous vlogs
where I have literally spent thousands
and thousands of dollars on expensive
and different types of mics I know when
he makes like I may have bought big
eight nine mics over the years German
mics and high-end all kinds of mics and
I'm I just went insane at one point
trying to get the best sound the best
sound the best cell and I spent so much
effort on trying to get the best sound I
remember at one point I was spending
like at least as much time trying to get
the best sound and I was actually trying
to put out my content
this is stupid it's stupid you should
just get your sound setup loss event
take and go with it nothing you had what
I did I ended up taking one of my it's a
good mic but it's kind of a middle to
roll mic and well it's a high-end mic
but nonetheless now I don't think about
it at all I just I just have to cut
myself off from the other options
because when you look at technology
you're never going to find the perfect
tech whether it be in coding frameworks
or libraries or whether it be in camera
gear in lenses whether it be in
microphones whatever you never
gonna find a perfect situation saving
with cold so is a coding youtube channel
so let's talk about coding business
you're never going to build the first
app the first time around this is the
big illusion this is the big fakery
that you hear about business hotter guy
came out the first business doesn't work
that way
apps and code and and business ideas and
businesses they get refined over time it
get refined over time when you start off
a business you have to have a sort of
like a vague end goal but you have to be
expect you have to expect that you're
going to run into all kinds of problems
you got to expect that you're going to
have to change things you're going to
have to reef angle things and often
times where you end up will be a very
different place than where you started
and Sammy would perhaps you know when I
was doing software development as a
freelancer back in the late 90s early
2000s I I really got very profitable
when I realized that most of the
absolute rule for clients weren't ever
going to get used much by the clients
not because the abstinent work it's just
if the clients will get caught up in
this and caught up in that and it just
they weren't use much so they said you
know instead of trying to write
rock-solid super solid code that was
unbelievable with the latest frameworks
and latest this and that and deployments
and so on and security and so forget it
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to release as quickly as possible to get
the software in the hands of the clients
as quickly as possible to see how they
react to it because oftentimes is going
to be all come on oftentimes there's
always going to be tons of changes
required in your app it's just the way
it is it's not because you're in
confidence not because the clients
stupid it's just because it's the way it
is people don't know what they want
until they start using it and they start
playing with them they start trying to
figure out how it works this is this is
a truism across a whole range of
business and and software added boost in
software it's anything with business
I've been in business inside that 18
years old started with two hundred
dollars to my name that's not two
hundred dollars in my bank account two
hundred dollars to my name accounting
the old mattresses to sleep on terms of
my the value of my assets and I just
slowly slowly built it up and where that
first business ended up was the
import-export business soft
manufacturing color dry goods and stuff
it was it was in a different place than
I had envisioned the money was coming in
from products that I'd never considered
where thought they would come in from
and the things that I thought were going
to do really well didn't do well at all
and yet II area and then I end up and
then I ended up not business and
starting something else boom boom boom
boom boom and Here I am today in I have
to tell you in 2003 when I started to
produce my first course official course
on video I was like I had no
expectations of anything I just I just
said I'll do it why not you know I
bought it so I bought a cheap mic for
fifteen dollars and it was on sale for
five bucks it was looks like when he's
might you plug into your computer and it
is recorded like you know whatever
neither Google Google it was terrible
sounds like going into the metro
boo-boo-boo-boo-boo you know it sounded
like that half the time and I'd have the
window open in my place and I lived
downtown in a court of City so sometimes
sirens would be going by and I would be
too too lazy to want to start over
because of sirens and I couldn't it
wasn't very good at editing back then
compared to today and so I got like to
say ignoring sirens and that was my
venerable course called web design what
very original name yes but it did super
well people loved the sirens and I just
got the job done
and I just got the job done I didn't
care you know whatever the salable
voices gator to see what happens
and I have to tell you if in 1996 or 97
90 if somebody were told me yeah you
would be selling lots of courses and
people your beginning their millions of
page views on your coding related sites
every month
I would never have thought it was not
something that occurred to me you know
prior to it happening so there you go I
don't know how I got on this tangent but
I hope it was useful to you
