code is essential to your child's
education there are benefits to it and
here to tell us more about it I'm going
by stefan michelle keith the president
of studio web how are you I'm very good
today how are you I'm great thank you
thank you so much for being here really
appreciate it first of all when it comes
to could describe what is code exactly
holding is writing written instructions
to tell computers what to do so the
computer could be a home computer it
could be your laptop it could be your
thermostat right everything is run by
cold these days so it's really important
all part of life for those of us that
aren't tech savvy like myself I think
it's intimidating when you hear code and
writing code is it fairly easy to pick
up on a beginners level yeah if it's
taught properly it is it just has to be
broken down because at the end of the
day the instructions that code provides
his computers which is very simple
instructions right so it's like you know
if somebody clicks on a button to this
if they drag on the screen do that but
you just got to learn it step by step I
mentioned in the introduction that it's
a benefit for children to learn it in
their curriculum at school even starting
from from kindergarten and right fruits
Asia why it what are the benefits well
there's two two benefits to big benefits
the obvious one is the jobs
opportunities huge amount of jobs that
are now available I have a terrible time
trying to find good coders it really
it's very very difficult and that's why
the one of the reasons the TPP deal is
being pushed is because they want to try
to bring encoders Ramon around the world
right because they're just not enough
supply and this is going to go on for
decades apparently according to studies
in addition to that so what about the
students who don't want to come coders
or may not become coders right there is
tremendous I call brain training
advantage to learning to code you learn
or organic organizational skills
problem-solving skills you learn to work
with other people collaborate so there's
a lot of benefits and you know last
thing I like to point out is just you
become much more aware become
more of a digital citizen if you will so
it's a lot more difficult for instance
scan somebody who knows coding right
yeah of course so you need a lot of fun
the protecting a food the people so how
have you gone about implementing it then
then in schools have they been fairly
open to it what broke our we were
actually approached about six years ago
I built the prototype I've been teaching
closed since 2003 but dealing with the
private market just individuals
producing video courses online training
and so forth so we were approached about
six years ago five years ago by couple
schools in the States because we had
built a prototype for a system which is
now studio web so it's okay let's go
with it and since that time we work with
that school and many other schools now
and I can sort of to learn how to do it
properly because when you're teaching
middle school elementary school high
school is very different from teaching
adult learners how is it different well
you have to break down material in a
simple way we'll give you one example
the we have the YouTube generation today
so they're very short attention spans
right yeah so we step videos were like
10 minutes long it's video basically
watch a video they get quiz they
interact with the system the systems
tracking all their your performance and
their input so if they had videos here
longer than six seven minutes they would
just start falling asleep so that's just
one thing we had to do we have to show
in the videos and you know to figure all
this stuff out we didn't do with many
many schools and like we've even flown
down spend a day or two sitting in the
classrooms watching how the students
interacting with the systems and so on
so it's a live at psychology right
understanding psychology of the learner
if parents are watching right now and
they'd like to see their school
implement teaching code it can they can
they you know sort of talk to their
school to the principal to teachers and
encourage them to get in touch with you
that's what I would suggest you see it
Canada is just starting to look at this
now but if you look at the UK France
they've mandated code its core
critically it's reading writing math
coat because if you value even President
Obama started initiative about a year
and a half of
on the US and the White House is
spearheading this big initiative and
they have these schools now these
leagues of schools these districts like
we're hooked up with one they're called
the League of innovative schools and
they have about three million students
in general and in total there they're
looking at new ways to integrate code
into the classroom and they're trying to
figure all this out well you've
obviously told us that so many benefits
available out there for students we
really appreciate you spending time with
us this morning thank you very much well
thanks for having me my pleasure net all
