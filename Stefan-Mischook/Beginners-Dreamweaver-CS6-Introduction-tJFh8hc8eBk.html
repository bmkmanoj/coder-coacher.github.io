Dreamweaver cs6 video tutorial this
video is going to be dealing with all
facets of working within Dreamweaver cs6
and we'll be covering a number of
different topics including how the
interface works creating basic pages
inside of Dreamweaver will eventually be
learning about styling content with CSS
and really a ton of information about
different ways that we can incorporate
html5 and css3 inside of Dreamweaver
will be starting with a really simple
interface a very common 960 fixed pixel
layout and as you can see here divided
into three common sections and we'll be
learning about working with rollover
graphics whether those are going to be
produced with simple CSS CSS 3 with some
animation or as we'll see eventually
we'll be integrating more images into
our three column layout and will also be
discussing how to deal with those
pictures as rollovers whether or not to
use JavaScript or CSS 3 or just simple
CSS will also be discussing how html5
video can work inside of your designs
and there are a number of things that we
must keep in mind when discussing that
particular topic as well we'll be
looking at all kinds of different ways
of using css3 transitions something else
that's new inside of Dreamweaver and as
you can see here we can integrate
anything from these types of movements
or as you can see in these links as well
as down here nice transitional color
changes inside of these two designs
inevitably will be moving towards
looking at your design inside of a much
more responsive type of layout this is
also new inside of Dreamweaver cs6 and
will now be able to use Dreamweaver to
create much more liquid layouts ones
that will look just as good on an iPad
as well as an iPhone
these are all the different topics that
we're going to be discussing inside of
this particular tutorial and we're going
to do that beginning with the next video
