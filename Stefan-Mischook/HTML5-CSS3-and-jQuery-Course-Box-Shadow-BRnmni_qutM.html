more css3 features and I happen to have
a number of websites open here at the
moment as you can see we're looking at
the one that we just completed in the
last video so this is our progress file
with the rounded corners in place but
what I'm going to introduce to you right
now is a new css3 selector that deals
with that's not the selector it's
actually the property that deals with a
box shadow so the box shadow property
and as you'll notice here in our
progress file we have in our content
area this little line that's on the side
of this containing box right now I mean
that's fine I have no problem with it
but given that we're looking at css3
features if I go to the older version
the one that actually is finished you'll
notice that there is a slight difference
here we actually happen to have a little
drop shadow going all the way across and
you may or may not notice it's rather
subtle even on the links you'll notice
that on the hover effect there's a bit
of a drop shadow on the top and the
bottom of those links so let's see how
we can implement the box shadow in our
design so if you're still working with
the progress which is what I'm looking
at right here I'm going to ask you to go
to the style and if you remember from
our source code here's the source code
next to the navigation we have the
article tag and the article tag is the
one that we want to put our drop shadow
on so if we go to our CSS stylesheet and
we go to article then go to the progress
one here it is here is our article and
at the moment you'll notice that it is
floating on the right-hand side it's got
a border color and a border style of
solid with a 1 pixel amount however
you'll notice that we will now put in
or box-shadow so to do so we just put in
the words box dash shadow but as you may
remember with many of the different
things that we've been working with with
regards to css3 we often have to add
some extra information for different
browsers and we'll get to that in just a
second but first of all let's look at
the declarations that we put into the
box shadow right now I'm just putting 0
you don't have to write pixels but i'll
put in pixels in case you want to add
some more amounts later on and 0 pixels
and 5 pixels and a color of 888 which is
kind of a grayish color well let's run
through exactly what this means here
this first amount and again anytime
you're using 0 you don't have to put px4
pixels but i'm putting it in here in
case you want to add some more a little
bit later on but basically what this is
saying is horizontal shadow vertical
shadow so in other words how much of the
shadow is going to happen horizontally
and vertically where is it going to be
placed horizontally or vertically on
that particular box in this case the
article so horizontal and vertical and 5
pixels here is for the blur amount how
much of that blur is happening in other
words if we set this to 0 we would just
end up with you know a gray line
depending on how thick it would be but
right now this is a blur amount so I'm
really as you can see here only just
blurring 5 pixels and that's going
everywhere not just horizontal and
vertically and here is just what color
you want that actual shadow to be so
that's pretty easy simple enough if you
can see it and compare it to anything
else that we've been doing up to this
point however as I've mentioned with
css3 there's often the need to address
other browsers and in this case what we
want to be addressing are the WebKit
browsers and the WebKit browsers would
you know compose google chrome or
are working with Safari and here I'm
just going to say dash WebKit dash box
dash shadow so really all we got to do
to make it work in that amount I'm going
to give it exactly the same amount as we
had before and as you can see i'm just
going to put in a little comment here to
let you and everybody else know that
this is for safari don't forget to close
that comment so here is our safari
declaration so let's save it and let's
jump on over to our browser and i'm
going to go to the correct one this is
my progress file and you'll notice
normally we don't see anything happening
here but as soon as i refresh this
amount ah look at that you have a means
of separating this area from this area
just by adding a little bit of a drop
shadow now if we had a lighter
background than the one that I have here
I might be inclined to add some drop
shadow effect on the sides of this whole
containing document but in this case all
I really want to do is to address the
article right here in this section so
that's great but as I mentioned in the
earlier method we also notice that there
were drop shadows on the navigational
elements that we have right here on the
side so I'm going to direct you to your
CSS style sheet yet again and let's take
a look if you remember the drop shadow
is only invoked when the links are
rolled over so it is in fact the hover
state of the link that I'm particularly
interested in so why don't we come in
here and there's really not much that we
need to do other than copy paste the
information that we had just a second
ago so I copy that box shadow amount put
it in here and when we save this it's a
very subtle effect because we already
have the greens but notice if i refresh
this now we still have
drop shadow here and check it out now
there's this very soft and subtle just a
little bit of a shadow effect right on
the edges there so that can show you
some pretty interesting things one last
thing I want to mention about the box
shadow there's one extra declaration
that i'm not using at the moment and
since i'm in safari I'll illustrate that
by just putting it into the safari but
I'm going to remove it soon enough so
you can choose to do this if you want or
not but I'm just putting it in to show
it to you even though I will be removing
it because I'm not really i like crazy
about how it looks in our design
although it can look really nice in
other designs so check this out we can
also indicate that the drop shadow
should be inset and what that means is
rather than have the shadow be on the
outside of our article we're going to
have it on the inside of the article so
i'm going to save this and let's jump on
over to safari just a preview now as we
can see this is my article area here and
the drop shadow is on the outside of
that but if I preview this with the
inset effect notice kind of subtle again
but the article area looks like it's
lower than the navigational area simply
because this is now in set is not fun so
that shows you some of the differences
between those two and as you can see
kind of gives us the illusion that this
navigation area seems to be higher than
this area down here that would be made
even more noticeable if you had two
different colors on either side of these
or even just a very subtle change in the
white I mean this is not actually pure
white at the moment but you can make it
even more off-white if you want it to
create more of that sort of separation
now I'm going to stick with the normal
one that we were working with so I'm
going to just remove that and save it
and as you can see if I come back in
here and preview that you can see now
it's on the outside and this area
actually seems as if it
is a higher level than this area down
here this one now seems as if it's
pushed in the background so that's a
great new feature with css3 called box
shadow when we come back I'm going to
show you some more css3 as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
