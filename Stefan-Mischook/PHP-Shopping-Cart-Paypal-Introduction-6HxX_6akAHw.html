I'm gonna be showing you how to set up a
PayPal shopping cart this first video is
going to discuss some of the I guess o
underlying technologies very briefly and
also what that shopping cart looks like
and what we should end up with at the
end of this series we're gonna be using
PHP with XML to store our shopping cart
and we're gonna be doing this with
PayPal and PayPal offers a whole suite
of different tools to interface your web
application your shopping cart with
their services however we're gonna be
using the simplest one since the goal of
this video is essentially or this video
package is just to provide you with the
tools to create a simple shopping cart
so what we see here is we've got
essentially three pages we've got view
cart view store and clear cart if I view
my cart right now I've got two cans of
tomato soup and one bag of pasta we are
also using the shipping and we're also
calculating totals I can clear my cart
right here and if I go back I can also
add another can of tomato soup to my
cart and I can buy it there or I can go
back to the store and add some fresh
cumin as well and maybe I'll add two
more orders of pasta as well so
obviously this interface could be in
built upon and you could add some more
functionality however by the end of this
video series you'll understand the
underlying structure well enough to be
able to do that on your own we're also
using the PayPal sandbox so if I hit by
now I'm gonna be taken right now
initially to the sandbox server for
PayPal however we can very easily flip
that on to the production PayPal server
for moving our website from the sandbox
where fake transactions occur and fake
emails are sent to the production server
where real transactions occur and real
money is sent
so at the top here you can see that
PayPal has recognized the different
products and their quantities including
the shipping and handling which we're
also gonna be covering in this video and
I'm just gonna log in as a dummy user
now normally any regular PayPal user
would be able to log in and they would
see this which is essentially their bill
and I've got a fake credit card here so
I'll hit pay now and once the
transaction has been completed if I go
to the PayPal Development Center which
we're also going to cover we're gonna
set up a PayPal user developer's account
so that we can do all this kind of
testing and I go to the test email page
we'll see the transaction that's just
occurred and that information gets
communicated both to the seller and to
the buyer and if I go back to the test
accounts page I can actually log in to
what is essentially a duplicate of the
PayPal website but it's just for doing
development testing so I'm gonna log in
now as a business user which is BBB
and you'll see that I've got a nice
balance here which is from all the fake
transactions that have occurred and this
way you don't need to set up all of the
regular business information to set up
the shopping cart that you want to
integrate into the paypal services so
that's a quick overview of what we're
going to accomplish in this video series
in the next video I'm gonna talk a
little more about the terminology we're
gonna talk about what XML is what
refactoring is and you might hear me
throw that term around a little we're
gonna talk about an IDE and Eclipse and
why we're using Eclipse to get this job
done as opposed to something like
Dreamweaver or some basic text editor
and and that should be about it I'm John
Leventhal and thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
