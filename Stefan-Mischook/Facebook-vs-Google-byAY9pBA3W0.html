calm killer PHP calm killer video stored
on anyone bunch of sites in this video
blog I want to briefly talk about
Facebook vs google plus they're both
social networks and one big issue that
concerns me and a good business lesson
and a life lesson I supposed well not
know about life lesson but anyway here
it goes here we go you got google plus
you got facebook google+ is just
starting to rise pretty quickly the big
difference between google+ and facebook
is google+ is far more i think it's
better organized easy to know what's
going on and what are the most important
aspects of that organization is the
security google+ makes it much more it's
much easier to create you know private
content if you will on your profile
whereas with facebook they really make
it difficult like the privacy settings
is just is this a real mess and i
blogged about this recently text block
and you know when you have a situation
there where the configuration for
something is very complex it's either
because a that programmers are
incompetent or be there purposefully
trying to make it harder for you to make
aspects of your profile private i
personally believe that they're doing
the lighter i personally have no inside
information is just a speculation based
on my experience I think they're
purposefully making hard and convoluted
to make information hot a private
because that's which Facebook does they
sell your information and they want to
be able to sell detailed profiles about
all these people so you can sell to
marketers the FBI maybe if you're that
rumor or whatnot that's a problem
because I don't know about you guys I
think it's not a good idea to have all
your personal information
out there on the web there's freely
accessible or accessible for a price
because you know you've heard of
identity theft right and the way to
protect yourself is have some aspects of
you know at least some aspects of your
life to be anonymous to be secret so you
got to be careful about that whole
privacy thing that's that's just me
another reason why I think they're doing
a purpose at Facebook and again
emphasize I think I'm no insider
knowledge here is that I've learned in
business the last 18 20 years I've been
in business that whenever you have
something that's unnecessarily complex
like a contract or whatnot it's usually
done so because people are trying to
hide something it's a smoke screen it's
a way to hide their true intentions
that's why you have very thick contracts
a lot of times it's very common tactic
actually where they put in they want to
take 10,000 pages so that people can't
figure out the hell's going on they can
hide all kinds of little details it
changes everything in the front page
right that's why for instance the least
recent Wall Street legislation in the
u.s. it was like fifteen thousand pages
or 1500 pages or something some
ridiculous number pages whereas the
previous legislation that were very well
glass-steagall I now I'm going into
details but I'm getting to a point the
previous legislation that was very
effective from the 1930s to keep the
banks from playing their little games
was only 15 pages 15 pages versus like
1500 or 15,000 so the reason the one in
the 1930s was 15 pages and was quite
effective is because it was it was you
know they weren't trying to hide stuff
it was very simple to point banks can
only do this they can't do that whereas
when you have the 1500 page document or
15,000 page free what it is now it's
reason it's so complex is because
they're trying to they're putting on all
these little ifs and buts and yeah this
situation and they're hiding all this
stuff so people won't see it right
that's that's keep that in mind so I say
it's a life lesson or a business lesson
because I always tell people when you're
doing web design work or web programming
work and you're maybe setting up
contract signing contracts keep them
very simple very simple contracts are
very simple to defend and are very
simple to understand if you have
complexity in the contract you're asking
for trouble you're asking for trouble
it's been all kind of money on lawyers
and you're probably going to get in the
n that means screw so there you have it
so personally we do use Facebook just a
tiny bit but I got all kinds of fans of
killer sites on there I don't really use
it much because I don't want people to
know all my personal business even
though I'm a public in a sense i think
is this a bad thing i would i'm not
going to use it very much as well i'm
not a social networking guy you might
want to go more into like a Google+
maybe simply because you get better
securities controls and so on and you
know now you don't want to get divorced
or lose your job because of some stupid
photos you posted on Facebook or some
stupid photos or stories that your
friends posted on Facebook about you
then your your prospective employer sees
this and says that's inappropriate you
get farted anyway you get the idea so
there you go not directly tech related
but you know you get to shut off the
video anytime you like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
