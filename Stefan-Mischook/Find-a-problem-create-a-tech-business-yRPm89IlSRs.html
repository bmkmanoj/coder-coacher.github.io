the same shirt every day I'm actually
doing several vlogs in a row because
it's just easier for me to set up the
shop once required several vlogs and
release them over a few days so in this
vlog I want to talk about the backwards
approach that many startup companies
take and why I'm not in favor of this
backward approach but yeah a lot of
people would argue against me so you see
going around out there has got us photo
of I think Ford saying if I would ask my
customers customers what they wanted I
wouldn't they would have told me faster
horses something something to that
effect I'm paraphrasing but you get the
idea so the notion the idea they're
trying to put out there is that as
somebody who's developing a business as
an innovator you have to you can't go to
the clients you know your clients don't
know what they want and that is
sometimes the case but no that's like
that's like saying you see that guy who
won the lottery he won the lottery
look you play the lottery you good you
could win it it's that fluky the vast
majority of businesses who take that
approach the Ford approach crash and
burn failed miserably fail miserably if
you look at the successes of vc-backed
startups that's the case now if you're
spending all these investors money you
know I guess what do you care you don't
want you to spend tons of money and you
see throw a bunch of stuff against the
wall you see what stinks that's their
approach to business that's not real
business that's business based on this
gamblers approach to business real
business is the opposite its flipped
it's not here's my product let's see if
we can find clients who want it
that's the VC approach which i think is
you know
whatever I just said what I think the
wise approach to business is to get to
know a particular market really well
whatever it may be it could be you know
meat processing it could be water
purification it could be making bagels I
don't know whatever business it is that
you're looking at you if you know it
well and then you can identify a
potential problem in that business
something that needs to be fixed
something that has to be addressed that
is how you actually build a successful
business it's much more likely that
you're going to be successful if you
take that approach then the silly idea
that you're gonna come up with something
and then Henry and even do it Ford style
or Steve Jobs style and have success you
see Steve Jobs he's had he had several
failures as well and he had a couple of
mega successes but you can't it goes
back to something I've talked about for
years you can't have expect a lottery
ticket business strategy to be the
winning strategy
you know the Hail Mary pass and football
you know sometimes they work but most
the time they don't like you know I'm
not a big football fan I don't watch my
football but one thing I've known is
that they they move the ball up the the
field right boom boom boom boom and then
eventually you get to the end zone
businesses like that as well it's very
rare it's exceptionally rare and that's
why you you know that's why yours they
write stories about them and make movies
all about them it's very rare that you
come up with a product out of late your
head based on you know intuition if you
will Steve Jobs is the you know one of
the most probably the most famous
entrepreneur because of that because he
was able to do it a few times in his
but even that's a bit of an illusion
because you know you know when he came
out with the iPhone he didn't really
invent the iPhone out of the blue you
know people were using some primitive
form of smartphone they had hard
keyboards in the BlackBerry devices you
know comes to mind and so he just
improved upon that that's the illusion
of Apple Apple tends to wait to see what
the the real innovators the guys who are
throwing stuff against the wall do they
see uh there's an attraction there and
let's see how we can fix the problem in
that particular market so that so that
when I see that Ford quote where he says
very worthy quote I'm saying you know if
I would ask my clients they would say
give me faster horses
that's like misleading because he was
just lucky he was very lucky but he had
the foresight to see that I questioned
to see if he ever if this guy ever had
any other luck besides the car right
people get lucky and anybody who who's
honest about business will tell you luck
plays a major role so I always say don't
count on being super ultra lucky even
when you go with the approached business
but I suggest that you identify a
problem within industry within a
situation that you can solve with
technology even that approach which is
far far far more likely even a success
even that requires a little bit of luck
as well but at least it's grounded in
some solid information solid data you
are identifying a problem and then
you're innovating to solve that problem
just innovating out of your head is
likely going to fail and don't believe
don't take my word for it look at the
statistics in terms of success rates of
startups</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
