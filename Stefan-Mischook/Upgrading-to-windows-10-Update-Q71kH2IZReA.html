the upgrade from windows 7 on my old SSD
based laptop believe it or not this is a
34 year old laptop and it's working
pretty good I just played around with it
a little bit let's see if I can pop it
open for you and it takes about a few
seconds to come out of sleep mode the
web browser launches very quickly of
course it was so still open open code
here Firefox there we go so it's not bad
it's a sublime text for code editors
here click my pad properly there we go
so not too bad anyway so yeah Windows 10
installed it seems to run pretty much at
the same speed as it did with windows 7
but Windows 10 is a better operating
system that's for sure it's much better
than windows 7i fine especially have it
if you have a touch screen windows 10 is
a hybrid touch screen and this
traditional interface you just click a
little button and the way you go there's
a side panel anyway whatever my laptop
is not touch screen but it still works
fine with windows 10 which is kind of
cool that was a problem with windows 8
you needed a touch screen device to be
able to use Windows 8 effectively
Windows 10 no problem so there you go I
upgraded my 34 year old laptop although
it was an SSD well it is it is an SSD
based computer and I three in there and
it runs pretty good so far so I think
you know based on my experience of one
machine Windows 10 is actually working
pretty good so far anyway that's my
update job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
