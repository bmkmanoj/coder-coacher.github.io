work now my infrastructure work in terms
of the apps and the server component of
what I do is now slowly slowly coming to
an end meaning after literally years of
working out details about the most
mostly of sooty web app and other things
we've got something pretty solid now and
so the role that I'm going to be taking
or the focus as my work is going to flip
from infrastructure foundational work
flipping into marketing so I'm pretty
stoked about that what are the things
that you look at when you're sitting up
a new business is setting up workflows
that are efficient a workflow might be
how you will talk about coding as an
example how you organize your team under
you could be a team of you one it could
be a team of three four people in terms
of how the project work is handed out to
various individuals you know whether
you're going to use github and your
protocol if you will in terms of how you
handle branching in terms of your
codebase and how it's submitted you get
irregular cetera it could be also in
terms of the type of servers that you
use and how you're going to guarantee
that your servers are properly backed up
everything is up-to-date and passionate
secure what is the protocol what is the
workflow for that and because of me
where I'm doing I'm doing a lot of
content creation on the primary content
creator the workflow is in terms of how
to produce the video whether it be
vlogging style whether it be screencasts
what is the process what mics to use
what cameras do you use what editing
software how you integrate all these
different things together for instance
recently somebody on YouTube and thanks
a lot for pointing that out mention how
my s's was getting into eight years
they're pretty good headphones and that
is called icing in the
audio the audio industry audio audio
engineer industries se so it's like
literally depending on the individual
speaker they may emphasize these the s
sound and it can Pierce right into ear I
know how there's if you've got a certain
type of headset speakers and so I really
appreciate that
guy pointing it out because I go yes
chew it may happen only once in a while
when you're speaking yes when you're
saying a word rather has s in it like
snakes
it's annoying though it's annoying
though and especially in my situation
where people might be listening to my
videos for you know ten minute videos at
a time five minutes videos at time and
they got the headphones on you know what
no ethics peering into your eardrums
right is annoying so what I do in terms
of workflow there's a couple options
most people will they'll deal with that
with software you got software in your
your audio editing software you can just
it would take care of the esses it will
knit with track them nail them nail them
oh just so we'll just lower the volume
for that split second as the S comes out
so this appears the person's ear what
I've done though because of the editing
software that I use doesn't have a very
good sound editing tool so what I used
to have to do is export the sound into a
separate file import it into a separate
app applied the de-esser filter to get
rid of those annoying piercing asses
then bring it back into the video
integrate it and then output the whole
thing a lot of steps a lot of steps so
what did I do I want old school I got
this years ago I got a de-esser which is
a piece of hardware that you pipe you
pipe the mic right into it and de-esser
will actually eliminate all the icing
for you and if I feel like I want to put
a picture of it right here this is what
it is piece of hardware from the late
80s Early 90s nobody uses these anymore
but for me it's super useful because I
don't want to have to export my audio
track apply a filter bring it back in
it's all these excerpts now that I get
the hardware de-esser it does it for me
as a recording fantastic so that's an
example of working at a workflow and
really when you're setting up the
business or you're setting up your
process your workflow process for coding
the workflow is huge once you resolve
your workflow everything else becomes
much much easier so it's kind of cool
the reason I got on this vlog actually
is because of two-factor authentication
authentication I talked about this in a
previous video but it's want to remind
you to factor authentication
authentication scheming if you don't
know what it is it's just basically
having your accounts when you log into
some online account by key accounts etc
etc your Google counts your YouTube
account where if you log in the account
in question the system in question will
send you a text message on your cell
phone and then you have to get you get a
code and usually a six digit number and
then you have to enter that code before
you can log in this is a very important
a little security this means even if
somebody were to guess your password
with two-factor authentication it
becomes they can't get it it can't get
in unless they have your cell phone so
it's pretty secure and what some people
do if they're very big bloggers for
instance what they'll do is they will
have a private cell phone a private
numbers only for two-factor
authentication
now you can get that up in Canada you
can get cell phones that are not bound
to your name they're just a number and
you pay for that and you're anonymous a
lot of criminals use that apparently but
you can get these like gas stations and
stuff so that might be a smart thing to
do is to get a separate little phone but
just it's just there for two-factor
authentication
it provides a very nice extra level of
security reason I mentioned that private
phone because some big youtubers in the
state's they had to factor that the case
but the the hacker would just call up
the cellphone company say can you
transfer that number I lost my phone to
this new phone and and and the cell
phone company dweebs would do it which
is crazy I would think I would hope that
they would sue the cell phone company
for such a breach because they're not
supposed to do that unless you give them
all kinds of passwords and all kinds of
personal information but only you know
anyhow I guess that's pretty much it so
two-factor authentication if you haven't
set it up on your YouTube account or any
other accounts you use and if they do
offer it which today they should so
Shuster some personal information in
there do set it up because let me tell
you I sleep like a baby now at night
knowing but I have to factor
authentication people just can I get
into my accounts unless I have my cell
phone and my private cell phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
