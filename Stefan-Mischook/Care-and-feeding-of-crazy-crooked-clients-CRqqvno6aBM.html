and feeding of crazy crooked clients
this is the subject of this video blog
so i think you can understand a crazy
and a crooked client might be they could
be crazy and crooked it could be crazy
and not crooked but it could just be
crooked or it can just be I'm not very
experienced with regards to app and web
design development so it comes down to
the way that you staged the relationship
between you and your client that will
prevent a lot of problems when you first
meet your client you have to be clear
calm and transparent about how the
process is going to go and you have to
get things down on paper with your
contract contract is huge and by having
a contract in a way your position it to
your client who could be great client
but they can also be crazy crooked as
well the way you position the contract
where you each have a signed copy is
that you say this will prevent any
disputes this will help prevent disputes
and it will be clear about each of our
responsibilities in this transaction
that's a very reasonable position as a
transparent position any reasonable
person was okay that's cool that makes
sense we want to make sure that we
everybody understands where we're going
in this situation so you should indicate
in that contract how are you going to
get paid I talked about the thirty-three
percent split how many revisions there
should be there should be three
revisions after you deliver the first
draft how you know timeliness in terms
of payment and so on so forth I think
I'll do another blog on my top five
clauses but I would include in a
contract so yeah so when you're doing
with the crazy clients it's it's about
setting up the situation setting up the
relationship up front so you understand
where you are going because let me give
you an example of cryptic liar crooked
client might
have you do a bunch of work back and
forth we'll talk about a website for
instance could be a web app could be an
app could be whatever have you come back
and forth though we respects and this
and that and have paid you maybe half up
front and then when you're like
ninety-five percent of the work is done
and then they'll go wow that's quite
sure if I like this but how about you
just give me what you got and we'll call
it even even though you've done
ninety-five percent of work you will get
paid half right those type of things or
you might have a client just immature
they uh I've seen a lot of times in my
experience as a developer clients who
don't know what they're doing they're a
lot they tend to wrongly assume about
what is hard to do versus what is not
hard to do so for instance they may find
that implementing a cinematograph within
a website is a huge amount of work
whereas you know setting up an
authentication system is like nothing
come on login system it's simple
everybody does it but they'll think that
the cinemagraph is I oh my god wow
that's amazing so you know so the a lot
of times they have no idea about they
have no appreciation about how long
something can take to do it's it's
deceptive if you've been learning web
development recently a website you can
see you know yourself that it could take
a long time just to tweak a layout just
to get it right or to get a feature
going properly you can take a lot longer
than you would think right because
there's all these little things that
come up at slow down the whole process
yeah so dealio crooked or crazy clients
having strict parameters upfront on
paper on contract is a good preventive
measure also using the payment schedule
233 payment schedules as we discussed
before plays a role in terms of allowing
you to control the situation people tend
to act more seriously when they're
seriously invested in a project so that
means if you after you after you
delivered a first draft where you've
gotten sixty-six percent of the money
they're much more likely
you clients are to respect the process
because they know that they've put
nearly two-thirds of the money into this
project or as if you haven't forbid
don't take any money upfront which is
the silliest thing you could possibly do
then they won't take you too seriously
because they don't have anything
invested right so yes that's basically
the solution crooked crazy clients in
time you also have to learn to identify
them and you're going to get a feel for
that pretty early on so and sometimes
the crookedness is not so obvious like
for instance you might have a client who
keeps on trying to bleed you of your
time well I don't like this color of
green I can be able slightly different
color of green okay I like that color
green but you know what then I think
that button should be should changed and
so you can have these continuous change
requests now that could be more of an
issue of just inexperience in terms of
the clients so you have to be up front
with that in terms of how many change
requests do they get with this
particular job because they could go on
forever ever ever ever ever and ever
there's a point where you have to say
listen that's it I got done my three
revisions we're done finally another
thing i would do to deal with crooked
created clients is have it clear in the
initial contract that you own the code
you own everything until you get final
payment and it's they sign off on that
that's a clause you should have in every
contract i would recommend this way they
can't say give me the work which you've
done so far I've only paid you half but
you've done ninety-five percent of work
I wanted my sixteen-year-old kid is
going to add a little bits on the side
or have interns going to come work for
free so give it work so remember that
don't give up the code don't give them
the site don't give them the app until
they pay you in full right so there you
go that's it for crazy crooked clients
