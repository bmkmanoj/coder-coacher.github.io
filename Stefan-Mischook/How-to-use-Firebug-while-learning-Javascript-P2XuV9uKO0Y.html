functions what I want to do is show you
a new console a new way to view
JavaScript output in a browser using
something called Firebug now if you
recall in a previous video we went into
the era consoles in Internet Explorer
and in Firefox Firebug is a plug-in that
works with Firefox and it's basically a
tool that allows you to inspect and
monitor your CSS HTML javascript live
it's a very interesting tool to use when
you're writing JavaScript of course
because it allows you to see all kinds
of stuff that you wouldn't be able to
see otherwise so I'm just going to
download it you can get it of course as
you saw you do a search for Firebug in
Google you'll get it here so we're gonna
install it works of course on Mac and
PCs of versions fire bugs okay Firefox
gave options you see Firefox was not
allowing me to to download stuff because
of security so I just said do it and
okay here Firefox Firebug rather let's
go install now installing see hey I have
to upgrade my version of Firefox which
sucks so let me do that now
alright let's try this again then
alright it's all now you're right it's
working
we fart again restart Firefox
alright rock-and-roll Firebug which is
now installed let's load up the basic
page alright just take a look at the
code
okay so we have Firebug installed and if
we minimize the browser here look down
here you got a little Firebug here if I
click on it and it's a little Firebug
thing pops open so what I want to show
you is the console consoles disabled
so forget about network monitoring so
what we want to do is we have the
console this is gonna help us for a lot
of our logging I'll show you how to use
that in a second and also script for
JavaScript debugging alright so we have
a console active in Firebug in Mozilla
Firefox and this will give us more
detailed information than the built-in
consoles that we saw before arrow
console here and I'll show you an
example of that so let's let's pop open
goodness page so we have there alert
ayat me Stef so let's just look at that
a Firebug again I'll relaunch you have
our alert fires me staff so alerts work
when you want to see the output of
functions and so on you know but what's
more cool to use something called a
console so I'm gonna destroy it there's
somebody both console dot log and I can
just play a message and go
so let's save that launch Firefox again
reload page see the console says hello
right here
bingo so that is okay simple enough it's
easier to have the console than always
having to click ok on the alert box and
you know so you can also use it to
evaluate expressions in in in JavaScript
what's an expression sort of like a min
mini equation or programmatic equation
Oh two plus two hit enter so let's say
that we load a guess for right now we
can do that with as you know every
programming language is a built in mega
calculator of course you can do all
kinds of mathematical equations and I'm
not going to get into that in this video
because most of us wouldn't be using
javascript for math but this is
something let me denote they look at the
arrow console we can do that here we can
write in console you say 2 2 plus 2 plus
2 plus 2 we hit enter for it's kind of
cool we could do things like is 3 less
than or hit enter evaluated rather hmm
it should have given me the answer false
oh that's why I have it set the errors
only go to all okay here we go so the
arrow consoles cool but if you can just
see it down here this is much easier so
I so I can go you know for less then you
enter launch Firefox we get false of
course so as you can see the console
allows us to inspect - excuse me to
output stuff to console using the
console dot log function and this is
something that only works if you got the
JavaScript Firebug thing going here
and so I recommend firewalk really and
for most of the videos in the JavaScript
series I'm going to be using the Firebug
and Firefox because it's so much easier
to work with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
