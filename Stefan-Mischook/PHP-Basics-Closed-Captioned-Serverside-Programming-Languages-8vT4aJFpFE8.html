understand the difference between a
server-side programming language like
PHP and asp in JSP and cold fusion for
instance versus a client-side
programming language like Java Script
client-side refers to your home
computers programming languages that run
on your computer's night JavaScript for
instance if you write JavaScript in a
for web page the JavaScript engine
actually operates in your own computer
whereas with a server-side language like
PHP the engine actually operates on the
server let me walk you through the
process of when somebody's surfing the
web and they hit a website and I'm going
to show you how it works turns a
relationship between your computer and
the server and how things are processed
I think you have a much better
understanding what i'm talking about
once this is done so let's say this is
your own computer and you come to killer
sites calm and you click a link that
takes you to shopping cart PHP when you
click that link that's what the Nerds
would say and they would call it rather
making a request to the server basically
you're when you click on a link the
browser shoots a message to the server
the web server and says send me the page
called shopping cart PHP not a web
server is smart enough to know that
since the page you requested has a dot
PHP extension instead of a dot HTML or
dot ASP it knows that this is a PHP page
and it should be sent to PHP engine for
processing so what happens the server
passes says okay take the peach shopping
cart PHP process the code in your engine
and waits for the PHP engine to finish
processing it and send back the response
the results of the processing to the
server and the server just sends back
the response back to the clone computer
so what do I mean by the PHP engine
processing the shopping cart PHP page as
you probably are aware all your PHP code
all your pre PHP programming will go
inside of PHP pages the difference
between a normal PHP pay
and our normal HTML page is that there's
PHP code in there there's basically PHP
instructions in the page that tells the
server or a PHP engine what to do for
instance a process a farm or connect to
a database send an email etc etc so the
PHP engine understands and can read PHP
code that's why the server sends the PHP
page 2 of the PHP engine so the PHP
engine can interpret read and then send
back the results of whatever
instructions you roll in the PHP page it
wouldn't send a PHP page to the ASP
engine assuming or as an ASP engine on
the same server which could happen
because the pasp engine would not
understand any any of the PHP code the
server knows what where to send the page
to but it's the extension name so if it
receives a request for an asp page it
will send it to the asp engine and the
engine will do its processing spit back
results and and the computer gets it
when I talk about engines with a V PHP
or asp or our cold fusion or any other
server sign language what these are
really are just programs the PHP engine
is a PHP program that reads and
understands and processes PHP code the
SP engine is the same thing it reads
understand ASP code processes it sends
it back to server so what does it send
back what are these engines would it
easy what does the PHP engine send back
to the server typically it sends back
just straightforward raw HTML code at no
time does the home computer see or
process any PHP code that's the main
distinction a server-side language is
all processed on the server on the flip
side you have client-side languages like
JavaScript now when we're talking about
the client we're talking about the home
computers client-side language languages
actually run in the client in this case
because we're talking about web
programming if you write a little
JavaScript the JavaScript actually gets
processed on your own computer not on
the server that's why when you pop open
a pH a PHP page for instance you don't
see no PHP or code but if you pop open a
HTML page with javascript in it you will
see the JavaScript code because those
code is actually processed on your own
computer
to recap server-side languages the work
is being done on the server whereas a
client-side language like Java Script
the work is being done on the client
computer and in our case the web browser
I'm just going to put this couple of
bullet points for you guys to see and
will fade out with this this is an
important distinction because down the
road this understanding between the
server-side language and where it runs
and the client-side language language is
and where it runs where they run rather
is going to have an impact on how you
understand and build your dynamic
websites
to drive the point home in how the PHP
engine processes PHP code and then spits
out just straight HTML I want to show
you something we look here I'm at the
killer sites com blog and this blog is
actually made with PHP this is a
wordpress I'm going to look at the
source code using Firefox when go view
page source and we look at the source
code I assume you guys are experienced
HTML guys you notice in the source code
we just see straight HTML and some CSS
code in here there's actually no PHP now
consider how long is pages right so
let's actually look at the PHP code that
was used to generate this so here's the
code here's the page it's it's called
single.php it's a wordpress page and as
you can see the code is pretty short
this is all the code now there's a lot
of complex PHP going on here and I'm not
expect you to understand this now the
only point I want to make you notice all
these PHP tags here all this PHP so this
PHP code is read by the PHP engine
processed and it spits out all this HTML
