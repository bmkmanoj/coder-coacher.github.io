talk about is working with a PNG well we
had discussed a little bit about working
with our gift a little bit earlier and
as you can see a PNG is a really great
option and choice when you're working in
this fashion as well let's take a look
save for web devices and as you can see
the JPEG was one thing certainly but
didn't really suit this particular image
that we had created on the other hand a
gif gave us you know nice 3.15 k image
when we were using 128 colors actually
it's really only 126 colors and as you
can see diffusion specifies the dither
algorithm now the dinner here specifies
the amount of dither what we're really
doing with that amount is determining
exactly how much of the separation of
those images are going to take place
it's not really something that's
applicable in this case as you can see
here one hundred percent dither is
increasing the size a little bit if I
set this to fifty percent dither really
does nothing in this particular image
and how it's going to work so not really
all that important for us at this stage
in the game we're going to keep it at
100 however if I were to go down to say
actually let me come in here and I'll
put this as the gift and we can compare
to that one on the other hand I'm going
to come in here and choose PNG now PNG
24 is something that is great and what
it allows us to do is to really work
well with transparencies and in the next
video I'm going to show you a little bit
more about those transparencies and how
they work however at this point we don't
have any number of options in here it's
just 24 24 while actually we've got four
channels of information each channel
with eight bits inside of them and here
the third channel is supported for
transparency on the other hand if we go
to a PNG eight you'll see that it pretty
much
gives you the same amount of information
that we had when we were working with
the gift on the other hand though if you
keep all of these you know sets of
information the same you'll notice that
even despite the fact well this one's
set to 50 did there i'm just going to
bring that back up to 100 you'll see
here 3.15 but here if I'm using the PNG
eight it's shaved off a little bit of K
even if it's only a few bites that it's
shaved off that's still good every bite
counts so you might be wondering I mean
why would I use the gift over the PNG
well that's something that was really
important a number of years back when
very old browsers did not support pngs
now most modern browsers all support
PNG's the one thing that you have to
keep in mind is that PNG transparency
may not be supported in all modern
browsers specifically the internet
explorer browser however since there is
no transparency here I could use a PNG
eight instead of a gift and the reason
specifically is just because it's going
to give us same amount of settings same
amount of colors that I'm using before
but it gives you a smaller size so in
this case why not use a PNG eight it's
much better for you however when we come
back in the next video I'm going to talk
to you a little bit more about
transparencies and we'll sort of explore
some of the differences there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
