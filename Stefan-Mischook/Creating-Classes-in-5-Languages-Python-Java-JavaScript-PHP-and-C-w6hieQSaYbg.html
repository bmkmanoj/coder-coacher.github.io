I'm going to compare creating classes in
one two three four five different
languages one of the things that I
discuss on a railer basis is how it's so
important to learn the foundations the
fundamentals the core of whichever or
whatever programming language you decide
to learn at first because everything
comes off of that with that super solid
foundation everything else is gonna be
easy and in fact learning other
languages is going to be easy now
like everything else I teach and I talk
about on this channel is all from lots
of hard earned nerd experience going
back to the 90s business and coding
experience so I digress here so now what
I'm gonna show you is how you can create
a simple object in the five programming
languages because one of the things I
always say is that once you learn one
programming language will modern
programming language you will have
learned pretty much 95% of all the
programming languages so let's start off
at the top so I got one Python and we
create a class with Python
number two Java we create a class with
Java now just in case you don't know a
class is a way of organizing your code
in any object-oriented based language
there are many many many out there
including Python Java PHP Swift Ruby
c-sharp accessory etc etc etc now to
create objects in object-oriented
programming you use something called a
class now I'm not going to teach
object-oriented programming in this
video but it's what you to show you how
similar these five different languages
are so first one I got Python then I got
Java then I got PHP everybody's favorite
language just joking there I'm not
disparaging PHP for freelancers if you
want to do freelance development and
programming I say do PHP JavaScript now
javascript actually voted ax
object-oriented technically nerd
speaking it's a prototypical language
although I think the latest version of
the JavaScript language might actually
be pure object what I'm not sure but
anyway but traditionally javascript is
prototypical haven't looked at it that
in a while that in terms of getting that
nerdy and deep but anyway for all
intensive purposes javascript does act
like an object when to the language so
don't worry about it we'll get into this
a few seconds later and then you got C
sharp which is Microsoft's answer to
Java so yeah let's look at this so let's
go back to the top Python you see to
create a class classes are like the
templates the cookie cutters you use
classes to create objects you know
object-oriented programming anyway so to
create a class in Python we use the
class keyword and we say we're creating
a class and we're gonna call it a class
automobile and we do our stuff boom look
at Java yeah now the code is different
the syntax is different because there
are differences between the languages
don't get me wrong but the key point to
take away is that with Python and with
Java they all they both use the class
keyword to create objects and then with
PHP look at they use a class keyword to
create objects look at Jose now Java
scripts the odd one or the odd man out
as I said it's a prototypical language
it does not use a class keyword to
create objects it actually uses a
function though JavaScript does not use
a class keyword conceptually it is the
same as the other languages all right
and in c-sharp here we go again we use
the class keyword right so the way it
typically works with object-oriented
programming languages most of the time
they have the class keyword class
keyword with with Python class keyword
with Java class keyword with PHP you get
the idea now yes there are several
differences there's no question but the
key to take away from this is that in
all these situations always different
languages rather you're using the class
keyword so if you learned how to create
clauses in Python if you never in java
code and you look at
Java code you can see all the class I
guess so create a class here and because
you've learned classes in Python you'll
know a lot about how classes work and
behave in Java although they are
different again I would say these
languages in terms of concepts are about
95 percent or more of the same maybe
even 97 percent depending let me give
you another example how similar things
are now in object-oriented programming
you have this idea of a constructor
constructor is a part of your class code
that is fired off when the code is
activated if you will again I'm trying
to avoid inner terms so in Python we
have this quote here that it is our
constructor and what a constructor does
it's a sort of like gets everything up
and running again I'm not trying to
teach you object-oriented programming
what I'm trying to show you is that the
concepts are shared across all these
languages so here's your constructor in
Python in Java here's a constructor here
yeah PHP here's your constructor here
welcome PHP to even use the word
construct that's the keyword construct
right and in JavaScript
hey JavaScript this is a constructor
right here boom so there's two it this
way
c-sharp the constructor I recall is
always has the same name as your class
so here this is the constructor right
here the point is you have another
concept constructors which is shared
across five different programming
languages so when you learn and
understand what the point of a
constructor is and they're the same the
point of the constructor or a
constructor is the same across all these
languages and any other project oriented
language but I'm aware of the class
keyword is the same has the same purpose
and does the same thing for all these
languages so there you go you learn the
basics of Python really well you learn
those foundations those core principles
it will go a long way to helping you not
only explore Python all over the place
because python is very vast like all
these other languages but will help you
to understand
programming in general regardless of the
language</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
