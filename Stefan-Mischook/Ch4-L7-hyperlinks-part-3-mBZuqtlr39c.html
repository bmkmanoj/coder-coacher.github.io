in your web links you know how annoying
it can be if you're on a page and you
click a link and it spawns a new window
and then you got multiple windows from
the same site that's that's really
annoying so the answer is hit it in the
example I just gave you and the answer
is you would use target blank if you
want to have a link to some outside
website so for instance let me add a new
link so I were to type this in control
copy and check-out I don't know we're
gonna say check out Google so let's say
you wanted to give people link to
google.com so what you do is put it in
here now I'll gonna do something it's
not the best idea
watch this google.com and let's watch
what happens this webpage is not found
we have an error that's the error page
so let's see what's up with that the
reason we have an error is because if
you're linking to an outside website you
have to start like this HTTP colon slash
slash World Wide Web
Google you have to put this stuff here
and what this stuff does it tells the
web browser that we're going on to the
public World Wide Web to grab our page
to go to our link here now we don't have
to put the World Wide Web in here we can
take that out we'll say that so let's
see what happens
takes us to Google now I'm going to
Google Canada because I happen to be in
Canada but if you are in the US and you
clicked on that link it would take you
google USA if you were in Spain it would
it would take you to Google Spain so I
put WWI like putting WWE just personal
habit of mine so it's the view and
browser works the same so there you go
that's why you might want to put a
target attribute well let me do that
again hold on hold on
see what watch what happens so now we're
in Google but we've lost our website
it's gone so you can always click back
but sometimes you don't want them to
have to click back so what you do is you
do the target
now or I'll see what happens open
browser see it spawns it in a new window
and we still have our website here
here's something else we can do we don't
have to use blank we could use our own
name
that works too now you don't have to use
the name of the page but you're linking
to in the target if you want to spawn a
new tab but it's just a good habit
because later on if you're getting into
more advanced web stuff having the name
of the site in your target can be used
in other things like with your
JavaScript or something it's also good
practice good practice means it's just a
good way of doing things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
