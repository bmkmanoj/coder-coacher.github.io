a little break from page layout and CSS
as it's a lot to take in and I want to
show you a couple quick little features
in terms of file management but
dreamweaver provides that will make your
life a lot easier as a web designer it's
a seemingly simple looking capability
but it's very useful so let's try
suppose pop open our index page or index
dot HTML double-click right and we
notice that here under Adobe look text
we have a link wray which says right
here link and it links to page 2 dot
HTML do we have page 2 we don't even
have a page 2 Wow let's re link that to
page dash two so we go like this well
that's a new one I didn't show you guys
the CSEC dream you see these little
wheels here in little wheels and they
appear in different parts of Dreamweaver
and the little wheels allows you to
easily linked documents that's pretty
cool so I click and I hold without
having to you know I could select from
my list of document tears of polls but
select and hold I see I dragged my
little wheel it takes me to page two so
this is a hyperlink there's a link so
I'm linking Leslie page 2.html I'll say
that let's preview which I click that
takes us to our ugly page view beautiful
so let's go back to Dreamweaver now this
is what I want to show you actually so I
showed you a little clicky wheel which
kind of cool and what I'm going to show
you is a file management capabilities
let's say let me shut this let's say you
decided what you needed to rename page
22 a better name like you know product
list and you know that you have index
linked to page two now typically without
dreamweaver if you change page to the
product list you would have to remember
to go into your index page and to change
the link to point to the new page name
right so put a little product dash list
now watch your dream weaver does for us
since we do it here is kind of close
like okay
ah so Dreamweaver pops up in this box
update files so it says update links in
the following files now what is this
Dreamweaver is keep track of what pages
are linked into what so if I change a
file name and it's and people may be
linking to that file verse versa then
Dreamweaver will say ho scan and say way
we got that we got to update links here
so it's basically asking as update links
in the following files so yeah we want
to update that in that link in the index
HTML page so we go update so Dreamweaver
automatically updates that link in our
index HTML page so i'm going to
double-click and look just approve you
see product list each tml now this is
may not seem like a big deal now since
we only have you know a couple pages but
just imagine but you had a page that was
you know that had 20 other pages linking
to and you might forget this is a great
tool because will help keep everything
linkedin up-to-date and so this is just
one of the many file management
capabilities that are built into
dreamweaver cs3 that makes your life as
a web designer that much easier
another thing I want to cover in entry
MERVA it's not really specific to design
some stuff down here now dreamweaver has
a magnification capability so you want
to zoom into a page and check out your
layout really close this is the idea if
you had some really complex layouts you
may want to do this maybe you want to
zoom out you want to see what the page
looks like from a distance so it's kind
of cool you know it's just out one of
the many capabilities now if you had
sailaja move it up and down so let's say
we go to 800 this allows you to move it
up and down and move the page just like
you would move a document and let's say
Photoshop or something so it's kind of
useful right and you get the zoom tool
so we go here double click it and it
brings it back to its real sighs so
let's set this back to a hundred percent
and let's let the point or two here I
want to look at this down here 15k three
seconds now what this is it tells you
how fast the page will load three
seconds and how many k 2 pages right now
the page is with you all the images in
the text it's only 15 killer k which is
15 kilobytes now three seconds has to
deal with the speed of the person's
internet connection which you can set in
Dreamweaver so let's do that now so we
want to you're going to edit preferences
or control you you saw back you know
three members cool we see all the
hotkeys preferences control you so what
you want to do when you get your
preferences window open is you want to
go into status bar this is the status
bar right here right and we got default
window sizes so you can sort of set your
default size so let's say you're laying
out pages for web TV then you could say
okay let's go with that one we're going
to select you know we'll select web TV
and that will be that but that's not why
we're here we want to look at
connections be so whenever we're looking
at 15 k will take three seconds that's
what
56 killed by modem a lot of people still
have a surprisingly you know so and
these are like 14 for i remember back in
the day 14 wow so most time people are
up here or here so if you look at 1500
okay you see 15k also the only lows in
one second big difference we go edit
preferences let's say we say it's a 14-4
modem which is like an old jalopy modem
also in 15 k is eight seconds yeah I
remember the day back in 1993-94 well 94
and 14 40 was considered fast so you
have to make your pages really skimpy so
let's let's go back I usually leave it
for now at 56 k although you're going to
have to determine depend on the type of
site you have what you want to set this
to so what does that mean well like on
killer sites calm and killer PHP calm we
have a lot of videos we assume that
people are coming to site to learn web
design and flash programming and
programming so we assume that they got
fairly modern computers modern internet
connections and you know videos are huge
right you know many megs of peace so I'm
you know I'm not so concerned about a
56k connection speed because that's not
the type of site i have on the other
hand if perhaps I was a site that you
know dog grooming site again you may get
a lot of people older people retirees
who may have slower internet connections
and you may want to make sure that your
your pages are fairly zippy so when
these guys come around rule of thumb
basically is I would just go target a
connection speed of 56 k and as long as
you pages can lull within 10-15 seconds
you're pretty cool so let's go okay with
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
