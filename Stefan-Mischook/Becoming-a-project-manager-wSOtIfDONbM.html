vlog for more advanced nerds perhaps if
you're beginner you might find it
interesting but it's really geared
towards more advanced nerds this is
something I learned later on in my
career as a developer because like all
developers I started by writing code
myself and for several years I was a
coder professionally reading code now
what happens at one point if you become
successful and you will become
successful if you just keep learning and
you keep working calmly towards your
goals
anyhow so as you continue to develop
your skills and your abilities you even
rise up in the company where they'll put
other more junior developers under you
or as a freelancer you start getting so
much work that you're going to start
having to hire people to help you out
now
the problem with that is when you start
bringing in new people to work under you
in either situation working for somebody
were working for yourself there is a new
layer of organization that has to be
accounted for
you basically have to coordinate who's
doing what coding so you have one other
guy it's not such a big deal but if you
have two or three other quarters or more
it becomes much more of a headache so
what happens is that you'll find
yourself becoming more and more detached
from actual coding you simply will not
have the time because it's very
difficult to manage a project that has
several developers involved whether you
have actual programmers writing the
business logic writing actual code and
or maybe you might have in addition to
that front-end developers putting
together of a user interface the UI
working on the UX user experience these
are all detailed aspects of app
development whether it be web apps
whether it be mobile apps or even
desktop apps of
yeah so what happens as you get more and
more people working for you you have
less and less time to write code
yourself and then what you're gonna find
is that mentally it's very difficult to
do both jobs at the same time meaning
it's very difficult to be somebody who
has a view of the project for 20,000
feet in that you're able to see all the
moving pieces you're seeing all these
individual developers doing their work
as your UX guys and you were UI people
guys and girls are doing their work so
what happens at some point you're gonna
have to make a decision whether or not
to become a manager of developers or
whether you're going to just become or
stick to development
I know people after 20 years some have
gone into the management and some have
gone to sales and other people who have
stuck to being pure developers some
people move up into project leads where
they manage a bunch of developers under
them the point I want to emphasize in
this video is that there's a point where
you're going to have to make that
decision what it is you want to do in
terms of your long term career
do you want to move up into management
or do you want to stick to development
now when you do move up into management
what happens you become detached from
the coding trends and this has happened
to me in the past where because I had to
concentrate on the big picture I lost
touch with some of the details in terms
of what was coming out what was cutting
edge in terms of coding now recently
I've jumped back into it everything's
relative in the last couple of years and
so I'm much more aware than it was say
five years ago where I sort of got
detached from that too much so here I am
again though where I'm managing the
studio web project which is an app
that's quite mature it's about six years
old now and I'm managing the developers
that are on this project and we're not
doing major changes because it's a very
mature codebase it's just more of it's
just more of a refactoring which is a
type of cleanup
and some additional features added to it
but I had to again I have to again I
can't get into the code right I can't
jump deep into the code because we jump
deep into the code I'll become too close
to the code and then I'll I won't be
able to focus on the big picture again
and that's what you have to do as a as a
manager of a project you have to be able
to step away from it and that was hard
for me at first it was very difficult
for me to leave the day-to-day coding
because I really enjoyed it I loved the
the results of when you get a piece of
code to work when you see your app doing
something it's kind of fun but in
exchange for that when you do become a
manager of developers and you get into
that management level your satisfaction
is seeing the whole project come
together which is actually a much more
stressful job to be totally also if you
because you've had them make sure all
these different people are doing what
they need to do and following the
working specification and everything
coordinates in at the same time because
the studio a by I also deal with the
clients a to a certain extent because I
want to be in touch with the end users
of our product so that I get direct
feedback and this allows me to better
plan and better manage the development
and the subtleties in the product when
you become detached from your clients
your software becomes detached from the
needs of your clients and that's what
you're kind of seeing now of Apple where
you see since Steve Jobs has died they
seem to they're still putting out solid
products but there seems to be a slow
creeping away from being responsive to
client needs we'll see we'll see they
for instance don't want to add touch
screens to their laptops and they claim
that touchscreen laptops don't work
which is you know frankly if you look at
the evidence out there with the
microsoft surface and the surface pros
and so many other manufacturers who have
touchscreens that notion is kind of a
silly thing I could tell you from
somebody uses both Mac OS and I love mac
OS and windows I really like Windows 10
I can tell you from having a touchscreen
Windows machine the touchscreen does
come in handy sometimes often rather
it's used just in Windows around close
apps open apps scroll through a website
but it becomes like a very important
user interface to have that touch screen
and then have dependability built into
your main device is also kind of cool I
use it a lot when I'm doing meetings I'm
writing down notes which depend and
because they're digital notes I can get
save them I can send them off I can
categorize them it's in many ways better
than paper and what's the Microsoft
Surface pen it does feel like you know
you got different nibs you can put it in
the front of the pen in front of the
stylus and it does feel like paper or a
ballpoint pen on paper it's not perfect
but it feels pretty good and after a
little bit you get used to it is quite
good anyway off on a tangent whoo that's
it
getting it to managing coders means
you're gonna have to become detached
from the code which can be a little bit
difficult and you also understand it
changes your entire role as a developer
but when you get into that management
end of things your possibilities in
terms of your career in terms of what
you have to do increase considerably and
as a freelancer and this is where the
context of the business you can move
into higher levels of Management that
way and as sales and in terms of
freelancing if you're gonna expand your
freelancing career you're gonna have to
at some point if you have any success
bringing assistance and so you're gonna
have to start taking those terms as well
I hope you found this vlog useful
