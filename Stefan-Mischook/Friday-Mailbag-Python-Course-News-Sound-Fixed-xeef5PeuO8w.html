just invented that so I've been really
busy with work I have a business trip
out to the west coast of the US coming
up I'm getting ready for busy with the
Python course so quick update on the
Python course and the participation in
terms of the mentee thing I have a lot
of people a lot more than I thought
would be interested in ish alee and so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
attempt to restructure the way I was
going to do things just a little bit to
accommodate more people because to be
honest with you if I can get more people
to participate and to give me that
feedback that I am looking for that will
just I think I think end up in a better
product so we're going to see how that
works out and we'll play that step by
step so let me just get in here so I
have a question from somebody hey Stefan
I just purchased your interactive what
developer course thank you I just want
to let you know how glad I am to start
this guy is asking this is a good idea
to create WordPress sites for local
businesses to help pay for some of this
college and I say it beats working at
McDonald's so yeah you have to learn a
little bit html5 CSS get comfortable
with that then of course you have to
learn a little bit of WordPress and then
go around go approach local sites a
local businesses small businesses rather
who have bad sites as you mentioned an
email and see what you can do now at
first you may have to do the first one
for free or first you know do a first
little small project for them for free
so you prove yourself and then with time
you can start raising your you start
charging them and you start approaching
how the businesses there's no reason why
you can't do pretty good working on the
side building WordPress sites definitely
making much better money that you would
working at a fast-food joints or
something so yeah that's a good idea so
when you're learning anything new these
are common tips that I actually give
people to intro of my courses so here my
my
tips number one take your time when
you're learning anything new especially
at first you have to give your mind a
chance to adapt to the new information
especially if you're brand new to coding
because when you're thinking code it's
very different than the type of brain
activity if you will but you use for
some of the other things that you do in
life like you know speaking English or
something so yeah when you're doing code
for the first time in your life it's
going to be a bit of a herd of a hurdle
at first so give yourself some time you
may not get something on Monday but
you're pretty sure you can be pretty
sure you're going to get it on wednesday
or thursday and once you have it you
can't really forget it number two when
you hit a bump in the road step back and
have a beer only if you're of drinking
age of course and i'm not advocating
drinking or taking drugs personally I
don't like the feeling of being out of
my mind I just you know it's not a moral
thing it's just a practical thing for me
it's a bit of a joke but the whole point
is you're going to hit bumps in the road
as you're learning anything new so just
be ready for that and when you hit
something where you just don't quite
understand the concept / it's just not
working some piece of polish lovely walk
away for a day walk away for they give
you a brain give you your your
subconscious a chance to work over the
problem a lot of times you hit a hit a
roadblock so this is not clear you come
back a day later and all sudden you
understand it so so easy so yeah keep
that in mind number three right code
often and expect to make mistakes
writing code is an error-prone process
and so expect to make mistakes and when
you're starting a new courting course so
if you're doing my Python course or you
do my HTML CSS or JavaScript my PHP
MySQL whatever course you're doing with
me get into the writing the code right
away because the quicker you write code
quickly going to understand how to code
very important and number four in time
you're going to develop your nerd eyes
and cold will come to read like English
well if English is your primary language
for now as a beginner when you look at
Co it's going to look like Mandarin
maybe or Chinese unless you're Chinese
and it's going to look like Spanish
maybe point is is that when you are
learning to code it kind of looks
gibberish but then at first and then as
you write code red code red code because
these are using easier to read and the
more languages you learn coding
languages the easier gets the user gets
the easier gets because a lot of these
coding languages programming languages
and whatnot was it be Python Ruby job as
C sharp PHP JavaScript they share a lot
of the same principles and ideas the
code looks a little different of course
and there is differences but it's like I
would say you can argue eighty to ninety
percent the same so when you learn
Python you're going to learn a lot about
JavaScript and so on and so forth and
yeah that's pretty much it so because of
work I'm getting ready to head off on a
business trip to it was close to the US
and because of the Python course and
just day-to-day stuff the vlogs are
slowing down a little bit but if you do
have questions send them to me it's it's
actually quite useful for me to answer
questions in the vlogs because it just
gives me topics all right it's Friday
January thirteenth friday 13th lucky
friday 13th enjoy the weekend bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
