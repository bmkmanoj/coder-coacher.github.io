sites calm in this video I wanted to
quickly show you something that I
rediscovered in WordPress and it has
everything to do with how WordPress
deals with the search engines so let's
jump into the WordPress dashboard this
is for one of my one of my sites out
there I am CSS the toiled on that and
what I had discovered recently I was
just visit the site what I had
discovered recently is that though we've
been adding a lot of new content to cite
these sub pages here we're not being
visited by the search engines for
reasons unknown to me because CSS
tutorial is a very highly ranked in
Google I'm just going to do a quick
search to show you what I mean CSS
tutorial dad's number one here so you
can see that we're pretty high ranked so
it was weird that all these sub pages
all these sub articles that we see here
we're not being indexed and as it turned
out it was something to do with
WordPress you see this whole site here
is all wordpress driven even the
homepage so everything that was done any
settings rather in WordPress would
affect into our site so going into a
dashboard this is the problems I
discovered you have to go into the
settings tab and you want to go into
privacy and in privacy you have two
options in terms of blog visibility and
the first option is to laugh at your
blog be visible by everybody on the web
including bidders visitors and search
engines the second option is to block
the search engines but to allow normal
visitors so what I discovered for some
reason somebody had set it to this
rather than this and what happen is that
WordPress embedded the nofollow
attribute within within the header of
every page in the site and the nofollow
attribute is a meta tag and that's
something that basically gives extra
information to the browsers anyhow so
the meta tag told all the search engines
to not index and visit any of the pages
within the site so that explain the
sudden drop-off of traffic a to CSS
tutorial yet so keep that in mind make
sure if you have a blog where you want
to search engines to actually find you
you want to make sure you go into your
privacy settings under settings and that
you make sure you set it to this top
option so that you allow everybody
including the search engines to look
through your site and index everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
