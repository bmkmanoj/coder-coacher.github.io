couple minutes and sit back and decide
how best to structure my project I ask a
couple questions you know what sort of
functionality do I need how do I want to
organize my project are there any
specific design patterns that I want to
follow in this case I've decided to go
with an object-oriented approach and use
the MVC design pattern which is Model
View controller pattern and I've done
that because I've decided this is
probably going to be a medium to large
application I'm gonna be showing you
only the basics enough to get you
started but I'm assuming that this could
be the basis for a much larger
application so I want to make sure that
my code is structured in a good way that
makes it easy to edit and change in the
future if necessary with this in mind
I've created the individual files that
I'm going to be working with on this
project and you'll notice I have a
couple different folders that's going to
hold different file types I have an
includes folder which includes a
database set PHP and init dot PHP I have
a models folder which holds the two
objects that we're going to be building
today an authorization object and a
template object have the views folder
which holds my style dot CSS and my
login and my members view and finally I
have a couple individual PHP files I
have a login dot PHP log out members and
temp this may seem like a lot of files
for a simple login system and in some
ways I agree however as I said earlier
this may be the basis for a much larger
application something that you're going
to continue adding on and extending in
the future and I want to make sure and
spend the right amount of time in order
to get this right initially the more
time that I spend in the planning stages
the less time I have to spend later
fixing issues
so let me talk briefly about the object
oriented approach and the MVC design
pattern now Stefan has covered
object-oriented programming in some
depth with his beginner's
object-oriented video series and my
focus with these videos is to show you a
real-world object oriented example so I
won't be going too much in depth theory
however I did want to briefly cover why
I've chosen object-oriented programming
for this particular series obviously you
know I want to show you an example of
real world real world object-oriented
PHP and I mean that's one reason why I'm
using object-oriented approach however
in addition what I have found is that
object-oriented programming allows me to
compartmentalize my code allows me to
provide a clean and clear organization
to my code I can split out individual
functions into separate objects which
allows me to reuse them in the future
potentially in future projects and also
allows me to write clear understandable
code and I will be showing you what I
mean as we go through these videos in
addition I've chosen to go with the MVC
or Model View controller design pattern
the goal of MVC is to reduce complexity
and increase the flexibility and
maintainability of web applications for
a little bit more information on that
check out Tony Marston net slash PHP -
MySQL slash model - view - controller
dot HTML and this is a slightly older
article but I'd highly suggest you take
a look at it if you want to learn a bit
more about MVC it covers a lot of the
basics and to give you a brief overview
of MVC
basically the way it works is you have
models views and controller files and
each file type has specific
responsibilities basically your
controllers handle input they get the
input from the user they pass that input
off to the model which does all the
processing the heavy lifting in the web
application and then the model passes
off the resulting data to the view which
is displayed back out to the user and
basically this allows me to split up my
application into individual sections
based on the area of responsibility and
allows me to separate the application
based on the type of code that we're
dealing with whether it's business logic
dealing with PHP type logic or whether
it is presentational logic I'm
presenting HTML and CSS JavaScript to
the user so like I said take a look at
this article goes quite in-depth into
this concept and I'd highly suggest you
would take a look at it basically what
as I was saying earlier this model
starts with the user the user inputs
information to the controller who passes
that information to the model who does
all the processing and then passes the
final data to the view which displays it
back out to the user so as this article
talks about there are different
interpretations of the MVC approach and
I'm not gonna say one approach is better
than another I'm simply going to show
you how I work with it and as you gain
experience working with design patterns
and improve your PHP knowledge I'm sure
you're gonna be able to find what works
best for you the last thing that I want
to do is to set up our database
so I have phpMyAdmin open and I have
created in Hopi underscore login
database and I'm going to create our
table which I'm going to call users and
it's gonna have three fields I'll have
an ID field
username field and a password field and
the ID will be an int use your name and
password will stay the same and they'll
both be 32 characters and if you scroll
over the ID is gonna auto increment not
save and next thing we want to do is I
want to insert a test user and the user
name is going to be admin and the
password we're going to set in a second
so I've opened up my text editor excuse
me and I've opened up temp dot PHP and
how are we going to work with passwords
is we're going to use the md5 function
to encrypt the passwords which takes an
string that you input into the md5
function and it spits out our 32
character string and the goal here is
that we don't want to store passwords in
plain text in the database and we want
to keep them reasonably secure and by
adding on a salt and an extra couple
letters and numbers at the end of our
password helps keep those passwords a
bit more secure so what I've done is I
have created the md5 function my
password is going to be admin I've added
a couple extra random numbers letters
and characters after it and I'm echoing
it out so I'm gonna run that and I'm
just gonna copy this text go back to
Chrome and paste it in as the password
there we go
so if you browse you'll notice we have
an admin username and the password is
the md5 equivalent of admin plus a
random salt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
