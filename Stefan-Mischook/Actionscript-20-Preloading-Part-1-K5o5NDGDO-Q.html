that we need to consider before wrapping
things up is how to implement a
preloader now the good thing is is that
when we set up the movie clip loader
object we had the opportunity now to add
a listener to it and with that listener
we will now in fact take advantage of it
so that we can see how many bytes are
being loaded and exactly what is being
loaded so we'll get to that in just a
second before we add the listener on to
the master a fillet I want you to look
at your preloader Fla and inside of it
there's to guide layers which I've made
invisible here if I fit it in the window
you can see it's just got this movie
clip in it preloader underscore MC
that's what it's called and inside of it
it's got a text field here I'll just
zoom into it a bit so you see there's a
little bit of animation in here as well
not just a little bit but in fact
there's a hundred frames of animation
here is the display txt text field
inside this and the animation here let
me just make this a little bit smaller
so you could see what it looks like
that's better so the animation that we
have here is in fact 100 frames long
it's just a little masking effect to
hide this little animation behind the
scenes and it's 100 frames long and as
Sherlock Holmes used to say that's not
an accident it's by design Watson and
the reason is is because we are going to
convert our information of loaded bytes
and what we're going to do is convert
that into a number between 1 and 100 as
that number increases also won a hundred
percent this will show us exactly where
the animation is until we get to 100
full completion
okay so with that in place and the swf
made for the preloader fla control-enter
you can make it as well and have it in
here if there is any action script in
this particular frame and actually need
not be here except for stop actions of
course so let's see what's going on here
I don't think I absolutely do not need
any of this information simply because
it's carried over from a previous file
which I copy paste it so now you can see
this information does nothing it doesn't
show up as anything but the swf has got
this information in here movie clip
called preloader MC inside of it if you
remember we also have display txt good
now in the master file here's what I
want you to do go to frame number one
and under add listener I want you to add
this particular information my listener
which is what we called it
okay and we are going to associate to my
listener an event called on load
progress
so online progress is going to be equal
to sorry function but this particular
callback function is going to have a
number of different variables which are
built-in first one refers to the movie
clip which is going to be loaded and
we'll call that target underscore MC
same information format that we use and
a variable here is going to be a number
for loaded bites
as well need 14 total bytes
and close that bracket so this inside
this particular function is open closed
just as we normally do inside this
particular function we're going to have
a couple of things that are going to
have happen okay number one we want to
load the swf that contains the preloader
and what i mean by that is we want to
have it visible on a higher level they
can use whatever level you want you can
put it on level 999 if you want a 100
level 10 doesn't really matter what I'm
going to do is I'll put it on level 100
okay if it's on level 100 doesn't really
matter where it is we're going to load
that in just a second but first and
foremost what we're going to do is to
create a variable so this particular
variable call it whatever you want but
I'm going to call it
preload
% very standard practice here and we're
going to strict data type this as a
number all right now we're also going to
tell it to give us math dot round oh
capital n of course sorry F dot round
and what that's going to do it gives a
round number right and in this we're
going to say whatever loaded bytes is
divided by total bytes
okay and we're going to multiply that
amount by 100 to give us a nice round
even number that's going to be between 1
and 100 all right another thing we're
going to do remember that movie on level
50 now we're going to load it on to
level 50 right here by the way once that
object is loaded on to level 50 we will
have to make level 50 visible you'll see
what I mean here level 1 5000 we said
100 so level 100 or here let's say level
10 that's a nice even number so once on
level 10 we're going to say make level
tens visibility
ok
visibility no visible
there you go underscore visible and
we're going to say make that visibility
be equal to true okay that's great but
here i also want to do something else
when we find something on level 10
and if you remember the object on level
10 had a movie in it called preloader
underscore MC preloader underscore MC we
want to tell this movie to go to and
stop let's try that again escape GS go
to and stop where well whatever the
value of preload percent is so if
preload percent is worth
let's say 10 it'll be at go to in stop
frame 10 if it's 50 go to and stop frame
50 and so on and so forth until we get
to 100 perfect so that takes care of the
animation what about displaying the text
let's see this go to level 10
alright and what are we going to do well
inside of it we said there's something
called preloader MC okay and what else
while inside preload rmc we know
something is called display underscore
txt right then what display TX T's text
is going to be equal to well we could
put in a string but here what we want to
do is to take advantage of this
information again so we'll say whatever
preload percent value is so if it's 10
and will be 10 and so on but we're also
going to concatenate a value for the
percentage sign so add 10 percentage
sign 20 percentage sign and so on and so
forth so that's going to display the way
we want it to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
