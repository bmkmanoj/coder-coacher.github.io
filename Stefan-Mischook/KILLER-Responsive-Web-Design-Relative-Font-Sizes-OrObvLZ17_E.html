bit about responsive font sizes now when
you do in responsive design you want
your design to be able to adapt to
different device sizes and it's quite
likely that you want your text to be
able to adapt as well for example maybe
you want the text to be larger on large
displays because you have more screen
space available whereas you want that
text to be smaller on smaller devices
say a mobile phone as you want to have
slightly more information in that space
the way to do that is with relative font
sizes and the way I'm going to suggest
that you do that is with something
called m's now you probably worked with
pixels quite a bit in the past and they
definitely have their advantages it's
nice to have something that seems pretty
consistent across you know multiple
devices well when it comes down to it
you have to understand that pixels are
still relative to the device they're
gonna change slightly and you're not
really dealing with an absolute perfect
size even when you're working with
pixels an M is a relative font size it's
based on the context with where it is
basically M's allow you to be resolution
independent and this is key because if
you go back to the idea I just talked
about if you want to have a slightly
different font size based on your device
the visitor is viewing the site in ms is
an excellent way to go about that in
order to demonstrate this you see here
on the screen it's the sample site that
I put together if you've done my content
management system course you might
recognize this particular template
basically it's a just a tweak template
from that particular course and
everything is currently sized in pixels
and just to give you a brief overview
these files are all available for your
download in case you want to be able to
follow along and actually do my code
changes at the same time to give you an
idea of the file structure I simply have
an index dot HTML I have a resources
folder which contains CSS
see it's titled up CSS file and images
which I just have a banner image so I've
kept this very simple and
straightforward you can take a look at
the CSS it's again very simple we just
have a meta information we have a title
we have a link to our out to our CSS
file and then I split up into a couple
different sections and we have the title
of the website in h1 we have a banner
with that image you have a navigation
section a Content section with a left
column right column and finally a footer
and again this is what it looks like
and then we also have the CSS stylesheet
that's associated with that it provides
all the styles for this theme so as you
can see everything is based on pixels
currently and I'd like to be able to
switch that over and actually use MS by
default an M is roughly about 16 pixels
and that's based on the browser defaults
the average browser has about a 16 pixel
height for just default text and one
thing that is often that often people do
is they actually resize that down to 10
pixels basically we're going to be using
a formula to calculate the size and M s
and it sounds a little bit complicated
at first but it's quite easy to pick up
the way you calculate MS is by using a
simple formula target divided by context
equals result so for example let's say I
wanted to say something in roughly
around 30 pixels and my context the area
where it's in the parent element has a
SOT as a font size of 10 pixels so then
we'd have 30 divided by 10 and the final
result would be 3m size so I'm going to
take that approach I'm actually going to
put that in place here in the sample
template so the first thing I want to do
is I want to add that preset which will
style things
- ten pixels that makes a calculations a
lot easier so up here at the top and add
HTML and I'm just gonna set everything
to 16 pixels by default this gives us a
standard size to work with and sort of
standardized as things class browsers
and then within the body section I want
to adjust the font size to 60 2.5% so
that means that our parent element the
body is going to be a 10 pixel font size
and obviously if you take a look at it
now you'll notice things are much
smaller so the next step is we need to
adjust the font sizes and the rest of
the document to use MS so let's just go
down the document and adjust things as
we go
for example the h1 has a font size
currently of twenty six pixels so to
convert that tab it would be twenty six
pixels divided by the ten pixel parent
element so we get a 2.6 M final value
and we're pretty much going to do that
just throughout the rest of the document
so the h2 rather than being 22 pixels
it'll be 2.2 m the h3 will be 1.4 em for
the banner element this is simply
something that's removing the line
height and removing some of the extra
spacing around the banner adjusting for
browser inconsistencies so I'm just
gonna leave that particular item alone
but anything that's actually showing
text I want to adjust the navigation
elements are currently at 12 pixels and
I'm going to make that 1.2 m
and the content itself was at 13 pixels
originally so I'm gonna adjust that to
1.3 m and finally in the footer it's
gonna be 1.1 m and keep in mind these
values all go back to that base 10 pixel
value this just gives you an easy way to
think of MS and should have associate it
with a pixel value just it's an easier
way to comprehend it
at least I find it easier hopefully you
will too so now that I've saved this
let's go ahead and do a preview and
you'll notice that things are mostly the
way I expected them to but these two
headers this main header and the sidebar
header seem a little bit bigger than I
expect them to be and if you remember
back to what I said it started that goes
back to this target divided by context
calculation the h1 if we take a look at
index.html and it's not the h1 I need to
look at the two headers I need to look
at are the h2 and h3 you notice that
they're both within this content element
and we added we go and look at the
content element we added font size to
that so the context has changed it's no
longer 10 pixels anymore is actually 13
pixels based on this value so we need to
adjust our values for the h2 and h3 to
fit so to do that I'm just going to open
up my calculator here I need to change
the age to that's gonna be we want a
final size of roughly around 22 pixels
and we divide that by the context which
is roughly about 13 pixels and this is
the final value we get so I'm just gonna
copy that paste it in place I'm going to
do the exact same thing for the h3 as
well so that we won't want the final
size to be roughly 14 pixels
and we want to divide that by 13 pixels
so this is the final font size copy
paste save and there we go we get a much
more consistent header sizes like I was
expecting like the original pixel sizes
we had selected so that should give you
a good overview of em's it obviously
does get a little bit tricky as you have
elements nesting within each other but
it's just one of those things you get
used to with a little bit of practice in
the next video we're going to be taking
this concept and actually adding on top
of it we're going to be talking about
sizing things like padding and margin
and widths using MS so those can be
responsive as well so it's a pretty good
idea that you hopefully have a good
grasp of this functionality before we
continue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
