look at web site directories and the
roots of a website so let me just pop
open things so we remind ourselves so
you see here the my - website web site
that we've been building and you
remember I mentioned this is the root of
the web site and we know it's the root
because we have that index page and we
know that the index page is the first
page but a web server will send from any
web site so if you go to studio web com
what the web server sends is the index
page that's the first page of City web
comm and we learned about subdirectories
like the sub - pages directory and my
friends and so on
this little reminder and you notice that
we had to change our H ref attribute
value right this is the attribute and
this is the value here's the href
attribute and its value you remember all
that anyway so we had to change the H
ref value the path to the file we have
to tell it tell the web browser to go to
the sub pages directory right because
because my for my - France on HTML is in
sub pages there we go
so let's take a look at this from
another point of view so I'm gonna pull
out a page from my book
now I wrote a book it's on Amazon
available June 22nd 2015 I think that's
in the US and maybe from this book so
take a look at this diagram here and you
see the site folder at the top this
would be the folder that your web
hosting them and he gives you to put all
your website files into so that section
you see it's is the root you see that in
the diagram so that contains the images
folder the products folder inside of
products you have the products page and
so this is a subdirectory
so the root is this and you got to of
course the index page in the root and
the contact page so look at this example
of a root address or as the Nerds would
say a root URL so you look at how - - -
bill - websites com yes that is probably
yes that's probably the worst spelling
you could have for a website domain but
this is something I built in 2003 anyway
so an example of a root address is we go
to how to be website calm slash contact
on HTML so let's look that up so let's
look at our little diagram here you see
contact our HTML you see it's right
inside the site folder which is the root
of the site so here's an example of a
root address now if you want to load up
the index dot HTML you could type in how
to build websites column slash index dot
HTML
rgeous how to build websites com that's
it because the web servers are set up
they're designed to load automatically
the index dot HTML file if you don't
specify the name of the file so here's
an example of a so here's it so if we
look just below here's an example of a
web address in a subdirectory so it's
how to build a website column slash
products slash products dot HTML so
let's look at our diagram you see
products and then we see inside of the
products folder we see products not HTML
and this is a subdirectory so again
here's an example of a subdirectory URL
us and here is an example of a root
address URL
I hope this diagram helps to make it a
little bit more clear understanding all
this will make building your websites a
little bit easier because you're gonna
understand
how to write your HTML passcode much
more easily</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
