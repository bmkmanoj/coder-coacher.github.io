give you a quick preview of some of the
things I'm working on for the Ruby
course I'm taking a bit of a
non-conventional approach so what I want
to explain to you in this particular
video is the hierarchy of programming
languages
you see there's many different ways you
can categorize or look at languages and
it's actually important to understand at
least a little bit you know why are
there so many different programming
languages right
there's Ruby Java PHP C assembler
Objective C C sharp there's so many so
why there's several reasons one of the
reasons is because the hierarchy of
languages so let me jump into that now
so when I talk about the hierarchy of
languages I'm referring to how languages
are stacked up on top of each other in a
relation to the CPU so what the heck
does that mean well let's go to the next
slide so here we go so at the end of the
day all programming languages are just
written languages that send instructions
to the computer now the heart or the
brain of the computer rather is the CPU
the central processor you know 1.2
gigahertz 2.5 gigahertz that thing
that's what processes all the
instructions from our ultimately from
the code that we write in other
programmers right now the thing is is
that the CPU itself does not speak in a
very human friendly language it's
actually very unfriendly it's actually
and if you want to write in machine code
which is the language the native
language if you will of the CPU the
natural language of the CPU I'll give
you a shot this is what native code
looks like this is a machine code you
see it's I have no idea what this code
is doing this is just a small tiny
little snippet as far as I know it could
be just saying you know write the letter
I to scream probably not even that
anyways you can look at it yourself and
it's surely not friendly right but this
is what CPUs understand right this is
what they understand so it's not
practical for humans to be writing this
kind of stuff here so what has happened
over the years is that nerds have
created languages that sit on top of
machine code that will then translate
the machine code and these languages are
you know as you go up to stack here from
from top to bottom excuse me from bottom
from bottom cpu upwards the languages
become much more human friendly or human
readable so machine code which is this
gobbledygook and then you have assembler
which is you know I don't have an
example of that but it's easier to write
and read than machine code and even
either easier than assembler or these
high level languages they're called high
because they're high up to stack right
there's the bottom here is the CPU high
up high up to stack now you know when
people say you know high-level language
versus low-level language what they're
talking about the lower the level of the
line language the closer it is to CPU
99.9999% of apps are written with these
high level languages C C++ really Python
Java PHP and I would argue well I don't
have to argue C C++ I think they're
lower actually than Ruby Python Java
because actually Ruby is partly created
with C Python is partly created with C
Java is partly created with C and C++ in
PHP creator would see so you know in
fact those two redraw this this diagram
it created I would put C and C++
underneath Ruby Python Java PHP although
technically they're all considered
higher-level languages for various
reasons so there you go that's
interesting a high-level language in a
low-level language the higher level the
more human readable it is for instance
like I said here's some machine code
and let's go back here some Ruby code
puts HelloWorld or it could be print
hello world now that's a lot easier for
humans to read and understand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
