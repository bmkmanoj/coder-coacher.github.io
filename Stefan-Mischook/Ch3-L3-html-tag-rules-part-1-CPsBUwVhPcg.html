there's a few of them that you should be
aware of so that you don't make any
mistakes when you're writing your pages
so the first rule is about the text case
in your tags you notice all the tags I
use lower case text so instead of
writing body like this I wrote it like
this now you could do something silly
and write it like this and it will still
work but most web designers these days
will write all their HTML in lower case
it's just a lot easier to read but again
you don't have to the browser's will
accept both lower case and upper case
tags
the only exception of course is with the
doctype we make it uppercase just as a
convention it's just something that
nerds like to do with web designers like
to do it kind of makes this doctype tag
standout apart from the rest of the page
but you don't have to you could put it
in lower case as well the next thing we
should look at is the proper nesting of
tags so what does that mean well you
know that we can have some tags inside
of other tags so for instance we have
the two paragraph sets of tags inside
our body tag and same thing here we have
the title tags inside of the head tags
and we have all these tags are inside of
the HTML tags when you see about when
you have one set of tags inside another
tag that's called tag nesting think of
like eggs inside of a bird's nest that's
where we got the word from I'm sure what
we want to do is we want to be sure that
we properly nest our tags so what does
that mean so let's look at the title tag
the title tag of course is now inside of
our head tags because the title goes
inside of the head section of the web
page now this is all cool because we
start our title tag inside of the head
and it ends the title tag when it's
still inside of the head that's proper
nesting
now if I did something silly like this
this is not proper nesting because we
started our title tag inside of head the
head section and we ended the title tag
outside of the head though a lot of
browsers will accept this and say ok
this guy made a mistake so we know what
he wants to do you shouldn't do that you
should make sure you properly nest your
tags the same thing with let's say the
body tag the body tag starts inside of
HTML right everything in between HTML
and HTML is considered inside of the
HTML tags so the body started inside of
HTML it should end inside of HTML which
it does here but if we did something
silly like this see that's on the
outside of HTML to be more clear this is
really on the outside of HTML so this
might work in some browsers but this is
really bad so you got to make sure that
you properly nest your tags so that if
you start a tag inside of another tag be
sure that this inside tag finishes in
sight of the other tag it's called
proper tag nesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
