killer video store and in this video I'm
going to talk about how to become a web
developer so we're gonna work off this
little article that I wrote and full
screen so I'm gonna read off of this and
comment along the way as well so here we
go so the following article details the
steps you need to become a web developer
this is a common question I get all the
time you are not alone so the first
thing you have to do number one is you
have to learn to code you need the
skills before you can sell them so I'm
recording this in 2014 May 2014
just to give you context although for
the next several years I think this list
I'm gonna describe here is going to be
it's going to be good you need to learn
the following technologies in this order
so first one HTML CSS the first two
rather this is you know this is pretty
common stuff this is the basic building
blocks of every website after that you
should learn a little bit of JavaScript
and this is the programming language for
the web browsers and this is very
important it's used to create all kinds
of effects in the websites it's used to
it's used to validate form just use to
communicate with the server if you don't
understand any of this you will once you
get into learning all this stuff so let
me just quickly get past JavaScript all
right after about you have html5 and
css3 now these are the extensions are
the latest versions of HTML and CSS
it really makes web browsers and web
design and web development a lot of fun
because you can do all kinds of cool
things for instance with html5 you can
directly embed into your web browser
video and audio clips whereas before you
had to use a third-party and outside
player like a flash player for instance
to do this not anymore with html5 and a
whole bunch of other things you can do
with html5 with css3 you can do all
kinds of nice crazy effects and create
rounded buttons all kinds of stuff
we used to only dream about even five
years ago html5 css3 makes this happen
and a lot of times especially with the
html5 stuff you need JavaScript you able
to access the html5 powers that's why I
mention JavaScript don't worry you don't
have to become an expert in all these
different things you just have to a lot
of times you just need a working
knowledge anyway Raft about you have
jquery jquery is the de facto de facto
standard javascript library is basically
a collection of JavaScript just java
scripts you know I'm trying to put this
in terms that not yours would understand
it's basically a collection of stuff but
it allows you to do all kinds of crazy
things like drop-down menus all kinds of
stuff again I'm not here to give you a
big description of all these
technologies just to give you a brief
understanding which you should learn so
anyway jQuery is huge it's used
everywhere
next you have Twitter bootstrap now this
may catch people by surprise now what
Twitter bootstrap is it's a a framework
and the framework is basically just a
collection of code
it's HTML it's a CSS code and it's
JavaScript code and the whole planet
Twitter bootstrap has to make it easy to
create sites that are responsive and
sites with a responsive our sites that
work on any device they work on desktop
computers it work on iPads iPhones
Android devices you get the idea
so by using Twitter bootstrap just
create the framework for your site and
then you can just work off of that it
really speeds up the process it's very
very important yeah
so after Twitter bootstrap you have PHP
you know what before I get into that you
know let me just escape out of here I'm
gonna show you what I mean about what
Twitter bootstrap can do for you so I'm
gonna launch
now here's studio web and you can see
this is a C it's a flexible site you see
how I get smaller you see I left the
photo here this image gets smaller all
of a sudden let me back it up
bigger smaller you see how fonts are
changing see see there's all this
happening automatically you notice the
top menu here so you have my top menu
watch what happens when I get small
enough see becomes a drop-down list here
it kind of reminds you the chrome
drop-down this and then if you get
smaller it gets smaller even again it
gets more again and see and this will
work on any device now this whole thing
is made possible by Twitter bootstrap it
does this pretty much automatically so
it really makes your life easy I just
wanted to give you a quick demo on that
one so PHP now PHP is one of the
server-side programming languages out
there there are a few competitors
there's Ruby Python Java as asp.net
c-sharp and others the reason I I
selected PHP as the server-side language
is because it's by far the most popular
and so many very important tools that we
use in modern web design development
today uses PHP WordPress is written in
PHP and there's tons of small businesses
that use WordPress so if they come to
you they want to modify your WordPress
blog no impeach Peter to make your life
easier Joomla Drupal to other popular
CMS's again written PHP many shopping
carts are written in PHP so you want to
modify that so knowing PHP is I think
it's critical now the great thing about
is that with all programming languages
once you learn one the rest will come
much easier so the competitor to PHP is
Ruby one of them and it's Python but
once you know PHP to jump over to Ruby
won't be a big leap but knowing PHP will
open you up to a lots and lots of jobs
that's my aim with this one you know to
become a web developer I assume you
wanna get work as a web developer so
next SQL and MySQL
now SQL is the language of databases
this structured query language again I'm
not trying to teach you all the
technology here this is it's more about
what you need to do to become a web
developer and you know so you need to
learn SQL again you don't have to be a
master of it just the basics
and MySQL is the most popular SQL
database out Downers there's MySQL
there's an SQL server from Microsoft
there's Oracle there's many others
post-grad SQL and these are all ok we'll
stop there because I can go on forever
so basically you have to learn SQL you
have to learn MySQL because these are -
these are super common when you create
database driven websites when you're
developing a website you're storing
stuff in SQL databases without a doubt
finally in terms of Technology
object-oriented PHP you may have heard
it as oo P in PHP or PHP or peas and
it's a style programming object-oriented
program it's a style program it's modern
programming and you see object-oriented
techniques if you will and that style
programming is in Ruby's and Java it's
in Python it's in PHP it's in JavaScript
so it's a style program you're gonna
have to learn anyway so there you go so
so let me emphasize here - we go back to
be clear you don't need to master all
these things before and before you get
into actually building stuff
commercially in fact to get to steps two
and three on this list you just need the
very basics you just got to look at this
list here as in the ultimate goal this
is what you're looking to do at the end
of the day so in fact you could quickly
move to step two once you have a good
understanding of CSS HTML and your mouse
so once you get to CSS and HTML you can
move to step two we'll get that and
we'll get to that a second as you learn
more though as you learn more of this
list of technology series you will be
able to take on more jobs simply because
you're gonna have a greater variety of
skills and your pay will go up because
as you learn more you become more
valuable become more experienced you
know you know more you learn the more
you earn
that's my little expression so okay
let's jump to number two start building
your own mini projects that's a big part
of learning so once you know your basic
HTML and CSS build a simple site start
building simple sites when you learn a
little JavaScript
build another simple site
some JavaScript in there when you learn
html5 start putting some html5 css3 in
there and so on so and so it's important
that you start building little mini
projects don't don't start with a big
project start with mini project because
it's really important that you sort of
start and finish something so a mini
project could be one or two page sorry
three page site and so on so you keep
doing this until you start feeling very
comfortable where you can build up a
little mini sides of those sites you're
comfortable with that when you feel
comfortable with that then you can start
talking to people start talking to
friends family acquaintances anybody who
may need a small website and you do it
for free
you do two to three freebie client sites
and the reason you want to do that so
you want to get the whole experience of
dealing with somebody else learning with
somebody else dealing with them
communicating with them that's a big
part of being a successful web
developers being able to manage your
clients and so on so let me give you
some tips when you're doing your freebie
projects you want to keep detailed
records at the time you spend on these
freebie clients so for instance you want
to track how many hours and meetings and
phone conversations how many hours
actually building your sites or web apps
and how many revisions you have to make
this is gonna come in very handy down
the road when you're when you're bidding
for contracts or you're trying to judge
how long a certain jobs gonna take you
by writing this keeping these records
and doing this your ability to judge the
time to complete a project is going to
get much much much better much better
and i'ma tell you it's crucial when you
out there as a web developer whether
you're working on your own as a
contractor or getting work it's crucial
you'd be able to accurately are fairly
accurately judge how long it takes you
to do something so it's an important
part number five once you've done a few
freebie clients and you're comfortable
with the quality of the work it's time
to put up your own website and you put
up your own website so that you can
refer to your people to your website the
prospective clients perspective
employers and you know you can show off
your work so that's it's an important
thing
so let me jump a little out of context
so do you need a certification or degree
to be a web developer the short answers
no except for if you want to work for a
larger company well work for a Microsoft
or Google you're gonna need a degree at
this point although that's changing now
slowly slowly but if you're doing work
for small businesses or you want to work
for small companies they hardly have
I've never been asked if I had a degree
in web development or design and all of
the years I've been doing these things
especially as a contractor they don't
care they want to look at your your
website you want to see what you've done
it will see your portfolio so how do you
get clients while you're looking stuff
three four and five when you start doing
freebie stuff and you start putting up
your site you're gonna see word-of-mouth
is gonna be a big part of it you will
start getting clients in time I've seen
this countless times number eight this
will help you get clients join a forum
as quickly as you can and contribute
questions and answers this will first
help you to develop your skills and it
would you'll start developing a
reputation I can't tell you how many
people have gone to the killer sites
forums for instance you know any form
any web designer forum you one and there
they're asking question answering
questions asking they become known in
the community and eventually somebody's
today can you help me with this project
tell me with that it's it's very common
so again you just got to start building
our reputation number nine continue to
learn technology and keep up to date
that's the the thing about web
development if you want to keep earning
top dollars and you want to you want to
get the maximum out of jobs you have to
be open to learning new stuff it's not
gonna be a constant thing but you gotta
you know once you get your your you know
get into it you know what you're doing
and you gotta keep your eye you know on
what's going on out there and you know
look around and start learning new
things here and there because you may
catch the next you know wave and they
will cut new technologies come in if you
catch it early you're gonna make a lot
of money do really well by catching it
early on and being one of the few
experts in that particular area
I've seen it again I've seen several
times is how it works so I'm gonna end
with a little shameless self-promotion
number two if you want to learn how to
do all these things in detail I have my
web developer from scratch package click
on it here takes you here will develop
from scratch sixty three and forty or
sixty three hours 42 minutes that covers
everything basic web design HTML CSS
reach a query Dreamweaver cs6 CSS layout
CSS Lisp Photoshop for the web how to
prepare images for the web HTML farms
you get the idea of PHP my scalp each be
shopping cart beginners javis grab
beginners jQuery
PHP crud pageant anyway sixty odd hours
of training when you get a course from
us when you get a course from me you
basically have access to it for life you
download it and if you lose something
and come back a year later two years
later redownload it if we update a part
of the web developer from scratch
package or say we update the shopping
cart tutorial because the technology has
changed you can come and download that
as well no problemo and that's it you
have a question give me a call one eight
five one eight five five nine three two
eighty or ninety one this is in North
America
sorry Europe you can always reach me by
email of course anyway that's it that's
how you become a web developer this PDF
