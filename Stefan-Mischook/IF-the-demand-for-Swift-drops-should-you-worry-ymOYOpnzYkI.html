and you find in a couple years
Swift is being diminished over time
meaning to be less and less Swift jobs
happening and I don't know 100% sure if
that's gonna happen but if you watch a
previous video which is a little bit
controversial I said that in the mobile
space because of hybrid apps and because
of projects like flutter there's a
strong potential that Swift use will
just diminish because in general native
app development is gonna go down now
this is already happening with hybrid
apps I just did a little bit more
research to confirm that and it's
happening more and more more simply
because it's just a lot less work to
write your hybrid apps rather than
having to write two separate code bases
one in Swift for iOS and one in Java for
Android right so they're going to be
using the web stack HTML CSS JavaScript
that's why today if you're going to
learn any languages any coding languages
any programming languages those three
are the the ones that I recommend the
most gives you the widest range of
possibilities in terms of jobs in terms
of business in terms of freelancing
anyhow but what happens if your Swiss
developer and you do find in a few years
like Ruby and many many other languages
though it's a great language which is a
great language what will happen if the
demand for Swift developer developers
goes down well it's not a big deal
because if you are a competent Swift
developer for you to jump ship into
flutter using dart or into the web stack
or into Python or any language will be
literally like this you see one of the
main themes of this particular YouTube
channel things I've been teaching
something I've been teaching rather for
many many years outside of YouTube to
young developers try not to think of
yourself as a swift developer or a Java
developer
a JavaScript developer or a Python
developer etc etc etc try to think of
yourself as just a developer and think
of the programming languages think of
the frameworks Franco think of the
libraries as just tools that you can
access now yes of course you will find
certain tools you will know better at a
particular point in time so right now
you babe you may be really good at your
Swift and iOS development so of course
you're kind of married to that
technology right now but it's not
uncommon it's actually quite common for
developers to have to switch from
language to language for a framework to
framework this is just par for the
course this is nothing unusual for
developers to switch over but the good
thing is once you know how to program
you know how to program something I've
told people many times I rather get
somebody with five years experience
writing Python and have them work on a
JavaScript project then have somebody of
only a one or two years of JavaScript
experience why because the person with
five years of Python coding experience
is very likely that'll be a much better
developer than the person with only two
years of experience with JavaScript
you see even though Python JavaScript
for different languages programming
languages share nineteen ninety-five
percent of the same concepts and the
same basic techniques if you will and
yes each language has its nuances it has
its own codes old syntax but they're so
very very very close so please try not
to be so hung up on what language you
use at a particular moment just because
you're writing Swift doesn't make you
necessarily a swift programmer
try to think of yourself I suggest this
anyhow it's just a programmer developer
and this comes out of experience in my
own experience as a developer I've
written commercial code what I've been
paid to or I've made money from code
I've written in nine different languages
and of course in the beginning like just
about everybody else I was resistant to
go from one language to the next
because I was comfortable in a
particular language but which you'll
find though as you jump from language to
language from framework to framework
you're going to get better and better as
a programmer that said when you're first
starting out it's best to stick to one
so you really master it well you
understand it well and that's gonna
raise your game so if you do say Swift
for three years or four years and you
find that Swift demand is really
dropping just like it happened with Ruby
remember Ruby Ruby on Rails at one point
it was the it was the crown jewel of web
development frameworks and people loved
Ruby ah it's great now at that time I
predicted its demise for market reasons
and other reasons which I won't get into
here and of course Rubeus it's fallen
quite a bit you don't hear about it you
don't hear about people wanting to do
things in Ruby Ruby rails not being said
it's still around there's still Ruby
work out there don't don't kid yourself
it's just not as nearly as hot as it
used to be now it's Jiao script even
JavaScript back in the day or Maryland
gems which was a joke language it was a
joke JavaScript JavaScript was the
language nobody wanted to use new ones
to use JavaScript that's was JavaScript
for the longest time and it's
interesting how now it's become probably
the most important language out there
today overall programming language so
you never know what's gonna happen
but it shouldn't matter to you because
as a professional developer you can just
go to any language and just jump right
into it I hope that makes sense
