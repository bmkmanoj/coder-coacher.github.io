takes time to master there's no question
so what I'm trying to do with this video
is again I want to emphasize the dream
weavers tools for managing CSS and using
CSS and I'm also just going to try and
teach you the the more practical aspects
of it because like I said there are
several books written on it and I'm not
going to be able to cover much of it and
especially in this video that said if
you I really advise but you learn a
little bit more about CSS in terms of
the raw code you should really get into
it and I'll tell you why because though
Dreamweaver is very powerful in terms of
what it does with CSS and HTML it still
has certain limitations there's always
so much you can do and it's not a about
taking a shot at Adobe Dreamweaver here
I think it's a great program it's just
what you need to know the basics behind
the scenes you need to know what
Dreamweaver is actually doing because at
the end of the day when you're clicking
all these Dreamweaver buttons and so on
Dreamweavers just writing code for you
right just write in code so you have to
understand that code you don't have to
become a guru but you have to understand
it so getting back to CSS I recommend
that once you do this stuff and you can
have practical workable knowledge from
this dreamweaver cs3 course but I would
recommend my web design one course where
I get into detail about code I get into
HTML I get into CSS and strangely enough
the course is not actually boring you
see once you understand code using a
program like dreamweaver or front page
or any web design program will become
much easier because you're going to
understand the basics and trust me it's
really not that hard you just got to
give yourself that extra hour so to
learn this stuff anyhow let's uh let's
move a little bit forward now what I
want to do is just show you again to
remind you how we can attach these style
sheets to multiple HTML pages so let's
let's create let me one just let me just
collapse this for sure first let's
create another HTML page so I'm going to
go file new see I'm showing you
different ways to do it and i will say
blank page new page and this all kinds
of neat stuff i'm going to show you
later but anyway new page and say create
head loop run a print type hello from
staff there we go so we got a page and
was going to file save and remember is
going to ask us what we want to call a
page so i'm going to be original to call
it page page two and every film exciting
see these page names are actually you
know except for the index you know what
the index is about but you know if you
were building here's a little tip when
you named your pages try to give them
names that are self-describing so let's
say you had a dog grooming business
you're building a site for them so you
might put price list give the page a
name priceless if on that page you
actually have the price list or you
might call it dog grooming bad one bad
one I know dog grooming you know dog
grooming photos there we go dot HTML
HTML there we go again you see the page
name tells me except something about
what's going to be on that page right
keep that in mind when you're building
your site's give the names intelligent
give the page names rather than tell
them intelligent names so it's easy to
remember what's going on a page provides
a sort of a self-describing logic to it
if you know what I mean and it's
actually good for google and search
engine optimization so keep that in mind
anyhow so I create a page 2.html and
here it is of course so let's let's
attach a stylesheet to it again we've
done it before what's let's do it again
you know this way we've done this way
right we have attached stylesheet but we
could also do down here sort of
shortcut way you can roll down here on
our style drop-down list and hit attach
style sheet and it gives us the options
right here so right now let's see style
of CSS and go browse see style to style
and so let's say styled a success hit ok
you go ok and there we go so page 2 I
just saved it page 2.html is now linked
to style dot CSS and we know it is
because if you look in our style CSS
style panel they go all you see that CSS
Styles is now include us now we can
happily apply our style rules cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
