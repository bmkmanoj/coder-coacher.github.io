morning I was reading an article about
NFL football players where 80% of them
regardless of how much they made when
they were playing 80% of them go
bankrupt within a couple of years of
retirement from the NFL what a disaster
imagine you work so hard you brutalize
your body where you're probably going to
get brain damage permanent battery body
injuries pain for the rest of your life
and within two years 80% chance you're
gonna go bankrupt I have to tell you
this is not a profession I would get
into whoo no no chance I don't know why
anybody who actually looks at the data
it looks at the facts would want to
become a professional football player
it's short term glory for a long term
pain and 80% chance you'd be broke
anyway so that's not very cool by the
way it's the same type of thing with
professional basketball players 80 85 %
of em B go bankrupt within a few years
so this brings me to the larger point of
this vlog why does this happen number
one there are three or four main reasons
as cited in the article and this happens
with a lot of entrepreneurs and business
owners as well I've seen it and that's
why in my upcoming course on becoming an
entrepreneur I call it the business
battle plan and one of the things I
teach is money management skills
financial skills and this is so
important in life whether you are an
entrepreneur business owner or a
professional athlete actor you really
have to get your head wrapped around
finances and investments and money
management otherwise you're going to
find yourself in a world of pain a world
of financial pain if you don't do that
so back to the professional football
players the article states that the top
four reasons why professional football
players find themselves in financial
ruin after just a couple years after
retiring though they've made tons of
money
number one they make terrible
investments bad investments number two
they get ripped off by financial
advisors accountants and what not happen
- in fact a kind of a neighbor of mine
Leonard Cohen very famous
singer-songwriter he had a house just
around the corner for me actually while
round a quarter maybe ten minutes walk
and he actually went bust in his 70s he
went bankrupt because he found his
financial adviser money manager spent
all that all his money and put him in
you know into bankruptcy so you had to
come out of retirement in the 70s to
make a few bucks to survive until you
know you passed away last year anyway so
yeah number one is financial advisors
ripping you off
number two bad investments again these
are two symptoms of having no financial
or money management skills very
important to develop these any business
course any entrepreneurial course if it
doesn't teach you this stuff is not
worth not worth it these people are just
academics because at the end of the day
if you don't have good financial skills
doesn't matter how successful your
business is you're going to wind up in a
bad situation number one again advisors
ripping you off bad investments
lifestyle spending out of control
keeping up with the Joneses as they say
out here in North America
you got to manage your money you got to
set up habits when you're young and
starting out your business habits of
saving habits of money management so
that you don't find yourself in that
situation we're spending all your money
on cars and houses you know when you see
young people who are out there showing
off their beautiful cars people in their
20s or 30s or big houses I would gamble
most of these people whether they're
probably let renting or leasing number
one number two it shows you a serious
lack of financial awareness on their
part even Warren Buffett one of richest
men in the world he lives in the same
house he bought in the nineteen
fifties it's a modest middle-class house
he could afford a huge estate with
Butler's and stuff he goes why would I
have that what a pain in the butt even
Steve Jobs he lived up until the day he
died doesn't you know billionaires in a
middle-class house in a middle-class
upper middle-class neighborhood so keep
that in mind so yeah those are top three
and number four is divorce divorce
marriage can be very expensive I'm not
against marriage I'm not saying I'm just
saying be very very careful about who
you marry man or woman and have strong
financial agreements prenups when you
get into it and understand that based on
statistics against our opinion stats you
got approximately a 50/50 chance that
you will be divorced so there's a 50/50
chance that you're going to be divorced
so you better put into place contracts
in advance that protects yourself and
your partner when the divorce happens if
it should happen 50/50 chance keep that
in mind that's a big big chance there
and if your wife to be your
husband-to-be is not into prenups then I
would consider that a big red flag big
warning about what will come down the
road if they're honest and they they're
artists people and fair-minded people
they'll understand that especially if
you work really hard in your business
and you've developed a certain amount of
equity in sort amount of wealth and you
know you're not necessarily want to give
it all away just because in five years
you guys get into a fight you know 50-50
chance keep that in mind so again a big
part of becoming financially independent
and wealth creation is actually in being
able to avoid those four big things but
the the professional athletes
professional football players follow to
guess what happens to entrepreneurs as
well I've seen it I've seen actually
even high paid programmers people who
are making a hundred grand or two 200
grand a year per year in that range from
the 90s and their late 40s 50 now and
they're they're literally broke
they're literally broke they have no
money management skills if you just took
a fraction of that money and just put it
away invested they be they be retired by
dhow
with pretty good money in the bank you
know anyhow so there you go
this is a important lesson when you're
developing your business whether you're
an entrepreneur or you buy a franchise
or whether you're professional developer
or a freelancer or even working for
people you have to develop some
financial intelligence some good
long-term habitual strategies that is
it's like a knee-jerk reaction it's like
it should be like brushing your teeth in
the morning you should implement these
certain things you do so that you know
five two years five years ten years
fifteen years I know for 20 years ago
what 20 years well I'd trust me as you
get into work and you're doing your
stuff and there's ups and downs and so
on if you don't slice away a certain
amount of the money that you earn into
long term investments into long-term
retirement investments you're gonna
you're not gonna feel like a hamster on
a wheel not getting anywhere but if you
do that and you have this habit of just
always investing always pulling money
aside you're gonna wake up in two years
hey look at it look at all those money a
good five years oh look at all this
money I got 10 years yeah look at all
those money is good I got you get the
idea so that's it for today
