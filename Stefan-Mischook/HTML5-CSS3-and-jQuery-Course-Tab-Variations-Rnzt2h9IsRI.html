i want to show you with this and if we
return back to our text editor for the
moment and we look at our javascript
here for a second or specifically
referencing our jquery you may remember
that there was an effect associated with
the tabs UI element here and it's set to
fade but if we return to our browser for
just a second i just want to point out
to you if you remember we were looking
at this the demo 1313 slideshow for tabs
well down at the bottom there is a link
to api methods and the API methods are
really just explaining a lot more
clearly how to work with tabs and
there's many many different variations
you can look at the one that we created
but there are many other ones and you
can see that there are some graphics
that you can download and use for them
as well but here is some important
information talking about the property
is what the defaults are and what the
description is well you'll see here we
have something here called fade excuse
me the effect rather and the description
for that effect that we're using right
now is fade tab contents are gradually
shown from 0 to full opacity well there
is the default which is just a show hide
and that's not really all that exciting
so that's why we chose fade Ajax loads
tab contents from the server using Ajax
and that's great one you can look at
that example if you're interested but
there's also slide and horizontal and
slide is a vertical sliding effect
whereas horizontal is a horizontal one
so let's take a look if we came in here
and we changed fade to slide rather and
if we save this and then just preview
that inside of our browser let's take a
look you already saw the beginning of
that effect but check it out see now
there's this little slide effect that's
sliding our elements in a vertical
fashion and if we were to change this to
horizontal
instead we would see upon refresh that
these elements are sliding into place
this way now kind of cool isn't it well
let's also take note of fade out speed
we set it to slow but here you can see
fade in speed and fade out speed is
anything set to zero and as you can see
here in the fade-out speed we're setting
it to slow so basically anything but
zero would work for our fade-out speed
and you know you could set that in
milliseconds right and many different
ways positive value here will result in
a cross fade effect which is
demonstrated here and it'll show you
just that right and this is the
slideshow that we've been working with
as well so those are two things that I
just want to you know make available to
you and let you be aware of that and how
that works there's also support for the
browser's back button as you can see it
requires the history tool be included on
your page and there's different things
that you could do that as well initial
index which one you're going to be
starting with rotate fall so if you
remember that's determines whether or
not we're going back to the beginning
after we've done the circle so all of
these elements here are really
interesting for you to at least they
should be necessary for you to be aware
of with regards to how the tabs work and
there's some fun things that you can do
with them however fade happens to be the
one that I particularly like the best so
that's the one that I've been sticking
with all right well while we're here
let's also take a moment to examine the
slideshow CSS now first and foremost
let's familiarize ourselves again with
what's happening we had a header with
the class called images within the
images class we had dibs that had an IMG
tag inside of them and there was also
these a links inside of the class called
slide tabs so if we come back up to the
top we'll see
information about the images there's a
background which is a gradient the
position is relative allows us to work
with absolute positioning within the
class called images so by making the
parent relative we can position things
absolutely so in here you'll see that
there's a height and width that's been
defined for it so if you wanted to
change that you certainly could it's
floating left and the cursor is a
pointer just so that when you put your
mouse over that it'll turn into a
pointer and allow you to click it also
we have the single slide and as you'll
see here the div within the class called
images is set to display none initially
and that's because we don't want them to
be seen but they do show up as soon as
the document is ready so its position
absolutely top left and top end left set
to 0 and it too has a height as well as
a font size if I want to put some text
in there I certainly could do that as
well as well you'll see that within the
images any h3s now I don't happen to
have any age 3 s this is copy code so we
don't necessarily need that there but
here we have information for the slide
tabs and those little circles below tabs
right in the initial one that was copy
pasted it was clear both but I
positioned it absolutely so that we
could get it so much from the top and a
certain amount from the right and that
allows us if we look at our design view
here to position it exactly over here
where I wanted it not just randomly in
the middle centered between everything
else along with that we also have the a
tags that are inside of the slide tabs
class and as you'll see here the real
interesting thing about them with
regards to the hover state and the
current state you'll notice that there
is information about the background
image first of all they're given a
height value and that's to indicate
exactly the size of the circle that we
want but if you are
looking at the images folder itself and
you look for the Navigator PNG as you'll
see here it is eight across by 24 in
other words eight on top of eight on top
of eight the reason that's done in this
fashion is so that on hover we just
minus the value minus eight so that it
moves up and minus 16 so that it moves
up even more to display the current
class that's here so within slide tabs
all a tags have a current and that
indicates which one is the one that's
actually the active state so that's a
little bit also about the CSS for the
slideshow and you can go about making
changes to these very easily if you wish
now when we come back I'm going to show
you another great feature with the
jQuery tools and that one's going to be
dealing with an image overlay sort of
like a gallery effect and a lightbox
effect so come back and we'll take a
look at that one as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
