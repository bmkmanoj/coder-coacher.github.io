we're going to talk about timing timing
is so important in business in life and
so let's talk about in terms of context
when you're choosing your platform your
coding language your framework try to
consider what is going to be popular
over the next 2-3 years look head a
little bit don't look behind look ahead
and that's where the big opportunities
will lie whether it be with a coding
language a framework or maybe a space
right right for instance is web apps the
big money it was still a huge amount of
money in web app creation so forth but
maybe I OT coding might be an
interesting place to look into I don't
know you can have to look around decide
where the money is in terms of your
coding and your technology pursuits are
again try to look a year two years three
years down the line try to figure out
where the buzzes that's the key to all
this stuff it's not to look behind not
to look what was popular three years ago
look what's popular what's rising in
popularity now so what did the answer is
now IOT could be one of those things but
how that's going to shake out it's hard
to say i'm not an expert in IOT i'm
actually looking a bit into it i have
somebody approached me they want me to
sort of get involved in the iot business
perhaps and i might be putting some
investment in that i'm not sure though
we'll see how that goes another thing
you can do in terms of pure coding end
of things you could look at but right
now and I've spoken about this before
i'm recording this in September 2016
javascript is on the rise in a big way
and
it's already super important of course
but you see JavaScript node JavaScript
on the server that's where you might see
a lot of opportunity as a developer a
young developer to get into that space
because a lot activity there this is
this would be in startups and that kind
of thing that said there's always tons
of work for PHP developers especially
PHP and get it when I'm talking PHP and
working with databases and several other
environments as well PHP for freelancers
do I get in to start up the cutting edge
where the big money is going to be I
would be getting into JavaScript if you
want to get into enterprise you know the
older stuff a Java spring or a dotnet
framework and you want to go accordingly
dotnet and so I bet you also have to
look at where you live where you live is
very important and most important what
you want to do what you want to do that
said this video is about timing timing
and how important timing is so let me
give you a real crazy small tiny example
about just a couple of days quotes so a
couple days ago the iphone 7 launched
and they had their their little launch
party at Apple so I saw something on
there about the the camera on on the new
iphone 7 it was curious about that so I
watched it just for that I've never had
an iphone have had iPads i have a mac i
have seen but display yet here i use
both windows 10 and i use macs oh and i
use android my main phone is an android
phone so anyway so i'm watching this
thing on the iphone and you have this
new software feature for iOS 10 where
you can create that blurry background
effect they call it the book affect the
depth of field effect they do it through
software in the iphone to create that SL
are like depth of field effect i saw
that in my initial reaction was oh i
guess they don't have the optics they
don't have the optics to create a depth
of field effect now I saw lots of video
on the s7 Samsung and just through the
optics without using hardware software
techniques they're able to create that
effect so I assumed that the Apple
phones optics basically its physical
camera did not have the capabilities to
create that effect at the end of the day
though I was wrong because actually if
you go real close on the subject you can
get that bokeh effect that nice depth of
field blurry background effect that
looks kind of cool and so I knew I did a
video very quickly that night and I said
yeah I question I was not too sure about
whether or not apple's new iphone 7s
optics its physical cameras would match
the new Samsung I was wrong about that
one part so i was like say fifty six
percent wrong in the video i talked
about a bunch of other things as well
related to the two phones i won't get
into here anyway so i put it out and
boom the thing starts to really move for
me what really move means is i got on
the front page of google for that search
term and then also within like an hour
to i had nearly 2,000 views and climbing
and i had an even split of fifty percent
thumbs down fifty percent of thumbs up
anyway you say anything perceived as
slightly negative about windows you're
going to get attacked slightly negative
about iphones you're going to get a text
slightly negative about Ruby you're
going to get attacked and so forth and
so on that's just the way it is humans
are tribal it's you know we're tribal
that's where it's were programmed in our
brains to be that way what can you do
any of so it was starting to go viral
matter of was viral but it was it was
like for me it takes me it takes one of
my videos like because of the nature the
subjects that I cover coding and we
factory have code and all these kind of
things you know takes a while I got
videos that you know takes a while they
slowly client eight hundred views a
thousand views I got a couple of videos
here and there at 10,000 views and
15,000 views but for for the most part
the type of stuff that I do is very
small audience relatively speaking so
when you in a couple of hours when
you're doing 2,000 views on youtube
alone that's not bad but because I had
made a mistake because
there was that little bit of
misinformation and Ike I said it was
like fifty percent fifty-six percent
wrong that I percent wrong I decided to
take it down I said they know what I
don't want to spread misinformation
that's not what I do on this channel
anywhere so I took it down even though I
was getting a lot of a lot of juice with
that video so you know what he did
anyway so I put up right within 20
minutes I put up another videos almost
the exact same title covering the same
subject where I said yeah I made a
mistake with the first video and then I
do this video so I put it up hardly
anything hey think it's like no juice
it's got maybe 350 views over in last 24
hours or 30 36 hours it's like nothing
same content turn them pretty much right
you know that's luck that's timing and
that's luck same content same author
same subject hardly anything so that
tells you something about that confirmed
something rather but I've been talking
about for years and years and years and
years and years another you know decade
or two luck in life is very very big
luck and knife is very very big and
that's just the way it is if you play a
lot of cards play a lot of poker you see
that to some nights you're just lucky
and you get the good card you're doing
well some nights you're getting the
backyard you're doing bad so we have to
recognize that's a big part of it so how
do you mitigate how do you deal with the
fact that you got to deal with some
lucky issues well you maximize your
chances you maximize your chances by
increasing your chances by getting
things out as quickly as possible trying
different avenues and seeing what sticks
that's basically what it comes down to
so you may get you may hit it off and
get really lucky once in a while like
the zucker breweries or the Steve Jobs
the Michael Dell's these type of guys
you have to understand and if you talk
to these people especially as they got
out as they get older and they realized
what happened Lock plays a big role it's
so yeah so you know when you're going
out there and don't put all your eggs in
one basket don't spend years and years
working on this one thing that's going
to be and then doesn't work because you
never know what's going to work like for
instance uber big big success now huge a
few years before if I understand there
were other ride-sharing absa didn't work
Airbnb almost identical types of apps
were out there or our sites are out
there prior to Arab Airbnb but they flop
because the market wasn't ready for air
B&amp;amp;B or and the market wasn't ready for
an Airbnb type of situation you got to
go out there you got to take your
chances you gotta hit you get a hit you
get a hit you got to hit you get hit and
then when you see something has
subtraction then you push forward into
it and that's a big part of it why see
you in the next video I might be
changing cameras because I can't see
myself the foci can't dollar focus is
not very good although shooter a clear
video so anyway you didn't need to hear
that we'll talk soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
