today what I'm gonna be doing is
building a really simple WordPress theme
with you from scratch and we're gonna go
through some of the different pages and
template files that are necessary for
WordPress personally my own in my own
work I've managed to use this technique
to create several sites very very
quickly here are some examples this is
one that I did for a conference this is
another one that I did with a designer
so we have navigation on the right it's
actually a bilingual website and here's
another one that I did in just about a
day very simple we've got navigation on
the left so what we're gonna be doing is
just going through the steps that are
necessary in PHP to do this the tools
that we're going to be using are of
course WordPress which is free in fact
everything that we're gonna be using to
get this job done is free and is
cross-platform so we're gonna be using
WordPress we're gonna be using a tool
called NAMP MAMP is a collection of
tools for having a local web server
it stands for Mac Apache MySQL and PHP
there are of course equivalents on Linux
live just google search lamp and also on
Windows you can search for lamp and all
of these collections or this stack of
technologies is all free so you can just
download it and run it on whichever
operating system you're currently
working on the other tool that I'm going
to be using is called text Wrangler and
text Wrangler is also free it's a very
very feature rich text editor and it's
the baby brother to another tool called
BBEdit which is great if you're doing a
lot of development and you just want a
very powerful very simple text editor
again you could use anything else you
could even use notepad on windows if you
wanted to and by the end of this
tutorial set what you should end up with
is something like this it's a very
simple theme we're also going to do a
sidebar which isn't
here right now and you're gonna be able
to essentially create different template
postings or different templates for
different parts of the WordPress theme
which is how all of the other sites that
I've done work so by the end of this
series you should be comfortable enough
to build your own template by yourself
we're gonna be using a bit of PHP but
you really don't need to be a PHP coder
to follow along just have a wonderful
interest in web design and web
development if you know HTML and CSS
it'll probably help but again it's not a
requirement that's about it so let's get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
