flogging lately this is a busy time of
the year for me on boarding schools and
such but that should be over the next
couple weeks depending on how smoothly
smoothly things roll out and we should
be back to to normal vlogging Molesey so
I just want to quickly discuss what the
role of a good mentor is in people's
lives I've had a few more than a few
mentors a couple of key ones whether it
be mentors in my martial arts or my
business or my coding career at the end
of it at the end of the day a good
mentor points the way a good mentor
doesn't do to work for you that's
impossible you have to do your own work
but the good mentor will help you avoid
major pitfalls and point you in a
general direction one of the things you
have to learn about when dealing with
mentors is sometimes it happened to me
sometimes you're gonna have to accept
where they will perceive something
that's true something in reality but you
just can't see yourself and that is
because of experience it's kind of like
if you're a musician and you've played a
lot you have well if you're a good
decent musician at least in a way you
have a sense of timing and time you know
instinctively when you're jamming when
you're playing when the change is going
to happen all the dynamics of the music
you're much more aware of it you you're
able to see it or hear it rather very
clearly where somebody who is not
trained in music hasn't played an issue
instrument before you just don't see it
and it's like a good friend of mine was
a singer in a band for several years he
would describe his say you can almost
see the future you know in terms of a
jam he would know instinctively didn't
have to - didn't have to look at the
other players in the band didn't have to
I didn't have to really even know the
songs he just knew when things were
going to shift
and that's just the nature of that game
and the same thing with martial arts as
well when you get more advanced in
martial arts you'll find in any fighting
you'll find that your perception about
the whole thing changes quite a bit and
I remember when I first started martial
arts when I was like 10 years old or
something
a lot of things were kind of magical to
me like I remember my first style I took
with judo and a lot of throws and the
takedowns and a takedown defense and
submissions and so forth where we're
very mysterious like you see people get
thrown into it Wow how that happened and
then you do it for a couple of years it
also it loses its magic but you start
seeing all the mechanics of all of all
the judo techniques and throws etc you
start seeing in a different light you
start seeing how it really is and same
thing when I went into the striking arts
I remember certain types of cakes and
techniques and trapping techniques in
Wing Chun and grappling techniques and
armbars all those kind of stuff this was
very again it was very magical to me how
do you do that how do you do that but
that as you progress as you train as you
learn as you're guided along the way you
start seeing things so when you have an
experienced fighter within moments to be
able to tell just by looking at somebody
how they walk how do you position
themselves what kind of fighter there
whether they're kickers whether they're
inside fighters whether they try to take
you to the ground it becomes pretty
obvious just on you know fairly subtle
well not even too subtle at least to a
trained eye what they're going to do
because you can see the positioning that
a grappler will often take or the
positioning a kicker will take for
instance attack window guys have a
tendency to have a slightly wider stance
they'll be high up and the legs will be
wider apart and they'll be bouncing
around and you see their hands will be
down typically because they're ready to
get and ready to kick that's what a
kicker does boxers will have narrower
stance you see their hands will tend to
be higher up by trier up ten you know
generally speaking and so it's obvious
what's going to happen grapplers they'll
crouch
lo lo crouch low no and you see Doris
stamps will be adjusted accordingly
getting ready to shoot in and try to
take you down and yeah so anyway off on
the tangent here point is is that a
mentor would say in business for
instance will have a perception about
business that you don't have yet because
you haven't done it it's still kind of
hazy and mystical for you if you will
but if you run through the rigmarole of
having built companies or products up
and launch them and see some fails some
see some succeed dealing with the
headaches and so forth you've done this
a few times as I have more interview
times you have a perception of things
it's very obvious and unless you've done
it you just don't see it and same thing
with quoting by the way as I've been
saying for a while now I said the key to
becoming a great coders actually not
trying to master every new framework out
there no no the key to becoming a great
coders is in the core concepts and the
core principles of of a programming
language and of programming and app
development in general if you have those
core concepts it doesn't matter which
framework it doesn't matter which
language you go into you're going to be
advanced if you if you've had these
things mastered you're gonna be a very
good position that's the whole point of
all this alright that's it for now Joe
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
