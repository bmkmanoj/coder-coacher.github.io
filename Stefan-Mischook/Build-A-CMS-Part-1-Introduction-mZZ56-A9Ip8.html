calm welcome to a brand new screencast
series on building a basic content
management system I'm going to be
covering a little bit of everything from
HTML and CSS to PHP and JavaScript so I
hope you'll find this tutorial series
useful and I hope that at the end of
this series you're going to have a
working functional content management
system that you can use in your own
projects
let me dive straight in by showing you a
working example of what we're going to
be building what you see here is a basic
HTML and CSS based site it's nothing
super complicated
I'm going to go ahead and log into the
content management system just by
clicking this link down here at the
bottom and the first thing you'll notice
is we get this modal window that pops up
in the middle of the page and allows us
to log in and let's say we mistyped the
password so we type the password
incorrectly we hit login and notice that
this window expands and gives us a
invalid username of password error so
let me type this incorrectly there we go
and the way I've built this system is I
want it to be very easy for either you
or your clients to use so what I've
built out is some kind of like a live
edit feature where it shows your website
as it would online but specific fields
have been highlighted the areas that you
can go ahead and edit and you'll notice
it looks like we have a couple different
types of editable fields we have a
one-line field of
what-you-see-is-what-you-get field in a
textarea field so there are a couple
different kinds of content that I'm
going to show you how to build out so
let's die click let's do the one line
first so notice we get a pop up another
modal window that appears tells us what
content block we're editing and let's
say you just tweak this a little bit so
a page header here hit submit and you
notice the page refreshes and the
content is updated
so all this content is saved in the
database so the content management
system is doing all the work of fetching
the database and grabbing all the
correct pieces of data this is what the
what-you-see-is-what-you-get
functionality looks like and we're going
to be working with JavaScript based
solution called tiny MCE and that adds
functionality to allow us to be able to
add what you see is what you get sort of
editable field same as you'd find in
wordpress or other content management
systems and for example this makes it
easy for us to change information maybe
we want to make this section bold hit
submit and you'll notice that this has
been updated on the site and includes
the bold text and this is the last
example here is text area and it's just
a big text field know what you see is
what you get toolbars so it's pretty
basic and straightforward I guess the
last feature that I want to show you is
just a preview page option if you click
this link these fields disappear so you
can preview the site as you would see it
live then you can click it again to make
these buttons make these fields reappear
and make the fields editable now that
I've demonstrated this system let me
talk briefly about the goals that I have
in mind as I'm building this system the
main one is I want to make sure it's
simple and easy for people to use I mean
it could be you yourself who's going to
be using this application it could be
your clients their customers people you
work with but no matter what I want to
make sure it's easy for people to
understand and bug-free works
consistently I also want to make sure
that it's going to be flexible that I
build it in such a way that it's going
to be easy for you to add additional
functionality in or for me to come back
in the future videos and add
functionality myself and finally I want
to make sure that it's something that's
easy to integrate into existing
I don't want you to have to build a
project from scratch in order to use
this system and to that end let me show
you just a brief sampling of the code so
this code here is this page just the
basic HTML and CSS and what I've done is
I've added a couple lines of PHP in
different spots in this code and as I
was saying I want to make this as easy
to integrate as possible so it just
requires a couple lines require require
is an include that calls the application
itself requires this head function which
includes the necessary JavaScript and
CSS requires a toolbar function which
makes this content management system
toolbar appear and disappear as
necessary
and finally these PHP lines wherever you
want to put content blocks we're going
to include these lines and the system is
smart enough to create content blocks if
they don't exist yet and to allow you to
edit them and update them as need be
with that in mind there are a couple of
requirements and expectations that I
have before we move forward in this
course just to talk briefly about
requirements I do expect that you're
going to have a computer that has access
to PHP 5 and MySQL I and just you know
working with mantle lamp should easily
fulfill this or if you have a web-based
server that you can upload files to and
work with that that'll work too and I'm
aiming this series primarily at
intermediate level PHP developers
someone who's at least beginners
understanding of PHP HTML and CSS and
JavaScript I'm going to do my best to
explain things as clearly and as easily
as I can
so please you know feel free to follow
along if you are a brand new beginner
you know somebody who's never worked
with any of this stuff before but keep
in mind that it will be more challenging
for you so as a final thing in this
video let me briefly discuss what I'm
going to be
in the next however many videos that
this series contains I'm going to be
talking about a wide range of
technologies HTML and CSS which is
primarily for the basic web site I'm
going to be talking a lot about object
oriented PHP and MySQL I those are the
technologies that I'm going to be using
to provide the core functionality for
the content management system and to
connect to the database and finally I'm
going to be talking about JavaScript and
jQuery and a little bit of Ajax thrown
in there as well and also working with
jQuery plugins we're going to be using
the color box plugin for jQuery which
provides the modal window functionality
that I showed you in the demo and
finally the tiny MCE plugin which allows
us to use what you see is what you get
functionality in our text areas so I
hope all this sounds exciting I hope
it's going to be an interesting series
and I hope you're going to learn a lot
so feel free to contact me if you have
any questions as you go through this my
email is Ben at career sites comm or you
can contact me on the killer sites
forums that's our website slash
community where I go by the username Ben
so thanks for listening I hope you enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
