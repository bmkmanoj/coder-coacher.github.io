a developer within 30 days let me be
more precise can you start making money
as a coder within 30 days of taking a
coding course short answer is yes it
would be entry-level though you can't
expect to be writing high end
professional code in 30 days that takes
more time but definitely you can get out
there and start making money as a
developer if you put in the time and you
got a good course the key to learning of
course as you learn your fundamentals
quick and then you start building
project but number one learn
fundamentals well number two build
little projects number three get out
there do some work with real people real
people real projects so if you're doing
freelance work easy to find if you can't
get a paid gig at first then just do
some free ones do a free one for friend
or a small business just tell the troops
that we're building you know building it
I'm learning my skills but I know what
I'm I know what I'm doing I'm beginner
it out but I'll build it for free and
you just start working with Democrats
working with a client dealing with the
clients situations and getting
parameters from them and executing on
all that that's part of a learning
process rather than working on your own
projects at home although that's a good
start as well so in terms of programming
languages you're not going to get this
first job in 30 days with C++ or Java
you won't get it Ruby you won't get it
with a lot of different languages out
there but where you will get it is in
the web stack of course that's html5
css3 a little bit JavaScript and
probably PHP just because so many small
businesses work on PHP and we're press I
know I talked about this in other vlogs
but this is something that has to be
emphasized because WordPress is not
considered sexy and PHP is not
considered sexy even though they really
are powerful and how their places in the
world believe it or not they do here's
the thing though the demand is there
because there's so many small businesses
that work off of WordPress and if they
work off of WordPress that means they
work off PHP they probably use a PHP
shopping cart based system and who
what else they have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
