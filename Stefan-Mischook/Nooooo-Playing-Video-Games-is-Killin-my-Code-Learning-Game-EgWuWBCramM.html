questions sometimes based on emails sent
to me but I don't reveal who you are so
here we go I am about to finish the CSS
portion of the killer sites course I'm
so glad I am though for the past few
months I have lost motivation for
programming although it's a skill that I
want to pursue more than anything else
being in high school young guy what are
the skills you have to develop as an
individual is the ability to focus and
be persistent this is a skill like it's
like lifting weights a muscle and how do
you do that you try to persist every day
so let's say you don't feel like writing
a little code that day just sit down he
was that painful get to your computer
drag yourself there sit down and say I'm
going I'm gonna write code for 10
minutes that's it just 10 minutes and
then I'll leave and this way you're
gonna start training your brain but
you're the master you gotta train your
monkey bro lizard brain your monkey
brain you gotta train your brain see I'm
the master today even though you don't
want me to code you're making me feel
lazy you want me to go play destiny or
something I'm going to write a little
bit of code today that is such an
important thing so you just there you go
there you go to the dust you sit down
you grab your laptop and you go under it
code and write just ten minutes of code
and after our 10 minutes it's still
painful you've done your 10 minutes fine
you've done something today at least you
move forward a little bit that's my tip
what you find often enough once you
start writing a code you might end up
being there for an hour but when you're
feeling really lazy just say I'm just
going to do 5 minutes it's good - 10
minutes I'm just gonna write one
function I'm just gonna write one class
I'm just gonna build an HTML table I'm
just gonna do four lessons on studio I'm
just gonna do one lesson on studio have
an answer to quiz questions that's one
of the reasons we develop studio well
the way it is by the way where it
remembers exactly where you were in the
course so that when you log back in not
only takes you to the exact lesson we
taking rate to the question you were at
in attracts everything so you can easily
see what you answered review everything
and just get to it
and because the videos are not ten
thousand hours long per video but you
have to scroll through the video to
figure out where you are there are short
videos so you know each video is like
five minutes six minutes no big deal to
watch them in their average six minutes
actually so let's say you're feeling
lazy one day just gonna do one video so
you get to your studio web diva you
watch the one video and you watch me
blah blah blah talk and then you just
did a quizzing and if you still feel
lazy that day it happens sevens
everybody including me they just walk
away but at least you've moved forward
you pushed it forward a little bit
alright being in high school I get
caught up with schoolwork but mostly
playing video games
yeah we've been all that we've all been
there and things that will distract me
and take me away from being able to
learn practice first of all you're a
nice girl you're young you know come on
you got a lot of time ahead if you trust
me I would give away all my money if I
could go back to being like in high
school seventeen eighteen Oh that'd be
great anyway so again just take that ten
minutes go and do what you got to do and
you'll see you'll start advancing
because when you when you contradict or
you go against your laziness which is
just your lizard brain your monkey brain
making you lazy when you control that
that impulse to to be lazy when you say
no what's happening is you're slowly
training your monkey brain your lizard
brain to to not be lazy and trust me
that's the most important thing you have
somebody who's persistent can work
consistently with moderate skill they'll
always beat somebody super talented
who's lazy guaranteed he continues when
I cold though I he'll bring passion
desire for practice and knowledge but
when I delved there's a little fire in
me and to start up due to the high
amount of effort it takes to get back
into it that's why you sent mentally set
yourself up perfect to say
gonna break one line of code it's gonna
write one function I'm just gonna do one
extra lesson today in studio web CSS or
studio javascript or whatever PHP or
Python
what do we happen to be takin just set
yourself minimal goals it's kind of like
you're in high school
anybody in college will recognize us
recognize this it's like when you have
this huge paper you got to submit you
got to submit a twenty page that's not
huge a 50 page report in three months
and you're like fifty pages you don't
want to do it why because your brain is
going that's a lot of work 50 pages so
your brains like your monkey brain your
lizard brain is it's fighting you
against that it doesn't want you to do
it so what you got to do in those
situations you that's you got to give
your brain your lizard brain your monkey
brain a little task you say now we're
not doing 50 pages today we're just
gonna write the first paragraph that's
it that's all so all sudden the
resistance will drop the monkey brain
and lizards very powerful influencer on
your life but it's not too bright even
though it's powerful so you can fool it
by saying we're not doing 50 pages today
we're just doing one paragraph maybe two
that's it and the lizard brain would go
okay that's not so that's not such a lot
of work okay let's just do vet so again
give yourself these little incremental
tasks to do and you'll be able to get to
a desk to sit down to write code or to
write or report or do whatever how would
you recommend me to continue to follow
of path of programming and not fall back
and the demotivated and lazy path even
though I love computing I think I
answered your questions do this and and
if you watch my previous vlog I talked
about working on your medium or long
term goals the stuff that you really
want to get to so let's say you're
learning to code because you want to put
up a website for some web app you want
to put out start planning that web app
start sketching it out start thinking
about the functions and the features etc
etc that's an example I talked about in
previous vlog there you go I hope this
is helpful this might be my my thing
that I do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
