our tutorial where we're going to put
everything all together on a HTML page
and we'll take advantage of the browsers
back button using a very simple
application something that's built in
directly into flash so here's how we get
started remember number one first and
foremost that we did have an
ActionScript layer first thing I'd like
you to do is to take a look at that
first frame where we indicated what the
movie clip loader object was and how
that worked what I'd like you to do is
to move that to about frame three four
or even five why do we do that number
one so that there's a bit of a buffer
when this thing first loads and
oftentimes sometimes you'll have some
depending on what the processing speed
of the particular computer is you might
get a bit of a glitch where it won't
read the very first frame after years of
experience this is something that we
usually do in any major project just
give it a bit of a buffer you know two
three four frames or something like that
is fine I'm going to put it on frame
number five in this case and also when
we take advantage of this back button
you'll notice that rather than always
starting at the first frame and seeing
the pre loader which is something we
don't want to see if we don't have to
this ensures that when we do use the
back button it'll just go back to frame
number one and it won't reload that
script again so it's really useful and
can be very good for us to give
ourselves a bit of a buffer
also something else that we can do is to
notice that we've got anchors that are
being used here as the frame names
remember label type anchors now that's a
good thing and here's why and how we'll
take advantage of that if you go to file
and we go to our publish settings one
more time you'll notice that in these
particular publish settings
I've got formats for flash and HTML
incidentally it right now it's just
going to call this master HTML but if
you prefer you could name this
index.html and that will be much more
appropriate so I will include that now
the flash settings pretty much same as
everything else if you want it in
version Player eight that's fine this
particular scripts ActionScript 2.0 as
we've set them out will also be
supported in Flash Player seven so you
can set them up as both of those either
one is acceptable and will work in fact
in the HTML settings here there's a
number of things by default you'll see
flash only you could detect flash
version and into and indicate what
version of Flash you're looking for in
this case we set seven so it's defaulted
at version seven and if we were to do
that it will you know redirect to
something telling it that it does in
fact need flash but I also want to say
flash with named anchors and flash with
named anchors is a really really great
way to do this as you can see because
what we're going to be doing is setting
up the ability for our Flash movie to
take advantage of the anchors that we've
set up and the back button of your
browser window so I'll just click OK
and if we were to say file publish now
what it's doing is it's giving me not
only an SWF but also an HTML file which
we'll see in just a second
you play it on your computer you can go
directly but first and foremost what I'd
like to show you is a finished version
of this site so as you can see here I
can press f11 just to see this full
screen as you will notice that in
Internet Explorer sometimes you'll have
to activate by clicking first but take
note if you press on these buttons it
loads the author page the portfolio page
sure is purposely heavy so that you'll
be able to see the preloader contact
page here here's the kicker though when
we have our back button in place as you
can see right here now unlike most flash
movies we can take advantage of this
back to portfolio back to author back to
killer sites incidentally notice that
once you've loaded this particular page
portfolio page and it is in fact in the
cache memory you'll never see that
preloader again so that's another
advantage of doing it the way we did so
as you can see that sets up everything
that we're going to need and that's how
you should have it set up in your files
as well so that's it that takes us to
the end of the tutorial and that wraps
things up quite nicely for you keep your
eyes out for further tutorials in flash
and ActionScript as we'll be discussing
how to insert video into this particular
file also how to work with sound and
flash as well as learning a little bit
more about animation in flash but
specifically animating through
ActionScript I hope to see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
