slash in a star and they end with a four
star and a forward slash and you can
make them as many lines as you want the
next step is we're going to type theme
name and then colon and then my template
if I hit save now and i refresh this
page you'll see that my template is now
appearing as the theme name but the
theme is still broken its broken because
the template itself is still missing
let's go through and figure out some
more information that we want to include
in this little block here so there's the
theme URI which is the actual URL for
our template so I'm just going to put my
own domain and if I have the template
somewhere then i would probably put my
template and you could download it there
but unfortunately it's not there and
then a description simple wordpress
theme for killer sites and a version
which is very important if you're going
to be offering up your template to
people online and an author I'm just
going to save that there if we refresh
that again the template is still missing
and what it's complaining about is that
there's no index PHP file now the way
that WordPress is structured is that you
can create different pages for different
styles of content so let's go back just
for a minute to our page here what we're
looking at here is the default homepage
if i click on hello world that i'm taken
to a particular post in the wordpress
theme now when i go back if i click on
about i'm taken to an actual page in my
wordpress configuration and if i do a
search that i'm taken to a search
results page
now if our theme doesn't have all of
these different kinds of templates it'll
eventually just default to the index.php
file now because our wordpress theme
doesn't have an index PHP file it still
says that it's broken so let's make an
index PHP file I'm going to go back to
text Wrangler and I'm just going to
create a new file I'm going to hit save
I'm going to just say index dot PHP now
there's nothing there but if I go back
here and I refresh it will actually see
that my template shows up and it's no
longer broken however when i click on
WordPress classic I can see what my
theme is going to look like with the
content and when I go back to the
kubrick theme or the WordPress default
theme I can also see that however when I
go back to my template I don't see
anything the reason for this is that we
haven't actually used any of the code
that is available to us through the
WordPress API the WordPress API is
basically a collection of functions that
WordPress provides template designers so
that we can basically build our own
themes without having to worry about the
nitty-gritty of the wordpress content
management system basically we can
create themes without having to worry
about accessing the database or
manipulating posts so that they're
hierarchical or any of these kinds of
tasks that would be better spent or
better done by the actual WordPress
framework or WordPress installation so
if i go back to my index PHP file and
now what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to start creating a very simple
PHP page
first thing of course is you need to
have a doctype I'm just going to put
that in and I'm going to put in an HTML
tag and a head tag I'm going to close
the head tag a body tag I'm going to
close the body tag and then I'm going to
close the HTML tag in just in here i'm
going to put hello world very simple so
far now if i hit save and i go back to
my template you'll see that it says
hello world in fact if i go to anywhere
on my page or anywhere on my website I'm
going to see hello world there's no way
for wordpress to figure out where it is
right now so I'm just going to close
this and we're going to add a little bit
of logic so that we can figure out some
things like the proper title of our page
I'm going to go back to text wrangler
and the first bit of wordpress code that
i'm going to introduce is the blog name
so i'm just going to use the PHP block
here and i'm going to close the PHP
block so whatever you see inside here is
actually PHP code and in here i'm just
going to say blog info name and now what
this is going to do is it's going to
output the name that i've specified in
the settings of my blog so i should get
my new template in my new wordpress
theme and that's what we're getting
again very simple so we're already
starting to see a bit of dynamic content
appearing now there is another thing
that I'd like to put in there which are
basically all of the little chunks of
code that are made available thanks to
the RSS and subscription services that
WordPress offers so I'm just going to
actually paste this in from another
theme and I'll briefly touch on it right
now so in the head body or in the head
section of my HTML page I'm just going
to paste in three lines the first is a
link tag alternate application RSS plus
XML title is equal to a blog info name
now we've already talked about blog info
name that's the name of the actual blog
and then RSS feed and then blog info RSS
URL now if you guess that blog info RSS
to URL is the RSS feed then you're
correct so basically we're just adding
some helpful information for the browser
so that it knows how to subscribe if
this is in fact a blog to this
particular wordpress installation and
then we're also going to have this WP
underscore head section which is going
to be used by wordpress if there's any
kind of dynamic content that it wants to
inject and it does this in the wp
underscore head section so it's just
good to leave this here now I'm going to
click on this again and I'm going to
activate and you'll notice that we
haven't actually changed anything but if
I visit the site and I view my source
we're actually going to get a little bit
more information than we saw in our
template we're going to get some meta
information we're going to get some more
XML information we're also going to have
the generator which in this case is
WordPress and so blog info you our blog
info name has been replaced with my new
template RSS feed and then the RSS feed
has also been dynamically created for us
now in the next video we're going to
talk a little bit about the loop and the
loop is a concept that wordpress
template designers tend to refer back to
and it's often seen in a lot of blog
posts dealing with styling of WordPress
themes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
