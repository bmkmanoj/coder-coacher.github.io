versus traditional hosting and let's
talk about dedicated servers while we
are at it so I been developing since the
90s and the host thing that I'm used to
is either traditional where you read
hosts hosting space from some some
provider some hosting company they put
it on their physical servers and away
you go you use a control panel like
Plesk or cPanel to interact with your
site you upload your site by SS FTP yeah
this is traditional then we go to the
next step where you get pretty popular
where your sites are starting to
generate a lot of traffic and you start
getting in trouble with your hosting
accounts that happen to me many many
years ago so you have to upgrade to a
dedicated server so you get your own
dedicated box now you could configure
your own box and stick it in some
company's warehouse where they plug it
into their super high-speed Internet I
wouldn't advise that because then
there's any problems with that box it's
a big heading for you you have to go in
and blah blah blah blah better solution
with a dedicated service you just use
the dedicated servers company's own
hardware don't even have rack servers or
whatever configurations they happen to
have now the good thing about that is
that you have total control over your
server there's no other sites on there
there's nobody else using apps on there
so you have total control you have to
worry about somebody else doing
something I could take down your site or
your app but there are some downsides to
that as well so the downside to having a
dedicated servers that you have a single
point of failure meaning that if that
server should fail the hard drive fails
the round fails the power supply fails
whatever you got problems so in that
situation you have to have some good
backups in place remote backups so you
should be daily backing up the database
databases
you should have daily backups of the
server itself ideally on to another
server although you could use a raid
array so you have one disk drive for
your main server you have another disk
drive it's cloning the main one
continuously so if the main drive fails
the new one picks up and away you go but
that doesn't protect against other
Hardware problems if a hard to support
supply should go if some Ram goes bad
etc consider that being said I've been
doing dedicated serving I've been
running dedicated servers rather for 10
years or so and I've had one hardly
hardware failure of the hard drive in
that whole time so the hardware's pretty
solid these days so it's you know I'm
not sure how how scared you should be
about that another thing is that what a
dedicated server you're kind of capped
out so cap to see AP out meaning if you
start getting a huge spike in traffic
you're gonna have to scramble to get a
new dedicated server up and writing a
cat to capture about this that growth of
volume how often does that happen
very rare so I wouldn't be so concerned
about that with the cloud base hosting
there is the advantage that it's really
easy to set up be say especially with
project projects at digitalocean and
amazon's and google and you got all
these tools now out there but make it
really easy to go boom boom boom and you
got your cloud-based hosting up and
running there's some complexity with it
though I'm not sure if it's any more
complex come to think of it as using a
traditional server but it's different
where these days uploading files with
FTP is considered old-school bad form
although a lot of people still do it but
when you're getting into more advanced
app development
everybody's been pushing things through
repos like github or bitbucket and
they're using SSH to move files around
this is all back-end server stuff I'll
get into the details here the point is
is that when you're getting into
cloud-based whole state you're getting
to much more modern way of doing it
it's more secure in fact with our new
servers we don't even use passwords
anymore we use keys to SSH keys to allow
us to log in and navigate our servers
hey that's a whole different video a
whole different subject so yes there are
new methods today of hosting your web
app or your website's cloud base hosting
is great for the fact that you can scale
almost instantly so you can spike a
traffic these days with fear with these
systems if you know what you're doing
you can go beaming meaning you're up and
running in moments also you have a lot
of opportunities in terms of cloud
backups auto backups and recoveries it's
just really sophisticated stuff and in
fact cloud-based hosting as I believe I
mentioned in a previous video has a lot
of implications in terms of app
development
you know itself because of the fact that
you can clone your app and scale it in a
very simple way and I call it dum-dum
scaling where you just clone your app
and just move it over boom ba-ba-boom it
allows for you to have a much simpler
architecture in terms of your own app
prior to cloud-based hosting these
really interesting solutions that to be
honest with you we're just getting into
this year personally it changes the way
you can look at development in terms of
your app the app code base itself could
be actually significantly simpler when
it comes to scaling and backups and
security and so forth because of
cloud-based hosting it's kind of a cool
thing to be honest with you and it
actually goes to one of the basic
principles in in object-oriented
programming separation of concerns
valves are stretching I'm stretching how
people interpret that but essentially by
using cloud-based hosting you're able to
extract out of your core app a lot of
security issues and scaling issues which
is a good thing because whenever you
break your app down into finer
components meaning you simplify your app
so we have what aspect of your app that
just handles logging another have aspect
of your app just handles and a
processing of orders so now with
cloud-based hosting you can extract the
need for scaling functionality scaling
meaning if you have to expand the power
of your site and so that it can handle a
lot more traffic because of cloud-based
hosting you can extract that component
that complexity out of your core out and
utilize the cloud infrastructure to
simplify your core apps code base which
is very cool because it simplifies a lot
of things it actually can extend the
longevity of an older app that may not
have been engineered for scaling
initially so instead of having to go in
there and try and mess with an old code
base which is like a disaster you can
just relegate that push that into the
cloud based services I don't know this
is probably a little bit too high level
and abstract for some of you guys but
the point is is that cloud base hosting
is more complex in certain regards but
it's more secure in terms of raw
security it's more secure in terms of
being able to scale more easily it's
more secure to being able to have a more
robust backup and recovery built into it
because of the nature of what it is now
in terms of buggy old code bases that's
just the way it goes just to remind you
one of my friends said there's a crappy
code and crap here code
he used other words but you get the idea
and I was listening to some people
talking about how YouTube which is one
of the biggest companies out there run
by one of the biggest companies out
there they have some lingering problems
within YouTube now some bugs because
they have some old wacky code floating
around in YouTube that causes problems
and they're trying to work their way
around this and this is YouTube so if
Google YouTube has problems with their
code because it's a ten year old code
base don't be worried about your
getting a little problematic over times
as well that being said one of the best
ways to keep it cold from becoming messy
and dirty is to keep your code as simple
as possible go for simple simple simple
as possible because simple code is
easier to maintain than complex code but
there's some fancy stuff so that's about
it for now when I found a tangent but
that's what I that's what I do
