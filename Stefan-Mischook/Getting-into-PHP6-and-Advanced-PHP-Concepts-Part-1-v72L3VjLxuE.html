comm and in this series of videos what
I'm gonna be doing is walking you
through some of the more advanced topics
of found in many of the very popular PHP
frameworks out there whether it's
Symphony or PHP cake or the Zend
framework and we're gonna be looking at
getting ready for PHP 6 which should be
coming out in a couple of months and
just looking at some advanced topics
like magic methods namespaces anonymous
functions creating callbacks and doing a
lot of kind of neat things with the code
to just minimize the amount of code that
we're actually writing so that it's more
succinct and so it's better architected
so there's definitely going to be an
emphasis on architecture in this series
of videos so let's get started the first
thing you're gonna need to follow along
is just you're gonna need some kind of
lamp or xampp stack of technologies
you're gonna need PHP and Apache and
usually when you download it it also
comes with my sequel so what I would
suggest is to go to Apache friends org
and to download a copy of xampp which is
free and it's actually cross-platform if
you're on a Windows box or on on a Mac
or you're running Ubuntu or any kind of
Linux distribution you should be able to
get up and running relatively quickly
with xampp with that in mind you're
going to need to have at least version
5.3 of PHP to get started so if you
don't want to install xampp on your
local computer you're going to need to
have a hosting environment where you can
work with that version of PHP or above
so I have this local domain set up on my
humble little computer here which is
pointing to killer PHP which is just a
fake address it's a it's basically
pointing to my local computer so I can
develop easily at home and I've also got
this very simple text editor called
BBEdit which I
highly suggests but you can get away
with pretty much any text editor or you
can use a fancy one like PDT or NetBeans
but really anything is good and you'll
see that basically I've got an index dot
PHP file here with preparing yourself
for pH b6 autoloading classes which is
going to be the first topic that we're
going to be looking at and if i refresh
this page I can see it right here in
terms of my file structure you'll see
that I have this folder here called
killer PHP and I've got a public folder
with the actual index dot PHP file that
you're seeing right here so this is very
important just we've got the killer PHP
folder which is where we're storing our
application and we have a public folder
where we're going to be putting any
public assets classes or scripts that we
want to make available to the viewers of
the web site and in there we just have
an index dot PHP file so if I go back to
BB edit here and I delete these lines
and I open up a PHP tag and do PHP info
with a semicolon I should be able to see
that I'm running PHP version 5.3 which
is pretty much all that's required to
get us up and running and doing some
neat stuff with autoloading classes in
future videos in this series we're
actually going to be building our own
MVC framework and it's not that I would
suggest that you write one or that you
roll your own from scratch unless you
have a lot of time on your hands but it
is a great way of seeing how frameworks
are constructed in general and sort of
the power that comes with using methods
that are called dynamically so instead
of actually calling a function in a
class you you abstract out that
responsibility to another class it
sounds a little tricky at this point but
once we get into the code it'll it'll
probably make a little more sense so
let's get started the first thing that I
want to talk about is just you might
have seen this a lot in in legacy PHP
code is the statement
require once so if I wanted to load a
class for example and I'm gonna create
I'm gonna create a class called a user
it's gonna be a user model so if we
think about this in in traditional
old-school PHP you would create a new
file and you would say class user so we
just kind of open that up and then I'm
in my public folder here so I would
create user dot PHP hit save and then
we'd be good to go let's say I created a
public function here called get name and
I returned John Smith and then here if I
wanted to use that class than I would do
require once and then user dot PHP then
I would create a new user object and
then I would echo user get name and then
if I went back to my site here and i
refresh this I would get John Smith now
this is great if you're dealing with one
or two PHP files but a lot of these
frameworks have hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of classes which means that
if you want to create any kind of
structure or relationship between these
classes you're constantly creating these
require once statements here and there
and that can be a lot of a lot of work
for you down the line so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to show you how you
can create namespaces basically an
absolute location for a class and then
you can do away with all of these
require one statements so instead of
saying require once user dot PHP and
then user equals no user you can just
say user equals new user and everything
else will just magically work now to do
that we're going to need to change our
index dot PHP file a little bit the
first thing I want to do is I want to
look at this very special function
called get include path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
