MacBook Pro and I just wanted to comment
about their major revolutionary laptop
where they tout this strip at the top of
the laptop let me just show you this in
the will go to Apple apple.com touch of
genius right so they got this so they
got the touch strip at the top where you
can control your radio and it changes
based on what's on your screen so forth
and they have this in place because they
don't have a touchscreen they're the
only laptop in the market I believe at
this price point which is it's pretty
expensive it doesn't have a touchscreen
which is if you've have a touchscreen I
have a touchscreen laptop in addition to
my back macbook pro 2012 right now the
touch screen is very useful to have even
doing just common day-to-day tasks so
it's kind of ashamed they put it in
anyway so you got this touch thing at
the top where you can control things and
it changes based on the app that's on
the screen which is kind of cool
revolutionary silver save classic Apple
so here we go we have a HP Pavilion
deviate released 2010 so about six years
ago and you can't see it here but let me
show you a screenshot of it because the
dv7 say put a little arrow you know just
look at it isn't that familiar right
little little screen here you know in
that familiar yeah so it seems that
maybe they did invent it so let's go
back to my video there's a comment here
and what our most famous YouTube
vloggers product loggers this guy mkbhd
he was interviewing the top apple guy so
watch this quick little clip I'll put
the link in in this video but it's I'm
viewing this up here at 55 seconds top
of this HP Pavilion dv6 our Jameson it
was a great laptop at the time and
helped me out a lot the webcam made the
videos and at the top of that laptop it
had this little
function bar with like a volume slider
and some little brightness buttons
didn't change or anything right but this
is like next-level having these buttons
that change based on what happier you're
using at the time so there you have it
in 2010 using the technology of the time
HP had put in a bar at the top of the
screen and of course not as advanced
because six years ago and technology it
has evolved so yeah classic Apple they
take ideas that other people have used
have created and they use the technology
of the day to advance them like the
iPhone the smartphone if you will was
really invented by palm PA LM and and
when touch screen became available Apple
licensed the touch screen they did not
invent it they licensed it and they did
what they did and there's nothing wrong
with that but I just want to bring some
truth to the discussion with regards to
who's inventing what and what's
revolutionary or not that's it for this
