the fact that we've got our header in
place here and it just says insert logo
here so maybe I'll just change that
information to killer sites training or
CSS training and I will just save that
in my HTML and I'll move on over to my
CSS stylesheet and just right after our
header and you'll notice I'm kind of
trying to organize these things so that
they're logically built together and
I'll come in here and I'll say header h1
and let's define the definition for this
information so what will we do I think
what we're gonna do first and foremost
is to give it the same margin and
padding that we have on the other
elements so let's come in here and we'll
say padding should we give it all the
same all the way around we could you
know that'll be 20 on top and the bottom
so if we did that we would just come in
here and say look just give me 20 pixels
all the way around might be a little
generous top and bottom so let me come
around and take a look at that after we
preview it and you know I think I kind
of like it it's not too bad you'll
notice that I've got the same amount of
padding here 20 same amount of padding
here 20 and it creates a nice clean line
for us to work with that we've aligned
with and you know I don't mind having a
strip of color up at the top but I think
I'd like to do something that's very
minimalistic in this fashion so what I
may want to do instead is to remove the
background for our header and if that's
the case you'll notice there's not going
to be anything there but instead what
I'm going to do is to borrow the border
information that we had for the main and
let's go back to our header notice not
the h1 but just the header
and inside that header I'm gonna say
border-to-border bottom color and border
bottom width of one and a border bottom
style of solid now if we do that let me
save this and then preview it in our
browser you'll see that we have our
white and it's just a nice clean line
that we've got going there
perhaps just to keep things in keeping
with everything else I'm gonna borrow
the background color that I'm using here
and maybe we can use it for our
headlines not only for our header but
also for the other ones that we're
dealing with as well so let's see I'm
going to borrow the color which we're
going to be using which is the same as
this hover effect so I'm gonna copy 9 9
C and we need to add color to the header
h1 so I'll come in here and I'll say
color and I'll paste in that color that
we just copied all right we've got that
here but having done that here I also
kind of want to do it to the headlines
as well so in main that is rather so I'm
going to come in here right after main
paragraph and we'll say also main H twos
comma and H threes because there are h2s
and threes in there and what I'm going
to do is to put in color same color that
we had on the other one don't forget to
close this tank so let's see what this
looks like
once we've saved it and we can preview
this in our browser uh-huh pretty good
but you might find it a little bit light
in comparison to the rest of the
information so I think I'm just gonna
try and choose a darker purple
so let me see which one may be a good
looking color for us to use perhaps
something more along these lines alright
so I'm just gonna copy this information
H twos and threes are doing it so why
don't we also get our h1 in the header
doing it as well so save that preview it
in our browser then you can see it's a
little bit darker and may show up a
little bit nicer depending on what
you're looking for if you actually want
this to be the same background color you
can for the hover State we can do that
too we can just go down to the hover
State so li a:hover and I'll change this
to the darker one that we're now using
preview it and there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
