killer sites calm killer PHP calm and of
course studio web so have you ever
wondered how effective social media
marketing might be I have a quick
example that might shed some light on
that for you so I do have my own Twitter
account and I just use it typically to
post videos that I post a youtube and
occasional comment it's not something I
really pursue so I only have a seven
hundred odd followers and I don't really
follow anybody except my brother or some
other friend of mine that's about it but
first whatever reasons I decided to send
the famous and in some circles the
infamous Michael Moore filmmaker a tweet
about something so you can see here I'm
now recording this video on the
thirty-first of May and you can see here
my tweet is still there I tweeted him on
the twenty-sixth i'm a 26 right here you
see it got a bunch of retweets and
favorites 229 225 was not bad not great
but nonetheless so i got a prominent
position on a very popular twitter
account he has over 1.7 million
followers so that's quite a bit and so
how did this affect my traffic so let's
go to my Twitter account and let's see
if we can find it here here it is here
it is tweets a reply click through you
can see 229 retweets 255 favorites not
bad for a guy who's never tweeted to
Michael or anybody else for that matter
so after a few days you see it's a 26th
I sent us out let's look at some
statistics so Twitter gave this to me
and here we go so your week in review so
you see I got a total of sixty 1,000
point three well 61.3 k views now I
guess that's actual people are seeing
the tweet
how much attention they paid to it but
nonetheless and you see what the I'm
sadly the vast majority it was from this
one sentence i sent to michael moore
over 60,000 King from him so very habit
though I'm on a though I tweeted on a on
a Twitter account that has 1.7 million
followers he's kept it up it's in the
top three or four for over a week now
and thus far I've gotten a little over
61,000 views for that tweet so it's not
bad for one sentence of work but you can
see when you're posting your something
on Twitter five percent return and in
terms of relative to your normal
followers is I guess I mean you can
expect although this is a very rough
measure you know I'm not it I'm not the
experts in social media marketing but
it's not the most effective marketing
method I know that email marketing is
far more effective than that so just so
