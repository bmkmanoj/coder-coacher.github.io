video we're going to learn how to use
Dreamweaver cs4 s site definition tool
if you just launched Dreamweaver for the
first time and you haven't used it
before you're going to see something
similar to this although on this opening
screen here this is called a welcome
screen you won't see all these things
here all these recent items because
obviously if you're new to Dreamweaver
you haven't actually you know done any
work with it so this wouldn't be here
but all this stuff you're going to see
here these are instructional videos
they're okay you know they're okay and
you got fees here are various types of
files that you can open up these are
kind of like templates by pre structured
for you so it makes it easier for you
get going anyhow in this video as I said
we're going to look at the site
definition windows so we go up here and
we click on site and you have options
new site manage sites and whole bunch of
different things so first thing we're
going to do is look at creating a new
site so here's click on new site and you
can have the site definition window here
so first let's give it a name I'm going
to call it killer Photoshop luck on this
site actually doesn't exist yet but
we're working on it and so let's create
a local folder so we have the site name
here you can see its site definition
change from one described side to you
know in this case killer Photoshop and
local root folder this is where all your
basic web files are going to be sitting
well not just your basic website files
all your website files so if we go in
click the button there let me do that
again you click this little folder and
what you want to do is navigate to where
you want to stick all those basic files
now I'm going to jump up I'm going to
put it on my desktop or actually I did
create a folder called killer Photoshop
calm this works the same way on Mac or
PC basically want to put all your site
files inside of a folder that
it's easy to find so for the sake of
this demo I put it on the desktop of
course you know you could you may decide
that you want to put all your sites into
my documents folder that's up to you so
I'm just going to select that click open
and then click select and there you go
now we've told Dreamweaver where we're
holding our site files now get back to
the importance of that in a moment so
for now that's cool we can forget about
these type of things leave it all
default let's now click over under the
category list I want to click on remote
info now what's this all about this is
basically the place where you tell
dreamweaver where you want to upload
your files to this assumes that you have
web hosting setup the most common way is
to use FTP you could also store your
website on a local network so let's say
you're in an office and all the website
files are actually located in the
network at your office then you can
select this which for ninety-nine
percent of us man there's a few other
options of course but for ninety-nine
percent of us it's going to be ftp ftp
is short for file transfer protocol it's
just a way to move files over the
internet and if you have your hosting
setup they will be able to provide you
with all this information for ftp host
as basically your address your host
directory where you want to put your web
files login name password and again your
hosting company will be able to provide
for you the details here although most
of the time leaving these default is
going to go anyhow for this particular
video we're not going to actually set up
ftp so it's going to go to none but i
want to point that out and beyond that
well we got all a bunch of other options
here which we won't get into this video
and a lot of you may not even use many
of these options a lot of us stuff is
used in very particular situations like
version control is used
and you're working on a big project with
many bit different people so you won't
need to learn about vision control
unless you're working probably for a
larger organization and if they do use
it they'll tell you what to do so
everything's cool we're just going to go
okay and you can see in the side files
tab here now if you don't see that it
may be something that you may see
something like this so you want to click
on this little arrow here and you see
the side files tab and you know that
you've set up your site and you're ready
to add pages tube site so you're not
going to do I'm going to option click or
right click i'm going to say new file
and I'm going to write in index dot HTML
and there's our new file so let's see
dreamweaver created as for us this is a
basic web page in HTML page and we
double click on that and we're ready to
go we can add text give it through the
design view what we see here or we go
right into code you see dreamweaver
inserted all this for us which is kind
of cool
in
part 2 of this video we're going to go a
little deeper into the site definition
capabilities and going to learn a few
useful techniques that I found extremely
handy over the years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
