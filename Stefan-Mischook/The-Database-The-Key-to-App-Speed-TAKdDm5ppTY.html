thing you can look at in terms of your
codebase
to optimize your app for speed if it's
your typical web app or an app that
depends on a database I would say about
95 percent at a time the thing that's
going to slow down your app the thing
that's going to eat up all the server
resources is going to be the database
activity database connections so with
that in mind when you're looking at your
app if it relies on an SQL database
doesn't matter what it is post-grad or
MySQL or Oracle the thing you should be
looking at is optimization of your
database interaction the crud
create read update and delete operations
database operations are going to eat up
all the juice so that starts with
designing your database tables properly
so that you can have optimized queries
and then after value can get into
caching and you get into all kinds of
different things I won't get into all
the strategies but the whole point of
this vlog is just to point out for most
web apps I'm say ninety ninety-five
percent to pick a number it's very high
most of the time the performance issues
are going to be involved with database
access so you want to optimize your
database structure right from the
beginning you want to minimize the
amount of times you open connections to
your database because that takes a huge
amount of processing you want to make
sure that your result sets well depends
sometimes you want to bring in huge
result sets so you don't have to hit the
database many times you might do one big
query pull out a bunch of results and
then hold it in cache and then work with
that sometimes you want to minimize your
results set so you don't have a huge
amount of processing on the client now
this may be a little bit a little bit
more high level for beginners it's not
really meant for beginners but all you
have to take away from this vlog is time
and time again going back to the 90s and
still is the case today
the biggest hit for most web apps most
apps these days if they're
database-driven is that is the database
interaction so you if you want to work
on performance you're concerned about
performance be concerned about your
database understand good database
structure understand how to interact
with the database in an efficient manner
that's going to be by far the most
important thing you can do in terms of
speed of your app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
