killer at sites calm and other sites so
tonight I'm night video blogging here so
I'm going to answer a question that was
recently put to me let me say that again
I want to answer a question that was
recently put to me and that is as a web
designer or web programmer do you need
to be a server expert should you be able
to install mysql and apache and
configure v6 should you be a secure
shell ssh master being able to log in
and execute all kinds of Unix commands
and so on as a web programmer or web
designer and the short answer is no you
don't need to be you just need a little
bit of knowledge just enough so that you
can maneuver around the server so if for
instance you're on a unix or linux based
server and a control panel happens to be
cpanel then you should understand cpanel
should be able to log in you should be
able to do different things like set up
email counts navigate the filesystem
read web stats and so on you don't need
to be a master of Apache and all that
kind of stuff that's where the web hosts
they provide those services for you
they're the ones you should be able to
call or send in a support ticket and get
that support you can't do everything and
know everything in the tech world these
days so just just just too much you know
and you're talking to a guy hearing this
from a guy you know I've programmed apps
in eight nine languages or the over the
years you know Western a starlet you
know start with classic asp that's not
really language it uses a vbscript and
then lots of java most of my work was in
java and PHP / parole and some other
languages so though I have a pretty
eclectic background in the tech world I
still recognize that you can't know
everything so no you do not need to
to know and be an expert in servers if
you are a web programmer or web designer
you just you know you just know you need
to know your basic so you can get around
it and move around and make sure you
have a good host so that you can contact
them if you need to have something
configured or fixed or something and
that's my short nighttime video blog
