client who said can we do this in our
profiles i'm aspirator details because
the details are not important so i
looked at who that's weird you should be
able to so I looked into it and then
sure enough she wasn't able to is like
food less interesting so I said okay bug
we just released the latest version of
the app and was a tiny little bug
introduced I don't know so what I do is
I went in and I started messing around
with the database I created some fake
accounts and I just wanted to test some
of the value of see what would happen in
the UI so I started doing a bunch of
tests I said sure enough I started
finding that just one but I got two
three four bugs things were happening
why did this happen why is it working
so I started firing off emails might
lead to the help of business I'm not
actively involved in the development of
the app yeah so long story short though
what had happened is that there wasn't
actually any of these bugs what I was
doing
I was adding values to a particular
record and then checking on the live
view of the web view of the app but
referring to another record so basically
I was making changes to user blah blah
and I was checking in the live system
for user blah blah blah blah blah so I
kept added changing values in a database
and it wasn't being reflected in the web
app that I was like cousin but why is it
it's working what's going on this is
crazy this has been working for years
did we do a stupid update and I was
firing off all these emails this is not
working it is not working it is not
working and then I realized oh dude
you're updating the wrong you're
updating a record in the database so
yeah in my rush to try to figure things
out I wasn't paying attention to IDs and
I was making I made a silly mistake
all kinds of silly stuff now up video
too so that happens sometimes so
sometimes the bug is not in your code
sometimes the bugs in your brain and
there you go that happens especially
when you get detached from the code base
so that's the thing at one point if
you're a developer at one point in your
career you would have to make that
decision whether or not you want to go
into higher-level management or you want
to stay in a code and both are noble
pursuits bill to find that friends for
my age and older or still coders and as
are people who moved on for a long long
time such as myself and the thing is
though when you let go of the coding
it's kind of like the hard things kind
of letting go over an ex a girlfriend
okay it's not the best analogy but it's
letting go of that control and had
intimacy with your code with the code of
an app that you're involved with
sometimes it's hard to do it even to
this day it irks me I feel I feel
vulnerable if you will that I don't know
all the code like the back of my hand as
I did in the past in the past my old
apps even when I had people working with
me and for me I would have them do
superficial things on the outside I
would I'd be very well versed and
involved in the core of the codebase so
 excuse me stuff went down I would
just we have to go right into the code
and and fix it right away now because
I'm not aware of what's going on in
great detail it would be stupid of me to
jump into the cold because I don't know
what's going on so when you're not
positioned as an old developer I feel
kind of bound I feel a little
constrained that way and it's a decision
I had to make though and I don't regret
that decision at some point some people
you know if there's any ears of coding
and developing and you like it
at some point you may say you know what
I want to get into architecture I want
to get into
advanced aspects I want to get to the
business and the things rather be having
my hands deep into code for my entire
career and again either decision is
great it depends on your personality
type but the downside of letting go of
being active in the code is that you're
not aware what's going on and you might
do what I just did and waste half an
hour of your time doing a silly noob
mistake and updating the wrong record
and you know what I mean and seeing
seeing bugs that are not actually there
anyhow that's pretty much it I will be
