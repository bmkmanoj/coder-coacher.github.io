going to be showing you is a couple of
other adjustments and in particular
we're going to be looking at threshold
so in order to begin with if you've made
your adjustments the way I did in terms
of replacing the color in the last
episode we can just go to file revert
and that will bring us back to what the
original image looked like well in this
case I don't really care so much about
color because what I want to attempt to
work with is an adjustment that is
called threshold now let's take a look
at threshold it can be applied as a
adjustment layer so I can just come down
here and show you that adjustment layer
and here it is threshold so if I were to
click on threshold let's take a look it
gives you this sort of black and white
version and it's really picking up all
of the shadow areas in here why is this
good well first of all let's see if
you've got a little warning icon here
just click on that it's going to update
your histogram as you can see here and
what it's doing is when we slide it in
one direction it's really adding or
getting rid of the blacks remember it's
our histogram this is black area here
this is white area there you want to add
more or get rid of the blacks then you
slide it this way get rid of the lights
you can slide it this way as you can see
until we have very little whites so this
is all really useful whenever you want
to create an effect that looks similar
to the one that I happen to have right
here and this is something that you know
anytime you're going for an illustrative
look inside of your design or something
that you can add as a background element
a little bit later on
working with your blend modes or
something along those lines it's a
really wonderful way of adding those
elements and at this moment in time
we've just I've just shown you a little
bit about how to convert this but later
on in some future exercises I'll be
showing you how we can apply a very nice
threshold effect to something we can
also you know select the area in black
we can make a stamp out of this we can
convert that into an illustration
actually if you're working with
illustrator and you can produce you know
t-shirts you have your Che Guevara
t-shirt or something along those lines
and this is a really wonderful way that
you can pick out those highlights and
work with things like drawings and
brushing with paints and stuff like that
so it's really a useful application of
an image adjustment and it can be a very
permanent one that you apply down here
through your threshold or even a
temporary one using a simple adjustment
layer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
