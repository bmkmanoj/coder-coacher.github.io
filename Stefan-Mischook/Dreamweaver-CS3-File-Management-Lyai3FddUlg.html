little break from page layout and CSS
cuz it's a lot to take in and I want to
show you a couple quick little features
in terms of file management but
Dreamweaver provides that will make your
life a lot easier as a web designer it
says seemingly simple looking capability
but it's very useful so let's try
something that's pop open our index page
or index dot HTML double click right and
we know is that here under Adobe look
text we have a link right which says
right here link and it links to page two
dot HTML do we have page two you don't
even have a page two
Wow let's relink that to page - - so we
go like this
oh yeah that's a new one I didn't show
you guys the CSEC dream you see these
little wheels here at little wheels and
they appear in different parts of
Dreamweaver and the little wheels allows
you to easily link documents that's
pretty cool so I click and I hold
without having to you know okay I could
select from my list of documents here as
opposed but select and hold I see I drag
my little wheel it takes me to page two
so this is a hyperlink there's a link so
I'm linking I see page two dot HTML I'll
say that let's preview which I click
that takes us to our Glee page view
beautiful so let's go back to
Dreamweaver now this is what I want to
show you actually so I showed you a
little clicky wheel which kind of cool
and what I'm going to show you is a file
management capabilities let's say let me
shift this let's say you decided that
you needed to rename page two to a
better name like you know product list
and you know that you have index link to
page two now typically without
Dreamweaver if you change page two the
product list you would have to remember
to go into your index page and to change
the link to point to the new page name
right so put a little product - list now
watch what dream weaver does for us
since we do it here this Connect will
say okay
so Dreamweaver pops up in this box
update files so it says update links and
the following files now what is this
Dreamweaver is keeps track of what pages
are linked into what so if I change a
file name and it's and people may be
linking to that file versus versa then
Dreamweaver will say it'll scan and say
wait we gotta we gotta update links here
so it's basically asking us update links
in the following files so yeah we want
to update that in that link in the index
dot HTML page so we go update so
Dreamweaver automatically updates that
link in our index dot HTML page so I'm
gonna double click and look just approve
you see product list our HTML now this
is may not seem like a big deal now
since we only have you know a couple
pages but it just imagined but you had a
page that was you know that had 20 other
pages linking to and you might forget
this is a great tool because we'll help
keep everything linked and up-to-date
and so this is just one of the many file
management capabilities that are built
into Dreamweaver cs3 that makes your
life as a web designer that much easier
another thing I want to cover in dreamer
it's not really specific to design some
of the stuff down here now Dreamweaver
has a magnification capability so you
want to zoom into a page and check out
your layout and really close this is the
idea if you have some really complex
layouts you may want to do this maybe
you want to zoom out you want to see
what the page looks like from a distance
it's kind of cool you know it's just one
of the many capabilities now if you had
Sailaja move it up and down so let's say
we've got 800 this allows you to move it
up and down and move the page just like
you would move a document and let's say
Photoshop or something so it's kind of
useful right and you get the zoom tool
so we go here double click it and it
brings it back to its real size so let's
set this back to a hundred percent and
let's select a point or two here I want
to look at this down here 15 K 3 seconds
now what this is it tells you how fast
the page will load 3 seconds and how
many K 2 pages right now the page is
with you all the images and the text
it's only 15 killer K which is 15
kilobytes now 3 seconds has to deal with
the speed of the person's internet
connection which you can set in
Dreamweaver so let's do that now so we
going to you're going to edit
preferences or control you you saw like
you know remember is cool we see all the
hotkeys preferences control you so what
you want to do when you get your
Preferences window open is you want to
go into a status bar this is the status
bar right here right and we got default
window size so you can sort of set your
default size so let's say you're laying
out pages for web TV then you could say
okay let's go with that one we're gonna
select you know we'll select web TV and
that will be that but that's not why
we're here we want to look at
connections B so whenever we're looking
at 15 K would take three seconds that's
what
56 killed by mode 'm and a lot of people
still have this surprisingly you know so
and these are like 14 4 i remember back
in the day 14 wow
so most time people are up here or here
so if you look at 1500 okay
you see 15k also the only lows and 1
second big difference we go edit
preferences let's say we say it's a 14-4
mode which is like an old jalopy modem
also in 15k is 8 seconds yeah I remember
the day back in 1993 94 94 and 14400 was
considered fast so you had to make your
pages really skimpy so let's let's go
back I usually leave it for now at 56k
although you're gonna have to determine
to pay on the type of site you have what
you want to set this to so what does
that mean well like on killer sites calm
and killer PHP calm we have a lot of
videos we assume that people are coming
to site to learn web design and flash
programming and programming so we assume
that they got fairly modern computers
modern internet connections and you know
videos are huge right you know there are
many makes a piece so I'm you know I'm
not so concerned about a 56k connection
speed because that's not the type of
site I have on the other hand if perhaps
I was a site that you know dog-grooming
site again you may get a lot of people
older people retirees who may have
slower internet connections and you may
want to make sure that your your pages
are fairly zippy so when these guys come
around rule of thumb basically is I
would just go target a connection speed
56k and as long as you two pages can law
within 10-15 seconds you're pretty cool
so let's go okay with that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
