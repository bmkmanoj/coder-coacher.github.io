sights calm so in this V block I'm gonna
answer a question that's been put to me
on many occasions and I've answered it
before but I figure I should do
something for 2016 well over in July
2016
happy fourth of July for American
viewers out there so what are we gonna
do we're going to talk about how to get
paid if you are a freelancer this is a
very important subject because of course
we are coders we are developers and
because we like it but because we want
to make a living we want to get paid so
if you are a freelancer how do you get
paid what comes down I'll get to the
point number one my highly recommended
method of setting up payment with the
client is I call it the 33 split so what
does that mean when you first start the
project you should get 33 percent of the
total upfront when you deliver the first
draft the prototype of the project will
be a website a web app or an app again
another 33% from the client so now you
have 66 percent of the money now and
then when you finally finish the project
you get that last 33% so why do I do it
a 33 33 versus 50/50 a lot of people say
50 percent upfront 50 on completion I
don't like that so much I prefer to 33
33 33 and that's because what you're
going to find as a freelance developer
is that when you go from the delivery of
the first draft to the final product you
know that last segment that lasts
stretch to the finish is going to be the
longest most drawn out part of the
project where you are you are likely
going to be waiting around for your
client to deliver text images to give
you feedback what not depending on the
type of project this happens all the
time
so if you do a project where you you're
doing 50 50
and you know you're waiting for that
last 10% of the work to be done because
you're waiting for your client again to
give you the feedback or the text that
you need so you're out of your be at a
stage we've done 75 80 percent 90
percent of the work but you only you've
only gotten half of your money and how's
my phone just telling me um lower power
consumption anyway so that's why I don't
do it 50/50 because this happens all the
time you're gonna you're gonna do a
project your client is gonna be waiting
around you know it's going to be not
when your I was gonna make you wait
around while you're waiting to deliver
that last bit and depending on what he
gives to you or he or she brings to you
so again that last bit of tax that last
bit of input so but if you're on the
other hand if you have if you do 233
split where you have at this point 66
percent of money I was seventy percent
of money at least you have 70 percent of
money so so if they drag it out you're
not worried about getting that second
half in fact that put some more pressure
on them because they've already paid out
nearly seventy percent of the project so
that's my number one tip if it's not
already obvious when you're doing any
type of service work whether you're web
designer or developer a graphic designer
whatnot make sure you get some sort of
payment upfront before you start doing
any major work they're gonna try to
convince you otherwise but never accept
that because you got to remember when
you're doing services you can't get it
back so if you saw sell somebody a car
or a piece of furniture if they don't
pay you can go seize the car you can see
as a furniture you can go get it but if
you've done have to work or
three-quarters of the work or all the
work you can't get it back because it's
about time right it's check you're not
gonna be able to take the website or the
web app that you produce for the the
grocer down the street or the butcher
down the street and so somebody else you
can know you're not gonna be able to for
the most part so you got to make sure
that you do get money upfront when
you're dealing with clients as a
freelancer another thing you should
consider is when you do get money
upfront especially when you do 233 split
you will get more respect from your
client that is for sure if they are not
putting out any money and you're doing
all this work trust me they're gonna be
not treating you as well so there you go
that's how you should be collecting from
clients remember remember when you start
off a contract when you first sit down
with the clients at these are the terms
of the payment it's 33 split and you
explain them we don't tell him why at
the end but you say listen you say I
want 33 up four percent up front so you
know if I can be half when I delivered a
first draft which means maybe a rough
layout of a website or a rough mock-up
working version of the app before you
present - you walk in with that first
draft they have to have the check ready
for that second 33% and this is a way
you sell it to them you say you don't
have to put up half but you get to give
me 33% when I walk in with the first
draft might be two weeks later a month
later or whatever then you see that I've
done work you give me another 33% and
then when I've bringing you the final I
give you 33% and I'll leave with this
what you're gonna find is that a lot of
clients will drag but on that last 33%
where you're waiting for the feedback or
the images is what not don't be caught
up in this and that and the other thing
who knows but happens all the time so
what this means you have to always plan
when you get past the first draft to
start planning for more clients that
come on board if you have free time you
should start working on new clients and
start scheduling ahead and what you'll
find is you probably have at one point
several clients projects going at the
same time once you get established where
you're gonna be waiting on three or four
clients to bring you that last that last
you know a little bit that you need to
complete their work so you want to keep
the cash flowing so you got to make sure
you always got to get new clients coming
in the final thing about that is you're
gonna get heat you know they may
disappear for a month and then come with
that last bit and expect you to finish
in two days so you know I waited a month
I have other clients I'll schedule you
in and you just explain to them when
that happened
when that happens so these are common
occurrences has happened to me going
back into the 90s and throughout my
freelancing career and it's happened to
many many students of mine who have gone
on to become independent web designers
and web developers and if this of course
applies to just about any trade outside
of Technology inside technology when it
comes to any services this is what you
have to expect so that's it for today I
hope you find this useful and yep that's
it ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
