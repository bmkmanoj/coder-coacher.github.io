you a little bit about applying SSL's to
your websites without having to buy it
an SSL certificate and a few other
little things related to that so first
of all I'm not a killer sighs calm and
you can see here I'm using Chrome that
the site is secure nice green padlock
HTTPS ss4 secure secure connection
information bubble is secure that's all
cool now if I go to another site killer
video Starcom now you see it to HTTPS as
well as for secure but it's not green
right if you click on that it says your
connection to the site is not fully
secure so what does that mean that means
that even though the site is loaded over
a secure connection and you know that
because of the HTTPS here some parts of
the site could be scripts that you link
to could be a CSS file that you link to
could be images could be video whatever
is not secure so how do you figure that
out there's a couple options one option
is you can go to a site like this one
here
why not padlock and you just put in you
our URL right here you say check so here
you go and it's identified all those 56
items that was loaded in this page total
56 so yes this page loaded up fifty six
items and I said insecure URL can secure
URL so yeah the share this link is
insecure
it's linking to a je s button on the
site so I have to update this to HTTPS
and this has to be WS by the way and
here in secure URL I have a link to
bloggers to do up calm without HTTPS and
it's linking to an image so there's an
image in that page and there is a
insecure URL to link to a JS file that's
making this page not 100% secure only
partly secure another way you can check
that is just right-click it
inspect and you're going to have this
the browser tools here and you look here
three errors one morning so you click on
the errors and it says right here mix
content the page at killer via SOCOM
HTTP SME secure was loaded over HTTP
hypertext Transfer Protocol secure but
requested an insecure image blah blah
blah see here right here so what do I
have to do I have to go and change the
URL on this page and make sure it's HTTP
HTTPS of course blog that's to get web
has to be secure itself now if I click
on that tells me what image is trying to
load but insecure so the frog image here
so we scroll down this guy right here
insecure so I would have to go in there
in a code change this to HTTPS assuming
that blog that's 2d web is secure how do
we check that
let's just go to blog and right now your
connection to say is not secure who know
but if we go back to a practice in HTTP
s colon slash slash boom loading your
connection say is not fully secure same
type of thing so you go right click
inspect see here two errors tells me
it's just these things here it's a few
images JPEG or PNG and the PNG chrome
said is is a warning that's terrible but
here the shared is the share best thing
again is causing problems again this is
a script of J s Genesis real for
JavaScript that's sets up social media
sharing button so I'm going to have to
update this when these sites were set up
they weren't set up under HTTP they were
set up just unsecured but these days
Google and the search engine Google they
want everything to be HTTPS that's more
secure so you're going to have to secure
everything to make sure all the
resources that are connecting to web
page as file CSS files images etcetera
they all have to be under secure URL and
you have to indicate in the code
it's HTTP not HTTP HTTP has to be HTTP
and there you go now how do you get the
free certificate but for me certificate
you can buy a SSL and the price is 20 or
20 year 25 year depending or you can use
something called let's encrypt so here
I've loaded up the control panel for a
killer video store no killer sites if
you scroll down you see let's encrypt
now this is free SSL and you see I
already installed it on the killer site
so I just want to show you that you can
do that now what's their swing to free
let's encrypt SSL versus the paid ones
some people say to pay once or more
secure I don't necessarily buy that but
I do have both paid and unpaid SSL's
so again if I click here we know we are
secure anyway I hope that helps now you
know how to find unsecured items on your
webpage or in your webpages using either
the browser dev tools which probably the
easiest again right-click inspect the
errors and warnings will be loaded up
right here and then you can go in there
and update things as you need to or you
can use a site like rhino padlock and it
will give you a maybe a slightly
user-friendly version although I think
just using the browser dev tools
probably best that's it oh by the way I
took down the video on business book not
because I got flagged because there was
killer in the title but because I have
enough people to help me beta test this
thing so thanks very much bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
