over the assets panel to give you an
idea of what this is all about and how
you can use it in your own Dreamweaver
work
you can finally ask this panel of course
inside the files panel group which by
default you should have here on the left
hand side and what you want to do is you
want to click the assets tab here now
the assets tab gives you a summary of
all the assets all the components of
your websites so for instance here we're
looking at images then you have all the
colors that we've used in the website so
this is basically a list of all the
colors but I've used inside of killer
sites calm quite a few actually it gives
me all the links so if I expand this a
little bit you see all the links here
that are contained within killer sites
calm again quite a few we also look at
any flash objects that are floating
around inside this site any shockwave
stuff no shockwave is sort of like flash
movies except they're made with
Macromedia director so you're not going
to see this too often because director
well Adobe director now because director
is not really used too much these days
any movies again no movies any scripts
that we see we got a bunch of J's files
J's files by the way our files are
contained scripts things like JavaScript
any templates any library items now
we'll get into templates and library
items later on but these are components
that you can insert into your web page
but Dreamweaver uses to make a web page
is easier to manage so let's go back to
our row icon here the images and we can
see the images panel gives us a bunch
information about the image we got the
dimensions the size and kilobytes the
type of image that it is so we have
gifts it's like here we've got P P and
G's and JPEGs as well so by clicking
these buttons at the top you can reset
the order so I click type resets the
order in terms of the type of image so
now we have P and G's first followed by
JPEGs the gifts and I click it again
then we start with gifts and so on and
say what dimensions we can start with
the smallest image is 13 by 13 and
slowly grow to the larger images or we
can flip it back when we select an image
we see what it looks like here in a
preview and we can increase the size for
preview as well so this is a good way to
scan for your site see what images
you're using and then from there you can
actually check to see where exactly
these images are in your websites this
is under full path of course so this
could be a good way to scan for your
site or you could just drag and drop
images onto your web page if you haven't
have a web page here
if I'll finish up having to taste the
administration's in here of the assets
tab here what I would review is page
inside of my Dreamweaver subdirectory
inside of killer sites calm so I do that
by right-clicking selecting new file or
Apple clicking with fee on the Macintosh
of course and and I'm just gonna put in
test not HTML because I'm just going to
use this a test or so to launch it and
our editor here I just double click it
and we could see in the editor we have
our test page so what I want to do now
is I want to drag a particular image
found inside of our assets panel this
particular Dreamweaver images is what I
drag it onto our web page so I have to
do here instead of digging for it
digging for that image using the images
button here I would have to start
digging and looking around for which
could be pretty difficult in a larger
site all I have to do this find the
image here that is dragging it like so
and Dreamweaver will drop the image in
place for me finding it for me so we'll
get into adding images later but we'll
just leave everything blank for now I
just hit OK and here's our image so
Dreamweaver assets panel allows you to
find various assets in your site whether
it be colors images links flash movies
scripts and so on it allows you to find
these things very easily so that you can
easily insert them and organize them in
your site so this for example I was able
to find this particular image and bring
it into a web page without having to dig
for it through the usual means of adding
an image which in this case would be
using the images select the image source
button here
another thing we can do is use the link
assets and I selected it here and I
selected the killer site.com slash site
map JSP link and what we can do with the
links asset subsection is actually drag
and drop links onto our main page so
let's say I have an image and I want to
create a link out of his image all I
have to do instead of having to type it
all out as you normally would in the
properties inspector down here where you
would select it and you would put in
your link information all you have to do
is go here into my link assets grab the
link and just drag it over on top of my
image and if you look down here you can
see that we dragged it's actually excuse
me attached this link to its image
automatically again so we don't have to
type in anything the same thing can be
done with text
so I will select these text links over
here and I can just drag and drop it
once again onto my text
and then my text gets linked without
having to type in my link information in
here this is just a quick look at some
of the useful functionalities found in
the assets panel in Dreamweaver cs3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
