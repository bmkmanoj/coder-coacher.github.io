with is this area in the middle right
here that area does not make up 1024
1024 as I said it's the top of your
computer screen down at the bottom of
your computer screen or at least what my
computer screen happens to be set to
here and the vast majority of people are
as we mentioned following at least this
screen or a higher screen resolution so
in order to make your website work
really well if I was to create a layout
of 1024 by 768 then we would see that if
my browser was set to fullscreen there
would still be a lot of real estate
that's taken up by the browser itself
probably giving me a horizontal
scrollbar which I don't really want now
a vertical scrollbar is not really the
end of the world a lot of people have
come to expect that but I want to
address that in just a second if you
want to play it safe the best way to
work within this environment is to
choose a width and a height of 955 by
600 now let's also address that issue
there's gonna be some math that we're
gonna have to do sorry if you don't like
math but you do have to spend some time
preparing especially in a fixed pixel
based design a little bit of how your
layout is going to work inside the
browser so there's a little math
involved if you want to have the easiest
way of working with that we can round
off our 955 to a nice even 900 that'll
be easy for us to sort of divide into
different sections and work out
mathematically the height of 600 on the
other hand is something that also
contends with all of that extra real
estate that's taken up by the browser as
we mentioned earlier so what does this
mean for us well I mentioned that height
of 600 is also important for a number of
different reasons number one as I
mentioned vertical scroll bars are not
really unusual in the web world and
everybody comes to expect them to a
certain degree however one important
thing about this height of 600 is in the
design field we often refer to these
areas as above the fold or below the
fold well in print it's easy to think
about this think about like a newspaper
and how newspapers fold it in half
usually when you pick it up
well everything above the fold or at the
top of the newspaper is generally seen
as the most important information it's
also the most highly visible information
that's where you'll have to pay the most
for advertising and there's a reason
behind that because it's got the most
visibility same thing can be applied to
this the principle on a web based
environment everything above a height of
600 is referred to as above the fold
because of this we can recognize that
the vast majority of people are going to
be looking at that area more so than
anything below the fold now that doesn't
mean any person is not going to look
below the fold of course the information
is there it's always going to be there
however the most important elements of
your website should always be above the
height of 600 or rather above the fold
it's really important as sort of address
this because it's the highest area of
visibility most people are going to look
at that area before moving on to another
website
not everybody's necessarily going to
read everything below that area most
will but the attention span of most
people will sort of Peter off with
anything below the height of 600 so
address that issue as well and that's
something that's important here too so
not only is that 600 sort of addressing
the extra real estate that's inside of
the browser that we can't use for our
design but it also addresses some
important information in terms of
visibility from your audience also
remember something else SEO search
engine optimization tells us that search
engine spiders as they crawl the web and
as they crawl down different web sites
will generally only have a finite amount
of information that they can ingest and
usually what is happening is they ingest
the information that is above the fold
now that's not
to say that they won't grab anything
that's below the height of 600 possible
but the higher your height value is the
less information that search engine
spiders will actually attract so if you
have something that's ridiculously high
and a lot of scrolling on your website
that might actually affect your SEO
adversely so it's something that you
also should be aware of not only for the
attention span of your audience but also
for search engine optimization so what
I've done here is in Photoshop chosen a
heightened width of 900 by 600 and
that's what we're going to be starting
with at this point now we're also going
to have to address a couple of other
things in other words where we're going
to set up our rulers and guides and also
a little bit of information about color
schemes and how we can work with color
not only inside a Photoshop but in any
application that you want to be working
with even if it's just straightforward
HTML so we'll discuss a little bit more
about color in just a second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
