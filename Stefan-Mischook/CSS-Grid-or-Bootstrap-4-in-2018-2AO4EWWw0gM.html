developers how they can choose which
technologies to learn and when to learn
them so what you can see in your career
as a developer you're gonna see the
emergence and the dying of many
technologies you're going to see new
technologies come on and people who are
behind these technologies will tell you
it is the most important thing ever you
have to learn it right and then their
competitor will say the same thing and
you're going oh my god oh my gosh so
you're going stackoverflow and you're
like you've got all these different
opinions it says what do you do what do
you choose
whether you're a front-end developer
full stack web Python PHP whatever
you're gonna see this you're gonna see
technologies evolve technologies come
technologies go and if you try to learn
every single thing you try to follow up
on every single thing you're never
you're never gonna be able to get any
work done that's why the strategy what
I've learned over the last 20 years away
it works best for you as a professional
is to learn your core to learn your
basics on full stack that's its html5
6:03 JavaScript and then you learn your
server-side language now I have a cave
for PHP for a whole bunch of reasons so
I won't get into now but whatever your
server-side language is and you learn
that and then you start building little
mini apps just those little mini apps
you see so you put it all together now a
good course will provide that for you so
from there what do you do so in the web
stack let's use that as an example now
because CSS was originally designed in a
less an optimal way shall we say it was
actually designed for a page layout as
opposed to musk use me it was designed
for styling documents rather than for
user interface design now a think about
documents like a page right so you have
headline tags and you put some images
and stuff but how about creating a grid
UI user interface right weren't two
columns stuff now you can do it with
traditional CSS but it's not intuitive
to say the least now a good course a
good course Oh teach you how to do it
there's just three things you got to pay
attention
- it's really easy in fact once you
understand that but whatever it is not
intuitive to say the least so as a
result of that some developers came out
with libraries frameworks bootstrap is
the most popular for CSS and they have a
bootstrap grid system where you it's a
bunch of code but CSS code is a bunch of
JavaScript code jQuery and it it
basically allows you to layout pages
without having to understand the inner
workings of the browser so much and it
just saved you a lot of time and
headaches and it's super popular became
super popular
so bootstrap for just came out three is
still widely used for came out and it's
cool but again if you're taught properly
how to use core CSS even some of the
older school stuff it's easy you can get
it done pretty quickly but it's not
super intuitive now in the last year so
something core to CSS has come out so
they're called CSS grids and CSS flexbox
and it makes it really easy for you to
create user interfaces with CSS without
having to use a bootstrap so you're
faced with a decision as a developer or
a budding developer or experienced
developer do you learn the new bootstrap
for do you stick to bootstrap 3 or do
you go into CSS grid CSS flexbox number
one lesson always stick to core
technology over third-party libraries
bootstrap third-party library CSS grid
flex box core tech it's now widely
supported although it may not work in
older browsers flow won't work in older
browsers so when do you use CSS grid you
use it when you are working on a job
where you don't have to be dependent on
the older browser so would you do if
you're going to see establish client it
got web traffic check their stats you
see if they're using browsers that can
read CSS great or not you may not need
to use it by the way if your old
techniques work why use it you
you have to decide when you want to use
things don't use a technology just
because it's out there that's a silly
thing to do especially the cutting-edge
stuff because it's gonna be problems
that people have not discovered yet and
why should you be the one trying to
solve all these problems and headaches
you just want to get the jobs out so
anyway before you decide which
technology going to use on the browser
and you have to look at what technology
what web browsers are visiting that
person sites if it's brand-new site you
have to look at the business model if
they're dealing with an older baby boo
boo crowd you might figure it and
they're gonna be using older browsers
you know older people my grandfather's
web browser you know my grandfather's
doesn't like update way he passed away
but my you know my father not necessary
will want to update his web browser as
much as a young hipster but if your
token website would be frequented by
technology or where people then you know
they're gonna using the cutting-edge so
you know you can use the latest stuff
you get the idea so you have to look at
all these factors when you're choosing a
technology you notice I'm not saying you
should use CSS Greek because it's better
because XY new reasons or a bootstrap
because XY new reasons I'm talking about
business considerations that's very
important sorry for the lighting changed
Suns going around you know this is a
vlog so it's not the production value is
not as high as it would be otherwise any
help so when you're choosing a tech you
have to look at the big picture not just
the technology itself you have to look
at what the job demands right and that's
a lot about being a web professional is
being able to bring that knowledge sit
down and say okay what are we doing here
right and to make to make the choices
accordingly when it comes back to
choosing which technologies to learn you
want to favor core technologies like CSS
grid over bootstrap for as an example
let me give you a historical example of
how core technologies always beat their
party technologies now once upon a time
flash you may have heard of it flash was
super popular especially for video
embeds and so forth and for all kinds of
reasons I got into it was killed off
Steve Jobs did a good job at doing that
too
it was killed off in favor of html5 why
because html5 is non-proprietary
it was core to the browser so bye-bye
flash and I gave you all kinds of other
examples as well so favorite core versus
third party all the time if the core
technologies can handle it and look when
html5 first hit the scene a lot of flash
people are saying html5 can't do nearly
what you could do with flash and that
was true at the time didn't matter
because core wins in the hand so keep
that in mind when you're making your
choices so the next thing you have to
consider is when do you learn a new
technology oh when when well let me tell
you if you try to learn the new
technologies whenever they come out
you'll never have time to make any money
or any code so this is how it works 20
years experience has taught me this you
learn your core you learn it well so if
you're doing a web stack you learn html5
cs3 learning JavaScript units then a
request response model etc Tech Center
then you pick a server-side language if
you to do full statical I recommend PHP
because it's the most popular web
development language in the world I'm
not saying it's technically the best I
believe of all the modern technologies
and web stacks and server-side
programming they all have their pros and
cons are all very capable are all very
capable I just prefer PHP because it's
used a lot in freelance it's used in
WordPress it's easy to get started with
it it's a very capable and the PHP
community is huge PHP is now going PHP
is not going anywhere because it's so
huge when a technology reaches to a
certain level in terms of how much it's
used it just it just doesn't go away PHP
has reached that level let me give you
example of a competing technology to PHP
which though had its heyday was soon as
I got a lot of buzz was very popular it
has now faded into obscurity as I
predicted way back in 2006 2007 and
that's Ruby Ruby on Rails now will be a
Ruby on Rails if you're - Mary is a web
framework and Ruby's a language very
cool language very cool framework
in terms of minor depreciation of Ruby
and Ruby on Rails I get top marks
but I knew even back then and I blogged
about and took a lot of heat I wrote an
article and I think I said said Ruby on
Rails is why Ruby on Rails is flying off
the rails and something like that and I
got a lot of hate and that's pretty
pretty fun but I turned out to be
correct and the reason I knew that Ruby
was going to fade into nish not because
I said the technology's inferior is
because two things a because I felt that
the advantage that Ruby and rails
brought to the game would be
reproducible by the other languages out
there and sure enough it came out PHP
has laravel as an example and Python is
Django and there's pros and cons against
all again to all these frameworks but
you know you're you can be equally as
productive in each of these frameworks
so the big advantage there was no big
advantage for Ruby and or disadvantages
the core Ruby language ran runs very
very slow compared to PHP and Ruby is
too specialized you know if you're doing
Ruby you could do it for server
automation and stuff like that but at
the end of the day most people who do
Ruby they do it for web app creation the
problem is the vast majority about web
apps 85% are created in PHP why PHP is
either look easy to learn easy to get
startup setup with and there's a such a
huge amount of small businesses that
rely on PHP it's not going anywhere
so in terms of other use cases where you
might want a scripting language and cool
language you got Python Python she's the
whole replace old Ruby I knew was going
to be squeezed out by PHP a1n and by
Python on the other end and I knew that
dotnet c-sharp dotnet and Java was going
to just crush it from the top for the
enterprise so fair enough years later
here we go
Ruby has faded again it wasn't a so much
a technical decision
why decided not to invest in Ruby Ruby
rails it was because of business I and
stood the business I understand the
trends of things so with that example in
mind I think that after you learn your
basic web stack what I jump into
bootstrap for know on the peripheral
maybe it'd be cool to learn a little bit
of it just a grid system this understand
what it can bring but at the end of the
day once you know your basics you have
to pick and choose what you're going to
learn next and what may should decide
what the learn next is the jobs that you
do I always say learn on a need-to-know
basis that's the key to all this stuff
need to nerd basis you learn your basics
you learn a responsive site design with
my course or whatever the course that
you choose to do and then if you're
looking for a job
go look see what they want you to know
if they want you to know bootstrap form
then you go learn bootstrap for you pick
you pick up the grid system and like you
know a couple days you know no big deal
you do a YouTube video by buying or
whatever you do a course and you're done
it's not that hard
why don't you know your basics well
that's the key learning your basics well
you may find but they don't use
bootstrap they may you say well we want
to know bootstrap 3 and we use a little
boost rap for but boo chefs 3 more so
you gotta learn bootstrap 3 or you may
see another place say now we're into CSS
grid and CSS flexbox and we do that not
so much bootstrap you get the idea but
if you're trying to learn everything you
won't have time to do anything so as a
developer you're gonna learn on the job
learn on a need-to-know basis that's why
it's so important that you learn your
fundamentals well because once you know
your fundamentals all these things are
easy and other experienced developers
will tell you that I check out my C++
video where I got over 300,000 views as
some explain C++ coders with 30 years
experience they concurred with me he
said yeah you can't learn everything you
learn what you need at the time that's
your job as a developer by the way it's
not expected you know everything they'll
put it on the read to put it on the you
know job descriptions HR department so
she's large firm but the reality of the
matter is you just gonna you just you
just go in there and you go ok I'm going
to learn this I'm learned and that's
what I would do my career
now as a freelancer you just need to
know your basics you gotta get your good
site up you got to be able to put up
some basic apps and then you just start
building from there and then again I
would walk into a job and I would say
okay what are we doing here okay boom
boom boom we're doing this all right
we're gonna use bootstrap 302 use this
we use that depending on the needs of
the particular job so number one lesson
to take away I'm gonna wrap this up
because I gotta get packing number one
you should stick the core tech over
third-party libraries when you have to
make that choice number two you learn on
an e2 nerd basis so don't try to learn
everything right away and I'm sure you
concentrated on your core the
continental core technologies and then
you poke in poke around and see what's
out there so you're aware the where CSS
grid you're aware of bootstrap four
you're aware of basically what's going
on there and where you might want to use
one or the other
etc etc etc etc and that's how the
careers actually go in the real world
that's you know don't let the pundits
don't let the people who are backing
bootstrap fool you into thinking you
have to learn bootstrap you might have
to learn bootstrap at some point but
again if you know your basics you ready
to go so I do have like a basic
bootstrap intros for an older bootstrap
in the course in the course package but
at the end of the day like I said you
know your basics with me then you can
you know there's all kinds of YouTube
videos out there you could learn and
make down 20 minutes or it's not
necessarily something you're going to
use right imagine I put out a course
where I I tried to cover every single
library every single framework you would
being be learning for what five years
it's impossible so my job as a teacher
is to filter right I have to filter out
the unnecessary stuff and to give you
the tools to help you evaluate and
understand the markets like I just
taught you favorite core technology
we're gonna need to nerd basis
concentrate on your basics that is going
to push you forward in your developer
career much more quickly than trying to
learn the latest in greenus framework
all the
time I hope that make sense bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
