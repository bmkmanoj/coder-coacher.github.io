to somebody who sent me to a article
about android and whether or not google
will have to trash android because of
the problems that android has i'm not
going to go into all the details but i
think the major issue is the lack of
consistency between the android handsets
the hardware so as such when you see a
new version of android is released it
takes a long time before the android
universe all the different android
phones update to the latest version of
Android and I guess there's a bunch of
problems with I suppose with security
and feature sets and so on so on and yes
it's very different from iOS where it's
all basically controlled by Apple so you
have you know just a couple phones you
have to deal with so that makes it much
easier to manage the operating system in
this case iOS versus Android and of
course is also much easier as an app
developer to develop for iOS since you
don't have to develop for 50,000 phones
out there well the solution is as was
pointed out in the article i think is
for vendors of android apps to only
target particular version android maybe
particular devices fortunately for
vendors you see it's i think it's
probably nexus in samsung or taking the
lion's share of things so anyway back to
the original question will android get
killed well will google have to destroy
Android because of some inherent
weaknesses in the operating system the
guy in this article cited the fact that
it was based on linux there's legal
issues and there's colonel issues the
colonel is like the core of the
operating system so what's my take on
this whole thing i don't want to go down
all the details but let me give you some
general comments doubt this is based on
somebody here i've i've never done
android development of a dental I'm Java
development in the day and Android it is
done with Java not that that's too
relevant but anyway whatever generally
speaking it's a bad idea to rewrite
software from scratch mature software
older software tends to be tends to have
less bugs and is more stable because of
you know refinements and refinements and
refinements now with Android not knowing
all the details my guess is is that
you're just going to have to as Google
say listen when you're building your
phones let's let's start limiting some
of our hardware choices to XY and said
let's conform a little bit to certain
parameters maybe not as closely as
iphone but perhaps too to a certain
degree so that the operating system can
better manage the situation that being
said I don't know if there's a huge
problem of Android because yeah I'm sure
I heard the code base is pretty messy
inside I don't know what iOS is all
about but and I know it's difficult to
code for Android because there's all
these different devices and that is not
necessarily a function of a core of the
operating system that could be resolved
using something called a facade it's the
design pattern and software development
and facade is basically a very clear of
code that sits on top of another layer
of code so perhaps in later versions of
Android Google could just create facades
targeting maybe three or four tranches
of devices three or four categories of
devices and then the hardware
manufacturers could build accordingly
that might be a solution there again
getting back to the original point I was
going to make i've been using stock
Android for a few years now I love it
very stable works fantastic I heard of
the Samsung variation of
their Android with difficulty there
TouchWiz i think it is there they are
but they built on top of Android is very
fast I was just looking at the s7 from
Samsung works great seems to look good
to me very fast responsive and you know
so I'm not sure in terms of using the
devices I see huge difference between
iOS and Android in terms of
functionality and stability and so forth
i don't know but i've had my android for
years it's fantastic so i guess that
comes back to who's getting the later
version you know is it such a huge issue
that certain phones don't update to the
latest version of Android I don't know
if that's a huge issue to be honest with
you look at all the people are still
running Windows 7 heck there's a lot of
people are running 10 12 whatever how
many years old XP is now now that I
would advise to do that but that's my
take on it my general take take away is
that this author is I'm not convinced of
its arguments because in my experience
to be write an app from scratches it's
just begging for a huge amount of work
usually when you rewrite it out from
scratch you're exchanging an old set of
bugs or a new set of bugs and it's a
very rare thing that you see a company
decide to scrap a code base and move on
and you only do that when the real core
is so bad that it can't really adapt the
biggest example I can think of as mac OS
when Mac OS went from version 9 to 10 it
was a total rewrite and had to be done
because the core of Mac OS was so
ancient and so hobbled that it just
there is no way around it right there's
no way around in terms
multitasking and memory management so
forth so they had to they had to move on
from that but if you look at windows
which is a more modern windows 95 well
Windows NT is the basis of Windows 10 as
far as I understand and that's a very
old operating system and because it was
built with more modern architecture I
don't see a need to update the core
windows for a long time they just have
to fix things and I think that that's
what you're going to see what Android I
don't think it's too bad so bad rather
that they'll need to totally trash it I
just don't see that happening and that
and one of the reasons they don't see
that happening again I have android
phones a lot of people have android
phones they work great even if you don't
get the latest version of Android for
eight months a year or whatever who
cares it works great and as far as app
developers concern I would just be
targeting later phones for the most part
depending on the type of app that you're
right but if you're reading a specific
business app businesses are not going to
have their people on five year old
phones if they do or three year old
phones or four to three or four year old
phones if they do they're probably not
going to buy your app because they don't
want to spend any money to begin with so
I would just be calling against the
flagship devices you know the top
samsung the top Google devices and I
would just coat accordingly another
thing you could do is write your Android
apps in you know html5 use html5 stack
and use a translation matrix like
Cordova our phonegap that might be a way
to handle it let them deal with the
issues again I'm jumping around here so
yeah I don't see Android being rewritten
from scratch I don't think that's gonna
happen that's it what talk to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
