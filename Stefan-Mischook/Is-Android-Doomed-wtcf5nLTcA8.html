to somebody who sent me to a article
about Android and whether or not Google
will have to trash Android because of
the problems that Android has I'm not
going to go into all the details but I
think the major issue is the lack of
consistency between the Android handsets
the hardware so as such when you see a
new version of Android is release it
takes a long time before the Android
universe all the different Android
phones update to the latest version of
Android and I guess there's a bunch of
problems with that I suppose of security
and feature sets and so on so on and yes
it's very different from iOS where it's
all basically controlled by Apple so you
have you know just like Apple phones you
have to deal with so that makes it much
easier to manage the operating system in
this case it's iOS versus Android and of
course it's also much easier as an app
developer to develop for iOS since you
don't have to develop for fifty thousand
phones out there well the solution is as
was pointed out in the article I think
is for vendors of Android apps to only
target a particular version Android or
maybe particular devices fortunately for
vendors you see it's I think it's
probably Nexus in Samsung or taking the
lion's share of things so anyway back to
the original question will Android get
killed well well Google has to destroy
Android because of some inherent
weaknesses in the operating system the
guy in this article cited the fact that
it was based on Linux there's legal
issues and there's kernel issues the
kernel is like the core of the operating
system so what's my take on this whole
thing I don't want to go down all the
details but let me give you some general
comments now
this is based on somebody here I've I've
never done any Android developments
although I've done a lot of Java
development in the day and Android it is
done with Java not that that's too
relevant but anyway whatever generally
speaking it's a bad idea to rewrite
software from scratch mature software
older software tends to be tends to have
less bugs and is more stable because of
you know refinements and refinements and
refinements now with Android not knowing
all the details my guess is is that
you're just gonna have to as Google say
listen when you're building your phones
let's let's start limiting some of our
hardware choices to x y&amp;amp;z let's conform
a little bit to certain parameters maybe
not as closely as iPhone but perhaps to
to a certain degree so that the
operating system can better manage the
situation that being said I don't know
if there's a huge problem with Android
because yeah I'm sure I heard the code
base is pretty messy inside I don't know
what iOS is all about but and I know
it's difficult to code for Android
because there's all these different
devices and that is not necessarily a
function of a core of the operating
system that could be resolved using
something called a facade it's the
design pattern in software development
and a facade is basically a very clear
of code that sits on top of another
layer of code so perhaps in later
versions of Android Google could just
create facades targeting maybe three or
four tranches of devices three or four
categories of devices and then the
hardware manufacturers could build
accordingly that might be a solution
there again getting back to the original
point I was gonna make I've been using
stock Android for a few years now I love
it very stable works fantastic I heard
I'm sung a variation of vert Android
with difficulty there TouchWiz I think
it is their lair that they built on top
of Android is very fast I was just
looking at the s7 from Samsung works
great seems to look good to me very fast
responsive and you know so I'm not sure
in terms of using the devices I see huge
difference between iOS and Android in
terms of functionality and stability and
so forth I don't know but I've had my
Android for years it's fantastic so I
guess that comes back to who's getting
the later version you know is it such a
huge issue that certain phones don't
update to the latest version of Android
I don't know if that's a huge issue to
be honest with you look at all the
people are still running Windows 7 heck
there's a lot of people are running 10
12 whatever how many years old XP is now
now that I would advise to do that but
that's my take on it my general take
take away is that this author is I'm not
convinced that this arguments because in
my experience to be right an app from
scratches it's just begging for a huge
amount of work usually when you rewrite
it out from scratch you exchanging an
old set of bugs or a new set of bugs and
it's a very rare thing that you see a
company decide to scrap a codebase and
move on and you only do that when the
real core is so bad that I can't really
adapt the biggest example I can think of
is Mac OS when Mac OS went from version
9 to 10 it was a total rewrite and had
to be done because the core of Mac OS
was so ancient and so hobbled that it
just there was no way around it right
there's no way around in terms
multitasking and memory management so
forth so they had to they had to move on
from that but if you look at Windows
which is a more modern Windows 95
well Windows NT is the basis of Windows
10 as far as I understand and that's a
very old operating system and because it
was built with modern a modern
architecture I don't see a need to
update the core windows for a long time
they just have to fix things and I think
that that's what you're gonna see what
Android I don't think it's too bad so
bad rather that they'll need to totally
trash it I just don't see that happening
and and one of the reasons I don't see
that happening again
I have Android phones a lot of people
have Android phones they work great even
if you don't get the latest version of
Android for eight months a year or
whatever who cares it works great and as
far as app developers concerned I would
just be targeting later phones for the
most part depending on the type of app
that you're writing but if you're
reading a specific business app
businesses are not going to have their
people on the five-year-old phones if
they do or three year old phones or four
to three or four year old phones if they
do they're probably not going to buy
your app because they don't want to
spend any money to begin with so I would
just be coding against the flagship
devices you know the top Samsung the top
Google devices and I would just code
accordingly another thing you could do
is write your Android apps in you know
html5 use html5 stack and use a
translation matrix like Cordova or
PhoneGap that might be a way to handle
and let them deal with the issues again
I'm jumping around here so yeah I don't
see Android being rewritten from scratch
I don't think that's gonna happen that's
it
