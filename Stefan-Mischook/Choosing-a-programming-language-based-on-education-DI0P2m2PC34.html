this V block I'm going to talk about
choosing your programming language based
on the level of education you have or
you want to achieve now some of you may
be confused so what's this all about
basically if you're looking to get a job
as a developer as a coder you have to
consider what your endgame is because
certain types of code well certain
languages rather are not open to people
with no university degree so let me give
you a quick rundown if you want to do
Java coding generally speaking or
c-sharp coding Python coding generally
speaking you need to find yourself with
some sort of degree because those jobs
the Java jobs and c-sharp jobs the
Python jobs generally speaking are found
in bigger organizations bigger
businesses where they're going to be
looking at your diplomas they're going
to be looking at your level of education
because they have HR departments so
they're screening in that way it's
bureaucracy on the other hand if you
find yourself in situation where you
might not have a college degree you
might not be willing to go that full
route for whatever reasons then you need
to choose other languages for your
coding and that would include of course
HTML CSS JavaScript and my number one
pick of course is pH P they all go
together by the way HTML CSS JavaScript
generally do not compete with PHP
whereas Java c-sharp Python in many
respects can compete with PHP bottom
line is if you're looking for
well-paying work high paid work and you
know somebody who's going to be getting
a college degree then you best bet is to
learn the web development stack with
PHP that means HTML CSS JavaScript and
of course PHP and then of course you're
gonna have to learn databases and the
SQL language now this may seem like a
lot but if you have good courses they
focus in on the key elements of these
languages and they show you how to put
it all together so it makes sense nobody
out there knows every single thing about
all of these languages some people you
know you might have somebody here in
there is pretty good at one or the other
but don't worry you don't have to know
everything you just have to know the
general principles and generally how to
get things done so there again there he
goes if you're looking to get into the
to development coding if you're willing
to go all the way to get a degree then
you can look at Java you can look at
c-sharp you could look at Python perhaps
if on the other hand you think you're
not going to go to college and you just
want to get a job quickly then you got
to look at web development using PHP for
the server-side coding if you don't know
what server-side coding is it's cold
that sits on the server if that makes no
sense to you and do my course I even my
basic HTML course I teach all that
that's pretty much it thanks a lot
