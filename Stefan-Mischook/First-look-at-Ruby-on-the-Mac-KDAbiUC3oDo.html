getting pretty late 1251 a.m. saturday
night so instead of partying or
something I'm decided to record a video
blog ah yeah so it's really late so if
my hair's messed up yeah what are you
gonna do I think I'm going to shave my
head so that I don't have to comb my
hair anymore alright so what's the point
of this video so we've if you on the
killer sites forum here so we just
reskinned it anyway if you're on this
killer sites form you may have noticed
this little thing a new forearm I put in
beginners Peru be programming so yeah
that's what's happening now is for the
first time actually I'm going to be
producing a set of ruby programming
courses but are nothing a revolutionary
there's a lot of people out there who
put out these courses but they don't put
them out like I put out my courses I am
the reason I'm putting them out is
because the schools well school couple
schools in Chicago mentioned to me that
they are going to be teaching Ruby and
curriculum so they needed some Ruby
courses they're interested in
potentially using the studio web system
so there's my little plug anyway so what
about Ruby it's an interesting language
I'm still a big advocate of I'm still
big advocate of PHP I think it's if you
had to choose a particular language I
would choose that not necessarily
because PHP is a superior programming
language but more because it's a big
community lots of projects are in PHP
lots of forums wordpress drupal drupal
joomla and a shopping cart
packages out there so I just PHP is of
them it's much more widely used you know
insofar as the languages themselves are
concerned Ruby versus PHP Ruby is more
sophisticated in certain regards doesn't
mean it's you're going to be more
productive with it it's just it's
because it's a totally already and
object-oriented language everything is
an object in in Ruby so that gives you a
certain amount of flexibility and power
PHP's flexibility has to do with the
fact that it's not purely object or
object oriented ironically it's that
procedural interface gives us some
inflexibility would have covered this in
other videos the point of this video
blog is just too I just want to show you
a couple quick things with regards to
ruby in my production of the course I
haven't done much Ruby programming to be
totally honest with you in my my career
I looked at it many years ago we
considered it for a project we were
working on but at the time Ruby's
infrastructure was immature relative to
PHP so I decided to go with PHP although
we did produce a site monitor
application work quite well just in a
few days of Ruby and it's basically an
application that was designed to run on
you know our home computer is various
laptops and it would it would monitor
our sites and check to see if any of
them went down and it would send an
email to him to whatever email just as
we wanted to it was pretty good I think
I might put that back on again seems you
know we had dedicated servers and we pay
for technical support and
in management and we saw our servers are
sitting at some big location but we
still often have to unfortunately have
to call them say eight for some reason
the server's not responding you know
bothers me that I have to do that but
that's another story and I pay for
support you know but generally speaking
i'm not going to dis the people i work
with they're really good it's just that
that's the one little issue that bothers
me so maybe you say monitor might come
in handy and dig up that code base
anyhow so in preparation for the course
is for this Ruby course of producing
rather I'm always looking at multiple
sources of information so first thing I
do is I check around I read a lot check
out other videos that are out there
because I want to put something together
that's better and so I always look
around at different sources and so right
now for the Ruby course I went to what
most of the people in the Ruby community
would consider the primary book they
call it the pickaxe book because it's
got a pickaxe in the frame and it's a
pretty thick book so I'm going through
this book and learning more details
about the language I did not know before
despite the fact that I am teaching the
basics I still like to really have a big
picture understanding of things so I can
narrow down on the important aspects of
the language I did to do this my
javascript course they do this my PHP
course isn't and other things as well
anyway so on Mac OS which i'm using now
Ruby actually comes built in so I was
going to get quick demonstration of that
so I'm going to launch the terminal here
you see a ran a few commands so I'm just
going to run a few things again so first
thing we're going to know what version
of Ruby you have so you just open up
turn you know what i'm going to do i'm
just going to exit this exit Oh should
write that right it's one in the morning
so so I'm going to exit it and so we can
start fresh it looks all cool say she
started like this so we're going to just
go Ruby dash B and this tells us what
version of
Ruby are we running on the on the mac OS
now because you see here it's Ruby 2
point 0 so that's pretty pretty pretty
modern actually yeah here's the bill it
tells you even with the build it is so
it's it's a very modern Ruby so it's
more than good enough for our purposes
if you're using Windows you have to
explicitly install Ruby let's go Ruby
installer and it's pretty simple
actually and when I do the actual video
courses i'll be covering all this in
detail so yeah so now we know we have
Ruby installed now Ruby comes with
something called herb which is sure IRB
which is short for interactive Ruby so
just type in herb and jumps us into
herbs they see herb main blah blah blah
blah blah so basically now what we can
do whatever biz just the Ruby
interpreter allows you to fire off Ruby
commands and you know get some responses
so it's a good simple way to test things
out and just get your feet wet with Ruby
so let me start off with a simple Ruby
command print and Stefan is tired and
needs a cut don't like it a gut does
that work All Right see it outputs the
fattest are hurt and he's a cut now
sitting out Neil because we're not
returning anything right so yeah another
interesting commands go puts and stuff
an what it all right so ya see it does
the same thing now those are between
puts and print is puts can can do
something called I think it's called
interpolation again it's very late you
if you get to know me as later tonight
later at night it gets my brain capacity
just who I I get dumber and dumber as I
get tired and
I've only had one coffee today so anyway
so puts can do certain things so what's
you know what else could we do here we
could check to see what other aspects of
Ruby are installed on the computers when
we exit herb and now I'm in the route
again so just check the Ruby Ruby and I
say okay we're out of herb now so let's
say I want to install rails I go rails
now see it's interesting but it's very
friendly the Seas tells me something
rails is it's probably the most popular
web application framework in the Ruby
world it's equivalent to larva or the
zend framework etc so says rails is not
currently installed on the system to get
the latest version simply type in sudo
gem install rails now let me explain
this line now a gem is basically just a
ruby package that's it this is the
package they organize them in gems so
you can and they got this big database
or you can just type in a command say
gem install X package that you want
rails happens to be one package it's
it's pretty cool now sudo now sudo is a
is a Linux command and it basically says
take on the identity of another user
they let me back that up it that's true
what I just said but basically sooner
does allows you to override any security
restrictions you might get it turns you
into a super user you know super user do
you know sudo so let's say I want to
install one package one gem gem is
packaged
in the Ruby world something called
Sinatra so I'm going to say I'm going to
go install the natura yes and also usage
install suffix okay that's a mistake
it's actually gem I gotta tell it I want
install the gem install so natural now
said I guess it's not sure as a web
server so now it's trying to go over the
internets going to try install it but
we're going to get an error and we'll
see that it was a few seconds here so
it's error error while executing gem you
don't have write permission for the
library Lou Reed library rui / gems blah
blah so basically what's happening the
gem installer is trying to install this
package over the internet into our mac
computer the problem is is that there's
no right permission as a normal user in
in our mac so we have to override it
using sudo so yo sudo gem install
Sinatra now you're going to be
installing this in the core Ruby
directory that comes with mac OS 10 and
some people might be quite way you're
going to miss things up maybe you so you
could configure your computer to install
your gym package is in another directory
so and then run Ruby a separate instance
of Ruby elsewhere but since the naturist
on something that's already there we
install Sinatra is not going to conflict
with anything so we should be okay so I
just issued that a command hit enter I
gotta give my little password I don't
know if I wrote it up properly because
I'm very tired now ah see it's fetching
him now is doing everything that it
needs to do to install the ruby gem
Sinatra which is the the web
server and why do we want to install
snatch up because it's a really easy way
to start building real simple web apps
with Ruby which I will be doing my
course so that's it that was my
introduction to Ruby on on Mac OS i'll
be covering windows i'll be covering
other things as well and if you go to be
on YouTube a lot of stuff but also on
the the killer sites forum the beginners
Ruby a subform I will be putting in my
little comments and discussions as I
build out the course if you're
interested and that's pretty much it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
