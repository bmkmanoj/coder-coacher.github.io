we're going to be doing now is to set up
our secondary pages here we have our
index page and what I'd like you to do
at this point is to save file save as
and we are going to save as our let's
say our about page and the about page is
going to be replaced because if you
remember the existing about page does
not have any information on it that we
want except for the basic structure
we're going to get rid of the three
column layout and turn it into a two
column layout however notice that it
does say update the links and will
always say yes and the reason being is
because since the index page was outside
of any folders and the about pages
inside the web folder what that actually
means is the links will be different
from the index to the about so here we
are inside of the about page at this
point how do we know that we'll look
over here this is the about page that's
the index page well at this point I'm
going to split to the or go to the split
screen view and what we can see here is
that you know if you just slide you can
select the image that's in here notice
here is the div called middle column and
the middle column div is the one that
has the other elements inside of it and
there was another div over here called
the right column and that's the div as
you can see right there so what we're
going to be doing now is to actually
being or getting rid of a lot of the
information that we happen to have so
what I'm going to do is to remove the
elements from inside this and we could
even remove the elements from inside
this one just by deleting them and as
you can see here I'm going to actually
get rid of this and here is the third
column that right column and I can leave
it
as is if I wish I can get rid of this
middle column if I wish so now I just
have this right column so let's think
about a couple of things we still have
this area over here which is called left
column alcohol and it's perfectly fine
it's got you know nothing really giving
us any grief it still has this link on
that page and that's perfectly fine
again doing exactly what it should be
doing however what I want to be doing is
to creating some new sections instead of
calling this alcohol I think just for
the sake of simplicity we will go about
creating something in here called nav
will turn that into the navigation
section and we'll see a little bit later
on that that's going to be perfectly
fine for us now what is now going to do
well it's going to look exactly the same
as the other one in other words it'll
still be 260 and it will still float to
the left and if i press apply nothing's
really going to be applying yet and
we'll see why because there is no nav
but in here where the ID for elk all set
i'm going to rename that nav and just
refresh that and as you can see you
still have everything exactly the way it
was before and that's great but now this
area here if i were to increase its size
well first of all it's called the right
column i'm going to change its name to
something like main content and now that
that's been refreshed and called main
content you can see that wow it's all
stretched out and not exactly the size
that I want it to be so we're going to
have to make some changes and what we're
going to do is to specify that main
content is going to be again floating
this time to the right and how big is it
going to be well let's see if I had 260
and 260 that would be about well let's
see 250 250 to 500 and extra 10 each is
another 20
so five 20 but we still had that space
in the middle over here about 30 pixels
so 550 is what I'm looking for so if i
make it 550 and press apply you can see
that it still maintains that gutter
space of 30 that we had over here and
it's looking pretty good so I'll click
OK now a couple of other things we're
going to switch over to the assets
window and in the assets window if i
refresh it you can see that I've got all
three of my pictures I'm going to drag
this picture right in here we'll give it
some alternate text i'll say a large
about picture that's not very intuitive
but you know if you actually had a
picture and some files that made a
little bit more sense than this one does
and i would suggest that you use it now
notice there still was the h1
information from before which i'm going
to get rid of and the reason being is
because i'll just copy the information
that's hear about typography and I'll
command X to cut it out and I can get
rid of that h1 information to and right
underneath my picture I'm going to press
return and I'm going to paste in this
text now you'll notice that the text did
not paste in with the exact information
i wanted so i'm going to come in here
i'm going to make that a h1 and i'm
going to make sure that this area here
is not a h1 but rather i'll select that
text and i'll make it just a paragraph
so we still have the paragraph
information from before i can even copy
this and you know add some extra space
in here just in case and as you can see
we've got our file looking pretty much
the way I want it to let's test it and
see what little tweaks we need to
accomplish in here so we saved both of
those elements and let's try that again
sorry come in here and I'll preview this
in Firefox and as you can see I've got
my elements in place there's a 30 pixel
separation here as
all images were set to have 30 pixels of
separation notice that the paragraphs
could probably have a little bit more
down at the bottom or what I could
simply do is increase the amount of
information or margin rather at the
bottom of that particular file so main
content here does not really have
anything in terms of margin or padding
so I'll just add like maybe 10 pixels
down at the bottom and if i click ok you
can see that that's increased a little
margin outside of that area if it's not
enough for you you certainly can
increase that even more if you wish and
you can see that there's extra margin
there so now if i were to preview this
in my browser we would see that there is
certainly some extra space down at the
bottom that's funny it's sort of going
to the default let me try that again
there you go and as you can see you've
got some extra space here I don't really
need to worry about it and we've
incurred a scrollbar but you know that's
fine we're not all that unhappy with it
if you want to even see what more text
would look like I could go to lip simcom
as you remember last time and I could
just generate some more text inside here
and we could add some extra paragraphs
or something along those lines if we
wish so I'll just copy a paragraph here
go back to Dreamweaver and underneath
this I would just paste in yet another
paragraph I think I'll have to do it in
here so there we go we can refresh this
and as you can see I've got my paragraph
separation in there now I do notice that
my paragraphs don't actually have
anything at the bottom so there's a
separation of sorts that I want to place
in here there's no margin or padding
definition for those so I'm going to go
to my box definition and let's add a
little bit of margin at the bottom of my
paragraphs so I'm pretty happy with the
way they look at the top here and that's
pretty much because of
my headlines so what I'm going to do is
let's say hey what if we had 10
separation there if that's good for you
great if you want to add more 16 teens
too much obviously but 16 perhaps can
work okay for us and if you like that
then that can work just fine for what we
have available for us right here now
what we're going to do is to finish off
this page by adding some navigation
elements over here on the side and we'll
do that in just a second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
