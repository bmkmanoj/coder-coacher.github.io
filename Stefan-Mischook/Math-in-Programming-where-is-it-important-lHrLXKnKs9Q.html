vlog about how much do you need math in
programming and I basically said you
hardly need it at all mine and I have
said a programming you don't need much
math because most programming is just
basic business apps add subtract
multiply divide and that's pretty much
it
let me tell you where math does come in
with programming though and it comes in
big time if you are doing things like
game development perhaps if you're
building engines although people don't
do that too often if you're building
apps that may have to do with how for
whatever it really called biorhythmic
soar forget the term I'll set them I sit
down and do a vlog I forget the term but
any type of apps and maybe taking pulse
and tracking vital signs or stuff you
know things that you might find an Apple
watch or those fitbit's or something
that's where some complex math comes
into play and finally machine learning
and AI there you're gonna get some major
math apparently so if you're looking in
those particular areas of programming
and it sounds like a lot but actually
it's actually quite a narrow field it's
actually quite a specialized area but if
you're thinking about getting into that
then you're gonna probably have to
consider lots of math although as any
particular area gets more sophisticated
you're going to get more and more
libraries and which will mean less and
less math to do but right now as it
stands there's a lot of math and AI and
machine learning there's a lot of math
in apps that have to do with health
and tracking health and so forth and
taking vital signs and readings rather
so you got to consider that in terms of
math but again those are relatively rare
gigs compared to their basic coding gigs
that are out there business apps and so
forth anyhow I just wanted to present
that you know math does have its role
but it's in a narrow or
aspect of the programming or development
world ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
