variables variables are one of the
fundamentals of programming and it's
very important that you understand this
because they'll have a great impact in
terms of your ability to code down the
road
one of the benefits of understanding of
basic like variables
is that once you understand PHP
variables you pretty much understand
what variables are in every programming
language that's really used today in our
exploration of variables we're gonna
cover them well we're gonna cover three
major parts a what exactly are variables
how to create variables and why where we
have variables in the first place
let's start off by actually creating a
PHP variable and then from there we'll
get into some of the details
so I popped open Windows notepad and
with our basic HTML template page here
and here's our PHP tags so let's create
a variable PHP variables always start
with the dollar symbol when the PHP
engine sees a dollar symbol it knows
that were it's about to look at a
variable here let's give the variable
name and what say we'll call it name
variables always start with a dollar
symbol there has to be no space between
the dollar symbol and text and the text
itself can be uppercase or lowercase
this is fine this is fine doesn't matter
and you can start with an underscore
they cannot start with a number or any
special symbols like anything like this
so I would suggest that you create all
your variables with the dot well
obviously start with the dollar symbol
and keep it lowercase and there's a
reason for this later on when we look at
other aspects of PHP
as we learned before whenever you run a
line of PHP code you have to end it with
a semicolon so say that that's it we've
created our first variable so the next
step is to look at specifically what's
happening and what are we doing when
we're creating a variable
in a nutshell a variable is essentially
a container in memory think about your
computer memory that contains
information sometimes it could be text
information sometimes could be numbers
and sometimes could be other things
which we'll get into later on so right
now when you create a variable like this
or just go dollar sign and I give the
variable name
I basically reserved a spot in memory an
actual physical spot in your physical
memory well this case because this is a
server-side language is actually in the
server's memory but I've actually
haven't filled this container with any
information so let's fill it with some
formation and you do that by using equal
signs so we're gonna go name equals
double quotes Stefan
now we've used double quotes because
this is a text string remember a string
of text is just one piece of text
followed by another so now we've created
a variable and we've given it the value
of Stefan when Stefan happens to be a
texturing we know that because it's got
the double quotes right
this equal sign here nerds call this the
assignment operator because it assigns
the value of Stefan to the variable
called name it's called an assignment
operator because it's you can think of
it in terms of an operation it operates
on so it's the best analogy I can come
up with anyhow so this is the assignment
operator and it assigns the value of
Stefan to the variable called name with
the variable name is really is just a
reserved spot in the server's memory
think about your RAM memory you can have
you know 500 Meg's around 1 Giga RAM so
this is actually putting the value of
Stefan into a spot in memory and we've
named that spot in memory we called it
name so this begs the question why would
you want to do this
but the reason that you create variables
and we know about creating burials
variable is just basically putting
information inside of a container and
giving it a name the name being the name
of a variable the reason that we do this
is so that we can use this information
in this case it's just the stephane
later on in our scripts think of it as a
bag you know you're sticking some you
know some stuff in a bag in this case
it's the name Stephane and so then we
can use that bag and we can carry around
this information using different part in
our scripts to do all kinds of
interesting things this all become very
clear later the main points you want to
get out of this is that a variable is
basically a container for information
this is the information you assign
information to a variable using the
assignment operator which is the equal
sign and you know that in a variable
name no excuse me a variable it's just a
reserved spot and your server's memory
now I'm talking about RAM memory
so now that we got this basic theory
covered what's actually put this to some
use so I'm gonna just copy this and
we've looked at the print function
before so I'm just gonna just go print
name and it will force Emma : of course
because we all always have to end that
I'm going to save that and now I'm going
to view this in the web browser and I'm
going to see what it looks like
I've popped open Firefox now at the page
and we see the text Stephan preview the
source as simple as what gets it just
prints out the text effect so we've seen
how we declared a variable here when you
create a variable to call declaring a
variable that's what nerds will say we
assign data value stephane and now we've
used that variable in a PHP statement
and said print the variable name PHP is
smart enough to know that the variable
name contains the sticks the text
stephane so it just prints it out for us
to give you an idea the power variables
take a look at this copy/paste this
bring that here and I'll insert the old
horizontal rule which nobody uses
anymore all right
so you see a nurse in our code here our
first PHP block some basic HTML and our
second date our second PHP block you
notice here we've declared a variable
our name variable here and we haven't
used it here and down the road we've
mostly basically now asking PHP to use
the name variable and to print out its
value on the screen so just hit save pop
open the browser there you go
so we got our horizontal rule and our
names to found here
so this is a very very basic example but
you can see how we've basically stuck
the value of Stephane inside of a
container and we've used it later on or
script here this is this is very basic
and you're gonna see how variable to
come very very useful as we move along
deeper into PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
