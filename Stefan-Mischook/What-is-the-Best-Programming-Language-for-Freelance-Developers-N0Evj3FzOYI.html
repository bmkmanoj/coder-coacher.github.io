start this vlog that I can in
conventional unconventional way there we
go I'm the conventional way first of all
I bought these markers to do some white
board marker ink and eraser board
muttering and they smell bad it's weird
I hope you don't mind I'm just gonna go
make a tea in the next vlog I'm gonna go
over a bunch of the YouTube comments
some of them pretty funny and some of
them will be useful to people I think so
if you want to become a freelancer in
programming or if you want to be a
freelancer developer which language
should you learn this is a question I
get all the time and I keep answering it
from different points of view I'm trying
to hammer home a basic idea about
development in general and that idea is
that you have to look at the market
around you to make that decision every
different region you know if you're in
the States or if you're in Eastern
Europe or if you're in India things will
change but I think there's some
consistencies there so for instance C++
is not going to be the language if for V
freelancer I don't think there's any c++
jobs free freelancers so if you're gonna
do C++ coding you have to expect you're
going to be working for a company
there's nothing wrong with that some
people prefer that so people don't like
that
it depends what you want to do but if
you want to get into freelancing you
have to first look at the local market
and make this the decision based on what
you see in the local market so how do
you look at the local market you look at
indeed.com as
as an example of the site you look what
people who people are hiring and you see
if they're hiring as freelancers or not
you can look on sites that hire
freelance developers out there and
there's many out there I'm sure a lot of
people can suggest them and you can
start checking that out if you want to
work remotely as a freelancer that said
there are a few tried in true
technologies and languages but it's
going to give you a ton of freelance
work number one the web stack the web
stack of course huge that starts with
html5 and CSS CSS straight just so you
know just in case you're wondering you
have HTML and html5 at one point there
was a difference I suppose because html5
was this big leap forward from the
previous version of HTML and so in 2002
range 2013 range that time frame people
looked at html5 and HTML being kind of
different things because html5 loaded a
huge amount of power into HTML these
days though a 20-17 good well if you a
week or so from 2018 its html5 that's it
html5 all the browser's understand and
process html5 perfectly the Nerds will
say the browsers support to html5 salt
HTML html5 CSS is css3 again css3 was
considers different because it was a big
leap forward and turns out a tech so
everybody did everybody consider
differently now it's a CSS like my
beginners HTML and CSS course they teach
html5 and css3 so my beginners see as
HTML course is an html5 course and at
the end of the day I'm changing the
title by the way because I called it
beginner to HTML what should be it
should have been something like beginner
to pro in HTML because it covers
everything seeme with the CSS save me
what the JavaScript saved me with my PHP
course etc anyway so when you're looking
at freelance
you have to consider the technology C++
I don't think there's gonna be any
freelancing jobs there where all the
freelance money is is still in the web
stack why because every single business
just about it has to have some sort of
web site yes some will use things like
Wix
but that's only a temporary thing I
think when companies get serious about
their websites they're going to be
looking in customer jobs
another area you might want to consider
in terms of freelancing of course is
WordPress WordPress is huge you've got a
huge number of business sites out there
I think something like 30% or 35% of the
world's websites the world's websites
are on WordPress and that means a lot of
these business owners are going to need
WordPress developers people who know
WordPress well who can configure it lock
it down
who can install plug-ins who can modify
modify and add new themes etc etc etc so
there's a lot of activity in the
WordPress space for WordPress developers
so in my interactive web developer
course I do give you the key coding but
training what you need for WordPress is
html5 css3 a little bit of jobs well we
have a complete jobs of course in PHP
but if you're working with WordPress you
just need a little Java Script some PHP
for when I get into a theme creation so
forth and then we have a theme creating
course so there you go so you have to
know your way around WordPress just a
little bit isn't that difficult but if I
get enough comments about that I'll put
it I used to have one a wordpress course
but what press changes every so often so
I haven't updated it because I think
most people can get around WordPress but
if you want a wordpress basics course
how to install it and just the basics
insurance of how to set it up and so on
then I could put something out very
quickly for you guys if you can't find
anything else on the web I tend to
concentrate on the core programming and
the business end of the skills training
because that's what's lacking out there
so but sometimes when I get the mattock
and crack out something like that that
it could be pretty useful to you guys
anyway so back to freelancing yes so
freelancer you gotta look at local
opportunities you can look online you
got to consider the languages when you
look at the local opportunities what
you're probably going to see is that
there's gonna be lots of opportunities
for the web stack the web stack
developers you won't see much
opportunity for freelance in C++ C sharp
and Java I doubt it
because those languages tend to be
involved in projects where you gonna
have larger company if we're gonna have
full-time staff doing that Python you
can find some work in freelance and
Python there's no question about that
you may get called in to build some web
scrapers or maybe build a python-based
web app with Django or flask or some
other framework exception set yourself
yeah
freelancing it's still hugely dominated
by the web stack meaning the web
language is building websites and web
apps WordPress Joomla Drupal and some
Python as well you may have some Ruby
Ruby on Rails as well although more
serious companies will get involved in
that in the business world 90% of
business not 80% of businesses are small
and medium-sized businesses small
medium-sized businesses are far more
likely to loot use PHP based web apps or
websites WordPress based sites which is
PHP Drupal than anything else when you
get into very large organizations
they're going to be doing C++ or if
they're doing web stuff they would be
doing java web or a dotnet web and again
it's very regional for specific a lot of
the young nerdlings what developers
they're they have this this negative
disposition will forgot to PHP and
unlike PHP because they think PHP is
what PHP was ten years ago
PHP today it's every bit as
sophisticated and as capable as all the
modern languages out there and
frameworks out there no question but
there's this bias against it this
prejudice against it for some reason by
the Nerds but not by the companies who
need PHP developers so I was actually
just talking to a recruiter who called
me up and the thing that she said that
it's so hard to find
vanna PHP developer so so hard there's
such a big demand that's one of the
niche this is like this giant niche in
the programming world in the development
world PHP developer WordPress developer
because everybody wants to jump into AI
or they want to jump into a Java or they
want to jump into Python which is great
there's a huge gap for PHP developers
which means a lot of money be made
because a lot of crappy PHP developers
out there but if you could be the good
one one of the good ones then well even
if you wanted a crappy one so it's
probably a ton of work for out there so
yeah I think that's pretty much covers a
bit of a meandering vlog again I do
these vlogs and I present similar
information from different perspectives
because when you're noob young nerdling
you may not know what the particular
buzzword is you may not know exactly how
to ask or what questions to ask to get
the answer that you need and so that's
why I present things from a different
point of view so if you're hearing this
you're going asked if you talked about
this 20 videos ago or 10 videos ago or
five videos ago yeah I did but again I'm
trying to present from different points
of view to reach the largest audience
possible and you know that's good for me
and it's good for them as well so
everybody benefits that's the magic of
the YouTube you can just press stop if
it's not for you all right
that's pretty much it Cheers
okay guys it is December 19th 4:00 in
the afternoon a 8 at noon but I did not
have breakfast I had one coffee out of
tea and i'm going on one of my semi-fast
tonight today what does that mean

granola with raisins and almond milk

tomorrow morning so there you go if you
want to join me in the fast you know you
fast up before the holiday if you're in
the West and you're doing the Christmas

a little
clean the body out of a little lose four
or five Newton on for five pounds lose
to three pounds and then when you go to
the Christmas meal you won't come out
plumper
