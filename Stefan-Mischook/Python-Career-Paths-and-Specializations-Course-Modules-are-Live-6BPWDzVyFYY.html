added two new modules to my Python
course module number two is on Python
career paths where I outline three
career paths in Python becoming an
employee become a contractor and selling
your own Python programs I'll give you
the pros and cons I'll give you an
outline of what it's all about and I
give you the action plan the step by
step how to become an employee you step
by step how to become a contractor etc
and module 3 is on this Python
specializations Python as you know is a
general-purpose language and there's
many different areas we can go into with
Python you can go to AI machine learning
you can go into Python from Web Apps and
go into Python for server automation and
processes you can go to Python for data
sciences so I discuss those as well and
I talk about what supporting skill sets
that you have to have for each of these
specializations so for example if you're
doing web apps you're going to need to
learn HTML and CSS and some JavaScript
you have to do Python with web apps etc
etc etcetera
anyway that's there's a few other little
tidbits there it's only about 25 minutes
of video but there's also an 8 page PDF
that outlines everything bullet points
nice and simple kind of a playbook for
your Python professional career and
that's it for now
just in case it's not clear you can go
and download these two new modules now
if you already bought the course just
letting you know
