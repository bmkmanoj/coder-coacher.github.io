something strange something peculiar
about the way web browsers handle text
and tags in a page so let me just show
you it's probably the easiest way to do
it so I'm just gonna write text right to
the page now you notice this text is not
inside a paragraph tag it's just
floating on its own inside of the body
tag so let's see what happens okay no
big deal it's what we expected so I'm
gonna view source and here it is
so let's minimize that so let's do
something totally crazy so we have two
lines of text now you notice that we
have a line break here right so let's
see what this looks like in the browser
oh boy see very different even though we
have a line break in our code we don't
see it here in the web page as the web
browser would show us
but even though look in our code it does
indeed have a line break that's part of
that strange behavior talked about I
just mentioned really with regards to
how browsers treat text in a web page
whether you have one space like this or
a huge space like this let me show you
again it doesn't matter the web browser
will ignore all this weight space all
the space here will be ignored and of
course your two lines of text will be
squished up together it will look like
this so the solution of course is to use
tags so let's get rid of this and we're
gonna put it in a three paragraphs now
let's preview this and you see our feet
are three paragraphs after each
paragraph
there is a line break now let's try
something else I'm just gonna clear
these out so let's get rid of the line
break in our code so everything is
squished up right beside each other
right okay no spaces between our
paragraphs in the code we'll say that
preview and browser huh look at that
still there is a line break you see even
though in our code you can see it's all
squished up so what does that tell you
it tells you that the paragraph tag is
affecting the way our text is formatted
or positioned in the page it's kind of
basic but nonetheless it's useful to
know so when you add text in a paragraph
after the paragraph you're gonna have
automatically this separation this line
break that we see here the line break
the line break and that's just the way
that the paragraph tags work what you're
going to see in HTML is that each tag
that we use is gonna have a particular
effect on the page the good thing
they're all pretty similar there are
some differences here and there which
you're going to learn along the way as
we continue in the lessons but I just
want you to understand how the tags have
affected the way the text is displayed
in the page and now you see why we can't
just put text like this because we look
at it it's all going to be squished up
like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
