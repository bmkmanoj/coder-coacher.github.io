so I'm gonna answer a couple of
questions that were put to me on a
recent YouTube video okay so you're so
this person writes unfortunately forget
his name
soren three mahai song three writes i'm
oakley i mostly focus on studying
programming and have no idea how to
properly manage a web design business so
here here are some of the questions i
don't know if a contract should be
signed or not contracts should be signed
for sure now when you write a contract
for your web development or web design
any contract you have two copies you
have a copy for you and you have a copy
for your client and you should both sign
each contract so you know everybody's
got the same contract for sure so for
sure have a contract I don't know how to
write that contract or just find one
online or maybe I should ask a lawyer
for advice lawyer I don't think it's
really necessary for a web development
contracts web design contracts
my advice for contracts just keep them
very simple very much to the point and
and you know short little paragraph two
three sentences a few bullet points
short little paragraph a few bullet
points your signatures that's it
date the contracts or who knows the
dates and remember my thirty three split
video where I talk about how you should
get paid and that should be specified in
the contract specify what is going to be
delivered on the first draft what is the
time frame how you expect to be paid
resource of things I might put out a
contract template for people if people
ask for it you ask me and I'll put
something out for you I next question I
also don't know if I should resell
hosting and charge remains or if I do
how much should I charge for maintenance
well first of all when you're reselling
hosting I've done it understand it could
be a pain in the in the butt especially
when it comes to setting up their email
people are gonna be I losing my I lost
my email I don't know do my email so you
gotta understand it's it's a bit of an
issue so when you turn to resell
Hosting you have a few options you have
these turnkey hosting solutions like web
host manager very commonly used and just
makes it much easier to manage hosting
and you could rent a server from a big
provider big company and they'll you may
may cost you 80 bucks a month hundred
bucks a month and then you can put all
kinds of websites on there basic website
hosting and a lot of these things come
with turnkey scripts like instant
WordPress instant this instant that you
know setting up your databases so you
don't have to be a Linux or UNIX expert
or server expert and you could set up
hosting now understand when you're
getting into the hosting business it
could be problematic now it could be a
great thing as well now we have hosting
a killer sites while we I've been doing
it for many years but about eight ten
years ago something like this I sold the
hosting to a third party company and I
get residuals so I get my residuals on
that and I still get the residuals but I
don't have to do anything they take care
of phone support and tech support and
renewals and all this kind of stuff but
I don't I make much less on a per client
basis when I did before cuz my my
interest was not to become big hosting
provider so hosting could be very cool
because you get this money coming every
month all the time and people don't
typically change their hosting because
it's a big pain to do it it's like
changing your bank accounts people do it
but because hosting is commoditized now
what that means is that everybody is
neighbor can do hosting now it's hard to
get hosting clients so remember if
you're gonna be getting into the hosting
remember it could be a paint paint you
can get a call at five o'clock our
emails are not working why isn't it
working and it's usually going to be
something on their end they set up their
computer wrong and they expect you to be
on the phone and to walk them through so
it can be big headaches so if you're
gonna get into hosting especially
typical small business hosting you're
not gonna make much as you're looking at
seven eight nine ten bucks a month maybe
can you can you might be able to get
like an extra support fee a monthly fee
a retainer fee depending on the clients
remember it's usually something where
you have to if I were going to get to a
hole if I was going to get into
I would be planning that's my business
long-term to be in hosting where you get
a lot of people so you're getting you
can afford to bring in staff who could
take all these calls these tech support
calls about why they lost their email
address password or something
set me to consider IELTS or said I
rather make less but have not have to
deal with headaches then to get into the
hosting business and then there's more
advanced hosting now you get all this
cloud hosting what's going on it's much
more sophisticated and there's
virtualized hosting which is cloud so
it's a whole world in of itself it could
be some good money in it but it's it's a
long slog so if you want to be a
developer I would be mmm but getting to
hosting I know the friend of mine went
into it and he wanted to get out of it
about six months later because it was
dissipating that pain in the in a dare
year in the bottom how much charge for
maintenance for hosting that depends on
the contract depends on how elaborate
their needs are so you have to really
sit down and try to figure out how much
time it's going to take and you could
put that in a contract
you know if they you charge remember
fifty bucks a month or 75 bucks per
month for support they get how much
support 2 hours a month max they may not
use if they don't use it they lose it
for that month but that's all I would do
it so there you go I know I don't know
which way to the best offer support for
a website email or Skype or both well I
would always start with email because
with Skype yeah I sort of have to be
there email you can address it a little
later you could check ok it's on
emergency I can talk to him I can
readjust it two hours from now or next
day you can do Skype you can do both you
can do facebook Messenger if they do
value whatever whatever you feel
comfortable with
I like email because a nice record you
can keep a record of your communications
with him you can you know I use Gmail
whatever in this store it doesn't cost
you much so that's a way of doing the
support you might have to consider phone
support as well especially with business
accounts who may have 10 employees and
they lose their email addresses and then
you're in all kinds of trouble just
check out my time here all right we're
good anyway
how can I easily let the client know at
what stage I am in the process of
building of building his website
and how can I make this information
available at any time now to send him an
email in your original contract you
should say the first draft is going to
be delivered in two weeks for example
now if you say two weeks you better you
better plan that it's only going to take
you a week you know to account for
problems so yeah that's another thing
when you're when you plan out your
projects a good rule of thumb is a thumb
is to double your expected time so you
think somebody's going to take you a
month say it's gonna take you two months
if you get it done in a month great if
you don't get it done in a month you're
not gonna be late
you see what I mean so in terms of
communication you let them know if you
just say in the contract a first drafts
going to be delivered in two weeks you
set the date in the contract you're
gonna get paid your second third in that
case if you haven't seen my 33 split
video she'll watch that you understand
this so yeah that's what I would do I
would definitely need to send an email
so I yeah we your first draft is is is
out what's let's show you it I expect
payment and then the next draft will be
out and again emails is good that way
because it's all you can keep them nice
records of that or of course you can do
about messengers as well it depends with
the client the client may prefer email
client may prefer Skype who knows but
always remember you want to keep a
digital trail a time stamped a date
stamped record of all your
communications with your clients so
everybody has contacts in terms of
timelines and so if you say I'm gonna
deliver in two weeks two weeks from when
well gets first 2016 so that means you
could have in two weeks from their
August whatever 14th you know get the
idea timing contacts documentation
time-stamped very important to avoid
disputes by having all of this clearly
and plainly this presented to the client
up front avoids problems you don't count
on people's memories memories people's
memories play tricks on them especially
when it comes to money how can I make it
this is yeah yeah in terms of making it
you know it's it's not a big deal how do
you make it available to your client
where you're at you I also set
he's not micromanage he or she is not
micromanaging you first draft out in two
weeks that's when you open communication
with them okay we got a first draft the
only time you don't you if you need to
communicate with him beforehand is
because you need some information to
deliver that first draft but try meant
you got to set the parameters that
they're not on top of you they're not
your boss you're doing contract work for
them so but they're not in your in your
soup every day messing around with you
you know what I mean so you know I would
restrict communication otherwise it can
be a headache I'm just reading arrest
this question also that's pretty much it
I think I covered this guy's questions
if I miss anything Soren yeah you know
how to reach me
I hope this is useful for everybody
these are rules by the way that I didn't
just read on other people of people's
blogs
I've been coding since 1994 I bought I
started my first business when I was 18
it was outside of technology and so this
is from over to get decades of
experience working as either a
freelancer having a web design studio
having my own startups working with
other startups working in contracts for
multinational publicly traded companies
so I bring over 20 years of experience
into what I am discussing with you now I
hope you find it useful you have
questions feel free to ask I'm actually
responsive to my YouTube community at
this point in time so there you go
I hope you enjoyed cow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
