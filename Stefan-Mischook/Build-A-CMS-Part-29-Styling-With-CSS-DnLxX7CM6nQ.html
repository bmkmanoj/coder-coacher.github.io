talked about adding a div and two links
that surround each content block when
you're in the editing view and we're
going to use those to indicate which
areas on the page or editable and this
is what the preview looks like so far
and one thing I wanted to correct before
i continue is if we open up actually let
me show you in the source if you do a
preview of the page after you logged in
and you look at the div with a class of
FP underscore edit you'll notice we're
missing an equal sign here so I'm going
to go back to CMS models and underscore
CMS and I need to fix that because that
will cause problems when we're styling
things so with that out of the way let
me remind you how this system works this
is a little bit confusing so to
summarize this and to put it in a tabbed
for that it looks basically like this we
have an FP edit div that surrounds our
content block and within that div we
have to clap we have two links an edit
type link and an edit link and the edit
type indicates the type of block and the
edit link allows the user to click on
that area and edit the block and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to make
both of these links use position
absolute and the edit type link will be
positioned to the top and right whereas
the edit link will be absolutely
positioned to the top and left and we're
going to be using a combination of
jquery and CSS to style these CSS will
do most of the heavy lifting and I'll
use a little bit of jQuery to determine
the sizes for the absolutely positioned
elements
let me move to FP underscore style.css
and at the bottom of the page I'm going
to add a couple extra blank lines and
the first style that I'm going to add is
going to be for FP under square edit and
I know they're going to be two links
within this div that are going to be
positioned absolutely so I want to make
sure this one has a position of relative
so that the links within this div are
positioned in the correct spots I'm also
going to add display inline block this
is the most cross-browser of the display
options based on what i want for this
particular div so underneath that i'm
going to add FP edit type and this is
the link that indicates the type of the
content block and I want to move that
into the top right corner of the FP edit
div but first I want to add a display
block so it expands the width and height
correctly I want to add padding of four
pixels top 18 pixels left and right and
0 pixels on the bottom I wanted to add a
background
fit for a file that's within the images
folder and it's edit under school excuse
me underscore type that gif and it's
going to be positioned to the top and
center and it won't repeat and for text
I want text to be color want them to be
a white color and I want you to be font
size of 11 pixels now to adjust the
positioning of this element I want to
use position absolute I'm going to do a
top of negative six pixels so it moves
this up and out of the FP edit divs just
slightly a right of 10 pixels a height
of 25 pixels a height of 25 pixels and
finally text decoration none this
removes the default underline on text
links so below that now i'm going to do
FP edit link and it's going to have a
background excuse me not a background a
border of one pixel solid orange and
this is going to be aborted that
surrounds this element and indicates
that it's edited area and it's going to
have position absolute a top of 0 the
left of 0 and display block to make sure
it expands to fit the full width and
height properly and then a couple of
your properties it's going to have an
overflow of hidden
excuse me overflow there a text indent
of negative 9999 pixels and what this
does if I briefly go back to our index I
PHP and preview this it removes the edit
block text here and takes that and moves
it off the edge of the screen so that's
that and then an outline of none this
just moves the default outline when this
link is clicked on just cleans up the
display slightly and the last thing
before I forget when I was testing this
in multiple browsers I ran into an issue
specifically with ie7 where the FP edit
link the browser had issues determining
whether the cursor was hovered over with
the Edit link or over the content which
the Edit link is over that makes any
sense um let me start over the FP edit
link is positioned absolutely on top of
the content and the browser had trouble
determining which was being offered over
the actual content or this link so what
I found to get around this was this
particular element needs a background
and it needs a 1 pixel transparent
background and this removes browser
confusion that makes things work
consistently across browsers so it's
going to have images / trans gif and
that'll take care of things so below FP
edit link we also want to add some sort
of styling when this link is hovering
over
and in that case we're going to change
the background to edit underscore BG dot
PNG and this will change the background
to the diagonal striped orange
background that you saw earlier in the
preview so the last thing that I want to
cover in this particular video is I want
to change the z-index on these elements
basically it's the stacking what
elements appear on top of what other
elements and I want the content to be at
the lowest level so I'm going to change
FP edit block to have a z-index of 0 I
want the content or excuse me I want the
link to appear on top of the content so
here at the end of this I'm going to add
a Z and X of 99 pixels and then on top
of the Edit link I want the edit type
notification that link to appear so in
add a Z and X of 100 and the exact
numbers excuse me this is the index of
99 not pixels on the end so just so I'm
clear the z-index the actual value that
I've chosen is sort of arbitrary but
basically the higher number the higher
in the stack it's going to be so 100 is
larger than 99 so FP edit type will
appear on top of FP edit link so is the
last thing let's go ahead and preview
this and see where we are there we go so
we're headed in the right direction we
have our edit types and in the next
video I'm going to be talking about
using some jQuery to give proper heights
and widths to our editable areas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
