login dot PHP and you'll notice we have
just opening and closing PHP tags and a
brief little description and we're gonna
be starting writing this and first off I
want to explain a little bit about how
we're going to be handling login we're
gonna be obviously querying the database
and checking to see if the username and
password that the user entered matches
what the database has and if so we're
going to set a session variable and
redirect the user on to the members PHP
page so let me briefly introduce the
concept of PHP sessions basically
they're a way to easily store
information across multiple pages
they're temporary so they'll be deleted
either when session destroyed function
is called or when the browser itself is
closed and they work by temporarily
setting a cookie on the user on the
user's machine that uniquely identifies
them and allows them to interact with a
server and the server will automatically
save variables associated with them so
we're going to be using sessions within
our file as a way to authenticate the
user and make sure if he's visiting a
members page we want to make sure that
the session is set and he has
authorization to do this so the first
thing we want to do in our login dot PHP
file is we want to start the session
so I'm going to do session start like so
and what I should mention is you want to
make sure that this is the first thing
that the browser sees if for example you
have an empty line and say you have a
space up here that will cause issues so
you want to make sure that sessions
start is the first thing in the file so
in this case is the first thing after
the opening PHP tag and a little bit of
description so we're going to start the
session we also want to include a couple
files so I'm going to include one config
dot PHP and we'll make sure that's in
the includes folder and then we also
want to include the connection to the
database like so okay so with that set
let's just make sure everything's
working as it should be
let's go ahead and also include our view
so the login dot PHP and that's what the
views folder i've saved this let's go
ahead and preview
Hanne one moment let's go back to our
config file and double check this ok so
it looks like it was a quick type on my
part we're gonna go ahead and fix that
and one other thing that I noticed that
I want to quickly fix as well so let's
go back to our login dot PHP view and we
need to change this line here so we're
going to close out the string add the
error variable and do it like so so we
have a string or variable and another
string let's go ahead and save that and
go back to login dot PHP and there we go
ok so it's not perfect just yet you can
ignore the notices for now we'll fix
that in a minute
but obviously it is displaying the right
file so let's go back to login let's
just double check this and we need to
make sure Styles is actually style dot
CSS there we go
okay so like I said not perfect but
things you're working let's go back here
and let's start off by setting a couple
of forum defaults so we can remove those
errors so we're gonna include let me
just go back and double check so we have
error alert input user input pass arrow
pass and air user
okay so error alert so
I'm and actually this is the input
okay
so now let's go ahead and preview this
file one more time and you'll notice all
the issues that we had have now gone
away okay so with that in place let's
think about the logic that we need the
first thing we need is right above here
let's go ahead and check if the form has
been submitted we want to go ahead and
process it so if is set I'm gonna check
for the post variable specifically you
submit and if it has been submitted we
want to go ahead and process the form
otherwise we want to display the form so
in that case we can just move this line
up here okay so now let's go ahead and
figure out how we're going to process
the form first thing we want to do is
make sure that the user name and
password are both filled in because
obviously we don't want the user
entering if there's nothing entered
there for the username and password
so if post I'm going to check if use
your name
actually if that does equal nothing or
if post password equals nothing we want
to go ahead and display an error so okay
in that case we want to do another quick
if statement so if the username is the
one that's blank we want to change the
error user and we want to make that
equal the required strength so let's so
and then we want to do the same thing to
the password
okay so assuming that one of these is
empty we also want to display and alert
to the user so error alert we're gonna
want to ask the user please fill in all
the required fields okay and then the
last thing you quickly want to check get
the values for user name and password
like so and then I'll actually I can
just copy the line down here and then
we're gonna read display the form back
to the user okay so let's go ahead and
save this and preview so we got our
login form
let's hit submit and lets me go back and
check this sorry for all the mistakes I
should have caught this earlier there we
go so take that out
fresh there we go
so we get an alert says please fill in
all required fields it indicates the
user which fields required and this one
obviously is blank because the user
filled something in and we can switch it
to land a random value here submit
you'll notice same exact thing changes
you'll get required and this one will
still sate still stay filled in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
