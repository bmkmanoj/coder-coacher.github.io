killer sites com here it is killer sighs
calm in this video I want to give you a
quick tour of cpanel 2012 aspersion just
came out very recently I'm recording
this in mid April 2012 if you don't know
and I'm assuming that you don't know
cpanel is a user interface a control
panel that a lot of hosting companies
use while they provided for you so that
you can go in there and do basic
administration task for your website so
you get to the cPanel control panel by
going to your domain name and in this
case this is a whole site I just left up
a failed project or a project I
abandoned called idea 22 anyway so how
do you get to cpanel if you have cpanel
installed and a lot of you do by the way
you just add colon 2082 and that will
launch this panel right here if you're
watching this a few years from now and
cpanel is updated and you're watching
this video it's going to look similar to
this it may have different color scheme
and so on but it's going to work the
same way because I've been using cPanel
for a long time now and though they
change things here and there this is
pretty much what it looks like so anyway
so what you do is you put in the
username and the password provided to
you by your hosting company and that
will allow your login so i'm going to
log in so here's the default cpanel
look and feel and we're just going to go
over a couple quick things I think some
of you will find interesting and that's
it so anyway so welcome new user you're
probably going to see this now there's
these getting started wizards and I'm
just going to click and say no for now
since i'm going to show you here so what
see parallels you do allows you to
basically make all kinds of changes to
your website and while terms of the
hosting so you could check your stats
you can set up stats you can add
databases you can add ftp access all
kinds of different things so i'm just
going to do a couple of basic things so
first one i want to look at his
statistics so let's scroll down here and
again depending on how your hosting
company has configured cpanel it may be
organized in a slightly different way
but it's pretty much the same so what
I'm going to do here I'm going to go
down to a w stats now this is a very
common web stats program that's built in
to cpanel and it's pretty good so let's
take a look at that real quickly and
i'll show you how to interpret so many
statistics i'm assuming for this video
as you may have guessed that you're
pretty new to hold web hosting thing and
so if you already a pro at hosting a
website this may be a bit too basic for
you that said let's go in let's click in
to VA w stats and take a look i have to
understand this is an older site so the
traffic is pretty small because i
haven't it's basically dead so so far in
april
you can see right at the top we've had
80 596 unique visitors and thirteen
thousand visits and 68,000 and change in
turn to page views and 130,000 hits out
and bandwidth we used up 825 gigs of
data really well 825 gigs of data so far
this month which surprises me actually
it's almost a terabyte of data are only
halfway through two months that's pretty
good yeah fortunately killer sites we
have a couple of dedicated server so it
doesn't come close to hitting our
bandwidth limits but anyway this is
interesting to look at so let's let me
minimize this so you can see the whole
thing all right so here's the a w status
of view for the site idea 22 so we went
over these things what I'm going to do
is I want to discuss the distinction
between unique visitors number of visits
and pages and hits a lot of people may
not know the difference so let's look at
them unique visitors is a measure a
unique visitor hitting your site a
unique visitors somebody who hasn't been
to your site within the last is an hour
last two hours whereas visits it's it's
it's a number of total visits to your
site so if somebody comes to your site
comes back to your site within an hour
or two hours that will register as a
visit but not as a unique visit a unique
visit somebody hasn't been to your site
at least an hour or so so it's not a
perfect measure of the actual number of
real people coming to your site but it
gives you a better idea as you can see
sixty percent of the unique visitors
come back within that time frame I have
to check it used to be an hour they may
have extend it to two hours but it's
really not that important in a big
picture whether it's one or two hours
what not all you gotta know is that
these are fairly unique individuals and
say fairly because if somebody comes
back in the month twice it'll be
registered as a new unique visitor but I
tell the entire web thing works anyway
so that's why when you hear big
statistics about how many visitors are
coming to a site and so on you have to
take that with a grain of salt because
of you know it's an imperfect system of
tracking people like that it's the
nature of the internet fortunately or
unfortunately depending on how you want
to look at it anyway so now you know
difference between unique visitors and
number of visits pages is actually a
fairly good indicator because it tells
you how many actual pages are being
loaded up in your site now these are
monthly statistics right so this is for
a month of April or although so far only
on the fifteenth of April so we're not
even halfway through a month so so far
almost 70 69 thousand pages on this site
have been viewed and they have been
viewed by 2596 unique visitors although
I suspect several of these people may
have come back more than once in a day
or especially in the month so there may
be only 5,000 or 6,000 real unique
individuals it's very hard to judge hit
is an interesting thing it's almost a
totally irrelevant statistic and should
be ignored and the reason that is
because hits a short for server
server of course references the web
server and a hit can be anything that a
browser requests from a web page so what
does that mean when a web browser goes
to a site so let's say you go to killer
size com the web browser basically says
hey I want to see the first home page of
killer sites com you know what movie
back up what may be simple let me make
it a little bit simpler let's say we're
going to get the killer sites and we go
we want to go the web designer page so
go web designer so this is the killer
sites roadmaps web designer dot PHP this
is the actual page web designer dot PHP
so when I clicked on that link the sent
me to this page I basically sent a
message to the server withholding killer
sites a semi the web designer page PHP
page that's called a request this is
basic basic web internet theory here
it's important to understand though so
when you send that request the server
like a server in a restaurant says okay
send this this this guy that's me us
surfing the web send the guy the page
now the page itself contains all kinds
of things contains CSS files one or two
contains some JavaScript it contains all
these images each of these images can
all these different images now the page
itself actually doesn't contain it like
a word document or like a word document
or a Photoshop document might contain an
image it actually just points to these
images but anyway that's a whole that's
all about web design HTML so I'm not
going to go down that anymore what you
got to take away from this part it's
basically when you load a page up each
and every single image in that page it's
considered a server hit every
icon every image every CSS file
associated with the page every
javascript file that may be associated
with the page these are all server hits
so this page even though it's one page
there's let's see we got one image we
got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 images nine images
ten images that's 10 hits right there
right because you got 10 images then the
page itself is a hit the web designer
dot PHP that's a hit so it's 11 hits I
know there's at least one CSS file so
that's 12 hits there's a javascript file
that 13 hits there's a second javascript
file that's 14 hits so there's one page
when it's requested by a single guy it's
loaded up that is actually hitting
registering 13 hits one page is 13 hits
now on another page I go to this page
here which is a different page it's got
a different number of icons this will
register maybe 15 hits so he's starting
to get the picture hits are very much an
irrelevant data point you shouldn't be
paying attention to really because it
really the hits count really be affected
by the page itself so what you want to
pay attention to his unique visitors
visit and pages that's pretty much it
anyway I'm going to get back into the
cpanel video I guess in part 2 there's a
lot more about statistics and web
statistics here what you should take
away will this end it off here is about
aw stats is a pretty capable web stats
program if you have cpanel backing up
your website that depends on your
hosting company this will come with
so it's pretty good and it gives you all
kinds of data where the traffic's coming
from CS this site for some reasons get
gets a lot of traffic from Russia and
Ukraine which kind of surprises me to be
a totally honest with you but anyway
this is an old site haven't looked at it
in years really and it gives you you
know detailed information about where
people are going in the site web pages
give you tells you what web what
operating systems are visiting site you
can see in this case windows is
seventy-five percent of traffic's that
tells okay I got to work on making sure
site looks good in Windows tells you
what browsers people are using etc etc
how much you see Google sending a
thousand people so far this month so
that probably means that google is
sending much as 3,000 visits a month
considering that the site has not been
updated in many years that's pretty
funny and even tells you the key phrases
or people are using to get to the site
so look at all the fishing lures and
that's funny in part 2 I will go into
more detail about cpanel and how cpanel
works and I hope you enjoyed this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
