sights calm now welcome to part two of
crud basics with MySQL I at the end of
part 1 this is where we were we had a
connection to the database with a
connect to DB dot PHP script and then we
also had a view dot PHP script which
displays the results from the database
and we included edit delete and add new
record links so we're gonna go ahead and
continue adding functionality to this
little minor web program first thing I
want to do is let's create functionality
to allow us to delete these records so
I'm gonna start by creating a new file
leak PHP and now basically all this is
gonna do is we want the user to click on
the delete it's gonna take the user to
this page very briefly it's going to
check and see what the ID value from the
URL holds if you notice if you hover
over this look down here at the bottom
you'll notice delete dot PHP it passes
an ID variable in the URL so let's get
started on this we're going to open up
with PHP tags and as usual with
basically all of our pages in this
application we're going to want to
include connected to the database
okay so that gives us access to the
database and then we also want to check
if the ID in the URL was set so first we
want to make sure that it's set and then
if it is we want to make sure that it's
Numan it is numeric
so this makes sure that no one can pass
in you know a string of text and numbers
and random things make sure that the
data is valid okay so if this is set and
the ID value is numeric you want to go
ahead and set an ID value okay
and if we some reason it's either not
set or is it numeric we're gonna want to
redirect the user so else we're gonna
redirect the user back to the view page
so header
okay so now let me go ahead and test
this quickly so you go back to our view
records we're gonna go ahead and click
on delete you'll see a blank page so
that's fine now if we go ahead and
remove this ID value off you'll notice
it redirects us back to the view page
okay so we have our ID value excuse me
secondly we're gonna want to delete the
record so this one is done with a
slightly different syntax from the view
dot PHP file that we created just a
little while ago
we're gonna use prepared statements with
MySQL I that gives us quite a bit of
additional security and let me show you
how to do that so we're going to do st
MT that stands for a statement and we
want to prepare a statement so we're
going to use the prepare function and
within that we have our actual query so
when delete from players
we're ID equals question mark limit 1
now there is a pretty major difference
here between standard MySQL syntax
specifically what's up with the question
mark okay so basically those question
marks separate the Esk the MySQL logic
from the database excuse me from the
data the question marks are placeholders
until the next line so in that case
we're gonna first of all put this in an
if statement so if this is valid we're
gonna go ahead and delete the record
otherwise we'll just display an error
okay so now within this assuming this is
valid in the next line we actually want
to clarify what this will equal so
that's done with STM t and bind okay so
this is a little bit tricky and I'll do
my best to explain it so what this is
doing is we're gonna go ahead and delete
from players where ID equals question
mark limit one so this question mark is
going to be replaced by this line and
bind program basically tells the MySQL
what value will be in here so we're
gonna pass it two things we're gonna
pass it the type of data that's supposed
to appear in here in this case we're
going to pass it an integer and that's
done by adding an eye there are a couple
different ways to do things here you do
I for an integer as for a string etc you
can check the MySQL eye manual online
for more information on that
so we're going to pass it an integer and
specifically we want to pass it the ID
value so the value that we got from the
URL right here so now that this
parameter had been bound to the query we
can go ahead and execute that that's
done with execute function
and then finally we want to close out
the connection close out the statement
excuse me
okay so that we'll finish this section
and lastly we want to redirect the user
back to the view page okay so to go over
this one more time we're using prepared
statements and mysqli this is the
statement the question mark gets
replaced by this line well it's set to
the ID this is important because it
preserves additional security prevents
things like SQL injection which is
pretty important and you don't want
outside users being able to mess with
your application so I believe that's it
and I guess the last thing we want to do
here is we want to close out the
database connection itself we do that
with the close function
okay so let's go ahead back to our page
and preview it I'm gonna go ahead and
delete this record and let me go back
and check this one moment excuse me it's
that there we go and you'll notice that
we can now delete records okay so now
secondly now that we have delete working
let's go ahead and work on adding new
records to the database I'm going to
start by creating a new file I call it
records dot PHP and I'm gonna make this
file have two parts to its functionality
first of all it's gonna be able to add
new records to the database and also
edit new records and I'm combining this
into one file because both of these
functionality need the same basic
requirements they both need to form
they're going to ask for the same sort
of information so it's much easier to
have this information all in one file
rather than splitting them up across
multiple files in case we need to edit
things in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
