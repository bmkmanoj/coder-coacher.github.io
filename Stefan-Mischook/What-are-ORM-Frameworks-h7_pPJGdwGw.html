PHP comm it's been a while since my last
video I've been busy with a move and you
know busy with other work I guess anyhow
in this video tutorial I want to discuss
arm frameworks ORM and that's short for
object relational mapping so what we're
going to cover in this video which is
for beginners people new to the concept
of arm is first of all what they are
what they do when and why you'd want to
use them and by the way I'm glancing
down here because I got notes so and
finally I'm going to look at a couple
very quickly and look at a couple of
warm frameworks that are available to us
in the PHP world and I'm a mention one
that's not available to the PHP world
but is very important anyhow so an arm
framework as I just said is short for
object relational mapping so what these
frameworks are basically are just cold
they're software written in an
object-oriented language like PHP or
Java c-sharp etc and what these
frameworks do is basically wrap around
relational databases they create a
bridge of communication between a
relational database like MySQL SQL
server and the programming language in
our case PHP so let me run a quick
little scenario and I think will help
clarify what this thing does so let's
say you have a simple database with two
tables clients and products so you would
take your own framework and you have
pointed at this database and every arm
framework has its own way of doing
things
some have to be configuring XML files
some use something called reflection and
they're able to basically scan your
database and generate its own stuff
anyway
however your framework and particular
happens to work in the end what you have
are a series of objects as a No
object oriented objects in the case of
PHP we've of course it would be PHP
objects and these objects would map the
various tables in your database so what
you as a programmer would then do is use
these objects to interact with the
database as opposed to having to write
straight SQL code and doing all that
manual connecting in PHP of course you
you know the manual stuff would be using
MySQL libraries already PEO libraries
found in PHP the four big advantages of
using an arm to our long awesome I have
written down here so number one an arm
tool will harmonize data types between
your SQL database and language you
happen to be writing your web
applications in or your applications it
if you've ever worked with databases
before you know that tables when you're
creating your tables each of the columns
each of the fields have to be given data
types you know int small into blob
varchar' char etc now what the arm tool
will do is it will deal with the
inconsistencies between the datatypes
and your programming language so since
PHP is a dynamic language to begin with
it's maybe less of an issue but with
Java for instance where it's strongly
type order that you have to declare your
variables you have to declare the types
that they are whether it's inter string
small ant etc what the arm tool will do
is that it will translate the data types
and harmonize them for you on the fly so
when you use your arm objects to
interact with the database whether
you're saving data or updating data you
know etc the arm objects will take care
of that the data type conversions for
you on the fly so you don't have to
think about it another advantage of
using an arm tool is that it basically
shields you from much of the SQL code
you have to write otherwise so if you
ever done any
semi complex projects in any whether it
be PHP or Java or whatnot you know that
if you start getting into some some SQL
deep into it they can get pretty hairy
switch when you start doing some fancy
stuff in the case of using an arm you
would just have to interact with the arm
objects which you know in the case of
PHP based system they would just be paid
PHP based objects so it's a lot cleaner
so for instance if you looked at some
pseudocode let's say the arm framework
generated a client object for your
client table you just have to
instantiate that object and call it save
method for instance so you might say
client new you know Mike line equals new
client and you add your data in with the
constructor when you're constructing the
object initially and you would call a
save method of the client object
assuming that you want to created a save
method it could be some other method
name the basically would saved data to
the database and that's all you'd have
to do you would have to you would have
to you write SQL code and start wrapping
for data types etc which brings me to
another advantage of the arm framework
is that you won't have to deal worried
about SQL injection attacks and cleaning
up your data as it goes into the
framework the framework itself will
handle that as well so it's pretty cool
finally I state this last advantage with
a certain reluctance but I'll state it
anyway one of the things that people
thought about using an arm is that you
can much more easily switch from one
relational database to another with your
application since the Orang framework
will adapt itself accordingly and you
won't have to mess your with your code
now I say this with great reluctance
because in theory it sounds great and
practice
it's not necessarily that great and
second of all in you know the 10-15
years I've been playing with these kind
of technologies well web development and
application development I've in only one
occasion have I seen where we've
actually changed the database on an
application it's a very rare advance so
I'm not sure how important that really
is so when should you use an arm
framework that's an important question
well based on my personal experience it
really comes down to this as your
project becomes more complex the more
important arm throwing work can be if
you're dealing with relatively simple
PHP applications five tables or less
five six seven queries and it's just you
and some other guy writing the code then
arm would be overkill on the other hand
if you're doing things like if you've
got a system that has ten plus tables 10
plus queries and you're three or more
programmers the arm framework may be
something worth looking into because it
could save you a lot of time
finally arm frameworks are very
effective very useful they've matured
quite a bit in the last decade
nonetheless it's they don't solve all
your problems in that the arm objects
will probably handle 80 to 90% of your
queries to the database but sometimes
you can have to drop down into SQL or
some sql-like query language and a lot
of warm framework will provide something
like that for you because sometimes it
just doesn't work so if you think by
using an arm framework you're going to
be free of SQL code for rest of your
life that's not going to happen you're
still going to need to do it sometimes
but nonetheless when you implement a
good arm it will
it will save you a lot of time if your
project has got some scale and size to
it I hope you liked this video as I get
more settled into my new place here I
plan to put out many more on a regular
basis I'm Steph miss chuck with killer
