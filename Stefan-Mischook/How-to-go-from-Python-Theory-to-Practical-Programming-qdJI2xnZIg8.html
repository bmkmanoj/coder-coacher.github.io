questions that are put to me on YouTube
somebody asked me about Python and I
can't find the question through the
YouTube app here so I'm gonna go off of
memory so essentially we have somebody
who did a bunch of Python courses not
mine but other courses and still felt
after spending all this time and money
that they didn't know how to actually
write Python code
I guess beyond simple things they're
kind of lost let me just say two things
about that
that could be because of the type of
code training you did in Python I don't
know what you did it could be like I've
seen so many times or they just teach
you little snippets you know even I deal
with the broad picture is it could be
that you've done some project-based
courses where they teach you the walk
through the tutorial walkthrough was
done but they don't actually teach you
why they're doing things so it's not
just to how you need to know you need to
know but why I don't know what the
situation is with this particular guy so
they asked about my course well my
course bridge that gap between knowing
snippets of Python code and actually
being able to do something my general
philosophy about learning to code is
based on my own experience that aren't
learning to code and being a
professional developer and having
trained so many people over the years
what I do is I teach the foundation the
core principles of programming so in
Python I'll be teaching the basic syntax
what it's about the versions of Python
where Python is use and I run through
many many little tasks if you will with
Python I'll show you how comes together
so I'll come into some detail explaining
the how and the why then pull out
broader sense I don't have any expansive
big projects in my course simply because
I didn't feel there was a need to
because the whole in the market in terms
of the educational market was
covering those foundational principles
properly and giving people the
perspective I just described once you
have that that unlocks the door if you
will that opens up the whole world of
Python and all the Python tutorials that
you could find there's so many free
Python tutorials online that are fine
are good for people who have this
foundational knowledge that's tough
thing but it's hard to come across now
you may have put it together if you've
done five or ten courses I don't know
that's why I offer money-back guarantee
on the courses cuz not you know one shoe
does not fit all sizes right you have to
see if it works for you what most people
come away with 99.8% is that they they
find that doing my courses my python
course or how many courses they come
away with a deeper knowledge of
programming code they understand the
howl and the wife once you have that
then you can go and just choose whatever
direction you want to go into in terms
of Python so let's say you've you've
done a basic Python of course you
understand the foundations you know
about the versions of Python you'll
bounce stalling it and configuring it
you understand how the code is layout
you understand the basic constructs
within any programming languages
functions and methods and variables and
collection type C and then how to trap
user inputs etc etc from there what I
would suggest is you then you choose
whichever direction you want to get into
so let's say you want to get into Python
AI you want to do AI programming then
just type in Python AI tutorial and and
you'll find a dozen tutorials that are
free that will just walk you
step-by-step but with with those
tutorials like is all that foundation
training that makes those tutorials
approachable so if you've done my course
also those walkthroughs will become very
approachable very understandable and
you'll be able to take care of things
with no problems there's another example
let's say you want to get into Python
web app development so you have some
options there Django is the most popular
web framework and flask is another one
more lightweight now unlike PHP where
PHP just write some code and you throw
it up on to a server and it runs with
Python it's a general-purpose language
so you have to provide a framework
around it to make it work on the web
although you can do Python CGI but
generally speaking you're gonna be using
a framework like Django or flask so
again once you know your foundations
then all you have to do is go to the
Django homepage and it's this really
quick start guide 1 2 3 4 5 now if
you're doing Python web of course you're
gonna need to know the web languages as
html5 css3 and a bit of JavaScript and
then you can just approach that and just
do some some of those tutorials and go
from a there's ed with the tutorial so
let's say you wanted to do Python web
development is you do one of these
Django install tutorials and just do a
basic crud operation tutorial with
Django and you take it from there if you
want to put in a shopping cart you can
type in the shopping cart Django and
you'll find the shopping cart in Django
and just grab it put it in which you
have to understand as a professional
developer as a developer especially in
early years first two three years you're
constantly learning things as projects
come up and that's why I always
emphasize learn those basics and
foundations really well that's why I
emphasize that and teach that because
that's where it's lacking in the market
everybody's very tutorial centric or
snippet centric and I provide that
foundation so whether or not my Python
course will help you having somebody
who's already done five or six Python
course of course is depends on the
structure of the particular course that
you've done or the courses that you've
done if you're feeling a little lost and
you're already comfortable with the
basics of Python others you feel that
you are that I would just find any
number of walkthrough tutorials in
Python and whatever direction you want
to go in AI machine learning or robotics
or Python web
or server automation I think you
mentioned is some sort of server
automation stuff this just do it just do
it you have to understand but you're not
you're never gonna come into any job
while it's not over for a few years
knowing everything from A to Z there's
always something you're gonna have to
figure out and learn you know at this
points they've been doing things for
twenty years becomes the web app
development they've done so much it's
rare going to come across anything new
nonetheless in the early stages I was
always learning things on the go and
what I discovered back in those days is
that whenever I ran to some bigger
problems with any type of work I was
involved with the problems were
generally speaking a result of me not
having a fundamental grasp of some
foundational concept that was a key to
whatever it was I was doing back in
those days the other thing that would
run you would run into problems was just
the fact that the technologies were
immature things wouldn't work the way
they were supposed to work that has
largely gone away especially with the
mature platforms anyway I hope that
helps just keep at it man just you get
you got to stretch your neck out a
little bit when you're going from
beginner to a professional developer
why don't we buddy stretch your neck you
gotta be willing to go out there and you
know go into the darkroom go into that
area where you're not exactly sure about
everything don't worry if you have your
foundations you'll be able to figure it
out fairly easily that's pretty much it
