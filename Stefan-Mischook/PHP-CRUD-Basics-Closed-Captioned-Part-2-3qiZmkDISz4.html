database established let's go ahead and
create a file that will be able to view
the records that are in the database so
I'm going to create a new file we call
it view dot PHP and I'm going to start
out by just filling it with the standard
HTML head and body tags when I put the
title add few records and in the body
section again i'm going to add your
records okay and then underneath this h1
let's open up some PHP tags and the
first thing we want to do here is we
want to include the kinect DB file that
we just created so include
that's going to include the connection
to the database and now secondly we want
to run a query so that we can access the
database and return the records that we
need so that's done like this so result
equals mysql i query now within this
section is the query itself so we're
going to do select star from players
photo by ID so this is going to select
all the columns from the players table
and order them by the ID value so if we
briefly go back here excuse me so it's
going to return this and it'll be
ordered by ID one will be first five
will be last okay so we have the Select
statement we're going to want to put it
it within an if statement
like so this will return true if the
query is fine where false if there's
some sort of issue so down here I'm
going to echo air and I'm going to ask
to display the nice clothes I arrow
message okay so that's in place so we
have a connection to the database we
have the query and we have an error
statement if for some reason it doesn't
work the final thing we want to do down
here we want to close the connection
that's done with the clothes function
okay so open query closed now within
this section we want to actually make
sure that we have results to display and
then if so we need to display them so
that's going to be done with if
so we're going to check if the number of
our tote that excuse me the number of
rows that our query returned is larger
than zero if so we're going to display
them otherwise will display a message
i'm going to say the results to display
okay and then finally within this
section we want to actually display the
data that we've pulled from the database
so in that case i want to display this
data in a table and i'm going to want to
start out by echo in table tag and
within this we're going to do some basic
styling i'm going to add border equals
one and so that'll give us a little bit
of basic styling and we're going to
close that the table tag now within this
we want to set up some headers so open
the table row and start a table header
with in this first header we want the ID
value
in the second header we're going to want
the first name and finally in the third
header we want the last name and then we
want to close out that round ok so
that's set and now within this section
we want to display the results that we
got from the database so we're going to
do a while loop and while Rho equals the
result
now each time this while loop loops it's
going to set up this row value array
variable excuse me and we're going to
echo out table girl
and close out the table and then we're
going to echo out a couple to table data
cells this is going to include the data
that we got from the database we want to
include the ID so that's going to be
done with grow ID then we close out that
table data cell and then basically it's
a matter of just copying this line
pasting it two more times so first one
we got the ID then we want to get the
first name and finally the last name let
me save this and let's preview what's
line 32 okay so that should fix it okay
um one thing I wanted to point out I
have gotten this issue before it's an
error message it says no index used I
did a little bit of research on it and
it seems like it isn't that big of a
deal you can disable that message simply
instead of reporting all errors you just
report error specifically there we go
okay so let's open this up one more time
there we go so we have the ID table
header a first name and the last name
and all of the data for my database is
stored below so just in case let me go
back over this one more time so we
connect to the database and then we go
ahead and run our query so we select all
data from the database and you order it
by ID and if we have results display
we're going to go ahead and display them
and we display them in a while loop and
each time this loop represents one row
in the database and we grab the ID and
the first name and the last name and
display them on the page if there aren't
any results to display we display a
message or if the query is something
wrong with it somehow we display an
error
message so that's the basics of this
let's do a couple more tweaks in
preparation for the second part of this
tutorial first of all I'm going to want
to add two additional table headers here
that's because we want to add a couple
links we want to be able to edit and
delete these records from the database
so I'm go ahead and paste these two more
times so we're going to start and we're
going to set up a link and we want this
link to go to the Edit Page so we're
going to call records got PHP and we're
going to pass an ID value so that when
we visit this page PHP knows what record
we want to edit so records that PHP ID
equals and then we want to get the ID
and then we'll close off this a tag and
put it and then pretty similarly we want
to start off here this is going to be
delete so delete that PHP ID equals ID
and then close out the link
late okay so that's set up our table and
then the final thing I want to do is
down here after we finish our PHP stuff
let's also add a link and we're going to
add a link to records PHP and this is
going to add a new record okay so let's
go ahead and preview this and you'll
notice now we have edit and delete links
if you check down here at the bottom
you'll notice that the edit and delete
links have an ID associated with them
this is ID of 1i t of two etc and that
matches this ID and then we also have a
link to add new records if we need to
okay so that's the end of this part of
the tutorial please follow along i'll be
doing a second part discussing how to
make this edit delete and create new
record functionality actually work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
