that's left is to build out our
controllers and build out our
authorization object so I'm going to
work on the authorization object next we
want this object to contain functions
related to authorization basically login
logging out checking if a person is
logged in so that's what I'm going to
start working on so like the other
template object I'm going to start with
a class and call this one off and it's
going to start out we're going to use
two private variables and I have a
private database which I'll talk about
in a second and I'm going to have a
private salt and I'm going to set that
to a value so I'm going to pull from our
temp PHP file
so I'm going to grab these characters
copy and paste them into our
authorization object now let's go down a
little bit I'm gonna start out
our usual constructor and we're going to
be using the database PHP a include to
create the data to create a database
connection and we need to be able to get
access to this and by default the scope
of the database variable is set up in
such a way that we don't have access to
it within this authorization object
however what we can do is we can
reference that by using global database
so now we could have access to the
database object that we created within
database PHP and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to set this database equals
database so now instead of having to use
the global database line in every single
line of this object we can assign the
database variable up here to our
database object and all of our functions
can access the database now now below it
let's add a couple functions the first
function I want to build out is a
function called validate login and we're
going to provide it a username and a
password and this function will return
true or false depending on if the login
is valid so what we'll need to do is
we'll need to make a connection to the
database which we do using databases PHP
we'll need to access that database check
the variables that we were provided with
in user and pass check that against the
database return true or false so let's
start out by creating the database query
so if stst mt4 a statement equals this
database preparer and I'm using a MySQL
I prepared statement for security so
we're going to do select star from users
where username equals question mark and
password equals question mark
and otherwise else if it can't prepare
the statement for some reason maybe it
can't access the database or something
I'm simply going to use a die statement
and I'm going to say error could not
prepare my SQL I statement and you could
potentially include in your template
object the ability to show error
messages
perhaps error page that could have this
error message in it but for the sake of
this tutorial I think I'm going to keep
things simple and I'll just use a die
message so now assuming we were able to
prepare this statement correctly let's
go ahead do statement by end program and
the bind prim refers to these two
question marks and the first value is
going to hold SS because these two will
be strings and then a comma we're going
to pass in user and then finally the
password which is the md5 of our pass
plus our salt
like so and then we're going to execute
the statement we're going to store the
result and now we will check how many
rows are a turned so if the statement
has a number of rows over zero we know
that it did find the user successfully
so we're going to close out our
statement with a statement close and
we're going to turn true otherwise we'll
have a failure message
we're going to close out the statement
as we did above but this time return
false okay so that's that function we
have just one or two more minor things
this is basically the meet of this
particular object and let's do one other
function for check login status and it's
going to be a pretty simple function
it's just going to check if a session
variable that we're going to call logged
in so if that is set
so if that's set we want to return true
otherwise we want to return false and
the last thing we want to have a logout
function which is pretty simple just
going to destroy the session whoopsie
and then start it again
so basically these two lines it'll
destroy the session which means it will
remove any session logged in variables
and then it will start it again which is
important if we need to display any
alert messages that use the session
variable so I'm going to save this and
this particular object is done so the
next step is to show you how to work
with the controllers and actually access
the template and the authorization
objects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
