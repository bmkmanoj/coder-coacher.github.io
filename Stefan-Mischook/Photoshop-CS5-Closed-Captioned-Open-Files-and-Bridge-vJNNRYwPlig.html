creating a brand new file inside a
Photoshop and we also talked about what
was going on inside of our Photoshop
environment however what I want to talk
to you now is is how to open up some
files and as you can see there's a
number of different ways that we can
actually do that for example we can just
come to file open if you're following
along with me you can take the source
files that I've provided for you and
they contain a number of images inside
of an images folder and as you can see
here they're very simple number of
images these are all images which belong
in the public domain and hence you'll
see some of them that are older some of
them that are a little bit newer but
they're all public domain images so
they're free to use and as you can see
we can certainly click on these images
and have a little preview here that's
working inside of the Macintosh
environment however even if you were on
a PC environment you'll be able to see
that but notice these are just for
images they don't really say anything
about the files themselves for example
this is a JPEG if I had an AI file an
adobe illustrator file or if I had a PSD
file a Photoshop document we wouldn't be
able to see the preview until we
actually open up the file so there's a
couple of things that we can do to open
up images this is one way but certainly
if I wanted to I could also explore some
other ways of doing this for example I
could open up Adobe bridge and as you
can see here it says browse in bridge
notice also that if you're working
inside a Photoshop there's a little
button here that says launch bridge and
there's also another one here that says
launch mini bridge as well as over here
there's a little mini bridge button also
and if we were to access any of these I
could click on browse for files just
like this you'll notice what it's doing
its opening up Adobe bridge and if I
were to look at the open files that I
have
here you'll see that Adobe bridge is one
of the open files so whether you open up
Adobe bridge is a separate file or
whether you're working inside of bridge
itself the mini bridge these are all
different ways that you can view and
open up files for example i'm just going
to launch bridge and here is Adobe
bridge cs5 and it's a really nice
application that allows you to work with
different documents and work with
different files for example if we went
to our desktop you would see our source
files inside of the images folder and
what you may notice here is the simple
fact that we have a number of these
images available as you can also see I
can scroll down at the bottom here to
make these images be larger or smaller
depending on what I want to be looking
at you'll also notice that there is a
thumbnail grid that you can click on
there's also this area here where you're
viewing things as thumbnails that's
default you can view content details if
you wish and notice I can make this a
lot smaller so that we can see what that
looks like and you can scroll through
all of your images there's also
information here which is just viewing
it as a list and that's all great but i
think the thumbnail view is probably
going to be the easiest one for us to
see at the moment and you'll notice that
you know all of these areas are easily
scaled as you can see here you may or
may not notice that you can also take
the content that you do happen to have
available and one of the things you can
do is to select any of these images if
you wanted to open up one of these
images what you could do in that case is
to just briefly be able to take the
entire folder and you'll be able to
double click it and that would open up
any of these files so for example if I
were to double click this petri dish
file here you would see that it opens up
inside Photoshop with no difficulty
whatsoever if you go back to
this particular area let's say there's a
bunch of these files that we want to
sort of collapse a little bit and what I
mean by that is to sort of separate them
into a separate group for example I'll
select one I'll shift click to select
all of these sort of older World War One
World War two photographs if I right
click on it you'll notice that one of
the things that we can do is to stack
this you can group this as a stack when
I say that what you'll notice is now
I've got five images that are all
grouped up here and what that does is it
allows you to open and collapse it just
by clicking on the number 5 if i right
clicked on this and said stack ungroup
from stack we could do that if you
enable the onion skin you can sort of
see you know a number of images on top
of each other but i don't really like it
that way but nevertheless you could do
that if I wanted to I could also drag
more images into that stack all right so
all of these are me pictures that i have
here whether you right click on them
originally or whether you just drag them
into an existing stack right now as you
can see so I've got 11 images that I've
got open and if I wanted to I could
double click this and open up all 11 at
once inside of Photoshop for example
I'll click OK and bang as you can see
here you've got a number of different
images that are now all available if you
want to scroll through those images you
can see here there's this little arrow
on the side and that allow you to you
know jump through the different images
as you can see and among another number
of things that you can do is to actually
roll through those as you will notice
here what you can do is to close one of
these files or you can close all of
these files in one shot just by pressing
command w and this is the Alt key and if
you do that just as quickly as those
ones were opened and there now closed
and what you can also
see here is that you'll be able to
select any of these you'll be able to
collapse them into the elements that you
have here if these were photoshopped
documents PSD's in fact let's let's also
take note that if we're working with PSD
or AI files and instead of just seeing
the icon for illustrator or Photoshop
you'd actually see what the files look
like so it's a really nice tool to work
with and there's a lot that you can do
with it although all I'm really showing
you are some of the basics that you have
here so you can work with it inside a
bridge or as I mentioned if you're
inside a photoshop you can also work
with this little mini bridge right here
and what you'll notice is depending on
where you are located and as I'm
pointing to that file on the desktop you
can look at the preview on any one of
these which you can make big larger or
smaller of course then you can just
double click it open up that file so
salt and pepper is opened up here and
you can see that we've got a number of
different works that we can easily
access and work with if I were to press
my F key we'd notice that you know we
don't have that floating window we're in
that screen now again where we only see
the image so all of these things are
really useful and really helpful when
you're thinking about opening up images
for work inside of Illustrator well now
that we know how to open up the images
let's continue with those images and see
about working with some other tools and
shortcuts and those are going to be
zooming and moving in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
