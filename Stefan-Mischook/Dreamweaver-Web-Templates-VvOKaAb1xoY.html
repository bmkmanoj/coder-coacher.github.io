going to answer a question I was just
recently put to me will not put to me
put the form anyway real quick if you're
using Dreamweaver somebody wanted to
know about three column layouts
templates and dreamweaver to get to
dreamweaver template it's pretty simple
now if you have this welcome screen on
usko hit you hit more and it will take
you to this new document dialog and you
got the templates write HTML templates
HTML thank you know three column fix
they're all here so you select it create
you can add different options in terms
of the doctype on transitional look
stricter etc if you don't understand doc
types and CSS and so on you have to look
at our Dreamweaver course or web design
basics course another option you can go
to the templates you can get some stuff
in here as well and yeah so there's
different there's also blank templates
so you go HTML blank templates there's
all these different options you have
available for you in terms of templates
in Dreamweaver what I would suggest is
that you look through them all there's
the code that was used to create these
templates are pretty good so it's a good
way to learn how to create for instance
three-column fixed layout or three calm
liquid layout and so of course CSS
compliant aces new these are new school
templates rather than whole school this
is with Dreamweaver cs5 if you're using
an older version of dreamweaver the
templates are there you can access them
as well by going into file let me just
move this into the view here so you go
into file new and you're going to get
this template box as well this new
document dialog box as well those
different options if you're using a very
old version of dreamweaver you'll find
that the 10
blades they're there but they're not as
advanced in terms of the code base I
believe it's been a while since
dreamweaver cs4 the templates have gone
pretty good if meaning their modern if
you've got an older version of
dreamweaver cs3 or MX you may find the
templates you might find some HTML table
based layout templates which are not
desirable anymore so there you have it
if you're looking for templates in
dreamweaver let's say again we go to
file new and you can go into it a
different templates check them out like
I'll just load one up I'll go I want to
call them fix right sidebar go XHTML
transitional no I want the HTML for
strict as CSS you want to put it in the
head you can create external file
obviously put in a head for now and
that's it so we will create and here is
our page so I just uh just change a
little bit here house till their sides
rocks I'm biased of course and we just
go file save and it's going to say where
do you want to save us a oh so just give
it right here on the route to the site
so i call it simply dot HTML and if you
look here and our file view where's our
template and we can edit it you look at
the code here's a cold on the left-hand
side go to school pure code you see a
Dream Weaver has inserted
our CSS code you used to generate this
template right here now you'll notice a
lot of CSS comments that Dreamweaver has
inserted to teach us why certain CSS is
use a certain way to create the template
so it's kind of a good way to learn
about layout techniques with CSS because
at this time in 2011 though a lot of the
CSS layout problems have been resolved
it's still there's still some work
around code in their meaning code that
may not be intuitive by nature and so
you have to understand why they were
doing certain things fortunately with
the event of html5 we're going to see an
HTML compliant browsers and still not
there yet in 2011 early 2011 but I say
within a year too we're going to start
being able to use html5 layout
techniques and css3 and it's going to be
much much easier to lay out and create
pH pages that you know have all the
different structures that we like
structures being one column two column 3
column centerline right aligned with it
whatever and there you have it so I
encourage you you know as a way to learn
HTML go into templates and an to learn
CSS injury and we were check them out if
using an older version of dreamweaver
especially if you're using MX or cs3 you
will find that some of the templates are
dated and they're going to teach you
old-school techniques so you want to
stick to css-based templates and you
want to go with for now HTML 4.01 strict
I remember for time XHTML is all the
rage but that was kind of dumb because
designers who don't really understand
programming we're telling everybody he
was extra HTML and you know basically
rag over HTML 4.01 strict and when html5
becomes widely used
and that's what you're going to be using
going to be using html5 but I have to
save that for another video because
right now html5 is something that you're
going to use really for ipad iphone and
android development nope tablet PCs and
tablet devices rather and phones and so
on you can't really use html5 today in
public web because still the majority of
web browsers that people are using today
do not read html5 yet so we have to hold
on but it's coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
