installed if you go to killer sites calm
and you click on the top menu rate on
the right hand side forums it takes you
here now we just install this today and
so there's a little be more organization
and more skinning to be done
remember I had basically lockdown this
for my year or so ago so there's no
activity although we do get a decent
amount of traffic on it still so I think
I'm gonna revive it because I want to be
able to give give the community more
community capabilities YouTube's great
but the community features suck so with
this particular forum you'll be able to
set up your own account you're gonna
have your own location there's a rating
system where members are ranked you can
communicate between each other privately
it's really pretty easy now this is a
new version of the software so they did
a huge revamp and over the next week or
two I'm gonna be cleaning things up
organizing like some of the forum
categories here are gonna have to be
removed like expression web flash that
man is gonna throw in the archive and we
will be adding other categories
especially the business-oriented a
career oriented categories and I plan on
adding I hate these that what exclusive
but I'll just gonna be putting up videos
here and comments here and guys here but
I'm not gonna be putting a house up
elsewhere yes I want to build the
community back up again I had a lot of
fun and I've have one moderator and I
had another person I offer to moderate
and I'm sure some of the old members
from kill sites because this is a forum
but was first started in 2008 actually
before that and I'm not sure maybe
there's been three versions of the forum
I had a very old Java version and I shut
it down because the app was this really
crap and then eventually we got to this
so anyhow I welcome you guys to sign up
the great thing I added in this Facebook
sign-in now this took me like an hour to
the debug because Facebook had changed
100 a policy so I had to go into a sub
submenu to figure that out I'll do a
video on that to help people out because
it's a real pain
and yes you can just sign it with
Facebook if you want or you can sign in
directly right in here it's up to you
all right I'll see you guys on the forum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
