that it now affords us the possibility
of implementing the at font-face rule
what that means for us as designers or
anybody in fact is the simple notion
that you can now choose from so many
such a vast array of different fonts
that you can use in your projects and
that's going to be really an eye-opening
experience for you especially if you
found that the traditional web safe
fonts were rather limiting and they can
be that's true but nevertheless what I
will be talking about is how we can
implement these new elements in place
now there had been advances in working
with web-based fonts and as I'll show
you here there's a website at font-face
face off and it's basically just a list
of like you know different companies
like for example fonts.com and you'll
notice you can go to these places and
they have all kinds of fonts that you
can work within and use but for the most
part these different companies like font
spring example ask you to purchase fonts
that you're going to be using and some
of these are great you know they're
there are non traditional type foundries
it's not linno type here or even adobe
com for that matter but there's some
pretty good choices when it comes to
working with fonts online in a web-based
environment nevertheless let's say you
don't want to get into any kind of paid
scheme or anything like this you just
want to be working with any number of
free fonts that are available now
there's a lot of great places where you
can find fonts I personally do like the
league League of moveable type
when you go to their website you'll see
that they offer you a number of fonts
and they're completely free I think it's
a really good thing that they're doing
and giving typographers the opportunity
to spread their work and get a little
more renowned and there's some really
nice ones in here actually so you can
check them out and see what they look
like and what if we want to now start
using some of these and by the way
League of movable type has some really
nice ones but you know they are still
rather limited in in respect to Allah
the different fonts that are out there
and available well one of the best
places that I can draw your attention to
is a website called font squirrel and
this is it right here and why is this a
great website well for a number of
reasons number one if you have a font
that you own and you wish to convert it
into many different formats that will be
supported in an online environment they
happen to have something called a font
face generator and we're going to use
that in just a second and I'll show you
how and aside from that though they also
have a number of really cool fonts that
are available some of them through they
themselves by the way if you didn't
already recognized font spring brings us
font squirrels so I guess this is a
means of their you know using font
squirrel which is a free website and you
can use it completely as it says here
one hundred percent free for commercial
use but you know it's good advertising
for their paid for service as well
nevertheless as I mentioned this is
completely free and if you look at for
example most downloaded you'll see that
there's tons of different fonts that you
can peruse and look at and you know have
some fun with there's some really nice
ones out there some are maybe not as
great as others certainly but hey what
do you want for free right so choose the
ones you like best and especially the
ones that look best here are some newly
added ones and I've included some of
these in the font folder that you're
going to be working with
you know just to see what they look like
Lobster and OSP just because they were
new here you'll also see font kits where
you don't have to go through the
generator there's just a bunch of fonts
that have all of them already converted
but nevertheless I've downloaded one of
the fonts I believe it's in just off the
home section here see musea is a nice
one too the slab or not but here's one
chunk 5 just to show you a nice chunky
slab serif as we have right here it's
from the League of moveable type and if
you were to download this OTF open type
format that's something that you know
you could be able to use on your
computer your desktop that's not a
problem but let me just go to my desktop
for a second and show you there it is
chunk 5 right and my OTF open type
format it's showing me all of the glyphs
that are in there but only using one OTF
file is not enough we need to support
many different versions of this
particular file in order to make it work
so that every single browser will be
able to see chunk 5 the way I want them
to so part of what this is all about is
the offer that font squirrel has for us
through its generator and by the way
this is information from fonte spring
that people make font squirrel you'll
see that we are going to be delivered
truetype woff eot and SVG font formats
and what you can see here in our font
face declaration it shows you that you
know in earlier versions of ie eot are
the only one that's going to work same
thing with ie9 although woff is accepted
as well you'll see that true type is
accepted for most browsers and SVG is
accepted for a number of browsers as
well right and this woff will also be
available the emerging standard format
from other things here we're working
with mobile platforms including the
iPhone and the iPad the SVG so when we
go through the
aunt squirrel at font-face generator
this is the information that we're going
to receive so I'm going to go to the
font face generator and after I've
downloaded that chunk file to my desktop
I'm going to add this particular file so
here it is chunk 5 all right now I'm
going to agree that yes this is totally
legal and eligible for web embedding so
I click on that and then your download
button appears and that should in just a
second download into your appropriate
downloads folder there you go so if I
now want to see that information I'm
just going to go here to my downloads
folder I'll just open that up you'll see
here it says web font kit there's a
bunch of information in here some really
nice stuff and as you can see here it
gives you specimen files but these are
just really you know CSS information
what you really want to look for is hey
let's look at this demo HTML file if I
open this up let me just shut that down
look what it shows you chunk 5 Roman and
it shows you at different sizes what
chunk 5 will look like that's pretty
amazing some really nice things there
and there's a sample layout obviously I
wouldn't use this for body but I kind of
want to use it for my h1 so we can see
that while is a display font this nice
slabby chunk 5 serif slab serif looks
pretty good however be aware i'm looking
at this on a mac and you'll see that the
anti-aliasing is automatically set up on
a mac but in Windows Windows rendering
you'll see that things with you know
rounded edges like this oftentimes will
produce kind of chunky effects so it's
up to you to decide whether or not you
want to be working with this some are
better than others certainly but be
aware of that windows rendering right in
some of the paid services you have auto
hinting which sort of removes that but
that's why you're paying for those
services glyphs and languages shows you
all the different glyphs that are
available some installing
information right and we're going to use
this installing information as well
actually I'm just going to copy this
information right here and then you can
work with it or even better I'm just
going to shut that down even better you
can actually do the same as we start to
look at the finish files that we have
available that I've provided you with so
here is the chunk 5 format now what am I
going to be doing well let's do this if
you go to your progress folder and you
create a new folder will call it fonts
and as you can see you can create one to
a whole bunch of different fonts in here
it doesn't matter how many but as long
as you have the correct name so I'm
going to come in here and i'm going to
choose the eot file i'm also going to
include the SVG the truetype and the
woff and these files and only these
files I don't really need anything else
are what I'm going to place inside the
font folder for the progress files that
we've been working with so right now
there's a folder called fonts we have
these ones here if you look in the
finished folder you'll notice in the
fonts here I've got quite a few extra
ones in there that you can sort of
experiment with and take a look at and
see which ones you like best I'm just
going to throw chunk in here for now and
then we can look at something else in
just a second so in your progress files
if you are now ready to work with this
come back in the next video and I'll
explain how we can implement this these
different fonts in that trunk 5 font
into our CSS and make it work on our
browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
