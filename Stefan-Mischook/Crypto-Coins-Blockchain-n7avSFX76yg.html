people make in the cryptocurrency spaces
that they conflate they mix up they
assume that the tokens or the coins are
actually the blockchain they're not
ripple clients are not the ripple
blockchain theorem coins are not the
theory of blocking the blockchain is the
underlying technology that generates the
coins so people are buying these coins
assuming that you know gonna be adopted
ripples gonna be adopted a theorem is
going to be adopted well it could be but
the ethereum blockchain tech will be
adopted or the ripple blockchain tech
will be adopted but they're certainly
not going to be using the etherium coins
in circulation or the ripple coins in
circulation why why would they win a
bank for example the size that they're
going to utilize blockchain technology
to do an easy exchange of money amongst
its clients why would they pay you a
premium for these coins it makes no
sense they will create their own very
very quickly and for nothing
you see if I was a bank if I was a huge
bank Steff Bank killer bank I would
issue my killer coins based on aetherium
technology and you know I could generate
10 billion Wheels coins very easy to
change the algo bang they got 10 billion
unique coins and I say each coin is
worth $1 and that's it that's that's my
version of serial killer coins based on
the etherium blockchain database and
Bob's your uncle where we go so I think
a lot of young nerdlings
or non nerds a lot of people getting
involved in this they have no idea what
about the blockchain tech I don't claim
to be an expert about everything but I'm
telling you you're just gonna use
business sense why would a bank pay you
for your theory of coins where they can
just generate their own and how do you
know how do I know that they can
generate your own because every 2
seconds somebody comes up with their own
cryptocurrency or at their own fork hey
isn't that hard to do so why would they
use yours
short answer was they won't so the coins
the reason they're going up is because
people are confused about it and they
confused confused about what all this is
about in my opinion because you've got
most of people involved in this market
or eighteen to thirty-five year old guys
so these are people who have hardly any
finance experience at all and they
Muslim don't know much about about tech
either they're not software developers
they don't understand databases they all
said any of this thing so dacoits could
go up because the speculative mania just
like people went after Cabbage Patch
dolls or people went after tulips you
know but I'm telling you right now the
adoption of any of these cryptocurrency
block chains basically whether it be the
ethereum blockchain or a ripple
blockchain or some variant they're not
going to use your serum tokens why would
they they just create their own they
don't need to pay you anything keep that
in mind
