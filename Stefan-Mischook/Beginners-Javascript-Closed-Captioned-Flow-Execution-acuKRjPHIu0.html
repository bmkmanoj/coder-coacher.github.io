look at javascript flow and execution
this well anyway it's actually going to
be a quick little video and let's so
let's just just jump into code right
away and you see what I mean
in all the examples that we've been
doing so far we've inserted our
javascript code in between the body and
body tags of our HTML and for the sake
of practice and so forth that's fine but
this can get a little bit messy
especially if we have lots of you know
our normal web pages with floor of a
code in there are HTML so one thing you
can do is you can actually take your
javascript and you can stick it in the
head and that's usually where people
place the JavaScript code so let's just
run this to see how it looks and as we
can see everything works fine so that's
the first thing I want to point out in
terms of the actual execution other code
just like it is with CSS and HTML the
web browser processes code from the top
down so whatever happens up here in
terms of reading the JavaScript code
reads this first and then this line this
line so on that's why when we reassigned
the variable last name and we gave it
the value of first name plus the value
of number it over wrote this previous
value here why because this came after
this because the JavaScript engine read
this and resist and read this and I said
oh let's change the variable last name
to this so this over wrote this just
keep that in mind when you're working
with javascript this may help solve some
bugs down the road
so far we've been including our
JavaScript straight in our HTML pages
whether it was in the body or in the
head section of our pages another thing
that we can do is actually include the
javascript in our pages via the
javascript link or include tag so let me
show you what that's all about and
you'll you'll see what I mean I'm just
going to delete this and we're just
going to modify this tag and here it is
is this source attribute so I'm just
going to use the capabilities of the
text editor so now I've included into
this page javascript that's found in
this file here co je s so I'm going to
pop open that file and as you can see
here I have the code from but I had
initially in our pages and I just
included it here in a separate file Coco
dias jazz store for JavaScript of course
you notice I have no JavaScript opening
and closing tags as I have almost open
up this here as i have here right in the
jas file so i just have the straight
javascript that's it in here I have this
link tag to the JavaScript code this is
much like CSS and you can think of it
the same way so if I preview this in
Firefox you see the code still works no
problem let me just try it again here we
go Nick Jimmy fish and there you go
you may have noticed in our examples as
the page loaded the javascript
automatically was fired also in this
case of this page here our Lord box
automatically pops open as the page
loads so what we're going to do in the
next videos we're going to look at
something called a function that's going
to teach you how to control when and how
your javascript is actually fired off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
