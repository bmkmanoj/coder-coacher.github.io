take the plunge with my three-year-old
SSD based samsung ultra thin laptop and
to upgrade it from windows 7 to Windows
10 so I started this process yesterday
and a little little icon appeared on my
taskbar in Windows I just clicked it and
it's been going through the process
downloading components restarting you
know downloading new components
restarting and so I wouldn't sit there
because it's taking hours and hours and
hours so I click OK come back 20 minutes
later click OK again and two hours later
it's still downloading click again so
here we are I have to go overnight with
the big download of Windows 10 i guess
it's a pretty big app and i have ultra
high speed connection so anyhow so here
we are it's not quite 24 hours into the
process but it's still installing last
time i checked the progress is around
eighty eight ninety percent i have no
idea how well it's going to work some
people told me it's done well where
they've updated to windows 10 and
everything is cool and other people have
told me it's not so good I don't know so
we'll see what happens I just wanted to
give you a quick heads up when and if
you decide to upgrade to Windows 10 from
a previous version of Windows keep in
mind that it's probably going to be a
long process so don't expect to do it in
an hour give yourself a day or so where
your computer is offline that is for
sure and I'm hoping that upgrading from
windows 7 to 10 will allow me to use
that computer as a secondary computer
because I got a new surface book pro
which is far faster of course the old
computer is SSD base but it's an i3 so
you know you know 34 year old computers
are 34 year old computers I'll let you
know if Windows 10 tanks it or not
that's the big question since I got a
new computer I think I take
ask with the 01 if I only had one
computer and I was running windows 7
hearings pretty stable although its
young windows seven is not the safe as
in terms of viruses and so on apparently
Windows 10 is much safer with built-in
antivirus and so on anyhow if I only had
one computer I would be very very very
reluctant to take the free upgrade to
Windows 10 unless it was a computer
that's maybe one or two years old Macs
but when you go into a 34 year old
computer I'd be little concerned I'm
taking that risk again because I have an
old one also the old computer was very
fast for its times it was an SSD based
system with an i three so that's it for
this video blog I decided just to record
this really quickly like this with the
webcam as opposed to getting out the pro
cam let me know if the video quality is
okay and it's a lot easier for me to
produce content when I just do like this
alright I'll keep you informed about
Windows 10 soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
