calm in the next few videos I'll be
introducing you to jqtouch a JavaScript
based solution for mobile web
development on iOS Android and other
mobile devices in short jqtouch provides
developers with way to create web apps
that look and function like native iOS
applications jqtouch includes support
for touches and swiping animation user
interface elements and themes so it's
going to be very flexible for your use
in this video I'll be introducing you to
the jqtouch website and the demo they
provide as well as showing you how to
preview jqtouch using a variety of
methods you can find the jqtouch website
at jqtouch com at this site you can
download the source code can preview
their interactive demo showing how
jqtouch works and you can learn about
the features and functionality that
jqtouch offers before I continue I
should also talk about what jqtouch
requires specifically it requires either
the septa or jQuery libraries for it to
function properly and if you haven't
heard of zep dough and I hadn't before
learning about jqtouch basically it is a
version of jQuery that's been optimized
specifically for webkit-based browsers
and a WebKit is sort of the basis for
most mobile devices specifically for
devices on iOS and Android so what it
does is it provides the jQuery
functionality in a smaller lighter
package meaning that it's easier for
users to download and it will make your
application faster than using jQuery
itself so of those two jqtouch
recommends the use of zep dough over
jQuery because of the size difference
and you can learn a little bit more
about Zeb doe if you click the septum
support link takes you to a blog post
that explains it a little bit more
now that I briefly introduced you to Zeb
doe let me go back and talk to you and
demonstrate this little demo that
jqtouch provides they provide this demo
in two ways one you can watch this
little video to the left hand side of
your screen here and you can also
preview this directly within the browser
so i would highly suggest if you want to
preview this you do so in a webkit-based
browser for example something like
chrome or safari in my case i like to
use chrome so that's what I will be
using today so I'm going to click the
preview link and this is what it looks
like initially I'm going to go ahead and
change the size of the browser change
the size of the browser to fit more like
a mobile phone type orientation in size
so basically what this is is this
provides you with an interactive
playground to learn all about what
jqtouch is the features and
functionality that they offer and I'm
not going to go over absolutely
everything here because i'm sure you can
explore this on your own I want to at
least highlight a couple different
things that jqtouch offers the first
thing that I want to talk about is
themes so jqtouch supports two themes
initially which one is this base sort of
black and gray and green theme and also
they include this Apple theme which has
the standard blues and whites and Gray's
that Apple tends to use with many of
their default applications secondly
jqtouch also supports various different
events so for example swiping tapping or
various page events like something
animating in animating at out etc and
these work a little bit better when you
actually preview them
a proper iOS device tapped works but
swype doesn't really work unless you're
actually using iOS device or previewing
using Xcode it also supports Ajax and
provides samples for you showing how to
integrate Ajax into your application and
since I imagine that a lot of the
applications you may be building will
require some sort of interaction with
the database this is pretty important
and I found it very useful they had
samples showing you how to put this into
action also they have support for
various animations for example sliding
one page into the next sliding one page
up and flipping between one page in the
next that one's a little bit harder to
see but obviously these aren't exactly
the same animations that apple offers
but it's pretty much what we were able
to do based on the limitations of css3
and the transitions that were able to
make using that and as it mentions down
here at the bottom you can actually make
custom animations as well if you want to
add your own additional ways to tried to
move between pages and finally let me
talk about user interface for a moment
it supports various different layouts
for the user interface including this
sort of table based layout where
everything has a label and items are
arranged in rows also has this edge to
edge layout without the edges between
items has a plastic layout which
basically means things sort of have a
flat appearance
and also metal version this one's a
little bit harder to see if I go back to
the jqtouch theme and take a look at the
metal interface you'll notice that looks
a little bit more realistic so obviously
the styles that jqtouch provides are
sort of just the base layer for you to
work off of and since everything is done
with JavaScript and CSS makes it very
easy for you to change out and make
modifications to what they've done in
addition to this demo let me also
introduce you to the tutorials and
support that jqtouch offers if you go
back to jqtouch com you can also take a
look at the source code issue tracking
and docs on github so if you click that
link it'll take you to the github page
basically this is all the code sort of
stored for jqtouch and if you take a
look near the top of the page here's a
wiki section so i would suggest taking a
look at that they have various articles
on getting started theming extensions
all various different functionality that
jqtouch offers so if you're looking for
a little bit of additional information
i'll take a look here first finally I
want to talk a little bit about how to
preview jqtouch ideally you know you're
going to have a mac or you have an iOS
device and that's really sort of the
ideal situation ideally you'll have an
iphone or ipod touch that you'll be able
to look and preview websites in as
you're developing so you can see
actually what they look like in addition
there are a couple other ways that you
can do it if you have a Mac you can take
a look and preview this using Xcode
and let me talk about that briefly and
you can download xcode in one of two
ways the most recent version xcode four
can be downloaded using the mac app
store and i realized that not everyone
has the mac app store so let me also
introduce a different way to get that as
well if you want to get an older version
that if you don't have access to the mac
app store so if you go to connect apple
com and i'm actually already logged in
but basically you will go ahead and sign
up for a free Apple Developer account
you'll just provide your username and a
password and it's going to get you
access to this download section so
you're going to be able to go to the
developer tools and check these and
it'll take here and you'll notice it
you're able to download all sorts of the
older versions of Xcode even if you
don't have access to the mac app store
so with that in mind let me actually
show you how to work with xcode in
preview jqtouch projects and the easiest
way to do it once you have xcode set up
is to use their iOS application
specifically for previewing iOS apps so
if i go to my Applications folder let me
actually open this up and I'm going to
show you how to get at the specific
application that you want to use now you
could open Xcode and
create a tempo temporary project to
preview stuff with but there is a little
bit of an easier way so if you access
Xcode and go to show package contents go
to contents developer platforms iPhone
simulator platform developer and
applications this is the iOS simulator
and I'm going to go ahead and drag that
into my bar here and if you click on it
it'll pop up an actual iOS simulator for
you to work with and if you don't have
access to natural iOS device this is
really the second best method how to
preview things so for example you can
open up safari and I have jqtouch you're
ready to go if you hold down alt that'll
give you the zooming functionality by
moving the mouse so I'm going to go
ahead and preview and for example this
is jqtouch demo as it would look like in
an actual iphone so that could also come
in handy and finally if you don't have a
iong spouter for example Chrome or
Safari it may not be absolutely perfect
and I you know as I said it ideally you
work with a mac or you have an iOS
device but this is a fallback method if
you don't have access to either of those
two options</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
