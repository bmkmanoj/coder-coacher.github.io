we're going to talk about how the cloud
and cloud-based hosting has changed the
entire software development game it is a
huge game changer and it's impacting my
own app so let me just talk about that
just in case you don't know cloud-based
hosting is basically virtualizing any
app that you build whether it be a PHP
app a Java app a Python App a ruby app a
JavaScript app whatever you put it
inside a virtual machine and then you
deploy this on a cloud-based service and
there's many out there AWS which
amazon's google has it there's no shin
and there are many others so why is this
a game changer because when you can
virtualize an app and then instantly
create clones of this virtualized app
the need for very advanced server
architecture for for reasons of scale
meaning if you want to really grow the
app huge because you're getting a lot of
traffic traditionally prior to the cloud
who would require a lot more complex
coding and engineering load balancing
strategies and so forth with modern-day
cloud-based hosting this is super easy
now it's never been so easy I've just
learned about this stuff in the last
year and it's freaking me out as an old
school web developer it's unbelievable
for instance with studio web my current
app that law schools are now using to
help teach code in a classroom we
designed it initially the prototype six
years ago and we've been refining it
refining it over years and it's actually
two apps now it's the score app and we
also have an API based extension to the
app to to modernize and speed up certain
modules add new capabilities anyway now
the whole issue of scaling it came up
about a year or two ago we were looking
at how we're going to scale this thing
too
need more school demand when you get
more students poor on board and so forth
and you don't want to just use one
server so because of cloud-based serving
and virtualization of apps it just
changed the whole thing it becomes so
easy and what I call it I call dum-dum
scaling when you scale your app you just
basically create a quality app and
create new virtualization of your app
and where you go Bob's your uncle now
I'm not going to get into all the
details about how all this work because
there's different approaches all this
kind of stuff and this is not a course
on virtualization of scalability of a
nap but you get the general idea the
cloud-based hosting is huge cloud-based
services is huge we're now extending
that not just with our core app we're
actually extending out with our content
we now stream it virtue from virtual
servers so that we don't have to deal
with that anymore we used to have a
dedicated service we still have we still
have some left but I use that dedicated
servers and everything would be on the
dedicated servers about two years ago of
so we offloaded all the video on to a
content provider and they take care of
all that headache for me they have their
servers and have the cloning going on
and it just works fantastic and I don't
have to worry about that and we've taken
that to another step with our
documentation how where I've moves all
that into the cloud as well so that it's
a lot easier for me just to keep the
documentation for our App up to date
because everything is on the cloud so
cloud-based services cloud-based
application development just change the
whole changes the whole game so I know
this is sort of very high level this is
just a nighttime vlog would you expect
but it just gives you something to
consider later on when you're getting
into app development just just so you
know you want to look into a cloud-based
hosting virtualization of apps this is
where the juice is this is where the
action is
and it's just going to bring down the
cost of developing well it is bringing
down the cost of developing and
deploying and scaling applications it's
such a great development as an old as an
old-time nerd from the 90s it just makes
me super excited all right that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
