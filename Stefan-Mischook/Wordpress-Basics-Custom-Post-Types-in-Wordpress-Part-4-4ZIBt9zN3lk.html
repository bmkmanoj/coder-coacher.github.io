that PHP file and we have a couple more
tweaks to do so just to keep things tidy
i'll add a another comment and we're
going to do again this time we instead
of add action we're going to use add
filter and we want to go ahead and
change the product columns and we do
that by passing in a string for future
reference if you have a different custom
post type that's where this go so we
just need to change that out so that's
the first and then we're going to pass
in the name of the function that we're
going to call in this case I'm going to
call it edit columns like so and then
the second thing we're going to do is
we're going to add an action and kind of
similar to above manage posts custom
column
and we're going to pass in another
function in this case custom columns so
let's go ahead and create these two
functions first of all function edit
columns and we're going to pass in
columns and then the second function is
custom columns this is also going to get
column so within this function we're
going to define the exact columns that
we want to use so we're going to use
columns equals an array let's see
and we're going to provide a couple
different variables our first one is
going to be CB and this is just a
standard one we're going to give an
input type equals checkbox like so next
one we want to show is title and
basically what we're doing here is we're
defining the columns and we're defining
the column header for each of these
columns so on the product title next is
going to be district that excuse me
description
price and finally type and then after we
set the columns array we're going to
return columns so basically this
function passes in a columns value and
we override it with our own information
and return it so let me say now let me
save this I'm not sure if it's going to
show up properly on the front end yet
looks like we're partially there you see
the headers did change so that's correct
but the values within them haven't so
that's the next step okay so we have our
custom columns and we're passing in this
column variable the first thing we need
to do is we need to do the Global post
so we have access to anything within
this post variable and we're going to
use switch switch column and basically
if you haven't you switch that often
before it's basically a different way to
do a long if statement with many if
else's or L safes excuse me so we're
going to check for different cases we're
going to check check for the case of
description
and this will match up with this so when
the custom columns is called with
description we know that we need to get
data for this description column so in
the case of description we're going to
use the excerpt and break if it's not
the description i'm going to try the
price and in this case we're going to
use custom equals get post custom and
you'll notice this code is very similar
to what we did above what was it here we
can basically just copy and paste this
and this will work the same
okay so custom and instead of setting
this price variable you need to echo it
out like so and then break and finally
case type we're going to echo out a
function called get the term list and
this is used to get well to define well
which categories which custom taxonomy
terms this item is a part of so we're
going to pass in a couple arguments a
post ID we're going to pass in which
taxonomy we want to get information
about case in this case its type we're
going to pass in any text that we want
to display before the taxonomy results
in this case nothing any text that we
want between taxonomy results i'm going
to put a comma and a space and finally
any text that we want to display after
taxonomy results i'll leave that blank
as well okay so that's it for this
section and you'll notice we do have
title as well but WordPress
automatically handles that for us so we
don't necessarily need to include that
with our custom columns function so I've
saved it let's go to Chrome fresh and
you notice now we have all the
information showing up properly
