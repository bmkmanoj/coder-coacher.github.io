what we're going to be talking about
today is a little bit about the
interface and how it looks and some
major changes that came in from the
previous version cs3 well if there are
any cs3 users in the audience first
thing you'll notice is that the
properties window has been moved from
the bottom to the side as we see it here
and the timeline is down at the bottom
at this point but if you prefer having
the time line up the top one of the nice
things about this is that we can move
the timeline into any area as you can
see now it's right up on top I'll just
collapse this motion editor we're going
to talk about that a little bit later
but as you can see this is the more
familiar interface with the timeline up
on top however if you're new to flash
and you're very comfortable working with
the timeline scenario or set up as it is
here you can feel free to continue to
work with it down at the bottom either
way doesn't really matter here we have
the properties window and as you can see
the properties window gives us
information about this particular flash
file including how big the file is in
this case we can see that it is composed
of a canvas size of 550 x 400 pixels and
you can edit the canvas size you can
also change the stages background color
the other information here in terms of
publishing is really important if you
are doing some more advanced flash work
but at the moment we're not really going
to be concerned with that there is a
library tab which allows us to access
any files that we would have in the
library and we'll learn more about the
library a little bit later and there is
the toolbars that we have here you'll
notice that if you move these objects
just by positioning them where the line
separation is you'll see that there is a
cursor that shows two arrow
back and forth left and right and you
can choose to have a single column or a
double column whichever one you prefer
and whichever one seems to suit your
needs for saving space you know you can
just do something along these lines you
can also collapse these files as you can
see here and we can even push this a
little bit further as well and what that
allows us to do is get used these icons
the two like on the property window icon
in the library icon and here is our
stage and if you want to reposition this
stage is a number of ways that you can
do that there is also the magnification
as you can see here we can say fit in
window but the easiest shortcut that I
can give you the first one at least is
pressing the spacebar and that will turn
your cursor into a hand and then we'll
be able to move around our objects let
me just say show frame and then you can
see how this is easily moved around we
can also go to a hundred percent if we
wish and move that around as well and
you can also collapse and sort of
minimize some of the other windows that
we have available here so these are just
some basics about our flash interface
and we're going to talk a little bit
more about some of the things that we
can do with flash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
