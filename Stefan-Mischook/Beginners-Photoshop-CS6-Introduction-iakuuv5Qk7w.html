another killer sites comm video tutorial
my name is Santo Romano and I'm gonna be
taking you through how to work with
Photoshop cs6 specifically for the web
will be creating user interface designs
and I'm going to be running through a
number of techniques that will be very
useful to you if you intend on creating
your own website as you can see we're
going to be putting together a real
simple GUI graphic user interface like
the one that we see right here and we're
going to be covering a number of topics
specifically related to how we can use
Photoshop cs6 to create the user
interface that you see before you and
also how to slice up these images and
get them ready so that we can use them
in a web-based environment now this is
not a course that is dealing with every
aspect of Photoshop in fact it's
primarily focused on working with
Photoshop for web preparation however if
you're interested in a much more
thorough look at Photoshop I can direct
you to killer sites coms Photoshop video
as you can see here killer sites comm
offers a complete Photoshop course
specifically aimed at web designers but
it covers a lot more information than
what we're dealing with in our video
nevertheless our video is going to be
dealing with a lot of topics so that
even if you are brand new to Photoshop
you'll be able to follow along as I'll
be covering some of the Photoshop
essentials and some of the basic tools
that you'll need to be using as well
we'll be learning how to deal with layer
masks and other basics of layer
structure will be keeping things nice
and neat and organized using groups and
other methods also we'll be talking
about working with layer styles and how
to create some really interesting i
conce like the ones that you see here
I'll be talking about working with some
basic filters and how to work with some
patterns also I'll be dealing with sin
full color Corrections and other ways
that we can replace colors and get our
images to look like they're more in
keeping with our overall design as well
we'll be looking at working with type
and dealing with things like warping
type among others ultimately I'll be
telling you how to organize your pages
so that if you had multiple pages that
you're designing you can keep them all
in one document and finally once we've
got a finished interface
we'll be slicing the images with
transparencies and without so that we
can get them ready for use in an HTML
environment so those are some of the
topics that we'll be covering so come on
back in the next video and we'll get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
