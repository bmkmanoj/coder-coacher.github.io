I'd like to do is discuss conditional
statements in other words creating a
condition for flash to meet if this is
happening do this otherwise do that so
that's the basis of how if statements
are written conditional statements
notice what I'm going to do is just
create a a 4 ActionScript layer and then
by selecting that particular frame I'm
going to open up the actions window and
let's do a couple of things number one
let's create a very simple variable so
I'll say a bar to formally declare a
variable let's call it total and let's
make total a number strict data type
that as a number let's give it a value
of something like five so right now
total is equal to five well what I'm
going to do at this moment is create and
set up a conditional statement so as you
can see what we're trying to do here is
to say if total has a value of five
we'll do something so let's see how to
write that first and foremost we write
this simple if then with our regular
brackets notice the code hinting it's
telling us that we need a condition in
here something to be checked something
that's met so let's see what we can do
if total is equal to the number five
close that bracket now let me just close
off these curly brackets as you can see
here in other words if this condition is
being met do whatever is inside these
curly brackets but before we move on
let's just talk about these equal signs
as you can see I'm using a double equal
sign here these are logical equality
signs and what you can see in the
operators right there's a la brady's
that you use with arithmetic as you can
see here very simple ones but there's
also comparison operators
you should probably get familiar with
these if you're going to be working with
any kind of conditional logic but as you
can see here we're testing equality with
the double equal sign what that actually
means is when we use one equal sign
outside of a conditional statement we're
telling this variable total we're
assigning a value of 5 but when we're
using two equal signs to check a
specific condition what we're actually
doing here is testing for equality is
the variable total actually equal to 5
not does it have a value 5 is it equal
to 5 right so we're checking to see if
this equals that well if we did do that
let's just say we're going to set up a
simple trace statement here and we'll
say the first edition
was met close the brackets and a
semicolon at the end of that I just
closed the toolbox for a second so as
you can see here we absolutely know that
total does have a value of five so what
we see here is if total is in fact equal
to five trace this message the first
condition was met control-enter will
test our movie for us and when our
output window opens up we see the first
condition is met let's continue with
this what if for example we had a second
condition that we wanted to check to see
if it was met well if we continue along
these lines we say else if in other
words exactly the same thing as the
first if but this is if that first
condition is not being mad check to see
if something else is being that so let's
put in our second condition here and
we'll just copy this information
actually and I'll paste it in here and
let's see what if instead of five total
was equal to six and we trace a message
it says the second condition was met so
notice it's exactly the same as the
first if statement the only thing we're
doing is we included in else to say well
otherwise if total is equal to six trace
the condition was being met well right
now the second condition would not be
displayed because total is only equal to
five but if we were to change the value
to six let's see what happens here
the second condition is met this time so
you can see how we're checking to see if
a specific condition is being met and we
take actions accordingly well let's say
the number was seven notice nothing
happens why because we're not checking
for that condition so does that mean for
every possibility every single condition
you have to have some sort of else if in
place well not really because you can
always just then say else or in other
words in layman's terms we just say
otherwise and what we're going to do in
this situation is simply set up the
other possibilities so as you can see if
total equals five do this if total
equals six do that else otherwise do
this so we'll just come in here and
trace another message and we'll say no
conditions or met
in this case the else acts as the
otherwise in other words if it doesn't
equal five if it doesn't equal six well
just do this so if we add seven or for
that matter 7,000 doesn't really matter
you say no conditions were met so as you
can see unless it's five first condition
was bad or six second condition was met
every other possibility for example 8
will say no conditions were met that's
the else the otherwise if it's not this
it's not that do this so that's a little
bit about conditional statements and
we'll see how to use these conditional
statements inside of the previous
example that we looked at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
