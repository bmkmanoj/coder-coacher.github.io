compare asp.net and PHP in terms of
market share this site was suggested to
me by this guy here on YouTube ruled
triple-xl yeah so first of all I took an
old Java app and I wrote it in asp.net
with c-sharp way back in the days when
asp.net and the.net framework were in
beta 3 just to compare comparable they
were comparable the way they did things
in asp.net was a little different from
Java in those days but things have you
know everything sort of homogenized
since then meaning everybody does pretty
much everything in very similar ways you
know but I won't get into the details
this is not really about the tech it's
really about the market penetration
other technologies and some realities
that suggest when I say that again and
the realities with the market
penetrations in each of these
technologies and how they affect your
work prospects because I think everybody
most people here are interested in terms
of the financial viability of
technologies that they learn so asp.net
or you can see here look 17 million
websites versus 42 million so you see a
lot more people use PHP in terms of
market share top ten thousand a hundred
thousand top million websites on the web
PHP is by far dominant versus P asp.net
in terms of website categories PHP
dominates all the big categories
business arts entertain internet
telecoms shopping marketing but ASP has
a few things in terms of geography again
around the world and US Russia Germany
France 216 other countries Canada to PHP
is pretty dominant so it's it's
something to consider I suppose but you
have to as I said before have to look at
your local market or whatever market you
want to operate in to decide whether you
go for one or the other so let me point
out asp.net is a framework and you write
asp.net sites usually usually with
c-sharp
PHP is a language and it has several
frameworks the most popular these days
in 2017 just about 2018 is Larry Bell
and laravel city web is laravel base as
an example it's very sophisticated
now PHP has larger penetration largely
because it's been around longer peach
feed came out I don't know you have to
look at me it's in mid to late 1990s
asp.net came out in 2000 2001 before
asp.net was classic ASP severe Emerald
several apps in and it was retired
because it was old technology now his P
was again a framework a simple framework
and most people grow ASP with VB script
and yeah but PHP evolved into it's very
sophisticated language and you have
choices of frameworks that you have
today just as sophisticated whatever you
get in Ruby Java ASP cetera peach trees
are specialized though it's you know
it's specifically for web app creation
you can do other things but nobody does
PHP commercially except to build web
sites and web apps whereas it's boys be
done it is a web app framework and you
code that with c-sharp in terms of
learning asp.net versus PHP again PHP is
just more approachable because it's a
whole bunch of reasons I won't get into
it here but I would definitely be going
into peach because PHP and its core well
here's the main reason PHP at its core
is a web web programming language
whereas asp.net is a framework and then
you have to use C sharp so you have to
learn C sharp and then get into the ASP
frameworks an extra step if you will
where's PHP right at the core of it with
basic PHP PHP 101 you can build simple
web apps you know things that process
forms and everything and much more
but you ultimately if you want to get
into commercial PHP when I use a
framework like a lair eval they espied
better than PHP PHP better an ASP again
all the modern programming languages and
frameworks are all neck-and-neck in
terms of their ability just have to look
at market issues you have to look at the
particular job it has so for instance if
you had a business client where they had
all kinds of Microsoft they were using
Microsoft Office or something
and he wanted to integrate their website
with their back Microsoft back-end then
you definitely want to go with ASP there
has to be done that because they have
all kinds of hooks and tie-ins and make
that easy on the other hand if you have
a client who's got a wordpress based
system they want to add any commerce and
maybe added some social capabilities of
course you're not gonna build something
and he SP not in asp.net you're gonna do
it in PHP PHP infrastructure if you're
just learning for the first time from
scratch I would definitely do PHP first
because it's just so much more
approachable you get things up and
running quickly and at the end of the
day once you learn your PHP well you'll
learn your MVC another design patterns I
won't get into it but that is you can
learn about it in the proper course and
you just get into building web apps with
PHP later on there's an opportunity for
you to use asp.net because of there's
some advantage because mainly because of
Microsoft infrastructure that the
company may be using it'll be easy for
you to learn asp.net because you already
have that background it's kind of like
when I talk about not learning C++ as
your first language now but I'll make it
fun of C++ it's very powerful but it's
just it's a hard language to learn
relative to say Python or JavaScript or
PHP much better to learn those core
principles of programming with easier
languages and then later on if you need
to do C++ a super plus will be just much
easier because it's just much more
approachable there you go I hope you
