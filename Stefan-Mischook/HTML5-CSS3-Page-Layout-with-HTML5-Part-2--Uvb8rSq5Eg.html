is that you know if i zoom out you can
see that basically the sidebar and the
post title are not inside they're not
Center aligned in fact neither is the
footer now getting the footer
center-aligned is pretty easy you just
do margin zero auto we're dealing with a
width up here of 960 pixels so if I add
the footer to that list then we're going
to get a centered footer which is good
now to get the sidebar and this left
content section to all flow nicely
together I'm going to wrap them in
another section tag
and i'm going to call this layout or
container container is a good general
term so i have a section of left content
and then the side tag and those guys are
going to be inside a section container
and the container is going to have a
margin of zero auto which will make it
centered and a width of 960 pixels let's
try that oh and display block alright so
now we're starting to get the beginnings
of a design that's properly structured
now in order for us to get the rest of
this moving forward we're probably going
to do quite a bit of CSS styling and
maybe some slight modifications to our
design here so I want my I want to
actually want maybe for more paragraphs
or I want four paragraphs total so I'm
just going to copy these two paragraphs
now I have four paragraphs to deal with
and then I have a pull quote so with
these five paragraph tags I want them to
be styled slightly differently for
starters I'm just going to do it where
they're all working the same way and I'm
going to have the pull quote be the
first kind of design element that we're
going to do first so the pull quote is
going to have a slight a slightly
different design associated with it so
we have this article and I want to say
that article p dot pull quote in other
words anything that's a pull quote
inside of an article is going to let's
say float right
maybe has a larger font size say 32
pixels a line height which is the
spacing between the lines of 25 pixels
some padding of 15 pixels and I'll just
give it a very simple background for now
of a light gray there's our pullquote
probably want to change the width you
make it 140 pixels so it's a little
smaller and now it's appearing on the
left side this is kind of interesting
now we can take this a step further and
we can add a border radius of 15 pixels
now i'm going to only work with the
mozilla border radiuses now that I've
explained how you can go from Mozilla
and WebKit you know browser
compatibility I if you want to convert
these examples in to WebKit it's not too
difficult just look at the last video in
the series but I'm going to be sticking
to Mozilla for the rest of this series
so now if i refresh this you'll notice
I'm getting these rounded corners which
is a good sign we'll make it say italic
font family Georgia already gets
starting to look better and I'm going to
maybe make the color a little more
interesting see da 1 C 1 C that should
be a light red of some sort and I'm
going to add a bit of a bit more padding
no the padding's good maybe some margin
to margin right or margin left rather
save 10 pixels
say 20 pixels yeah so there's a little
more space to breathe and paragraphs in
general need some work so article p
we'll just let's say make the font size
13 pixels gives them the margin between
paragraphs add a bit of a line height
and let's see what that looks like that
looks a little better and yeah that
looks good also i want my sidebar to be
over a little bit so i'll just say well
that'll be in the actual article which
we can do as well so i'll say article
say give that a width of well i already
have my article to find here hold on so
I have left content and then I have an
article inside that so the actual
article is going to be 600 pixels as
well as the left content section the
reason is is that eventually I want this
to appear in two columns so we're going
to have like a really quite an advanced
layout in terms of the way that it's
it's going to be laid out it's going to
have various columns and it should be
pretty pretty robust as well so I'm just
going to add some some margins around
the edges and that looks pretty good
that's a good start I'm going to add a
background to the body and what that
will do is that will give the whole
thing a bit of a bit more definition so
this is going to actually be a gradient
and it'll start on the top top Center
start white and then go down to a gray
and thirty percent means that don't go
all the way to the end in fact make it
gray after just a little bit not too
sure why we're getting a repeat but
should be okay it's probably just
because I'm so far zoomed out so now
that we have this background we can see
that our post is kind of swimming in the
middle of nowhere and I want to of
course compensate for that so in my left
content section let's go back here we've
got our container I'm going to add a
background of white ffff and I'm going
to save that now we're getting some
really tight margins here which isn't
too nice so again i'm going to add some
just some space around it first thing i
want to do is I want to add a border
radius so we get some nice rounded
corners and I'm going to add a top
margin to my container
there we go so now both of these are
going to be aligned the sidebar is going
to be aligned but there's still going to
be a bit of space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
