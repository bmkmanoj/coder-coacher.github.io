a car vlog I'm just using the mic from
the cell phone so you tell me if you
really care if I use that mic a little
cell phone mic or whether I use the mic
my little external mic I just fell too
lazy plugging in the external mic yeah
so it's one a quickly comment the
YouTube comments and questions are
actually kind of cool they they often
make some of the better vlogs I think on
the channel so keep the questions coming
I can't necessarily answer all the
questions sometimes I miss comments
sometimes only get to the comments after
a while like for instance I just
realized I had like 100 private messages
in the YouTube messaging so if you send
me private messages I'll try to be on
top of that but between that my email
Facebook to lesser extent you too it's a
psychological awesome messages and my
for instance in my email inbox I got
like a hundred emails or so I still have
to address so it's I forget I get behind
but now that I finish the Python course
and that's how that saves up a lot of
time for me elbowing on other stuff is
coming up and yeah so I'll try to get to
the messaging if you have questions keep
asking them on the YouTube and I will do
my best to answer them I'm trying to
decide and you guys could let me know
and I know if I asked this before I may
have have the old killer sites forums
and I put them in an archive a couple
years ago because I felt that people are
just using social media but I'm
wondering if I should maybe open that up
again just allow people to start
conversations about a particular subject
and interact with each other or should I
just just keep it on YouTube comments I
personally which is easy for me to keep
it on social networking plan the social
networks if you will or maybe set up a
Facebook book group I don't know if
anybody be interested in that or the for
let me know what you think about that I
have no particular opinion either way
sort of on the fence although I don't
put too
into it and that's pretty much it I'll
let you go I got to get back to the
office and start doing my work ChaCha
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
