sites com I wanted to spend some time
today discussing javascript and PHP
based form validation specifically I'd
like to cover what it is why you might
want to consider using it and go over an
example that we're going to build
showing both javascript in our case
we're going to use jquery and PHP based
form validation first of all what is
form validation for validation is the
process of double checking any user
input into your form you make sure that
the data that has been entered is valid
and in the expected format form
validation can involve something simple
for example just making sure that any
required fields are filled in or
something potentially more complicated
like checking that the email or a phone
number is in the correct format proper
form validation is helpful to everyone
involved it's helpful to you the
programer because you can double check
your data and make sure that anything
being entered into the form is valid and
doesn't pose any security risks it's
helpful for the visitor because they can
be assured that any data that they're
entering into the form is mistake free
it catches basic mistakes missing forms
in correctly formatted fields it's also
helpful for the client because they're
the one receiving this data from the
form and they can be assured that any
data the receiving is valid and should
be again in the correct format I'm going
to be talking about both javascript and
PHP based form validation today
javascript exists on the client side on
the visitors local computer it's helpful
because it allows them immediate
feedback to help them catch errors
however it can be easily bypassed a user
could easily disable JavaScript and then
the form validation would immediately
fail so it is important to have some
sort of server side validation in place
as well in our case we're going to be
using PHP to handle that because PHP is
handled on the server side it's out of
the control of the visitor and you can
make sure that the visitor
mess with it in any way let me get
started by showing you what we're going
to be building today so when i open up
kota and in this demo I'm going to be
discussing as i said before both PHP and
JavaScript based form validation and to
do the JavaScript validation I'm going
to be using a plug-in for a jQuery
called validate and it's probably the
simplest and easiest way I know to add
JavaScript validation this demo will
include both javascript and PHP based
validation the javascript will do most
of the heavy lifting if the javascript
validation passes the PHP validation
should pass to however it is important
to remember that you cannot always rely
on JavaScript validation to be in place
the user may have disabled javascript
either purposely or accidentally so you
can't always guarantee that it's going
to be in place let me give you a demo
here let's go ahead and enter in name
let me enter in a phone number but let's
say for some reason or another i enter
in an extra digit you notice as i skip
to the next line it generates an error
message telling the user exactly what's
going on so i can go ahead fix that and
in this case it's asking for area code
as well so let me fill that in there we
go and we can also do the same thing
with email if we enter in a incorrect
email it will give us an Aleut or if we
for example leave it blank it'll also
say this field is required so it catches
any required fields and make sure that
in our case the phone number and the
email field are formatted correctly
let's get started building this form
first of all I have Kota open which is
my text editor of choice and you also
need to have something like MAMP or way
I'm running to see you can make sure you
can have access to the PHP server
so the first thing I'm going to do is
let's get all the various files that
we're going to need set up so I'm going
to start with a new file I'm going to
start with the first one when we call it
form dot PHP and this is going to hold
our main form I'm also going to include
a couple other files we're going to
include jquery jas which i'm going to go
ahead and download from the jquery site
so jQuery com I'm going to grab the
production version download and simply a
copy and paste the JavaScript code into
my file okay so that's the first thing
I'm going to also create validate Jas
and this is going to be the javascript
plugin this can be found either at doc's
jquery calm / puck plugins / validation
on the homepage of the developer in this
case it's bass ambassa sistance de /
jquery plugins / jquery plugin
validation and i'm going to go ahead and
grab the I'll just grab the minified
version of this and again this copy and
paste
that's all set let's also create a
success dot PHP and this is going to be
very simple i'm just going to display
success message this will be the page it
will appear if our forum has been able
to be submitted correctly so we have a
forum success a jquery and a validate
and I believe that's all that we need to
get started so the last thing I'm going
to do for this video is an open up form
that PHP and I'm going to insert a block
of code which I'll quickly discuss here
we go and I'm just inserting this as a
big block rather than typing it out
individually because it'll save us a
little bit of time but you may want to
pause the video and type everything out
or you can download the source files and
have direct access to them so to briefly
go over what we just pasted in it's a
pretty basic HTML document we have our
title we are including the jquery JS
file and the validate JS file we just
created we have a JavaScript block
doesn't have any code in it just yet we
have a style block which just includes
some basic form styling so minor things
styling the body the field set in our
forum forum labels text areas etc then
finally down at the bottom within the
body tags we have the actual form it's
made up of labels and inputs in our case
we have named phone fax email comments a
required fields message and then finally
the submit button so let me make sure we
save this make clothes untitled here and
let's preview our forum and see what we
have so there we go this will use as the
basis for the rest of this tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
