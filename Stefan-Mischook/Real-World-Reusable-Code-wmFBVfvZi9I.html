sites in this little via blog I want to
discuss the fundamental idea of code now
the holy grail of coding is to have
clean code that's modular and that is
reusable and that was actually one of
the main points of object-oriented code
this concept that you would create
objects that could be reused and you can
reuse code I can tell you in real world
coding having been coding since 1994
it's very rare that you're able to reuse
a lot of code specially business level
code your business object layer usually
that code is not very reusable what's
reusable is framework code structural
code but fortunately for us much of the
framework code much of the structural
code is written especially when it comes
to web apps so if you look at what say
in the PHP world laravel symphony and
other frameworks they have their
structural code that you're going to
reuse you can use the framework code
that's kind of cool but again to migrate
that you're sort of reuse that code
skews me within the context of the
framework but to reuse particular
individual objects but you might pull
out here put it there it's doable but
it's much more difficult than you would
think and when you're coming down to
writing actual products actual code
bases that are used to for a particular
application so you know whatever
whatever whatever it may be whether it
be a web app or an iPhone app or
what-have-you
what you'll find if the code is not
terribly reusable except for some basic
structural infrastructure code so when
friend of mine put it their shitty code
and shittier code that's pretty much
what coding is all about so something I
mentioned in a previous vlog
could be a few years now I've been
blogging for a while I talked about the
reusable code within an MVC structure
MVC is Model View controller it's the
standard way in which you design apps
these days web apps and whatnot so you
have your model code your view code and
view and your controller code so the
monocle is basically your database
controlling code the view code is
basically what people see so in the case
of web apps that would be your HTML and
your CSS and you got the controller code
a controller code Brokers the
interaction between your views your your
webpages and your back-end data objects
and in your logic and yeah that's pretty
much it so in that context MVC the
controller code the code that brokered
between your views and your data objects
but that controller code won't be reused
that's what the throwing code easily now
you can reuse views and you modify them
you know templated views it's nothing
new so that's your gonna use that and
you can also reuse like your data access
layer and you see you know again in
frameworks like an or an object
relational mapping framework therein is
an example some of your model code that
of course is reuse of use or norm so
anyway I just wanted to clear up the
theoretical discussions of reusable code
between the context of object-oriented
programming you'll find that always part
of your code can be reusable and
especially when you're getting into your
standard business application most of
the time the code won't be reusable but
you're right unless you're ready you
know basic framework type of code but
these days this the way that software is
today you shouldn't be writing having to
write framework code at this point it's
very rare it's
should be once in a blue moon he should
do it because it's a very expensive
proposition it's a very time-consuming
thing back when I cut my teeth coding in
the 1990s we used to have to do it all
the time because these type of
frameworks were very new or they weren't
existing between early early days and so
there's a lot of development to be happy
these days frameworks are very mature
whether it be peach be laravel java
spring Ruby rails back on Django and
pick any other frame or if you wanted
you can argue about which framework is
better than the other but this that's
the real reusable code as these
frameworks so I wouldn't be so concerned
about writing reusable code viiay
especially if you're building business
apps if you're building a framework
which 99.99% of people should not be but
if you find yourself ok of course you're
gonna be doing that but that's a whole
other subject you know in of itself I
built my own MVC framework back in the
90s you know compared to modern
frameworks like laravel and spring and
root rails it was very primitive but it
did a very good job for me I used the
8020 rule in developing my code base
where I tried to solve 80% of the
problems you know with my code as
opposed to trying to do everything
because when you have a framework where
you're trying to do everything the
complexity increases crazy a crazy
amount for that last 20% of that you're
trying to put into a framework so you
can get a heck of a lot of the problem
solved in a framework by writing a a
fairly lightweight nimble framework that
last 20% is where all heavy-duty lifting
comes in where all the heavy work comes
in if you're not sure about the 80/20
principle and I explained it well here
I've explained in other videos or you
just look it up on Wikipedia and let me
tell you from my experience in coding
and in business the 80/20 rule works ok
the basic concept of the 80/20 rule is
that 80% of your cost come from 20% of
your expenses
sorts of business that analogy so if you
look at your business you may say Oh 80%
of my cost is really my employees and
the other 20% of my expenses or
everything else so you can look at maybe
streamlining what your employees do I
know this kind of evil especially in
these days we've got a lot of
outsourcing stuff which is could be very
problematic for people and I'm not
necessarily a big advocate of that but
that's just an example the 80/20 rule
originally came from this I think it was
a 15th century economist Italian
economist Pedrito I think his name was
been a while since they looked this up
and he discovered that 80% of the wealth
was concentrated in 20% of the
population which was like for him which
was completely evil now compared to
today when or 90% of the well something
like that is concentrated 1% of people
he would have you know he he would have
nightmares given that situation he
thought he thought that 80% of wealth
being concentrated was 20% of people was
kind of bad imagine how he would feel
about today but you see that that rule
applies in all areas or life is one of
those universal principles it's quite
interesting so in code you'll find that
80% of your complexity will be in 20% of
your objects for instance you know 80%
of the coding work will be in 20% of
your your task so it's there's different
ways you can slice it but it's kind of
interesting to look at your code base
like that to look at your business like
that to look at your cost like that
because it could save you a lot of time
because the key is is to focus in on
that key 20% of its costing you in that
80% of the work or like wasting 80% of
your time are burning 80% of your cost
your money so if you can concentrate on
a 20% as well you can get rid of most of
you can take care of most of the problem
that's what I would do with my framework
I had a framework but try to concentrate
on that 20% of the job that took up 80%
of the time and that was you I it was
data access it was data validation
these were the three major components
that takes up most of the time in most
web apps because most web apps is
collecting user data and forms and these
days in other ways tubes but in forms
then massaging that data filtering it to
validating it then putting into some
sort of database some sort of data store
and then pulling that data out massaging
it filtering it and displaying it to a
user and that's like really 80% of it so
there's lots of database code used too
low we used to I used to do these days
use an arm tool and it saves you a lot
of time you got data base you guys teach
me you've got data validation libraries
you've got authentication libraries
built in there and you got the whole MVC
structure in the case of web apps
whether it be a laravel or rails or
spring or whatnot Django they save a lot
of time so you can get so much more done
today versus what the amount of work it
took us to do things back you know 10 15
years ago anyway I hope you found this
