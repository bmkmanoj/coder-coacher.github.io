question from a student I'll try to
answer some of these questions although
some of them will require a little bit
more than a vlog to answer anyway here
we go another thing I want to do some
freelancing on the side while digging
deeper into web development I already
know a couple of small businesses who
need a website like my osteopath lady
farms jobs etc very good that's where
you start you talk to people that you
know you walk in say I got some web
design skills let me help you out let me
continue reading his email but there are
still lots of questions outside the
programming scope like what image
processing skills and tools do I need
well these days with modern web design
where you're building responsive
websites as I teach in my HTML CSS
course really you don't really need too
much in terms of image editing skills
not like it was 10 years ago basically
you just need a pretty clean image make
sure it's at 96 kilobits 'el an inch
don't make it for print if you don't
know what that is I talk all about that
in my course so you don't really need
much in terms of image editing usually
it's just a nice clean solid images
solid photos like you see on well let me
show you let me load up a site here even
Apple right this is this good
photography and is cut it nicely again
it's probably a 3d rendering and a 3d
rendering but this is pretty fast you
know this is Apple if we go to a simpler
site like I don't know sturdy web a
little studio web so studio web again
you see the image editing here is very
simple this is just an image all we did
here was blur out some point points here
and there you could do this with basic
photoshop or free photoshop like apps
like the gimp gim p th e gimp gim p
that's another option and there are
online image editing tools I think
sparrows one of them you can just search
for Google online image editing and you
can just do basic things like cuts and
crops and maybe blur out sections you
don't necessarily need to get a
Photoshop as you can see it's pretty
simple that being said if you find
yourself having to do a lot of image
processing then depending on what you
need to do you might want to get into
basic photoshop but the GIMP will do it
and there are many other less expensive
programs out there that will do it
personally rare times that I do with
these days I just use something called
Azera it's windows only but on Mac a lot
of times I just do screenshots of of
images that I want and I just uploaded
nowhere we go should I demand that they
hire a photography or do it myself if
they have no pictures that's a good
question to pet don't demand anything
from the client just give them options
in terms of what you're willing to do or
what price now if you have a camera
available and you know how to take
photos and just add it into the price or
say listen I can do it but something
cost you more and you just charge me a
rate or you can say well we need a
picture what you know we need a picture
it does it looks like this looks like
that you got to direct them so they
deliver the photos something you should
learn if you watch my vlogs you want to
be careful with regards to having to
deal with clients waiting for them to
come up with the goods photos text etc
video so I always recommend my 33 3333
payment this scheme if you will or
payment structure so that you a 33
percent upfront before you start doing
work 33 percent when you deliver the
first draft and then the last 33 percent
when the final site is up and the reason
I do 2 33 33 33 is because you want to
get that 66 percent of money very
quickly because what you're gonna find
many times you will have built a lot of
site and then you might wait months and
months before they actually deliver on
bringing you the final photos that you
need or delivering the final text that
you need to complete the site just keep
that in mind how do I get a logo from
paper in digital format
but you can use scanning right you kid
scan the logo and high-resolution if
they can't deliver local to you in a
digital format and then from that you
can use software like Adobe Illustrator
Zehra they're able to scan take scans
and turn them into vectors assume the
logos gonna have very simple shapes so
that's the way to do it again you got a
charge remember for that if they're not
able to to deliver that and if you can't
do that you don't want to do that there
might be services that allow you to do
that pretty easily being able to
identify shapes and scan them and
digitize them is becoming very very easy
these days not what was ten years ago
next question if there is no logo it is
my job to create one only if you
contract to do that and check around
local designed or maybe there's lots of
sites out there but they'll do logos
design and say listen we can hire people
to do local design it could be very
cheap with Fiverr and stuff depending on
how much they want to pay this work with
them your job as a contractor is only in
which you put in a contract what you're
going to do and if they want you to do
it you just charge them extra for that
if it's not core to your expertise for
instance you don't want to do local
design because that's because that's not
what you do then hire somebody to do
that there are sites online like five or
another zones you just go to local
design and sometimes you can just by
locals prefab you say ok what kind of
business do you have so if they're
osteopath you can go to these sites to
search for them on google or you can
type in osteopath or chiropractor or
medical type logos and they have a slew
logos that you can buy for whatever
dollars could be 50 bucks 20 bucks 100
bucks trust me buying a logo prefab for
a hundred bucks is much better than
creating your own from scratch that is
for sure so that's what I would suggest
that you do there and what do you you
would do it's just like when you're
presenting designs you say if they want
a logo from you say ok I'm going to go
to a local place and I'm going to tell
them we can do custom logo it's going to
cost you X amount of dollars
find a custom guy get the pricing or we
can use one of these places and then
present them make three to four logos to
choose from
and then you just you know put that in
place that's what I would do because I I
used to do that kind of stuff I have a
graphic design background but if you
want to be a developer develop right
don't get into design unless you want to
so again whatever you want to do that's
up to you to do to put into contracts up
to you you don't have to do anything you
don't want to do you're not they're not
your boss you you're you are your own
boss you decide what work on it you want
to do and if you they want you to do it
hire people in and just build for it and
take a little piece for yourself because
you have to take counts your time trying
to find these contractors next question
how to conduct the project on a business
side why I gave you some tips right
there I'm going to be putting together
of course I haven't written out actually
and I talked about it about a month ago
I just been so busy with work I'm going
to put together an entrepreneurial be an
entrepreneur business I've been an
entrepreneur for 28 years many different
businesses I've had my successes and so
I'm gonna be putting together of course
with discusses all these things
something that I wish I would have had
when I was young so if you're listening
to this and you're watching this and
that type of course would interest you
but let me know in the comments below
because the more comments they get the
more likely going to put out this course
like I said I've written it out already
I don't know what it is I forget it's
like 50 lessons or something it's gonna
be video and podcast format so you can
listen to as you go and continue with
his email like communication from start
to end up calculating rates what details
should be in a contract and contain
anyway that would be in the course you
know if you look in my YouTube
collection I talk about this stuff I
talk about contracts I talked a bit
about calculating rates it's in the
youtubes just search for that and you I
YouTube flogs you know I got hundreds so
and there there's some business stuff in
there yes next reselling hosting again I
talked about that as well in a nutshell
though reselling hosting can be good I
used to do is that with my own hosting
servers and everything but I sold that
business
and over eight years ago I still have my
residuals from that but it's
understanding when you start doing
hosting you'll probably have to deal
with email tech support
we lost our emails what do we do how do
we you know you may want to partner with
a hosting company and just get an
affiliate link and then you you know you
could you can make eighty a hundred
dollars for every hosting Cline you
bring them so better to hook them up
with a hosting company and make sure
they won't compete with you in terms of
your web design services and get an
affiliate link and just make a quick
hundred bucks you know and not have to
deal with the headaches unless your plan
is long term to have hundreds and
hundreds of hosting clients but
understand you have to deal with tech
support issues and it can get very
annoying when you're getting calls
Friday afternoon at four o'clock saying
that their emails don't work and it
turns out that they just lost their
passwords keep that in mind so last
question he asks do you think these
topics are you gonna cover them on
YouTube channel killer sites I think I
answer that I have covered a summit I'm
at least a good book or other resource
well I'm putting it together so let me
know you guys on YouTube I have the
course on it takes a bit of work to put
it out but you know because it's
business oriented for me anyway it's
easier to put out and a cold course it's
structured also I've been doing business
28 years kind of like the second nature
for me so I just you know it's easy for
me to get out compared to other things
that's about it see you in the next vlog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
