Moorea Montreal and about to head out to
get my morning coffee I'm now cutting
out my bagels bagels is kind of like a
bread II Brady thing if you will so you
eat and I don't some of you may be going
a little bagel is death there's some
people around the world they may not
know what a bagel is anyway it's a much
y'all where AM is famous for its bagels
they're apparently much better than
bagels outside of Montreal from my
experience that seems to be the case but
who knows I haven't had bagels in every
city of the world though
anyhow so I've cut out bagels because of
the carb content carb content you want
to limit your carbs specially white
flour and bagels or pretty much that so
I just go out to get a coffee and again
I go out because I work from the home
most of the time while an office in the
house and by design I used to have a big
location at one point one of my
businesses I I didn't like it because I
didn't like the responsibility and
having to have to go in there because
when you have a place and you got people
working for you you feel responsible you
have to go into work even though you may
feel like it that particular day so it's
a huge expense as well so I rather have
a big nice office small a big but a nice
office in my place and just deal with
that
what other things have been doing this
year and it's not the first year but I
been going through my books old CDs
remember CDs and other things clothes I
don't wear and I've been bringing them
to the goodwill the local goodwill and
it has two amazing impacts while amazing
might be too strong but as two positive
impacts number one you get to clean out
your closets you get to clean out
your shelves of things that you're not
using so I'm a minimalist by nature and
it kind of comes with my martial art
background where I at the most advanced
levels of martial arts you want a very
simple and efficient movement very clean
you know that is really what separates
the good martial artists from the
average martial artists anyway so
getting out all these old books clothes
I don't wear CDs DVDs stuff I don't
watch or listen to I have a one-year
rule for the most part if I haven't worn
or watched or read something within a
year or at least a year with some
exception some special books and very
valuable collectors books here and there
I would just I just bring them to the
goodwill well let somebody else enjoy
them I feel good now that I must have
brought over like between CDs and DVDs
like a hundred of these to the local
library so that people can actually
watch the films you listen to music as
they choose to write another thing I
brought to the goodwill was my old xbox
360 my xbox 360 perfectly good working
order and had about 20 games halo and
halo 1 and Rainbow Six Vegas and all
kinds of games and I used to play that a
lot with some old buddies we used to be
able to get online with Xbox Live it was
just a way to meet to chat with old
friends really but that kind of broke
down a little while ago and anyway we
don't use the 360 so I figured why is
this viable working console sitting in
my closet becoming more and more
outdated so I brought that to the
goodwill as well so hopefully some kid
will get access to a real cool console
with a bunch of games so yeah cleaning
house
is it's pretty cathartic it it's like
losing weight it's like losing weight
and it does take
strangely enough it takes a little
mental stress off of you you know what
else it does it prevents you from buying
stupid stupidly at least it helps
because you think about all the stuff
you just gave away and all the stuff you
never read or he didn't you hadn't read
in years rather so that I didn't read
there's a couple of books I haven't read
I bought them years ago I just haven't
read them yet I get excited when I go to
a bookstore I gotta read this oh this is
cool Airy and then you end up reading
some of them anyway
I spoke about in a recent vlog that I
have been revamping all not myself but I
put the I put in the queue to revamp the
killer video store after a few years to
basically do some cleanup of the app not
too much was media because it was
working pretty good but more importantly
was to clean out the old videos that's
what's hardest right where you have a
bunch of videos that I created years ago
and they were still I would say 90% to
95% relevant today because technology
PHP and HTML CSS and programming and all
these things are pretty consistent SQL
where they were five years ago but at
some point you got to say yourself it's
time to let them go the flesh them and
just put in the new stuff the latest
stuff clean house over you so you're
sure that people have the latest and
greatest of your work you see though
I've been creating videos since 2003 the
stuff I did just eight years ten years
ago or five years ago is not as good as
my plate of stuff because you just get
better with every iteration of course so
yep I also did a cleaning house lower in
the middle of cleaning house of the old
killer video store swapping up your
stuff and we're going to be putting in
two new a few other little things here
and there and it feels good it feels
good too
to clean that out and the final
crescendo of this spring cleaning if you
will is that I'm moving the last of my
physical dedicated silver servers into
the cloud into the cloud and that's
going to be a pretty cool thing because
when you're in a good cloud
infrastructure you don't have to worry
about a hardware failure and I found it
a cloud service provider actually
company Bedelia with very very long time
for my physical servers they got a cloud
infrastructure which is a turkey and
fully serviced whereas my criticism of
other providers out there like digital
oceans and so forth you have to become
like a Linux administrator pretty much
you have to manage it patching and
backups at all but you have to do all
kinds of work which is kind of like a
step backward in terms of hosting
providers so for similar price I found
somebody who is able to provide Turkey
cloud-based hosting so they take care of
DDoS attacks database backups patching
any support requests they take care of
so I don't have to have a Linux
administrator around me or I don't have
to become a Linux administrator this is
good
this takes another headache off of you
know my job as a CEO and that's pretty
cool you know and if you've ever run
your own company you know a big part of
running a company is just putting out
fires putting out fires and it's hard to
want to focus on the creative stuff
because you know you want to get in
there you want to create a course you
want to do a podcast you want to do a
video and then also you got to deal with
a problem client Craig Carlile calls new
client comes in you're going to set up
you know a special meeting with one of
your distributors bla bla bla bla bla
this way it is so if you're working for
somebody and you're saying to yourself
hmm
yeah cos I got it really easy I don't
know you know what
the one time I work on a gig for a very
large corporation that was in the 90s it
was like a three four week stint and it
was apparently during a high-pressure
situation for this company and everybody
was stressed out working there and I was
brought in as a hired gun coder and for
me was the easiest gig in the world it
was easy cuz I had to concern myself was
with my little part of the job I just
had to do my thing my thing my house
system had to work that's it
whether or not all these other things
happening into place wasn't my problem
wasn't my concern it was very liberating
I have to say but when you run your own
business when your startup founder or
you're starting your own little business
you're going to be worried about
everything so that's a lot of
responsibility in there's a lot of
stress that you don't have when you're
employee so if your employee and you're
wondering who it's not all bad being
employee that's that I'm not
discouraging you from being an
entrepreneur I'm an entrepreneur sort of
an eighteen and I think the benefits
strongly outweigh the cons in terms of
being being a business owner but just
understand it comes with a lot of
headaches at work
alright that's it I got it we'll get my
coffee funny</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
