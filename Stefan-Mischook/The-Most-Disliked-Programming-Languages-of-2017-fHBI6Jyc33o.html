gonna read this well go over this
article that was on ZDNet
the moves the most loathed programming
languages
here's hell developers caster votes so
this is from a stack overflow only so
let me point out it does not represent
how popular the languages are because
some of the most hated programming
languages listed here are extremely
popular PHP for instance so let's look
at it so the top of this apparently is
Perl
now Perl is a programming language back
in the day was used for server
automation it's a very compact terse
meaning less code programming language
and it was used for server automation
tasks which has been replaced by Python
it was also used quite a bit in the
early 90s very early 90s for web
development before page-level type of
web tech came out for dynamic websites
from web apps the problem of pearl is
that there's all these different flavors
of Perl and there's many different ways
to do things in pearls so Perl code was
notoriously very very very very messy
and the Perl philosophy was you know
write your protocol the way you want to
write it and sounds good except when you
want to go and update the code or see
what the code was doing because
everybody was doing in their own special
way it was a disaster and it reminds me
I spoke about this in a vlog from years
ago where I was hired by coming to take
over a project and an early version of a
social network and it was written in
Perl by the previous company so I came
in there to fix it because a previous
company couldn't fix it after a year and
I looked at the codebase and it was such
a disaster I said okay forget it this is
this is gonna be a rewrite so I rewrote
it using at the time it was cutting-edge
technology classic ASP which was the
first page level technology out there
and I wouldn't be using classic
be today of course which is one of the
hated languages of the law although
classic ASP is not really a language
it's a framework anyhow I was able to
rewrite the Perl app in just one month
whereas the previous company has spent
over a year or so writing this app in
Perl but classic ASP was such a
game-changer in terms of the
productivity of that I was able to do it
in a month on my own anyway so yeah so
Perl is one of the most hated languages
it says here Stack Overflow gathered its
data for ranking the most disliked
languages from its developer story
features on its job page which allows
users to add tags for languages they
would like to work with and languages
they would like to avoid other intensely
disliked languages included PHP
Objective C CoffeeScript
and Ruby on the other on the other end
of the scale the least disliked language
included are cotton and typescript rust
bash closure swift Python JavaScript and
go actually I was looking at Swift
recently but I'm gonna do a vlog on this
Swift was open source by Apple and IBM
who has a history of seeing the future
decided to get involved and Swift in a
big way and what they've done is they've
turned Swift into a server-side
programming language and they've done
some they've released some lots of open
source software it created a framework
forward for the server and I've done
just some superficial reading but what
are most interesting things about Swift
is that it's very productive in terms as
a coding language much in the same way
as PHP or JavaScript or Python but it
also it compiles down so it runs nearly
as fast as C they right beside C and you
understand like if you if you had a
chart C is the fastest language then you
would have Java PHP then you would have
JavaScript and you have Python
you have you know Ruby interns you know
this way is slower this way it's faster
so C is really super fast up here and
the next thing is like Java here well
guess what Swift is right here
unbelievable
so iBM has put out this framework based
on Swift that envisions a whole new way
of developing apps where apps are built
through micro-services type of framework
anyway I'll get into that later Swift is
a an interesting development I didn't
know it ran so fast at runtime but said
it's something to look into but you know
as I said in terms of jobs don't go I
gotta drop everything I go Swift now is
huge about so work with Python PHP
JavaScript Java C sharp C you know so
anyways Stack Overflow data scientists
Robin Robinson notes that the least
disliked tag tend to be the fast-growing
tend to be the fast growing in terms of
questions asked by developers on Stack
Overflow languages that fit this profile
including our Python typescript code
rust which questions with while
questions with tags for Perl objective-c
and Ruby are steadily shrinking
Microsoft didn't fare well either people
didn't like microsoft technology other
highly disliked the technologies
included COBOL COBOL is the old language
for mainframe servers amazing after it
left 40 years people still coded Adobe
Flash yeah it's weird I guess they got
legacy flash apps that are still being
used which is a disaster
Microsoft classic ASP I just spoke about
that and Microsoft itself apple also
sheriff also appears there as does
Microsoft SharePoint is an access it's
worth emphasize again that this is no
indictment of the technologies their
quality or their popularity so it says
in the article it is simply a
measurement of what technology start to
strong negative feelings in at least a
subset of developers who feel
comfortable sharing this publicly who
feel share excuse me who feel
confident or comfortable sharing this
publicly it's interesting the most liked
technologies including machine learning
get python html5 cs3 JSON docker Amazon
Web Services that's it for this article
I thought that was kind of interesting
again as I've explained in several of
their vlogs these days these all these
languages have their place most of them
with the exceptions of like flash for
instance they there's plenty of job
opportunities going forward but I
wouldn't I would definitely wouldn't
touch flash I wouldn't touch in some
means action script which is Flash's
programming language I wouldn't touch
Perl C++ C lots of jobs there but that's
a type of coding but you have to like
it's very different from let's say
writing apps and Python or Swift or or
the web stack for instance just keep
that in mind that's it for today's vlog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
