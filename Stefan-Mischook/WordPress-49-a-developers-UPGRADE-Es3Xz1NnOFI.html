WordPress 4.9 in one of my blogs and
interesting I think this might be called
a creators update it's kind of ironic
or a coincidental rather that I talked
about how we're president 2018 is still
a very viable option for developers who
want to especially do freelancing work
since so many businesses rely on
WordPress
so major customizer improvements code
error checking and more welcome to the
improved customizer workflow with design
drafts locking scheduling preview leaks
what's more a code syntax highlighting
error checking will make for a clean
smooth site building experience finally
if at all if all that wasn't pretty
great we've got a great new gallery
gallery widget and improvements to theme
browsing and switching so this is a
interesting update I haven't looked at
it I just installed this place so I
thought I would do a quick vlog but it
seems that the men and women or the
women in men the Nerds at WordPress are
considering the WordPress professionals
those who support WordPress sites so
collaboration with design preview leaks
need some feedback and proposed site
design changes right here where
president 4.9 gives you a preview link
you can send to your team and customers
but you can collect an integrate
feedback before your schedule changes
that's pretty cool
whole bunch of other things I'll let you
explore that further Oh safety sound box
the dreaded way screen you avoid when
working on themes and plugins cool
because what president's interesting
syntax highlighting there's no even more
widgets ok this is want to add media to
your text widget embed video
it's an interesting site building
improvements more reliable switching
better menu instructions less confusing
left-hand land ahead to good inverter
okay there you go
it seems that the wordpress people are
realizing and that the key to
WordPress's future is in the developer
community that's interesting all the
major operating systems knew this that's
why Microsoft took the lead in the 90s
over at Mac OS because they went out of
their way Microsoft did to support
developers for Windows to make it easy
for people to create apps for Windows so
the WordPress people with WordPress 4.9
and they've learned that lesson so it
seems that they're adding all kinds of
capabilities to WordPress to make it
easier for WordPress professionals to to
create themes and customize and manage
WordPress for their clients so again
another step forward in WordPress were
they're making it a great platform for
developers who want to support small
business who happen to be using
WordPress again I'm not saying we're
president later is the greatest thing
ever made but there's just such a huge
install base and now we have more tools
for developers it's just another
compelling reason to consider WordPress
if you want to get into freelance web
development in an area where you're
gonna have lots of demand because a tons
of businesses rely on WordPress and be
many developers don't want to work well
for WordPress because they have this bad
feeling about it which there's some
justification to that I had no no doubt
but nonetheless you know something I'll
be teaching in my business battle plan
course barriers to entry whether it be
financial barriers to entry whether it
be just popularity has a major impact in
terms of how much you can earn any
particular business that you get into so
for example WordPress development not
sexy not hot but huge
that equals big money let's talk about
something non tech looking at trades
when it at least sexy trades you can do
is the plumber the dreaded plumber and
the thing is though because it's not
sexy and because it takes a certain
amount a good amount of training to get
certified as a plumber plumbers have
unlimited work and they make piles and
piles of money compared to other you
know people who are doing the
blue-collar work so if you're
blue-collar hands-on type of person if
you can handle the the crap pun intended
you can get into plumbing make a lot of
money but you got to go school for a few
years and on the other hand if you
wanted to make a lot of money as a
freelance developer I'm not saying we're
pres is equivalent to plumbing and in
terms of the crap but it is definitely
closer to plumbing in terms of the
demand and in terms of the money you can
make and we're pressed for point nine
underscores that and makes it even
better alright that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
