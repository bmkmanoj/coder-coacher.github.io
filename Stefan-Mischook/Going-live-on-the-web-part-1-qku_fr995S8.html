gonna be part one of two I'm gonna show
you how to take your website and how to
put it live on the web it's actually
pretty easy there's three things you got
to do number one you got to get a domain
name now just in case you don't remember
a domain name is a unique address on the
web so for example studio web comm is a
domain name google.com is a domain name
youtube.com is a domain name
also remember that domain name
extensions com org.net TV and there's
hundreds and hundreds of other options
remember that these are different
addresses so what I mean by that for
example google.com is a different
address from google.org keep that in
mind and when we actually go to register
domain name I'll show you how to do it
we'll look at more details about that
second step is you gotta find a hosting
company now a hosting company is just a
company that has a server that's
connected to the web 24/7 and they have
a web server remember a web server is
server software it's just an app that
sits on servers that's installed on
servers and it the webserver apps will
serve up web pages just like a waiter
serves your food so what you gotta do is
you gotta rent some hosting space some
web server space is called hosting pay
for hosting it's very inexpensive for
most for most web sites and once you get
your hosting your hosting company will
help you configure all of this it's
really simple it's really simple for you
they take care of it very quickly and
they'll send you a username and password
and then you just have to upload your
website your HTML files your CSS files
your JavaScript files your images your
videos or your sound files whatever is
on your website past event has to then
be uploaded to the web server and that's
it then you'll be live on the web so
we'll go through this step-by-step it's
actually pretty easy and that's pretty
much it so let's get to work
this is my nerd hat this
what I put on when I start coding all
right let's get to it all right so let's
take a look at the site we're gonna
upload this is it here it's just a
one-page site with a photo that we've
seen before here is the site files I
have an image and an index.html file if
you remember every website needs an
index.html file this is the first web
page of any web site so we have to have
that index.html file normally if I had
many images I would have an images
folder and most websites have many pages
etc etc but because I'm just demoing I'm
just keeping it simple so what we need
to do is we first need to register a
domain name so the way you do that is
you go to a company that allows you to
register domain names and a company that
does this is called a registrar
registrar so this is one of my sites
I've been writing this for a long time
now and one of the things we do do is
sell domain names now I'm just going
here because it's it's my site you can
go to any registrar you want there are
many out there and so let's click on
this link here domain name is only $9.99
per year so we click on that so that's
gonna take us to the part of the site
that allows us to buy domain names and
even buy a hosting you see a lot of
registrar's by the way we'll have the
ability for you to buy domain names from
them as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
