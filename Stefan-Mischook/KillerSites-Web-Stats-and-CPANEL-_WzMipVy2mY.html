killer sites calm in this video blog I'm
going to show you some web statistics
and from from cpanel you can learn a
little about a little bit about that and
I'm going to address a recent critic who
thought I was not telling the truth
about my web statistics so I'm going to
now login to the web host manager which
is basically a web interface that you
can get when you have a dedicated server
it's very useful to have because it
gives you a nice graphical interface
representing your your server now you
wouldn't have this unless you have a
dedicated server so let me just get in
here i'm going to list some of the
accounts so you see we have a whole
bunch of web sites that are locked into
the server there's more we're just on
the first page but what I want to do is
I want to show you some of the web
statistics and I'm doing this live now
so you see that I'm not fudging anything
so I'm going to launch the cPanel which
is very common web interface if you have
standard hosting account which allows
you to do all kinds of things like set
up a MySQL database check your web
statistics and so on so I'm going to
drop into the web statistics software
called a w stats so this is aw status or
killer sites calm and it gives you a
live statistics of your site now this is
up to now so let's look at last several
months here you can see terms of page
views in blue here at 1.5 million 1.4
million 1.5 million 1.5 million so you
can see that just killer sites alone
gets a million about a million 50
million for page views per month so I
had stated I'm scratching my eye here
I had stated in a previous video blog
but the killer sites network gets
millions of page views per month quote
unquote so that's just killer site so
let's go to another killer site in the
killer sites network killer PHP so we
had 1.5 million approximately into our
site so we go to killer PHP 8w stats
review that real-time now it's not as
popular of a site as you can see we got
a quarter million on average will say
per month so long june july is always
slow this time of year everybody's out
gardening not looking at PHP information
so 260 270 246 251 page views per months
control we got a 1.5 so workout 1.7 1.75
million page views so yeah we're not at
the millions yet but we have many other
sites in the killer sites network so
we'll try a how to build websites calm
so we go in here and again we'll just go
to the aw stats and you check out the
statistics
alright so again this site quarter
million pageviews quarter million
quarterman panel to 40 2 3226 little
slow last few months but we've also been
doing the server changes that affects
things so now we're almost at two
million pageviews just with the site as
you can see there's this hole here in
the statistics and the reason we have is
hole is because this is the transitional
period from the old server to nurse new
server you see when you're moving your
website from server to server there is a
transitional period where the DNS
servers around the world of domain name
servers around the world they are
updating so at one point between the
fourth and will say the tenth of July
some of the DNS servers were pointing to
my old server so there is no traffic on
this server here but we're seeing and
you know and part of it no so that's
what was going on here so we see that
there is no traffic here because all the
traffic all the DNS servers were still
going to be old sir so that's why
there's going to be a low and the server
traffic for this particular site will
all the sites actually on a network
because we had the same thing so we did
cure PHP killer sites how to build
websites which check out CSS tutorial
net scroll down again we go to a w stats
CSS tutorial nets so we're looking at
the live statistics now this is not as
popular site we get 200,000 to 2,200 201
I guess the summer so but now we've
officially pushed over 2 million
pageviews per month and as you can see
we have several other sites in the
network killer actionscript killer Ajax
killer Dreamweaver killer JavaScript or
photoshop now admittedly these other
sites are not as popular but you know
again collectively we're looking at
we're looking at well over two million
page views a month I haven't checked
recently but I think collectively were
somewhere between two and three million
page views a month on the network so
that would constitute millions of page
views there you go so that's it so I
wanted to you know I have to admit I
just wanted to prove a point that I was
not be essing about our websites
statistics in terms of the traffic
levels anyway and maybe you learned a
little bit about web statistics and you
know what let me just go back what a
killer better know well good we're gonna
but all CSS tutorial so we go back here
I want to look at the statistics now
this is for beginner so you may find
this interesting when you're looking at
statistics or several things you can
locate look at unique visitors unique
visitors number of visits pageviews hits
and bandwidth the most accurate I think
most people would say would be in terms
of measuring how much real traffic you
have is unique visitors but that's not
the case of my opinion because you well
it is and it is it because unique
visitors means you know somebody who's
come to your site uniquely within an
hour so when you have a number of visits
this means you see there's more writers
more visits been unique visitors and
this month for instance simply because
if visits measures how many times within
an hour somebody's come by so if you
know that's why you have 35,000 in april
for this site at 47 thousand visits
versus unique visitors that means a
certain percentage of these people came
more than once within an hour and that's
why you have 35 vs 47,000 now pageviews
tells you how how many views actual
pages have been seen by people this is a
very accurate measure because it gives
you an indication not of not it gives
you an indication of not
only how many people have hit your site
but how interested they are on your site
you see we've had 47,000 visits but the
view to give you two hundred thousand
pages so they've seen several pages a
few pages per user which is a good idea
about you know how sticky the site is
how they like the site let's look at
heads people still once in awhile talk
about hits hits are useless because this
is hits a short first server hit server
hit could be an image loading could be a
CSS file load it could be a JavaScript
page file loading within the same page
to be the pages it's a page itself of
course so hits are irrelevant because it
really depends on the pages that are
loading so I always look at page views
and I also look at uniques and visits
this is much more important to me so if
we scroll back up you can see that under
pages in the blue column here 99,000 so
far this month we have four point three
four pages per visit so when a guy comes
to site they tend to look at four pages
which is not bad you know if it was a
pornography site it would be 1000 pages
per visit mountain time even 1500 but
you get the idea it depends on the type
of site in terms of pageviews per user
and I'll have to leave that to another
video because I have to head out now
anyway I just want to address those
issues that's it I hope you learned
something and we'll talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
