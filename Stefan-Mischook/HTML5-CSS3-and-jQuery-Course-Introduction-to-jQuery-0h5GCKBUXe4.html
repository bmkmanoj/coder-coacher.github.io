about working with css3 html5 and some
of those basics I'm going to move on to
the section dealing with jquery now when
we discussed working with css3 I did
mention that some of those transforms
were not and transitions rather we're
not going to work in Internet Explorer
whether it's version 9 or otherwise or
earlier so what do we do in that
scenario what do I do when I can't work
with this transition that I've just done
and shown you in the previous videos
well along comes jQuery to the rescue
now for those of you who are new to
working with jquery i'm going to be
running you through some very very basic
stuff so if you're a complete beginner
you should be able to follow along with
no problem however i will take the
moment to mention that killer sites com
has a number of training tutorials that
are dealing specifically with jquery
however I also want to show you some
alternatives to the traditional jquery
and show you some other alternatives as
you can see here I'm just switching on
over to my finder and in the source
files that have been provided for you
you'll find html5 version 3 and with in
there you'll notice that there are a
number of different folders including
this archive folder but there are the
fonts that we've been dealing with our
CSS that we've been dealing with but
you'll also notice that there's an extra
CSS in here one called slideshow CSS and
we're going to run through that and I'll
show you exactly what that means but if
you open up the index HTML page that'll
take you to this example right here now
I've left this transition along with
some of the other elements but I've
changed some things like some of these
fonts I've substituted for a different
font you'll notice there's no transition
on the rollovers here as well but the
one difference between what we had
before and what we have now is this
element in the middle which is utilizing
jQuery check this out if I click on the
image it'll just slide through and show
me a fade between a number of different
repeating images
I also have here some navigation
elements and these little buttons here
are also going to be used to control
what we're looking at notice that if I
did click on this the little navigation
here also updates and lets us know which
of the different lengths that we have
and if we wanted to add more images
these things will be added in our code
as well so this is the basics of what
we're going to be looking at and I want
to take a few minutes to talk to you a
little bit about what jQuery is
especially for those of you who are
unfamiliar with this kind of work well
we can begin by looking at jquery's
website you navigate to jQuery com
you'll see this website that I showing
you before you right here and you'll
notice there's a couple of things in
here first of all it says jQuery is a
new kind of JavaScript library it's a
fast concise library that simplifies
HTML document traversing event handling
animating and Ajax interactions for
rapid web development jquery is also
designed to change the way you write
javascript so in other words what jQuery
allows us to do it's sort of a library
of pre-written JavaScript and jQuery is
just a different way of accessing that
information and as you'll see it's a
little bit easier than actually writing
a bunch of JavaScript already when you
know you kind of already know what you
want to have happen but you don't have
to necessarily reinvent the wheel and
jam and jQuery in particular is very
easy way for us and especially if you're
a beginner to start using animation in a
non flash and a non css3 environment so
let's take a look as you can see here it
says grab the latest version now there
are two different types of versions that
you can in fact grab either the
production version which is minified and
gzipped as it says here 31 k or the
development version now the development
version is an uncompressed code so you
can actually go in
and make your own changes to it but for
what we're working with we're just going
to be accessing some pretty simple stuff
so we'll be looking at a very minified
version of jQuery however it's not just
jQuery in particular that I want you to
be aware of i want you to also notice
that there's a lot of other things that
you can do first of all there's a whole
bunch of plugins that jquery will offer
you different things that are written by
any number of different people and for
the most part should be free for you to
use for example you can see like a
number of different types of information
inside here there are animation and
effects browser tweaks events forms
drag-and-drop layout information for
example if i just come in here and say
here's some layout information and
you'll see Oh a vertical scroller good
way to manage a long list well if you
look at that and if you want to view a
demo for this you'll see oh well here is
a simple scroller and when you press
next it just slides the information this
way so that just shows you like the
absolute potential there's so many
different things that you can work with
in a jQuery environment menus media tons
of different things that I want you to
be aware of and feel free to use however
you'll notice that on the jQuery website
there's also something that deals with
you I and I've just have it open in a
separate window right here jQuery UI
user interface and what is jQuery UI
well it's basically another type of
jQuery JavaScript library but it's built
on top of the existing one and what it
does is it has a number of as it says
here rich effects and UI widgets things
like these calendar elements powerful
theme frameworks right all pretty easy
for you to work with and if you look at
the demos and the documentation you'll
see for example here's draggable
elements right yeah look drag it around
and you'll see that there's the source
code for how that works you could just
look at it and once I explain a little
bit about how jQuery works you're going
to see that this is going to be pretty
easy for you to understand
if you don't really understand it right
now but there's plenty of information on
these websites that will allow you to
work with this as well as you can see
here you know there's events there's
constrain movement I can be dragged only
vertically I can be dragged only
horizontally pretty interesting stuff
and this one here only within its parent
container some really fun things that
you can sort of play with in the demos
and documentation droppable elements so
not just a simple drag-and-drop but here
you're dragging it and if you drop it
here nothing happens but if I drop it
here wow it gives us the message yes
it's been dropped so you can kind of
already imagine some of the potentials
for using this kind of work here is some
very common thing that you can do a
jQuery and as I'll show you soon enough
another library as well and this is the
tabs option as you can see here this is
all inside the same page it's not
loading separate information or anything
like that from separate areas this is
all inside the same page so how do we
get about working with this kind of
stuff not to mention the jQuery UI
information that we have here and you'll
see here widgets like the accordion
widget as I'll show you just a second
see that that's a pretty common thing
whether it's from menu systems or
otherwise but let me show you one of the
oftentimes overlooked jquery libraries
and that's called jQuery tools and its
interface looks a little bit cleaner
than some of the other ones that you've
seen but nevertheless it's still just as
powerful it's just a different way of
approaching it so again jquery tools is
a collection of the most important user
interface components for modern web
sites used by large sites all over the
world and that's true and they have a
number of different client lists of
people that use their particular website
let's take a look at jQuery tools in
particular and what does this library
have to offer us well much like the UI
we also have tabs and as i'll be showing
you tabs will be something that we can
look at as well there's tooltips there
overlays there scrollable elements and
we're going to be utilizing scrollable
tabs in just a second you can also work
with forms and toolboxes another connect
the collection of web essentials it says
here to embed flash and otherwise but
it's the tabs area that I want to look
at and as you can see here this is a
very common sort of tab scenario you
know and as you can see each one of
these will be within the container and
you can see that there is some quick
start information here but for those of
you that are brand new I'm going to be
running you through a lot of this
showing you more about how these things
work along with this though you'll see
that one of the elements here is the
slideshow plugin for tabs and now you
might recognize exactly what I'm using
here either clicking on it this way or
clicking on these buttons here to
navigate to it so the slideshow plugin
for the tabs is basically creating this
little slideshow effect that we see
right here and I'm using these graphics
because they suited our design as well
and that's fine I've removed some of the
elements in here for example I don't
have these back and forth buttons pretty
much because I didn't like them but
nevertheless right we can work with
functionality even without them and I
don't have this play which is basically
just a default play to it and we can
stop that of course but nevertheless i'm
going to be showing you how to affect
and implement this into your work one of
the things that will also take a look at
a little bit closer are the API methods
which will allow us to determine exactly
how we want our slides to take place and
what they're going to be doing for us so
when we come back in the next video I'm
going to start opening up our current
design and the one that I'm going to
provide for you and you can follow along
as we run through how to implement this
jquery slider system which we've found
on the jquery tools so come back in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
