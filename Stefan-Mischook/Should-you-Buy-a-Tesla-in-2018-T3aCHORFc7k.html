Tesla I would not buy a Tesla today
because a I hear Tesla's are notoriously
prone to breaking things breaking knobs
flying off etc I've heard this and I
totally from various people and I have
also heard that they're having major
production problems and apparently on
occasion when you smash a Tesla all the
batteries can blow up I would wait a few
more years because I think that the
major car companies BMW Audi Volkswagen
and Porsche Ford etc they're all coming
out with their own hybrid cars and
electric vehicles and frankly I think
they're gonna just be they're just going
to be better be better made because
they're created by companies that really
know how to make cars so I have no
interest in buying a Tesla at this time
also I just don't like the range limited
range that they have I don't like the
fact that it takes 25 minutes to
recharge I think that for the next I
know five years or so I think the better
choice would be a hybrid car so that
you're not dependent on electricity and
having to recharge your car at the
infrastructure in North America at least
is not there yet was the exception of
maybe if you're just driving within a
city then you're probably pretty cool
then that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
