name is Stef
the problem with node J s so I'm
recording this in late May 2016 and so
let's talk about node J s nodejs
in case you don't know is a new fairly
popular JavaScript server-side
environment or server-side engine node
will basically compete with Django and
Ruby on Rails and PHP laravel not quite
on top of node you use another MVC well
not another but an MVC framework called
Express j/s and there are others and
it's a very fast-moving area of web
development in terms of the fact that
the technology is evolving very quickly
so the main problem of node.js these
days is that it is immature it is
immature and things are moving fast and
it's quite messy and my recommendation
at this point in time is to use nodejs
for simple things create a micro service
with it
maybe something that you need it's a
synchronous meaning you need some fast
moving data like a chat app or something
but I will not use it as the backbone of
your main app yet unless you you are
okay with highly evolving and somewhat
experimental technology you'd be much
better off using something that's tried
and true for now whether that would be
something Python base like Django or PHP
base like laravel or Ruby on Rails or if
you want to get really heavy-duty Java
there you go that's very interesting so
would I use Java now to build a
brand-new web app no and you gotta
understand I'm a huge huge Java user in
the past that was my main language in
the late 90s early 2000s
and in fact I had written my own MVC
framework not nearly as sophisticated as
spring and so on but nonetheless quite a
lightweight framework using pojos plain
old Java beans and servlets and jsps and
work really well for the type of
projects I was building so back to node
nodejs or a digression there so the prom
with node is that it's still very early
in its lifespan and in time it will
mature the package is I think the
package manager knows NPM I'm not a node
user or expert I played around with the
very basics of it but I have a good
friend of mine who developed a key part
of his app in node so he used node just
for the chat app for the messaging
because it's super fast in that regard
but in terms of the main app he's still
using PHP laravel as the main the main
core a core of the app if you will and I
would suggest the same right now and you
can if you look out on the web you're
gonna see people experimenting and this
whole problem with new technologies
coming about and young nerds coming out
they're trying to use it and going wow
that's amazing then they find out it's
got quite two holes and all kinds of
problems and that's fine if you're
willing to deal with those problems
that's cool but you have to understand
that when you're in production and you
got to put out work and you're getting
pay for that work it's kind of silly to
be to have to deal with some immature
product you know it depends what you
want to do are you in the business of
maturing and immature product or are you
in the business producing an app for
your clients or for yourself so there
you go the problem with node is that it
is still immature
I've seen this time and time again new
technologies come out and at first
there's problems with them they she'll
promise some of them fall into oblivion
and some come out and do very well so I
would be
reticent I would be cautious of
residence the right word I don't know
anyway I would be cautious to jump in to
know just because it's still young it's
not a shot on it it's just still young
and you can get everything you want done
with other very well-established mature
frameworks that's it ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
