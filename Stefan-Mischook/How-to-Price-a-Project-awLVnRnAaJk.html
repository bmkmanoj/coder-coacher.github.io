Steph and let's talk about pricing out a
contract as a freelance developer this
is a question that was put to me today
and I just gonna give you a quick answer
because I'm just a little bit too busy
to go into all kinds of detail so number
one when you are first starting to price
out jobs whether you're a software
developer creating apps from scratch or
you're building websites or you're
modifying wordpress templates what have
you so what you should do is you do your
estimate as best you can and then what
you got to do is you should probably
multiply that estimate by 2.4 so if you
figure it's gonna take you ten hours bid
24 hours why because typically
especially when you're in the beginning
you're gonna under quote how much time
something takes to get done this is very
common that people new will under quote
because you just you lose track of how
long it takes to do things so yeah so
you make your best guesstimate in terms
of how long how much time it's going to
take and then you multiply that by 2.4
you get a more accurate assessment of
what it is well how much time so if it's
gonna take to do the problem that people
are faced like this guy who was talking
to me today was that he always seems to
under call at least that's the
impression so if he quotes 10 hours and
actually takes me 20 hours his pay is
effectively cut in half right because
most clients by the way when they're
hiring you as a developer they are not
going to want to pay you by the hour
they're gonna want to know you per hour
rate but then they're gonna say well I'm
going to pay X amount of dollars for
this project so you give them a quote
and that's how it's gonna work 90% of
the time this will change when you get
more experience and your clients comes
to know you have relationships then you
can start building by the hour
but typically especially when you're
freelancer small beginner they're gonna
want fixed rates on a particular project
but do you that you build for them what
you got to do though over time is it
through your ability to assess how much
time it takes you to do something so how
do you do this or you take detail and
meticulous logs that's what you got to
do it's a bit of a pain at first I know
but when you quote a project you should
have your one two page quote and I've
talked about this in other vlogs and
then you should line-item you know build
the database gonna take me four hours or
five hours whatever it is to build the
UI is gonna take me ten hours blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah
you should detail this some pretty good
details so that when you actually start
building your project you start noting
exactly how much time it takes you to
build out the database you say I'm
building out a 20 table database and
it's taken me ten hours or five hours or
whatever it is or four hours of planning
allowed and you got to keep meticulous
logs by breaking down the project from
database views UX work middle layer
middle layer work etc X that are set up
basic set up deployment times etc etc
etc you got two categories it this way
and keep meticulous logs so that at the
end of the project you can compare your
quote your estimate versus what the real
time was and what you find or very
quickly usually about three or four
projects you'll be able to see you how
you and where you underestimated and
you're gonna become much more accurate
with your quotes but you won't get more
accurate unless you start doing as I
said keep meticulous logs compare and
contrast your your quotes your estimates
with the reality of the situation you do
this and you're gonna be much better off
in the end as a software developer hope
that helps
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
