I did I didn't put it out the whole
video was like this I was totally blurry
because I wasn't paid attention to what
was going on and I screwed it up so now
I just go right here and I'll be back
and focus again because the Canon does
the Canon a TD some of the cannons
cannon a TD and the 1d x mark to the 5d
mark 4 I'm not sure of others they have
a few others have it they have the dual
pixel autofocus which is canons phase
detect I believe it's a phase detect
type of focusing system and it is far
superior to anything else on the market
so Canon knows this and so they wimpy
they wimp up their cameras in many other
ways and so guys like me swallow it
because we need that dual pixel
autofocus because if you're doing solo
video work as I'm doing now having to do
a pixel autofocus it's huge because
watch how quickly it focuses see now
it's gonna focus as a plant because I
put my focus point right here so this is
always gonna be in focus so yeah yeah
see I'm out of focus now my face is but
this is focused and I go right here hey
I'm back in focus this is the power of
the Canon auto focusing system pretty
cool stuff
alright that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
