figured I'd put out a Christmas blog I
have a few hours before the next
Christmas party it's Christmas Day
see I'm dedicated youtuber because I
know a bunch of you guys out there are
not into Christmas so I figured I'd put
out a quick vlog so in this vlog I'm
gonna answer a question that was
recently put to me what do you think of
this guy's YouTube walkthrough coating
tutorials generally speaking when it
comes to walk through tutorials I say
those are the second thing that you
should use to learn how to code number
one you're going to learn what I call
core those are the foundational concepts
and principles that are universal to all
programming languages all coding along
with the core you're also learning the
syntax the actual code which you're
ready but the more important thing is
the core concepts core techniques it's
funny I was at a party yesterday another
Christmas party and a friend of my
father's are there and hold a guy
retired and he had done a lot of C++
programming and C programming in his
time as a developer this whole thing
about programming came up and so on and
he was saying the same thing as I'm
saying to you any experienced developer
will tell you that but the key to being
a great developer to be a pro level
developer is having a solid foundation
in the core concepts of core techniques
because those translate across all
languages all libraries and in the end
by learning the core first you're gonna
supercharge the learning process you can
learn how to code much more quickly than
you would any other way and much more
thoroughly
why don't it consists in things that I
hear from people who try to learn how to
code with walkthrough tutorials on
YouTube or paid is that they come away
with a lot of gaps a lot of holes in
their knowledge they're not sure where
to begin it's only natural then they
come and they do my they do my core
training all of a sudden everything is
like super simple and here's the irony
if you learn your core principles first
all of a sudden all those walks with
tutorials become super easy so instead
of taking you ten hours to do a
walk-through takes you only one hour
you get the idea think of it this way if
you wanted to learn how to play an
instrument let's say you wants to learn
to play guitar now you can learn to play
guitar well learn to play guitar by
doing these tutorials of how to play
this song or how to play that song and
use me teach you how to play the chords
and they say do this chord then that
chord then this court not a problem with
learning how to play guitar by just
learning how to play the songs that you
don't learn anything about music or very
very very very very little you don't
understand about the notes about what's
sharp and flat you don't understand
about blue scales versus Josh skills you
don't learn the skills you don't learn
about how to properly hold your pick on
how to strum the strings to pay on the
style of guitar at you're playing you
get the idea if you learn the core and
the foundation of music and playing
guitar ulsan you can learn every song
like this but if you learn just how to
play the five five songs are you going
to come away with is the ability to play
five songs and you go if you try to go
play in a band say I can play these five
songs so yeah but can you play any of
these other songs and you're going to be
going no same thing with programming
learn the core first once you've got
your core foundation in there then you
can jump into projects now the way I
have set it up I've been teaching since
2003 another professional developer
since the nineties the way I set up my
training is based on all my years of
experience I teach the core and it's
interactive like almost having me
sitting beside you giving you hints
helping you along etc etc anyway and
then once you got that down then I
provide a whole bunch of projects for
you to choose from now here's the thing
you've got a whole bunch of project
reality the situation is you you you do
let's say the paypal shopping cart
project where you learn how to been a
full-blown e-commerce site but
integrates with PayPal processes credit
cards and PayPal and it does a
calculation taxes and shipping etc
except once you've done that one project
you're pretty much you're going to have
all the skills that you need to do any
other type of project now again you
can't just go do the project first you
have to do
Foundation training then you jump into
project so I provide a bunch of project
for you to choose from and you decide
which way you want to go or you do my
foundation training then anything that
you see on the on YouTube or any other
site on the web any project-based
walkthrough then all sudden it becomes
really really easy again instead of
spending ten hours you do it in one hour
so the key component of a great coding
course what you should look for is
number one core foundational training
number two some real-world projects
real-world projects that's proper with a
lot of things I see on the web - they'll
teach how to create a shooter game in
Python it's almost a waste of time
because know what nobody creates shooter
games with Python Python is using a IML
machine learning Python is using web app
creation Python is using server
automation bars using data scientists
and processing data nobody makes a game
with Python so why would you teach
somebody I guess you can already just
kind of fun you make a game with Python
but you made a game that you don't have
anything real there so you should be
teaching real stuff so we might interact
a web developer course guess what people
do with web development coding they
build ecommerce systems are integrated
PayPal right that's why I teach that I
don't teach how to create a shooter in
JavaScript why because nobody uses
JavaScript great shooters yeah I guess
it's fine if you have time to wait you
can do that but I figured you don't have
time to waste
you know this channel is not just about
coding is about being an entrepreneur is
about getting out there making money
with the code whether it's a job or if
it's an entrepreneurial thing whether
they're freelancer thing so I always try
to bring in the realism into what I
teach so by the way if they're part
about any good coding course is the
career aspects of it and the
specializations so first one is first
level of good coding courses core
training second level is the some
projects the third level should be
career the career aspects so you
understand what the career paths are for
a particular language or particular type
of programming what you're doing and
then the specialization so for instance
in my Python course I teach you two
three
career paths which is of course job
getting a job
becoming a freelancer or building your
own Python programs that you sell into
the marketplace I talked about the
different paths how to get there with
each one the pros and cons etc etc and
then you got the specializations within
Python because it's broad-based you got
several specializations you got data
sciences you got AI and ml you got web
app development etc in the web stack
there's different specializations within
a website getting to be a full stack
developer you could be a front-end
developer you could be a wordpress
professional again pros and cons of each
different personality types different
opportunities each I teach this this is
the difference between a real course
that teaches you real-world job ready
money-making skills versus walkthrough
tutorials or piecemeal things that's
going to waste your time you have to
think about that finally a good teacher
should bring two things to the course
two fundamental thing number one the
course should be easy my job is to
simplify this stuff number two I have to
choose the good things the important
things in each of the technologies or
the languages that you need so you think
about it any of the programming
languages out there even the coding
languages like CSS HTML any of these
languages they're huge especially like
programming languages like Python Java
PHP c-sharp etc whatever pick up
language they're big they do a lot the
thing is you're not going to use 90% of
language 90% of the time most of the
time you're using a small subset of the
language which you use day-to-day so me
as a teacher my job besides simplifying
is to pick out the key aspects of the
languages and present those to you to
create that solid foundation so you can
launch your career it regardless of the
career path that you want to take right
I am able to judge what is important in
JavaScript in PHP Ian Python because of
my two decades experience as
professional developer I know what
concepts are important what basic
techniques are important and I provide
that for you so you have that foundation
unfortunately you got a lot of courses
out there put out by academics a lot of
them don't want to teach sorry and a lot
of them I can tell but they've never
been in the real world and actually
written real code in a production
environment so they teach a lot of
unnecessary things so for example if
you're a developer you don't need to
learn 10 different ways to to iterate
through collections you know it's not
ten depending on the language you get
the idea you just need to know the
important things and then once you have
those foundational concepts once they're
locked up in your head you understand
them and if you need to learn something
else you learn them on the need to nerd
basis that's what I always tell people
learn on a need-to-know basis because in
a final point you see so many frameworks
out there and you see languages come in
and out of favor I remember you know
whatever X X number of years ago I don't
know seventy years ago ActionScript was
huge action oh yeah actually script now
there's I scripted zero dead over so if
you thought of yourself is only an
action script develop you're like ah but
on the other hand you learn to be an
advanced developer and you thought of
yourself as a developer ActionScript is
one of the tools in the toolbox just
like any of the other languages that are
out there both the ActionScript jazz
Java Python whatever they're just tools
in the toolbox and when I migrated when
I finally made the leap from being an
intermediate level of developer to
advanced developer is when I realized
that I said I just just write whatever
language that is best for the job so
what I would walk into a job as a
freelancer I would sit down with the
client evaluate what their needs were
and depending on the technical needs and
the business needs and I'll describe
that in another video I chose a
particular language or a particular
framework that they needed and in fact
on several occasions I would choose a
language or a framework I had never
worked with before but because I had a
solid
foundation the core concepts and
principles it was the easy for me to
jump into a new language it's easy for
me to jump into a new framework alright
that's it I gotta get ready to go got
another Christmas party to go to
and this one's with friends so it should
be a lot more fun than the Christmas
party with my family just joking the
family is great alright job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
