vlog I should look at the camera my very
first vlog and I'm gonna be using my
cheap Euler webcam here because I'm
gonna do mailbag so I'm answering a
question you can see it on screen right
here so let me just quickly read it
Steph I decided I don't want to be a
programmer what I'm just kidding
well maybe read on but I still have the
ability to make nice-looking functional
websites using WordPress top-notch skill
I'd be perfectly happy making 25 an hour
or whatever or whatever as a WordPress
person rather than making 60 an hour
doing code that is complicated for me
every day I can see that appeal so first
comment 225 an hour over 60 60 an hour
it all depends on where you live in the
world different markets will give you
different price points in terms of your
per hour wage that being said yes
hardcore app developers in whatever
language probably will make more than
somebody who works just as a wordpress
you know theme creator config and
configures WordPress car girl that being
said if you set up a company first as a
freelancer where you're doing exclusive
WordPress work WordPress installations
WordPress theme work that kind of stuff
you could probably make a lot more than
you think maybe as much as a coder would
if not well maybe as much as the code of
would because there's such a huge demand
for WordPress so that's a good
profession to get into but very few
places talk about being a wordpress
consultant would really like you hear
your take on it
so mister mark another I'm answering
about email bono by comment yeah it's a
great it's a great place to go and I
think that you learn your html5 your
css3 of course touch it the JavaScript
just a taste don't we
huge programmer just a touch so you can
mess around with JavaScript theme
JavaScript in your themes WordPress
themes maybe little bit of jQuery
because they're probably leveraging
jQuery anyway and I would also learn
just a touch of PHP just so like my
beginners PHP course just so you know
your way around PHP you're comfortable
with it because as you know WordPress is
created with PHP and so when you're
messing around with code a little bit of
JavaScript code little PHP code you're
not so much a developer but you're more
of a script or a programmer somebody
who's playing around so you're not
developing apps from scratch which is a
huge job you're modifying apps adding a
little bits of functionality maybe
writing a little quick little plugin so
that is a very viable profession
WordPress consultant could be making big
money and if you position yourself right
as a freelancer you can make much as
much or more than a coder working for
somebody that's for sure so yeah that's
a great profession get in there it's a
nice blend of nerd skills
we're press skills WordPress theme
skills a little bit of coding skills
with html5 css3 so you can do responsive
theme work and maybe a touch of
JavaScript and jQuery and touch a PHP so
you can get deeper into WordPress as you
know we're press seems are built of PHP
pages so understanding PHP is kind of
beneficial there again not becoming a
full-fledged app developer so I'm gonna
end this mailbag with this comment by
Todd booth be in my video was the video
call again scroll into how to become an
entrepreneur in 2017 that was a video I
put out last night in fact Firefox is
really bad browser these days it's
making my little my little multicolored
ball spin in Mac anyhow so he writes I
think that quote is from Milton's
Paradise Lost yes I think you're right I
talked about
while you swatch that vlog or I talked
about starting a small business being an
entrepreneur in 2017 I quoted something
from Star Trek which quotes something
from Milton's Paradise anyway whatever
you are right in addition to everything
else so why not write a book on becoming
an entrepreneur or write a memoir about
your experiences I enjoy writing Cheers
all right well thanks Todd maybe
depending on how you know time time
quite busy with other work but I will
keep it in mind but I might set up a
vlog series for 2017 more specific to
entrepreneurial more specific to
entrepreneurs rather than coders of
course it will be a blend of Technology
and entrepreneurs because these days if
you become an entrepreneur you have to
really understand the technology space
you have to understand what tools you
have out there for instance interns own
the different languages got different
types of hosting perhaps what languages
might be better suited for a sticky or
type of software or web app that you
might produce for your small business
you might look at the way to manage your
back-office using modern technologies
all cloud-based stuff actually I got a
vlog on cloud based business activities
if you will coming out pretty soon all
right
that's about it very short vlog this
time around happy new year once again
