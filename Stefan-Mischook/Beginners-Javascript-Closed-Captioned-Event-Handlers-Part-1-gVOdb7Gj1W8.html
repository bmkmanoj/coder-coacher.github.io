jump back into code specifically I want
to look at something called event
handlers before i get into event
handlers i just wanted to point out that
this is a one of the classic examples of
where learning javascript or a concept
in javascript will apply will have
application rather and many other
languages that are out there for
instance event handlers or mechanism
that you see in languages like
ActionScript like Java C sharp and
several others so by learning event
handlers in this video and in JavaScript
you will pretty much have learned a lot
about event handlers and many other
languages so down the road when and if
you decide to pursue other languages
you'll it's going to be a lot easier for
you because you will already have learnt
it in JavaScript so if there's ever
times that you're sitting through one of
my videos or maybe you're learning
another language and you're getting a
little bored and you're wondering what's
the point just keep that in mind that a
lot of times with the concepts that you
learn in one language will help you
understand or will be pretty much the
same thing as in another language
there'll be a little bit of difference
in the way it's executed in the
different languages but that's not the
hard part the hard part is understanding
the basic concept to begin with and one
last point about this javascript is a
great language to learn with because
it's a language that's based on the C
programming language and why that's
important is because many other
languages like I mentioned for our
JavaScript Java C sharp action script
which is flashes programming language
and of course Java scripts are all based
on C so having that same route will make
it really easy for you to jump from one
to the other and today in web
programming or what
design these are all interesting
languages although in a Java C sharp
that's more for building really hardcore
server-side programming but a lot of you
may want to get into action script for
instance later on and for you to go from
JavaScript to action script will be
really easy
what our JavaScript event handlers well
I'm going to read through a couple
points and then we're going to jump into
some cold right away because i think
it's just going to be a lot easier to
understand when you see the code in
action but let's just start off with
these points event handlers are built-in
mechanisms that basically scan for
actions or events to happen in your web
page so for example when someone clicks
on on a paragraph or some piece of text
on your page that if event handler is
called on click think of it as on the
click when somebody moves a mouse over
an image or a paragraph or anything in a
web page that event handler would be
called on mouse over when a page is
loaded into the web browser that's
called on load
before I go on with this new theory
let's just jump into some code I'm gonna
pop open my code editor I'm just going
to use adobe cs4 dreamweaver be
consistent again you can use any text
editor but you feel comfortable with
that's up to you even know patters fine
i just use it because it's kind of nifty
so let's i'm using a trial so I'm
expecting that little trial window to
pop open here we go yeah yeah I got 20
more days so now that you have to buy
this I guess index very ok we got our
simple web page here not very exciting
but it will be soon ok so I got a
paragraph so I'm just going to add an
event handler so I'm going to go see
that little drop-down list that's
extremely ver that giving me options as
you can see here it gives me all these
options are code hinting almost so you
got on click on double click on key down
on keypress onmouseup mouse down over
alt over him you know this is um what
you call it these are all different
event handlers that you can apply to
paragraph so Dreamweavers intelligent
enough to figure out what we're trying
to do so it gives us these options so
I'm just going to dope don't click on
that so on click so what are we going to
do on the click so we're just going to
say I'm going to pop up our handy alert
box we've seen this in a previous video
and I say there we go so let's let's
preview that in a browser and see what
it looks like all right now i'm using
firefox here I just shrink this into
screen size here we go so I'm gonna use
firefox so i Jes i'll click on it
nope nothing happen error or error
what's the error I know why you see we
talked about the alert in a previous
video and if you notice on click I have
to use when i call on click this event
handler I have to use the quotes here
double quotes to surround it anything
let me just select all this Oh cut it
out anything in between these brackets
are going to be called by the browser
what I mean called I mean it will fire
it off so you can put function to the
record of all kinds of stuff in there
this is for JavaScript riots all
JavaScript anything in between these two
things it's like as I can click body and
body it's like P&amp;amp;P anything in between
these two things will be responded will
be activated there's a word will be
activated by a web browser when somebody
clicks on this paragraph right because
we apply the on click on the paragraph
so I put in the classic alert now the
reason didn't work is because in
JavaScript you can't have a quotes you
can't have double quotes inside of
double quotes you have to have a single
quote have to go like this see a single
quote save so there's a little
JavaScript tip this is pretty consistent
actually so let's now refresh this try
again there we go ouch you click me so
what can we take away from this number
one you can apply event handlers and
there are many we just like we looked at
on clickers one on to all kinds of
elements on our page right just about
any element that people interact with
right you wouldn't apply an event
handler to title because people can't
really interact with the title because
the title of the page appears up here
right so we know that we can apply event
handlers two elements on our page when
talking about elements tags and so far
from the image
but we also know that we can apply
different types of event handlers like
we had on click right so when we go back
here I click on something the alert pops
up so what that does is that on the
click do this and in this case we said
call this alert box here and that's just
one example your first introduction to
an event handler what's put in another
one it's going to be Mon mouse over my
right right out one save it I'll refresh
the page so i'm not going to click it
was going to run my mouse over see how
popped up I just have to run my mouse
over it pretty cool
there's a
more to event handlers in Jeff's repay
and we're going to explore that in the
next couple of videos what or 2 i'm not
sure how many more we're going to do
after this so this is just just the end
of video number one on event handlers
and i'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
