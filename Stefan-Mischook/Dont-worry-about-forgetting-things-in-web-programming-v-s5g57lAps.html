killer sights calm and killer PHP calm
in this video blog I want to talk about
remembering code remembering functions
remembering classes so let me jump into
this a bit more one of the things I
dealt with early on in my web
development career was my insecurity in
the fact that I was forgetting class
names function names even CSS properties
at times and what you're gonna discover
as you learn more and more and more of
this web stuff you're going to find that
you're going to forget things on a
regular basis and I'm here to tell you
that if you forget stuff
I wouldn't mind too much about that
don't worry about it the important thing
about web programming and web design is
understanding the process having good
design abilities whether it be the
aesthetic design look or whether it be
the design of your class structure if
your web programming knowing you know
specific little details about what what
a particular CSS property might be to do
you know X Y or Z or whether what the
exact function name is what the function
arguments are in PHP or any other
language really it's not important and
in fact when you use an integrated
development environment an IDE basically
a program designed to facilitate the
process of writing software whether it
be Java Ruby c-sharp C++ PHP they
actually have a facility built in a
functionality built into these programs
so it does code completion a code hit T
so you start writing out a function
and the program will tell you what are
your options because any experienced
programmer knows that you're going to
forget you're not going to remember it
was there I'll tell you what when I was
first getting into Java way back in the
day I guess mid mid to late 90s I wrote
everything with no pattern you know
Windows notepad and I you know I was
able to write my call and stuff but a
lot of times I would forget function
methods method signatures as they call
basically those are the arguments and
the details about the various methods in
the Java Y in Java rather and so I would
look it up but I do it the spine I get
in a line program but then when I
finally broke down so I'm gonna get an
IDE an integrated development
environment one of these programs that
helps programmers program all of a
sudden it was doing all this code
completion automatic to automatically
tell me what the options are and I was
able to write myself for it much more
quickly much more efficiently and then
you realize as you've written you know
you're first you're second when you're
on your tenth piece of software you
start realizing that I'm just you know
knowing the specific details it's not
it's not that important because you know
what's important again is its its
understanding of how to architect these
things properly understanding how to
structure your color properly how to
layout page properly how to make it
usable how to make it search
engine-friendly or you know back to code
how to write efficient functions or
efficient methods and methods and
functions safe today you know right
that's another story if you're into
programming so what to take away from
this video blog if you're learning with
stuff and you're feeling a little down
as I did at one point because you're
forgetting things that you used to know
or your high to get the
you forget that I kind of remember these
things no memory games like this are
always things that are important if
you're in elementary school and you're
learning your ABCs or learning to count
to 10 when it comes to the Vans advanced
programming it's the least important
aspect of the whole the whole profession
so in fact I rather take a highly
experienced Java guy who understands
coding programming and how to structure
code and how to make a rate efficient
functions right I rather have a guy like
this and say okay here we got to do this
in Ruby or we're going to do this thing
in PHP I know that this Java guy who
have years of experience developing
applications will be a better Ruby
programmer a better PHP programmer that
a beginner who's only done one year of
maybe some PHP or six months of PHP or
Ruby simply because he hasn't
experienced was that experience of
reading applications and understanding
how to do these things properly
transfers perfectly you know it doesn't
know anything about the PHP syntax even
though it doesn't know specific function
names and so on you'll still be better
or she will be better because the of
that broad understanding same thing with
CSS HTML it's again it's about having a
global understanding that differentiates
the beginners from the experts not
somebody
remember specifics and tactical nuances
about a particular language alright
that's it I hope you found that
interesting and don't mind the cars
again because this is a video blog and
not an official video I don't care about
cars going on in the background so I'm
just recording this in my living room
and when an idea pops up in my head</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
