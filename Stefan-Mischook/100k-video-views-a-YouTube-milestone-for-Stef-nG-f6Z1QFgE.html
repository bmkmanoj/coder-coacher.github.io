milestone today where a video I
published October 1st 2016
whatever six seven months ago I got a
hundred thousand views on this video for
me this is a milestone the very first
video that has gotten a hundred thousand
views or more and not bad it's ironic
because it's on my video should you
learn C++ where I stayed at the very
beginning of the video
I've never coded in C++ so people are
asking me I got I got a bit of grief you
see I got two hundred and thirteen
thumbs down 954 up people gave me the
thumbs down there uber nerds who were
complaining about my statements about
assembler I was not exactly precise but
that wasn't the point of video the point
of video is just to say yeah there's
there's lots of work opportunity in C++
when you watch my should you learn this
language or that language videos people
watch them you begin to realize a
pattern the pattern is all these
languages have their pluses and minuses
and really the language you choose
really depends on the type of work you
want to do in the type of project you
want to build in the case of
entrepreneurs and you can't go wrong
learning any programming language and in
fact with this YouTube experiment
meaning building up this YouTube channel
as a as a hobby if you will this has
been great too because I've gotten to
meet a lot of different people I've got
my message out so it's kind of cool
anyway milestone for me I know in the
grand scheme of things it's pretty much
not so much a hundred thousand views on
a single video not too bad let's see if
I can get two quarter million views on a
single video that's my next goal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
