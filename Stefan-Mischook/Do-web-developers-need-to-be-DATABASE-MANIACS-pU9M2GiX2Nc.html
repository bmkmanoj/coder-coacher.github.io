I'm gonna answer a question that
actually answered in the comments on
their blog and that was do developers
need to be good administrators of
databases didn't need to be network
administrators short answer is no that's
why you have DBAs DBA is short for
database administrators network
administrators network net and mint I
don't know what they are Mollison anyway
so know as a developer you don't need to
be a DBA but you do need to have good
basic knowledge of databases so that
means that you should understand how to
create databases how to properly create
tables how to do table normalization and
other and the basic crud operations crud
is CR UD that's create read update and
delete these are the basic things that
you do with databases now before I go on
I just want to point out there are
different types of databases what I've
been talking about now I've been talking
about the most popular type of database
in the world and that is the SQL
database or the more proper name is the
relational database and I'm not going to
get into the theory of databases in this
particular video but SQL is short for
structured query language and it is a
coding language used to talk to
relational databases and relational
databases are the most popular type of
database in the world just like there
are different types of cars or sports
cars and or sedans and coupes and pickup
trucks I guess of truckers on a car but
you get the idea there are different
types of databases so relational
databases example MySQL post-grad Oracle
sequel Microsoft sequel server these are
all examples of databases and they are
by far and away the most popular type of
database in the world today anyhow so do
you need to be an expert in these
databases no you don't you just need to
know your way around the basic
operations and so on there are other
types of database so he has a relational
databases or something called an object
based database what gets into
object-oriented programming and then you
have of course the simple flat file
database now a fly file database it's
just really just a text file where you
put like a a record you might put like
what say it was a shopping cart site and
you want to record order so you would
have one line of code with a list of the
products and then each record would be
separated by a carriage return now this
could be useful for very small and
simple databases but I wouldn't
recommend using them since you have all
these databases that are ready for you
to use these data base ops that are
simple and easy to use so why do does
why do most people use relational
databases because they just been around
for X 3040 years now or longer and
they're very refined and they work very
well
there are object based databases out
there which are used as well each type
of database has its pros and it's cons
and I'm not gonna get into that here all
the differences but I just want you to
be aware that there are different types
of databases as a developer you don't
have to be an expert you just need to
know your basics what are the basics
their basic queries like I mentioned for
the crud operations maybe some slightly
advanced queries that you could do like
inner joins outer joins but yeah do that
on the side it's not really necessary
that you be an expert in these things
because they don't they don't come up
too often especially with the new arm to
tools ORM object relational mapping
tools would you see that a lot of
frameworks like alarm Val or like rails
will use so you don't really need to be
an expert at low level SQL queries when
I say low level meaning talking directly
to the database but you still you should
still know how to design tables
effectively so that the data is held
effectively and that's called
normalization of tables so whole
different subject I know covering a lot
but you know it's a YouTube blog what do
you want yeah so you should know how to
design pretty decent database structures
so that so that your code the code your
app code whether you be writing in peach
the Ruby or Java or Python so that your
app code is effective is also efficient
in terms of querying database because
for most of us out there 99% of our apps
are going to be taking in information
from users and then sending it massaging
that information and then sending it to
the database and then pulling that
information back out again and
processing it and doing whatever you
want with it sending emails or process
you know computing data that's what most
of the work is data in massage data out
massage that's really what it is so you
got to know your way around databases
another thing I want to bring up here is
that when you are building your coding
skills and building experience as a
coder I can tell you from you know from
my experience since 1994 when I wrote my
first bit of code that over the time
you're gonna forget a lot of details
like I used to know for instance a lot
of details about database normalization
and theory down to the particular
database because for instance MySQL
would be more efficient in certain areas
and let's say sequel server in other
areas vice-versa so when you were
working with a particular database
server whether do MySQL pull square what
not you would have to you have to get to
know that particular database app so
that you can optimize your structure of
your databases accordingly I forget most
of this stuff now now if I went got back
into it it spent a couple hours it all
start coming back to me I am sure and
it'll be some changes so this brings me
to my final and larger point about all
this stuff the most important thing you
have to learn as a developer and is
something I've stressed in other vlogs
is that the basics are super important
the basics are what carries you for
throughout your career the basics are
universal so let me give you some
examples for instance when you're
writing code understanding good object
hierarchy and structure is very
important so we know if you're a coder
whether it be Python Java or PHP
designed by inheritance is not a good
thing to do
your coat is brittle you're much better
off designing your your object layers
your code layer router buy-in interfaces
using interfaces for instance and that's
just one example you should know the
basic design patterns MVC you shouldn't
stand iterative iteration you should
understand things like well by favorite
design pattern by FAR's filtering and
facade and there's several other basics
you should understand the basic
methodologies of refactoring get a good
book on code refactoring these are the
skills these basic skills that are gonna
carry you forward regardless of the
language or the environment you find
yourself in a year from now or five
years from now or ten years from now
these are universal principles these are
Universal techniques for lack of better
terms you know I got this actually this
idea this principle from martial arts I
did martial arts for two three decades
and it always comes down to the basics
that separates the good fighters or the
crappy fighters you know in martial arts
its timing tactics in the order of
importance timing tactics mental
physical community mental and physical
conditioning body mechanics these are
and speed and power these are the things
that separate the good fighters on the
bad now you notice in that list I
mentioned with martial arts I didn't
mention techniques you know the little
techniques and this type of stuff that
you see this stuff is the least
important aspect of fighting and in
software developments the same thing you
know understanding the latest trick in a
particular language or typical earning
to take the next popular framework is
not what separates the great coders it's
understanding these basic things that
basic design patterns basic good clean
coding practices that's what matters
anyway to close you don't need to be a
DBA you don't need to be a database
administrator to be a coder you just
need to know your basics you don't need
to be a network administrator you just
have to understand the basics of
networks
understand the basics of the HTTP
communication process I forget the word
hypertext Transfer Protocol the
communication protocol of the web if
you're doing Web Apps you just need to
know these basics and then from there
you can if you need a particular piece
of knowledge and a particular you know
in the case of databases you can look it
up or worst case scenario you can hire
in a DBA an expert and they can solve
that one little problem for you I hope
you find that useful and we'll see you
in the next video ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
