video I want to talk about what I'm
going to be doing going forward with the
YouTube channel now if you look through
my YouTube history you can see that we
started putting videos up I guess around
2007 2008 well we had one of my
assistants I said yeah I just throw up a
bunch of videos and you can see how I
was not nearly as comfortable as I am
today in front of the camera not that
I'm great or anything so I look at
what's on there in terms of the video
collections and there's plenty of videos
out there on coding you can find all
kinds of stuff a lot of it not too good
some of it very good it depends on what
level of learning you are see that's the
thing when you're beginner a lot of
content out there is sucks because most
of the people who are teaching in these
videos are not teachers they're coders
and believe it or not there is a
technique there is a practice there is a
skill to teaching and when you got adult
learners or people already know a bit
about a subject it's pretty easy to put
out a course so it's a lot easier for
somebody to put out an advanced
JavaScript course than it is to put out
a very basic you know JavaScript 101
course and that separates the good
teachers from the bad teachers is the
good teachers can teach the basics
really well that's the hard stuff so if
you look at my video collection in
killer sites going back to 2003 I always
took care of the beginners material
because that was the hardest to do need
I did some advanced stuff but then I
just I would bring in some people to do
the advanced courses that I have because
those are a lot easier to teach anyhow
I'm not saying I'm the greatest teacher
out there but I come from a family of
teachers my studied learning theory in
psychology
I taught martial arts for years so I
have a bit of a background in terms of
that you got a you know in life you got
to recognize your talents and you have
to recognize where
you are weak and if you oh if you are
weak in a particular area you got to
bring in the talent around you people
around you to take care of that deficit
to take care of that problem where that
area where you're not necessarily too
good at so when it comes to what I do
here and producing courses and so forth
I find that my my talent is in teaching
is in breaking down the simplicity and
where I'm not talented it's like singing
for example I'm terrible at that if this
was a I was a guy trying to make a
living as a singer it would be a
disaster so you really have to
understand where your talent lies and be
honest about it and that could be within
the context of development and coding in
of itself you may be good at a
particular type or a particular level
coding so give me you let me give you an
example so I have somebody a know and
they are horrendous bad at architecture
you have him designed you know let's put
a real-world example or analogy to this
let's say you you took this guy he said
design a car for you and he is so bad at
architecture at designing he would put
the steering wheel of the car in the
backseat you wouldn't have any brakes
and you would go to obey dude where it
breaks and he would say to you you
didn't ask for brakes and he said why is
the steering wheel in the backseat goes
I don't know I thought it would be kind
of cool to have it back there on the
other hand the same dude if you say
listen I want you to design the best gas
pedal and brakes this pedal system out
there and he would do an amazing job on
the brake pedal and the gas pedal alone
so you have to understand this guy has
to has to understand that he's no good
at architectures but he's good at
detailed work developing like encoding
he might be really good at developing
microservices so that's just one example
of somebody I know who is a coder and
within the context of coding he has a
particular strengths and on the other
hand
weakness so I'm the same way in terms of
coding or certain types of coding I'm
actually pretty good with architecture
I'm pretty good with UX and UI I'm
really good with detailed algorithms and
recursion and all this kind of stuff
yeah I'm not the best at it I can do it
it works well fortunately having to
write a highly efficient code these days
has more to do with architecture then
fine grained algorithms and the reason
that is is because computers and servers
are just so bloody fast these days so
yeah that's it
so in this channel I think what I'm
going to concentrate on is instead of
code and finding all kinds of doing all
kinds of little coat the tours that are
out there I'm gonna concentrate on the
business end of coding the practical end
the coding so not just the business and
the contracts and doom of clients and
collecting and managing your accounts
and so on but also how you should
consider business issues with regards to
your technological choices that makes a
big deal the difference there so for
example when does it make sense to
deploy your app your website to the
cloud versus using a more traditional
server when does it make sense to go
with a dedicated server versus a shared
hosting plan etc etc etc etc etc there's
all kinds of implications in terms of
cost and time and so on depending on the
type of project so we're going to be
running through these type of things and
yeah so finally you may or may not know
is that I'm a published author my book
came out I think it was July 2015 here
it is still on sale and Amazon's getting
great reviews this is a beginners book
covers html5 css3 javascript I touch on
a little bit on just a little bit of
touch on jQuery bootstrap this is this
book is designed for a total beginner
who wants to get up and running quickly
understand the big picture and then from
there you can drill into much more
detail through other books or my course
online whatever whatever whatever is
options for you so anyway so I'm an
offer and yeah I'm an author and yes I'm
plugging why not plug and the reason I
mention is because I've also written for
major web design magazine so I kept some
of them here like for this this magazine
here you've probably seen it in stores
there's an old cover right 2007 but I've
been writing for these guys for years
and what I just wrote a piece actually
if it's going to appear as an editorial
and I'm not sure what issues coming out
but it's coming out pretty soon within
the next couple months in web designer
magazine and I even though I don't even
know what I talked about so yeah there
you go so that's coming out just a
little announcement a little plug and
you also see some of my JavaScript
videos I released them in web designer
magazine as well those are coming out I
believe in this month and next month's
issue so that's there for you you can
view that and that's it for now so as I
said earlier or maybe I didn't because I
did two takes of this I'm going to be
doing a lot more of my video vlogs with
the webcam because there's just a lot
easier for me rather than breaking out
the big camera and that's it Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
