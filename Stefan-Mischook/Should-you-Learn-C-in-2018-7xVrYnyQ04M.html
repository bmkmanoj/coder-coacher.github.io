ever put out was on should you learn C++
in 2016 I was funny to me because I just
threw it out there because people are
asking and the first line I think in
that video I said I never written
commercial code in C++ and then I go on
and then a lot of people attacked me
said how can you comment on C++ if
you've never written code commercially I
did hello world that's pretty much it
well I can comment on it because I'm a
professional software developer for over
20 years and I've written software nine
different languages commercial software
and so I have a pretty good idea what
the market is like and generally
speaking so if I've driven you know ten
nine different types of race cars but I
haven't driven the tenth I can still
comment on the tenth type of race cars
ever driven them as arathi you know I
know enough about cars at this point
know about enough about racing and I'm
sure I would have heard a lot about what
that Maserati cars are like relativity
the other nine types of cars I've driven
I can comment on that same thing with
C++ now I've never written C++ code
before in a commercial sense but I know
what C++ is all about and I understand
the market because I understand software
development and I understand the market
now is C++ still a viable option 2018
well we're at two thousand two months
away from 2018 for sure C++ is going to
be viable I would imagine for at least
another ten years although I'm hearing
from people friends of mine who are C++
coders are saying it's getting pretty
messy because they're constantly trying
to retrofit C C++ to make it be able to
follow the paradigm du jour the current
hot way of were writing code and they're
saying he's telling me this for his
opinion but it's a bit of a mess now C++
will have his place for quite a while I
would imagine longer because it's highly
highly performant so you're going to see
being used to build gaming engine
and reading low-level type of speed
centric apps maybe AI type of engine so
use the rate the kernel and C++ and then
to do everything else in Python or and
go or something so yeah C++ is still
viable I think the most important thing
you have to consider when you're looking
at any programming language whether it
be C++ Java JavaScript Python PHP ruby
swift you have to look at the type of
work ti not ity PE the type of work that
you want to do that's such an important
thing because C+ C++ programming is a
totally different beast than doing
JavaScript programming or doing Python
programming it's a totally different
thing
it takes a different mindset really it's
like a sprinter versus a long-distance
runner
right the body of the sprinter is
totally different the training of the
sprinters totally different versus the
marathon runner they're both great
athletes they're both to be respected
but it's a different game so what you
should do if you're considering C++ look
at the type of work that it is and maybe
try the hello world and understand what
you got to do because with C++ it's a
low-level language meaning it's reading
closer to CPU meaning you got to handle
a lot more details you got a handle
memory management you got a handle it's
just a lot more verbose it takes a lot
more code and you can sleep a lot and
C++ to get certain things done versus a
same the same task being done in PHP or
Java or Python or JavaScript you know
you get the idea so again what are my
main what are my main thesis if you will
one of the main philosophies but I hold
after so many you know two decades of
being a developer that the language is
all very specific the quality of the
language is specific on the task what
you have to do if you want to write a
gaming engine Python would be the worst
language to do it in or one of the worst
C++ would be the way to go but if you
want to write web apps real quickly and
get into the
good place and do small business
development you don't want to go C++ you
want to go PHP it kills there it kills
etc etc etc you get the idea so you have
to consider the language based on the
type of work what you want to do and the
type of mind that you have for instance
AI programming which requires lots of
math and stuff not for me I'm terrible
at math so for guys who are terrible at
math you want to do web app development
you may want to do high level game
development it's you know that kind of
stuff
business apps where the math is really
not that important if it you know add
subtract multiply divide you know that's
pretty much the limit of of the math
that you need for that kind of work but
when you started getting into AI machine
learning it's a whole different game
it's uber nerd it's not something I'm
interested in that's something I I would
want to do maybe if I put my mind to it
I could but so if you want to get into
AI and chances are you're gonna do AI
gonna be writing Python I think maybe go
you got to be well aware but you got to
be doing a lot of math so beam the half
centric again I'm not one of these guys
so PHP sucks or Java scripts the best or
Java is the best or Python no it depends
what you want to do the only thing I rip
on is Ruby Ruby on Rails and actually
there's a lot of good things that that
framework Ruby on Rails is a web
framework is actually really good and
Ruby in terms of the language itself
really good or things I really like
about it a couple things you don't like
about it but it doesn't run very fast at
runtime and it's very nice it's we could
most not very initially it's becoming
more and more of a nitch language and
I'd recommend not doing Ruby Ruby on
Rails because it's it's falling into
niche meaning it's it's you can have
less and less opportunity there that
being said you know there's still gonna
be a lot of legacy Ruby and rails apps
out there and so you probably get paid
big money to do it because they're gonna
be fewer and fewer Ruby programmers but
you know that's sort of you see the end
of that road down the line
maybe 10 years or something whereas you
look at Java c-sharp
PHP they got such huge install bases in
their own right Python that it's not
going anywhere so yeah anyway I'll stop
going off on one of my tangents again I
even forget the point of this video so
I'm going to end it right here Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
