what's the best web hosting in the world
by the way I'm not talking about Don
Corleone because I want to I just got
this week voice box and I've lost my
voices to a certain extent anyway the
best web hosting in the world is the web
hosting where you can actually speak to
somebody I had a friend of mine recently
whose whole business is dependent on
their website and they do a couple
million a year in sales so it's pretty
good and their website went down so
website goes down and they call it they
they look to call up tech support from
the hosting company no tech support
calls I forget now whether or not they
could have reach anybody yet I think
they just went straight to voicemail so
then they get on the online chat and it
could get our response so they call me
up in the paddock stand stand for sign
is not working it's broken and basically
the CSS wasn't loading for the site so
the site came in just a big mess text
only and it was all over the place and
so CSS was loading so I asked the first
question when you're diagnosing a
progress first question did you change
anything to the site recently
yeah there was no then change the thing
okay that means something happened there
using WordPress okay have you updated
your WordPress is up-to-date mega on a
collateral so they know check I do a Fae
of flavor I go check they see they had
updated I updated in I check it out of a
bag wasn't to behind I want to check
whether or not the WordPress had any if
they were hacked or something
it was clearly they weren't hacked and I
won't go through all the details with
you I'm in theirs I figured it out
and so and I looked into it I realized
at that it's probably some server
setting they change something cursor or
something to do with the mime type
delivery so it's causing the CSS to not
be loaded properly bla bla bla bla bla
so they said now you gotta call up the
whole to come and he got it tell them
what's going on somebody flipped the
switch on their hosting on their servers
and it's causing your site problems so
of course he went with the my buddy for
his two million dollar a year business
decided I had to go with the cheapest a
whole thing of all time anyways they
could have reached anybody got a chat
and they said was no problem for servers
and of course the chat was actually with
people in some other countries so not
that there's anything wrong with other
countries other countries are great the
problem is if you deal with people who
are not speaking your first language
you're going to have communication
problems this is a property see not with
just a posting but you see also with
development a lot of small and
medium-sized businesses they think are
outsourcing is great until they have to
deal with the language issues and that's
a huge problem so then they go a local
town Oh tell us another story back to
this original store so they're like the
site's down sales are big angle sales
because people want to say is nothing
and their whole business is dependent on
it and actually what a partners is
partner said to me calls me up staff
well if we can't fix this problem with
the site pretty soon I guess I'm gonna
have to get a job so I said to listen
you just got to get these guys to
configure their service properly they
did something or move and the site and I
even transfer takes over to one of my
servers to see here you know what was
going on and I can see it was definitely
the server so then he calls me up a
couple hours later as well I had these
people there working on my new theme
when we're press themes or WordPress
being and instead they're willing to do
it and they want to do hosting but
there's going to be a he goes like a $90
a month
maintenance cost mean
they're going to look after make sure
it's up and running there's a little
expensive and Chaz's are what you get
here your site up and running WordPress
or whatnot and if the hosting company if
they manage their their service properly
you should never have a problem but you
know if you got a two million dollar
business I just totally depending on the
website to me as an insurance policy
yeah I'll spend the night at office a
month so that I know like a priority
support priority support so I said to
him yeah I would go with this they'll
move it
it'd be a 90 bucks a month of hosting
everything but you know you got somebody
there well isn't there he should and he
said I don't want fewer Ataka said how
much is you two billion dollar business
was to you
you think ninety dollars of insurance to
have a bunch of nerds will make sure
that say is not going downs with it to
me it's with it anyway long story short
they move the site over within 24 hours
mobile boom everything is fine fantastic
everybody's happy
so now want they to look for web hosting
is support now if you're just setting up
the basic site for your your for
blogging or your portfolio if you want
to be a developer something your basic
hosting package is six seven bucks a
month is fine but if you have a business
where you know you're doing a half a
million a million a year and you're not
a techie you know don't go with some
crazy hosting company that you can't
reach so the first thing I do is when
when I used to do hosting with your
party hosting I was first thing I would
do is call up the tech support see if
this tech support actually responds you
know that's that's the first thing I
would do and so for instance now with
studio where we hosted on cloud-based
digitalocean and which is very good but
we're looking at more full-service
cloud-based hosting coupled with dealing
with for about 12 years 15 years so they
have like this turnkey cloud-based
you've got all the advantages
a deal digitalocean but you also have
24/7 priority support
buh-buh-buh-buh-buh to me that's worth
it I have a problem I feel you have to
call you know modern-day advanced
hosting for your apps if you got volume
you got business should be that they're
monitoring it for you pay the extra
hundred bucks whether it is they monitor
make sure there's no do s attacks they
take care of this stuff this is the way
it should go
for serious apps but anyway at the end
of the day the world's best hosting is
the hosting that has your back with
really good tech support you're sold
that your sites stay up that's just my
two cents
