a bunch of web pages that are connected
together you connect these sites
together using a tag that we haven't
seen before something called the
hypertext or the HTML link tag a lot of
people just call them hyperlinks
sometimes we just refer to a mess links
so let's pop open our website and we'll
start with the index page we're gonna
edit that I'm going to open this with my
code editor sublime text and here we go
so you know what let me just simplify
this a little bit saving it so you know
we're gonna do let's try this out so
we're going to call this homepage
welcome to home pages the the old-school
way of calling a website back in the 90s
resuit people used to go say hey how do
I build a homepage anyway so we want to
do now is we're going to add another
paragraph and let's say where we want to
go we want to go to the my friends page
so let's say checkout
so what we want to do is we want to turn
the text my friend into a link you know
we've all used links before so how do we
do that we do that using the a tag or of
a hyperlink tag this is how we do it now
sublime text is smart enough to know
what we watch so I'm just going to press
ENTER and it fills in all the details so
here's the closing a tag so let me put
my friends inside the closing a tag here
I'll say that so so yeah this is a new
tag we haven't seen before this is the
opening tag this is a closing tag now
this text here href equals open and
close quotes this is something new we
haven't seen in HTML tags before well we
saw it way back with the image tag but
anyway so the href is called a tag
attribute just kind of like your hair
color is an attribute of you how tall
you are is an attribute of you an
attribute is just a little extra
information about the tag so the href
attribute tells you where this link is
going to go to so we want to go to in
this case we want to go to the page my
friends so let me just select this copy
that name so I don't have to type it out
like a sucker there we go let me get
this in view so here is our very first
link tag so it's the opening tag closing
tag this is going to be the clickable
text and this attribute here the H ref
attribute tells the web browser where
this link is pointing to so what does H
ref stand for it means hypertext
reference
it's hypertext you know what hypertext
is it's just text in a web page so it
just basically says this is where this
link is going to take us to and in this
case it's taking us to this web page
here and let's launch this in the
browser
here we go so let's click on through and
it loads up that of a page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
