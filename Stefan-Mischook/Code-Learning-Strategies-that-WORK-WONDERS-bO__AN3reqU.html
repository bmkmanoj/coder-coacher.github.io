learn how to program effectively
actually this lesson which about to get
it applies to anything which you want to
learn anyway so here's the gist of it
I'll get right into it number one your
brain can only take in new information
at a certain rate or a certain clip if
you will think about this when you
crammed before an exam forty high school
high school university college whatever
and you cram before the exam you when to
exam you cram you had a short-term
memory of things you did your exam and
everybody knows but two three weeks
later you forgot everything that's not
learning that's not and not really
effective when it comes to work-related
learning so if you want to learn how to
program for the sake of a career you
don't want to cram and then forget what
you want to do is you want to get
long-term or permanent understanding of
what this it means to code what a coding
is about and how to do it and how to
approach it
techniques concepts etc so this is what
you got to do you got to gradually
expose yourself on a consistent basis to
programming concepts and techniques in
fact my studio web app is designed
around that premise so when you watch a
video then the contents of the video are
reinforced immediately with quizzing and
code challenges and when you do come
back into studio web let's say you do a
half an hour training an hour of
training and then you'd say okay I'm
gonna take a break because the brand's
get a little tired get a little frazzled
that's an indicator it's a that's a good
sign to know that it's time to take a
break so you take a break you come back
at it maybe five hours later if you feel
refreshed maybe the next day if you feel
refreshed come back the next day the key
is you want to come back to it when
you're feeling refreshed you're feeling
invigorated you come back and then
sidwell remembers not only where you
were what lesson you're on but even what
question you were on it takes you right
back to where you started saving you
time so you can progress more quickly
what you're going to see as you learn to
code is that the first day for example
you may be able to study hard for half
an hour and it starts to start to get a
headache starts to overwhelm you so you
take a break then when you're feeling
relaxed again the next day you go back
to it instead of only being able to say
for half an hour else then you can do 45
minutes so you're taking in even more
and then you take another break you come
back again a day later five hours later
two days later depending on how your
brain is absorbing the information then
also it's not 45 minutes you take in an
hour
what's gonna happen as you continue to
expose yourself more and more to coding
techniques and practices and concepts
they will become easier and easier and
easier to understand and to assimilate
and you'll see I use something called a
spiral teaching method within the studio
up courses in all my courses that take
into account how the brain best learns
and more easily learns information you
see people go to school to learn how to
teach people study that there's a skill
to it that's one of the reasons why so
many courses out there not very
effective because the people teaching
them don't know how to teach
now I come from a family of teachers to
been building courses in 2003 I've been
teaching I taught martial arts for a
long time and I also studied learning
theory my major in university of
psychology so all these elements go into
my courses that's one of the big reasons
why they are so effective I understand
how the brain assimilates new
information the key to this is that you
got to do consistently and gradually and
you got to give your brain some rest
periods in between the learning you got
to do that so the brand's time to
assimilate the information it's like
training if you're doing weight training
or any type of sports really but I'll do
it weight training what are the most
important things you can do in weight
training I know it doesn't look like it
I used to do a long time ago so anyway
one of the things the most important
thing you you need to do is to give your
body a chance to rest you have to give
your body a chance to rest most athletes
over train regardless of the sport
you hear it all the time in a
competitive environment so for example I
remember when I was actively involved in
heavy-duty martial arts sometimes
sometimes people get injured so there
you get injured and they were at some
point they're forced to leave the
training because the injury is so bad so
what happens they leave for two weeks
they come back and I remember many of my
training partners would be like oh boy I
left for two weeks I'm gonna be really
lucky I terrible they get back in and
all sudden they're performing much
better than they had in over a year -
and the reason that is is because they
gave you their bodies and in fact their
minds a chance to rest to heal itself to
assimilate what they've learned so they
could come back fresh with that in mind
I remember for a period of time for
about a year so I trained with the
Canadian wrestling team I wasn't a
member I trained with them though and I
went and I trained with the Canadian
wrestling team because as long as we
learned how to wrestle with the best
wrestlers out there so I trained with
them and I remember that their coach was
a gold medalist in the Olympics during
the offseason they would train really
hard push themselves to get new levels
new games but then when they were in
competition season they would slow down
the training tremendously so that their
bodies were very well rested it's this
interval type of training is consistent
across many disciplines not just sports
not just learning business as well
back to weight gain weight training
after you work out really hard and you
literally tear the muscle you have to
give your muscles a chance to rest
people come back too quickly into the
weight training and you know their
muscles are still sore they go back and
they're in their training and they're
not making the gains they could make if
they just rest
they just rested a little while longer
drink drink lots of fluids eat whale
blubber blasts well you sleep well but
you better give your body a chance to
rest same thing when you're learning how
to code you're literally carving out new
pathways you're creating new can
affections in the brain your your simile
new knowledge new fundamental ways of
thinking in fact when you learn to
program you're going to learn how to
think in a different way so as a result
of that you have to give your brain a
chance to rest in between sessions now
if there's initial resistance and
laziness you have to also push yourself
a little bit there that's a little trick
if you don't feel like doing your
scheduled web development or your PHP or
JavaScript or Python training all in
particular today my suggestion to you is
you sit down and if you're doing a
studio web you do one video and you did
a quizzes with that one video lesson and
then you just walk away that might take
you 15-20 minutes or you write two or
three lines of code do something just to
give yourself a little exposure and if
when you sit down and you start writing
that code or start doing some of the
lessons if it starts if it doesn't start
rolling along and still a lot of
resistance okay then you do that one
lesson answer the quiz questions or you
write those few lines of code then you
back away put it away and do something
totally unrelated to coding something
that works the other side the non
logical side of your brain gives your
brain a rest relax but what you've often
find is that once you start doing some
lessons you start reading a little bit
of code also you start raining a lot of
code that being said you still need to
schedule downtime rest time as you are
learning same thing when you're actively
programming often enough you're going to
come into a situation where you're
writing a code you're writing your app
you're writing your program and you just
can't figure out this bug this bug is
this like bugging you you just can't get
it you can't figure it out
and you may have worked on it for half
an hour an hour I made a mistake we're
trying to work on things for two or
three hours I'm just gonna get the
answer so what I did is I would just
back off and say okay forget it I'll
just gonna look at it tomorrow or maybe
five hours from now especially when you
sleep on it overnight what you're gonna
find is that if a bug you hit the wall
you can't figure it out you sleep on it
and they've come the next day having not
looked at at all having nothing
you sit down in front of a computer and
within like two minutes you figure out
the answer you go oh that's it
because behind the scenes the brain is
working on it some assimilating things
here's a little tip to take away as an
end of this particular vlog the largest
most powerful part of your brain is non
conscious meaning you're not aware of
what's going on it's so powerful it's so
capable it's doing all kinds of stuff
behind the scenes it's scanning the room
like a supercomputer to the VDD like a
super radar and it's taking information
it's simulating information and you're
have no control over it you are not
aware of it consciously and but it's
there to do some super powerful work for
you what you need to do is you need to
expose it to information over and over
again so that it knows what it should be
working on for you so that's the little
psychological tip I'll give you again my
major in university of psychology so I
have some knowledge about this stuff so
there you go so that's how you should
learn incremental consistent give
yourself give yourself some time to rest
in between so that your brain can
similarly information if you hit a wall
back away but try to be consistent don't
work for four hours one day and then not
touch it for five days you know take one
day off come back to it etc you get the
idea so you have to work it out you're
gonna have to learn how your brain can
assimilate this information and in time
what you'll see is that you're going to
be able to instill a more and more and
more information much more quickly and
to the point where after you've done a
couple of languages you'll be able to
learn a whole new programming language
in a few hours and be able to write good
code production code but I've addressed
this in other videos alright that's it
for now ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
