CSS let's start learning some more so
okay we know this is a CSS style block
opening closing tag so here are some CSS
selectors right these are called
selectors because we use this CSS code
here to select tags in our page so let
me say h1
do this so let me say that again for all
the H ones in a page apply V CSS rules
this is the beginning of the CSS rule
block this is the end of a CSS rule
block well the proper nerd term for this
is called a declaration block you're
declaring the rules that's what two
declares is to make an announcement to
make a statement
so we're saying here I declare that all
h1 should have the color of orange well
the text color of orange we know that
this CSS here this is called a CSS
property and this CSS property here the
color property sets the text color in
whatever tag that you are targeting so
yeah so we're learning some nurse'
so let's add another CSS property and a
value so this is a property you have to
put a little colon here and then you say
this is the value we're saying turn the
text color to orange so let's add
another CS property so how do you
separate CS properties you use a
semicolon like this and yeah so let's I
don't know what font size so we're gonna
say we're gonna make our H 148 px so
what is px px is short for pixel if you
remember our discussion on images when
we talked about images in the HTML
course we measured images in pixels
right and pixels of course are those
little dots on your screens and yes
there you go I know so we're saying make
the font size of the h1s in the page
make them 48 pixels let me save that
let's preview in the browser what see in
a browser so here you go so you can see
our CSS h1 Z's are the H ones here see
how big they are so let's try that again
let's make it 78 pixels
open a browser even bigger so you get
the idea how the font size affects how
well the size of our fonts let's make a
really small let's make it to eight
pixels which will be barely visible
there we go there they are up here so
what do you want to take away from this
particular video well we understand that
these are selectors because they select
tags and our page and in fact these are
called tag selectors because they select
tags there are other types of selectors
that we're going to learn about in CSS
or several other types tag selectors are
a good place to start we know that this
here is a declaration block right it's
like yeah it's kind of like this is like
the opening of the block this is a
closing and a block kind of like this is
the opening this is a closing of the tag
opening and closing of the tag opening
and closing of the block so we know that
for th ones we do all the CSS here for
the h2s we do all the CSS here finally
we learned about CSS properties and
their value and we know we have to put a
colon so we go make the color orange and
then we use a semicolon to tell the web
browser this is one CSS property in
value and this is the second property
and value in our code and yeah so you
have to put the separator otherwise if
you go like this CSS will get confused
while the web browser will get confused
about your CSS code thinking that this
is all about the color which it isn't so
we're going to put this here that
creates a nice separation between our
properties and our values CSS property
in value number one CSS property in
value number two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
