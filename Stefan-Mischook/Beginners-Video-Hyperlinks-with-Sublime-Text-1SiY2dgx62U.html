we're gonna look at the a tag which is
the tag that's used to create hyperlinks
so people will call it the link tag but
technically speaking the link tag is not
the a tag but anyway the a tag is allows
you to connect webpages to webpages
webpages to other websites I'll show you
how to do that now so I'm gonna be using
sublime text so I launched that here I
got a new sublime text window now in
sublime text to make this into an HTML
page you literally save as and I'm gonna
save it on the desktop just to make it
easy I'm gonna call it index dot HTML
index is always the first page of web
site so I'll save that by naming it dot
HTML this tells sublime text that this
is a web page so now this allows us
we'll go into tools snippets and it
gives us that first option HTML and here
is your boilerplate for an html5 web
page now we know it's html5 because we
have this doctype here again this is a
supplemental video I'm assuming you've
done the studio web HTML course and so
you can put in your title and so on
whatever so what we're gonna do now is
we're gonna put in the a tag so there's
the a tag and sublime text is giving us
a drop-down list that assists us so I'm
going to hit enter and it fills in all
these details so I can put in the link
text here which will be visit the
coolest site ever made that's of course
a studio web I'm biased now here is the
H ref attribute this is a tag attribute
the tag is the 8a of course we know c
était cuz it's a this is the body tag
as it says body this is the HTML tag
because it says HTML so this is the a
tag and it's short for anchor and the
href here href equals h res is an
example of a tag attribute it's
basically a little more information
about the tag will this particular tag
just like your eye color is an attribute
you're I guess your face of your eyes of
you your haircolor is another attribute
that you have in your body a car a car
may have all-wheel drive that's an
attribute of the car so href is this an
attribute of this particular tag this
particular a tag and this is where
you're gonna put in the address of the
web page or the website that you want to
link to and then when you click on that
link it takes you to that site so I'm
just gonna type in eight ttp go in slash
slash so this code here HTTP is telling
of a web browser that were going to be
visiting a particular webpage or a
website using the hypertext Transfer
Protocol hypertext transfer well excuse
me hyper text Transfer Protocol that's a
fancy nerd way of saying we're going to
be using a very particular way of
navigating over the Internet
to go get a web page I talked about this
again
at length and explained in nan near
terms in my main course we're gonna go
wws tells the web browser again but
we're going on the world wide web
that's what w-w-w right world wide web
and we're gonna go to the coolest site
ever made studio web calm well at least
in my opinion and then I'll save that
pretty good so now we want to view this
page now there's a couple ways to do is
I'm just gonna open this up with I open
up with Safari here Suvari so here's a
page we just created right if you look
at the text here HR above a black in
between here visitor cool site this is a
cool site so we click on this it takes
us to the cool site ever created isn't
any interesting now we can go into sub
pages for instant to go to videos new
course is here's my HTML course I was
talking about this actually covers html5
and it goes way beyond just beginners it
starts you off at beginners anyway
whatever so we go here let's go to
powerful Python 3 of course I'm actually
creating now
and I'm gonna get that link here's the
full link to that site copy so let's
create a new link before I lose that
let's create a new hypertext a new
anchor rather a new a tag there we go
new a tag so now I'm gonna tell the web
browser in this link here I'll just
expand this okay so now we're going to
studio web.com but we're going to a very
particular page this page here power
from Python 3 visit the greatest Python
course ever so I'll save that now if we
preview this let me just load up this
page again hold on we close this here
now there are simple ways to load up
this page with python or shortcuts by
excuse me with sublime text this is
sublime text bar just gonna load this up
here like this open with Safari again
and you see you got the two links side
by side that's no no good so what we're
gonna do we're just gonna create a
little break tag just a couple of them I
like to keep the code consistent meaning
all lowercase it's better it's just
reload this okay so we got it so this is
a Python code there we go so there you
go that's a basic introduction to
hypertext the keys that get your href
attribute and this is short for
hypertext reference of course make sure
you get your quotes in there you could
use single quotes
this will sublime text give me trouble
you can use single quotes like that
I'll work as well save that and we
reload let's go back here reload it
still works right you single quotes
double quotes up to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
