about the loss of net neutrality and
whether or not it has any significant
impact in terms of jobs for developers
this is a serious subject so it requires
a sip of hot liquid in this case I'm
drinking tea cuz it's nighttime I don't
drink coffee at night typically alright
number one I don't think it's gonna have
any impact in terms of jobs I think it
actually might create opportunity for
web developers because site owners may
feel a need to come up with solutions to
mitigate for any potential throttling of
sites
I think the throttling might just only
affect very large players I think the
big telcos already telcos not or not
telcos the big cable internet providers
will they may be going after Facebook
for facebook video they may go after
YouTube they may go after Vimeo that
kind of stuff so these companies are
gonna have to pay out potentially at
first but you know what they're gonna do
there's a big game changer out there and
I think it's gonna make this whole lack
of net neutrality a moot point that game
changers 5g5 geez cellular internet is
blows away literally blows away
traditional ground lines traditional
ground line the average speed that
people have in terms of ground line
internet is six point five make that
megabits make a bytes per second they
can download six point five megabytes
for a second apparently 5g optimally
well in optimal situations Samsung's
just did a demo with their 5g modem 5g
you can do 500 megabytes per second
versus 6.5 500 that was optimal so
imagine it's not optimal and it's only
100 megabits bytes per second versus 6.5
it's still huge a huge difference over
what ground lines can deliver and so
what Google's going to probably be doing
or Facebook or maybe a few of them will
get together and they'll just
start subsidizing 5g modems for
everybody and then maybe they'll you
know buy out a few of the telcos you
know who have these 5g networks and
Bob's your uncle that crushes any
dangers of net neutrality so I don't be
too concerned but there's another thing
that has to be considered if I was an
owner of Comcast or any of these big
internet providers I would be very
careful about pissing off to Millennials
and the Internet users because you know
it's probably a ninety nine percent to
one of Internet users who are against
net neutrality lean net neutrality so if
they piss them off they're going to give
them big incentive to want to leave them
quickly you know so I don't know if
they're gonna do anything we'll have to
see what happens I think what the if
they'll do anything I think they'll go
after some of the big players and and
the big players will just deal with the
situation as I just described oh and all
actually I think that whether the cable
internet providers try to try to crush
some of the internet or or when 5tu
comes out and it's coming out I think
it's a huge opportunity to for web
developers and the reason I say that is
because I've seen this before when we
went from modems to high-speed Internet
the nature of the web changed and all
the websites changed we used to have to
really design websites for very slow
internet connection so we had to use
much smaller images and there's all
kinds of optimizations we had to do that
we no longer have to concern yourself
with now we have these you know huge
images on our web sites and we can have
video and our streaming audio and it's
not an issue and I think what 5g where
you literally you're getting six point
five megabytes per second up to 500 also
that's a game-changer in terms of what
you can do in terms of the website
presence and so that will mean more work
for developers I mean more work for
designers because I think businesses are
going to going to be taking at that
of that as that grows out more and more
and more I'm sure I will as well I
adjust saves according to what the
technology can support at the time so I
think it's a good thing I wouldn't be
too concerned about it yeah it's a
douchey thing to do in terms of killing
net neutrality but I don't think we'll
have much more of an impact than a blip
if you will because of the things I
mentioned and man we'll see I don't have
a crystal ball there might be a couple
little things here and there for a
little while but I don't think it would
last very long
so to summarize I think there's gonna
actually be more jobs for web developers
I think that net neutrality if I had my
say I would say keep it no don't kill it
like they did too bad they killed it I
don't think that's cool but I don't
think it's an issue because of 5g
technology and also I think they're
gonna go after the big players first so
and the big players will just take care
of that - Google's the Facebook's a etc
they already did to Netflix right
Netflix was able to just solve the
problem by paying more money and there
you go I hope that answers that question
people are asking so I answered Cheers
hmm yeah that right there is a lava lamp</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
