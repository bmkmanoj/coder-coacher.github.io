killer sites if you're gonna watch any
video of the hundreds of videos that I
put out on YouTube
if you're gonna watch any video this is
the one to watch this is the most
important lesson but I've ever gotten
when it comes to small business or
freelancing or coding and actually
generally in life so take out your pen
and paper or your smartphone and take
down this note so what you need to
understand is something called F you
money F you as in money so what's the
whole point of this a few money what it
is why you should be concerned about it
and we'll talk about a few other things
so f you money is a stash of money
that's emergency money this is money
that you never ever touch in fact I have
my Fu stash I haven't touched it ever
and I've had it in place for whatever 15
20 years now it's money that is
untouchable and the whole point of f you
money is that it's your security money
to emergency money so how much money
should you have in terms of f you money
well you should have enough fu money to
last you at least one year to cover all
your expenses so if you spend a thousand
bucks a month to live I'm just pulling
that number out of my out of the air if
you have a fast you a thousand dollars a
months to live
you should have at least twelve thousand
dollars of F you money now you're not
gonna build this up right away it's
gonna take time to build it up but you
should really be working on building up
your f you stash your stash of cash and
again this is not money you use to buy a
new laptop if you need a new laptop or
you go on vacation for it no no this is
money that's untouchable it's only used
in dire straits situations so what you
should do is as you save it up you
should be putting it in some account
where you can't easily get at the money
may be some sort of savings account a
different branch a different bank but
you typically would use something where
you have to go to the branch to get the
money you
to make sure that this money is hard to
get at but you don't want to invest this
money in something volatile like stocks
or bonds you don't know you don't want
to lock up the money where you collect
you can't get at it at it in an
emergency because remember when the
market is bad for you in your business
whether you're a freelancer web
developer or web designer or a carpenter
it's probably bad for everybody so if
the market is bad for everybody if your
money is locked up in some sort of
investment you're gonna have time
getting at it so let's say you took your
fu money you put it in a stock market
even McDonald stocks something safe if
the market starts crashing your stocks
will start scrap crashing to a certain
amount and then you're not gonna want to
sell it because your your stocks will be
lower right so what you want to do is
you want to take your fu money you put
it aside that one year ideal ideally of
cash you put it aside and you never
touch it and it's for emergency purposes
only to pay your rent to pay your
mortgage this is pretty buy food this is
dire straits type of stuff this is
separate from your long terms retirement
savings this is separate from your your
basic bank account for your day-to-day
operations in your business whether
you're freelancer or whatnot and this is
a very important distinction so what I
do is I put it in a savings account and
a bank separate from them from my main
bank and it's a high rate of savings in
terms of the percentage well by today's
standards not the literal one or it's
one and a half percent or something like
this and I just don't touch it it's been
there for like 15 20 years and friends
of mine say yeah your money it's not
working for you should have invested I
said well it is working for me it makes
me sleep well at night that's the whole
point a few money you can sleep well at
night and you'd have to worry about
paying your bills now ideally I say one
year but you start initially maybe pull
out 5% 5% or 10% of your income and you
start building up your fu money and you
want to build it up build it up why is
it fu money well let's say you're
independent coder contractor freelancer
web developer carpenter and you're
dealing with some clients or real you
know they're you know they're not the
nicest people I'm trying to avoid
swearing because they deal with law
schools and I got to be you know I gotta
be correct with my terms here can't use
terms that are not suitable for the
younger crowd anyway so let's say you're
doing with a client is a real jerk
getting on your nerves and you're like
if you have a year's worth of fu money
you can just go you know what I don't
need your contract we're not doing we're
not dealing with you anymore
why because you know but you have one
year worth of cash saved up and you
don't have to worry about it that's
amazing
now for me I keep two years in fu Mike I
like two years personally and I know
that if all hell breaks loose and I got
no contracts no income coming in heaven
forbid I know for two years I don't have
to worry about money let me tell you
it's so relaxing to live that way it
changes your entire life your psychology
changes you're much more relaxed when
you in which you're gonna find which I
found strangely enough and I walked into
business meetings when I had built up
even like a year's worth for fu money
six months a year I was much more
relaxed when I meet with clients because
I wasn't desperate for the contract and
you know it's weird
they say that 85% of communication is
nonverbal and what happens is that
people pick up on that subconsciously
they can pick up that know this guy
Steph he doesn't really need the money
and they go damn he must be really good
and then I'll send what I saw what would
happen when I had a lot of fu money the
amount of money I would earn on my
contracts to start going up because I
would ask for what I wanted and they
would give it to me I said I want I want
80 bucks an hour
100 bucks the hour and it's gonna take
this many hours and they were like okay
sure and it's the weirdest thing I know
it sounds strange but remember 85% of
communication is nonverbal body language
it's all these subtle cues and people
could pick up subconsciously if you're
feeling comfortable with yourself if
you're confident and let me tell you
nothing makes you more confident knowing
that you have a good years worth of fu
money in the bank so fu money
super-important life-changing it just
does not apply to colors it applies to
anything that you do it's a life it's a
life lesson that's so important so yeah
a few money start building it up slowly
slowly I know it's hard for at first
five percent of you which you bring in
put in your Fu stash 10% whatever you
can it's very important now that said
you got to also if you have debt you got
to balance that out as well I'm not say
you should pay off all your dead have no
fu you should actually bounce it out so
if you have some debt so she's low
interest a pay off something like that
but cash is king cash is king it's very
important to have a few stash now
remember a few stats you want to go on
vacation you got no money in your in
your personal account you've got no
money in your corporate account you
can't you can't go on vacation that fu
money is not for going on vacation you
need a new computer because your
computer getting a little slow but you
have no money you can't use a few money
don't use it that's it's the silliest
thing you do that's the worst thing to
do is to spend your ass few money in
fact ideally should never spent it right
because you don't want to be in that
situation but let me tell you you get
that a few money you're gonna be
thanking me go staff life is so much
easier life is so much easier you know
for a number of years I sort of went
into semi-retirement 32 because I did
very well in the 1990s and so on and I
had a lot of fu money and I became like
a professional coffee drinker people
would say what does Steph do he says
well I don't know I as far as I know he
goes for coffee
he goes for breakfast a lot that was
that was my job for a number of years
now recently I've gotten back into it
because of my interest in studio web and
I'm helping schools now and she just
covert into into their curriculum since
I've been teaching code since 2003 so
you know maybe coding since 94 so anyway
back to a few money a few money is so
important number one thing get your f
your money together understand the rules
of fu money if any of this is unclear
you want some more you want me to unroll
this for you a bit more in terms of what
f you money is all about let me know I
think I've covered everything but it's
such an important thing to have and I
highly recommend that you get into it I
hope you found this useful
