I want to talk about the three most
viable assets you can build going afford
people in the past would look at things
like real estate or stocks and stuff let
me tell you what you can do to build up
your personal wealth and security no
matter where you are in the world the
three most valuable things going forward
are going to be number one reputation
your personal reputation or your
business reputation is going to be so
important especially today in the age of
social media where everything is out
there if you are individual looking at
some point or me to go work for a
company if you have a social media or
for your Facebook or your Instagram is
filled with questionable things stupid
things that can affect your ability to
get a good job so keep that in mind
before you put up pictures of yourself
getting drunk or something number two
skill sets skill sets are incredibly
important these days that's why in
today's very competitive economy you
have to compete not just with people in
your own City you got to compete with
people around the world so you whether
you're a web designer or a developer an
aspiring developer or small business
owners always try to improve your skill
sets it kind of makes sense to keep
investing in yourself in terms of what
you know learning new languages
programming languages learning new
processes new apps even learning new
spoken languages you'll see that it will
come in handy and number three if you
can try to get yourself ownership on
intellectual property whether it be apps
that you build whether it be things that
you write or videos or books that you
write or whatever
this isn't apply to everybody of course
but intellectual property of course is
something cool to hold as well patents
trademarks now don't go crazy and start
trade trying
you know chase out down things like it I
got to get a trademark I got a I got a
patent something I gotta create an app
that I own but just keep that in mind
just in principle but in my opinion
these are the three most important
things going forward because physical
items houses and so forth though they've
had to run I think if you look at the
demographic shifts where in off the
America China Japan Europe or a
population is aging people are in
massive debt I think like big houses are
gonna lose value the one thing that
might affect this of course what is
affecting is it's a massive influx of
Chinese investors some clean money some
dirty money we have this problem in
Canada for instance where Chinese
speculators would go into markets into
Western Canada on our west coast BC in
the driven housing prices up incredibly
but now the Canadian government finally
put controls in place it's a little tax
and all sudden the prices are starting
to just literally crash and they had
these crazy loopholes in her laws or
Chinese speculators foreign and foreign
speculators coming to our markets buy up
houses put a bio for a million put them
on the sale for 2 million get another
speculators speculators just a Wall
Street term for a gambler
and then he could sell it pocket a
million not pay taxes because they would
say this they would say that the house
was their primary residence I'll stop
there I want to go into details so yeah
I think all those games are going to
lose their steam or have lost their
steam a lot of people in the states for
instance a lot of people in the u.s.
they're still underwater in terms of
what they pay for their house and what
it's worth today even though they've
bounced back quite a bit and this goes
to basic business and coding by the way
you have to kind of look what the trend
is going forward as opposed to backwards
you got to look forward instead of
backwards that is the key to
being ahead of the game for sure
otherwise it gets very difficult the
most valuable skill sets number one your
reputation you have to have a good
reputation number two skills you got to
keep improving your skill sets number
three intellectual property if your get
a hold of it so keep that in mind
finally I just want to close with with
regards to the comments in my videos I
do my best to respond to them since
though I am NOT a professional youtuber
this is more or less a hobby for me and
a way for me to practice speaking in
front of the camera so I try to get to
them but I don't necessarily get to all
of them I do read I think most of them
if not all of them so I appreciate the
comments though keep them coming I get
ideas from comments in terms of what to
talk about in one of these vlogs so keep
them coming and I do appreciate when you
do click the like or the thumbs up it
tells me about I'm doing something that
you guys enjoy it also pushes me up in
the ranking as I said as YouTube is my
hobby and I get about sixty sixty five
thousand views collectively per month so
it's not much it's a small thing that's
cool but as a hobby I like to see if I
can make it go up even more but as you
know I don't make money off youtube I
don't have any ads or anything and I
have no plans to put ads I don't know if
I ever would
but again so I appreciate you watching
the videos appreciate the comments and
appreciate any thumbs ups and whatnot
but you guys give me that's it for now
