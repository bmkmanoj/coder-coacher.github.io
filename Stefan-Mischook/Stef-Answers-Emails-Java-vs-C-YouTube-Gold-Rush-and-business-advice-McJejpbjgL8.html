the questions that are put on the
YouTube channel I figured it's just
easier to do it all in one video since
there's a whole bunch of little ones so
consider this the Q&amp;amp;A video on this
channel first question what's your
thoughts on learning JavaScript and CSS
as your first programming language
first of all CSS is not a programming
language JavaScript is but to learn
JavaScript you need to learn HTML first
then you need to learn at least the
basics of CSS and then you can go into
programming watch my video series on
careers in code where I discuss all the
different modern languages out there not
all of them but many of them PHP Python
JavaScript c-sharp Java etc etc and then
you can decide which language is best
given what you want to do in your coding
what's your take on c-sharp compared to
Java well in terms of the languages
themselves the core languages themselves
c-sharp came out after Java and I kind
of looked at C sharps and it's kind of
like Java plus plus so they they what
they did Microsoft when they put
together c-sharp when he created it they
tried to take the best from Java and add
some extra capabilities I haven't used
c-sharp and years so it's a very capable
language as is Java I'm sure in terms of
the core languages there they're both
learning off of each other so I'm sure
than each new version of c-sharp with
each new version of Java they approve
they improve upon of the language that
said as it is with all the other
programming languages that I talked
about your choice between c-sharp and
Java has very little to do with the
language itself in the big picture and
the big picture has much more to do with
the type of programming work you want to
do although c-sharp and Java do share
the enterprise space what do I mean by
that very large organizations who build
very
large apps will tend to use a c-sharp or
Java and c-sharp dotnet framework Java
these days it's Java spring which is
their own which is the most popular
framework out there this is for web apps
in addition to that if you want to get
into Android development then you have
to do Java because that's the native
language of Android and then if you want
to do certain specialized Windows
programming then you would have to get
to C sharp or vb.net which is just
basically you know c-sharp and vb.net or
same language it's just syntax is
syntactically different but that's it's
really most everybody uses c-sharp
anyhow so again I'm trying to emphasize
people made of videos the language is
it's not hugely important it's the type
of work you want to do and it's the the
type of career that you want and the
type of apps you want to build that
really dictates your language certain
languages are better suited for certain
environments so if you're going to do
Android you either got to do it in Java
or you're gonna use html5 and then run
it through a translator like PhoneGap or
something but and if you want to do I
guess unity programming or dotnet then
you gotta use c-sharp so in terms of the
core languages themselves I don't see
them as being hugely different and
inconsequential somebody asked me about
Lexus what do you think of the Lexus vs.
Audi again I'm sure those cars have some
good aspects about them I've never
driven them so I couldn't say but I hear
there's good things I just happen to
like outtie nice interiors I think
they're famous for having the
best-looking interiors in terms of bang
for the buck but that's just a personal
choice somebody commented on my video
Borel don't copy and the
it's Aryan chain said I completely I
completely agree with your conclusion my
conclusion is a lot of vloggers out
there are just copying KC nice that but
in terms of Stan he continues in terms
of storytelling style is just a medium
true I think a lot of copiers simply
don't have things to tell you that's
exactly it you know there's an
expression I think I got it's a Texas
expression all sizzle no steak and a lot
of these vloggers all sizzle no steak
so they a lot of these vloggers don't
have much to say or anything to say
because they haven't really done much in
their lives or young people for me young
as your early 20s so they haven't done
much so they have enough no experience
nothing to really talk about so they
talk about nothing and to make up for
talking about nothing they tried to be
cute and funny and they try to leverage
their personalities and they try to make
the video look interesting stylistically
because when you have content that has
no no vitamins if you will and there's
no content in it that's what you do you
emphasize the aesthetics of it you
you'll work on on making the videos look
interesting because there's nothing
being said in these videos let's face it
even nice dad who it's very good at his
his presentation style if you will his
sizzles is excellent but you know he
talks about you know going to the beach
on the weekend you know the fact that he
can make these very mundane tasks
interesting because of his visuals and
so forth and his cueing of music and
people like that that's cool but yeah
he's right I think a lot of these
vloggers has simply got nothing the same
of course he disputes I'm reading and my
opinion Casey is influenced by a few
directors Wes Anderson and Tarantino
couple Coppola I'm not sure he got his
whole style from one movie though that
may be the case at maybe the caves in
who knows where it is the Boogie Nights
director where he got his stuff and
everybody's influenced but to me if you
watch
of that movie watch the Boogie Nights
you're gonna see where it says it's 100
cent the style that Casey has adopted I
was about to say it's 100 cent Casey
nice that but since Boogie Nights came
out in 97 you know it's nice I got it
from this guy in my opinion it could be
wrong I haven't spoken to Casey nice dad
so I don't know so yeah that's the thing
about the vloggers I was about I don't
know if I put it out yet or I'm gonna
put out a YouTube video on the
California Gold Rush and YouTube Gold
Rush and I don't even know if I put it
out or not because what I'll do
sometimes when I feel like it I will
record two or three blogs at a time and
then I'll edit them over a few days
anyway just summarize that just in case
I haven't put it out we see a lot of
people wanting to get in on this YouTube
Gold Rush so it's great for the camera
buyers okay I'm sure Sony in Canada are
doing a fantastic business selling
cameras to vloggers and aspiring indie
filmmakers and what's going to happen
with that is the market is gonna be
flooding and it's going to be like the
music industry we're gonna have but we
could have countless numbers of people
trying to put out videos and vlogs and
little indie movies and they figure I
finally got the great camera and most of
its not gonna go anywhere because that's
just the nature of of creation of
content creation most content is it just
disappears into the black hole there's
so much now and now the content creation
is so inexpensive like with the new
cameras you can buy for relatively
little money compared to just five years
ago you can produce beautiful looking
content with great sound and the editing
software is powerful and you can write
it off and you can edit 1080p and even a
4k video on a moderately powered
computer so from a business point of
view when it comes to logging and
youtubing and just general content
creation
don't go in there spending money you
can't afford to lose because just by way
of averages you are going to
now what I do with these logs as I said
it's my hobby number one but it's also a
way for me to practice my delivery it's
actually over last six seven months
we've been vlogging that every day but
quite a bit I think my ability to speak
in front of the camera has done much
better
and it's helped me with my course
creation which law schools and
institutions use so that was my goal
besides also getting the word out and so
forth but be very careful my warning to
you when you if you decide you're going
to become a vlogger and if you're tight
for cash and you've got nothing to say
getting a fancy camera is not going to
give you any advantage because
everybody's neighbor can get that fancy
camera advantage comes in business when
you're doing something nobody else is
doing and you are one of the first or
that's better yet if you are a V first
to mark it with something new so if
you're copying Casey and I stat or if
you figure getting the brand new Sony's
or some fancy lens that's gonna make you
look clear in low-light is going to give
you some advantage it's not going to
because everybody is neighbor can do it
20 year old guy is 18 year old guys and
I'm sure younger can do it and in fact
it matters a lot of the biggest vloggers
out there do not use super fancy
equipment some of these biggest vloggers
out there or video makers on YouTube
will use as an example they use they use
a smartphone to do all our video work
you know they just use a smartphone no
fancy mics anything and they get like
huge amounts of views what are some of
the biggest guys will just use a webcam
so at the end of the day what are the
most important rules in all media is
that content is king the sizzle will
only take you so far at the end of the
day you need some steak you need some
substance and I think you'll see a lot
of these loggers just fade into
obscurity as another thing is going to
happen I can tell you from my experience
in terms of online avatar
in selling advertising space advertising
on the web is becoming commoditized what
that means is that there's so many
places you can advertise YouTube
Facebook all different types of websites
you know out there a personal website
small websites that and I can go on and
on and on and on the point is is that ad
space is not running out in fact ad
space is only increasing so what that
does it drives the value of ads down
quite a bit and you're seen as we talk
youtubers complain about that what are
saying wow I know I'm not making nearly
as much revenue as I used to and what's
going on what's going on well what's
going on is that there's so many more
YouTube vloggers and there's only so
many advertisers so every 20 year old
kid who puts out a video that gets 500
views or 300 views or one of my videos
against 500 or 300 views I'm siphoning
off some of that ad add some of those ad
dollars that are would otherwise be
spent on fewer fewer YouTube channels I
saw this in the late 90s and early 2000s
were through my websites killer sites
column given a PHP and so forth I still
get a couple million page views a month
on those sites but at one point I was
part of the Adsense program of YouTube
at one point I was getting as much as $2
a click $2 every time so I'm gonna click
on a link and it's slowly after you know
house because I jumped on it when it
just just started and but has more and
more websites hooked up to Adsense
more and more competition came in the
value per click just kept dropping and
dropping and dropping then it was $2 and
a dollar 75 or 50 a dollar 50 cents 25
cents 10 cents I don't know what that
click is now I don't do too many Google
as not nearly as much because it's just
no point to it it doesn't make the same
as it used to be so understand then when
you jump into the YouTube game you jump
into any game as the market becomes
saturated more and more suppliers the
value of wedding
you're supplying we'll drop in no it
will drop in value so with YouTube you
can surely expect that the amount of
dollars you can make per video view or
per thousand views is the CPM is just
going to drop and it's it's gonna become
very very difficult and at the end of
the day getting spending a few thousand
dollars on cameras and equipment is not
going to make the difference if you
think you're gonna make your money just
talking about yourself jumping around
running around on a skateboard
think again you're not because KC is
wrapped at stuff up and you have to have
some new idea you have to have some new
idea you have to have some new
presentation there first goers into that
YouTube vlogger space that these guys
are established you're gonna have to
compete with many more vloggers and
these guys they had two three four years
ago that is for sure anyway I hope this
is useful bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
