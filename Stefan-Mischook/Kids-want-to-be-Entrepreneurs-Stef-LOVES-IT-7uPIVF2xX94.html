things I'm gonna cover in this vlog
number one I was reading article is very
interesting forget what newspaper
doesn't matter
they were asking kids what is your
career aspiration what would you like to
be when you grow up and the old
standards of actor sports star they fell
away
they have no interesting being an actor
much less interest in being a sports
star and I think that's a good thing
because those are just lottery ticket
type of professions and your short term
at best specially athlete right a
professional football player you know a
few years of fame fortune at the cost of
you know likely permanent brain damage
go nuts and you being pain the rest of
your life boxers too right so many
sports so many professional sports are
just a recipe for lifelong pain and
disaster and I can tell you that from
family members of mine who didn't quite
make it to the professional level not
because they didn't have the skill in
fact one of them had quite the skill but
because of her an injury here you don't
hear about all the promising young
athletes who lose it you know who don't
get their career going because they get
some injury I asked one of my uncle's
who was wanted to top basketball players
in Canada at the time he was in the
newspapers and people followed him for
years and I had in fact ten fifteen
years after his career was over as a
player in Canada
he I would run into people who'd
recognize the name and and I would get
perks because my uncle was a big name
that's why I used to watch of your uncle
play bla bla bla anyhow that said I
asked him a few years ago I said so now
but you know your older guy at least
seventy I said what if you had to do it
over again would you do it and without
hesitation he said no because he said he
had a few years
is of a bit of glory and a life-long of
pain pain with basketball it's not
exactly a rough sport compared to
football and boxing and MMA so anyway I
went off on a tangent so the young kids
bring it again pretty smart these young
guys and girls their number one
aspirations to become an entrepreneur
which kind of surprised me because when
I became an entrepreneur you know about
eight hundred thousand years ago I was
wonder do I start when I was 18 I was
one of the only persons actually I was
like one of the only people I knew my
age was even interested in doing
business today it's much more common
that you see younger people in the early
20s getting to business and I think one
of the reasons is because a the illusion
of the life life log secured job that
sort of disappeared
and what used to be for a period about
30 years you could be a lifer what kind
of company and you work there a great
job you get a pension fantastic that
period is that's gone now of course with
globalization and also people younger
people specially Millennials are there
there they got access to a lot more
information so they realize how the game
is played now there's nothing wrong it's
there's huge advantages by the way to
being an employee pay respects because
you know you're gonna get paid
you just have to worry about you your
job you have very little risk relative
to be an entrepreneur but there's also
it's it's a Faustian contract if you
will
Faust look it up felstein contract in
the sense that yes you get all those
advantages but the cost of huge
potential in terms of lifestyle in terms
of potential income and then there's the
lifestyle advantage of being
entrepreneur so I started my first
company when I was 18 years old with no
money no family connections and I built
that from there and at one time I took a
position in that you know in those 28
years where I worked in a big
corporation as a contractor
but all three weeks or something and it
was like the easiest gig ever for me
because all I had to do was I was just
managing the help system it was an old
Java project and I was in charge of the
help system that's all I had to worry
about as long as my house my help system
worked well my job was done I'd have to
worry about this partner system have to
worry about that I'd have to worry about
launch date I did have to worry about my
thing and it was so relaxed and I
remember I was brought in by a publicly
traded company - I was a hired gun
because they had tight deadlines I had
to meet to be able to get their
licensing from the government our
federal government up here in Canada so
they brought me in and it was a
high-pressure situation apparently it
was like 10 15 of us in the development
team and I just had to do my thing and
probably it's high stress for people who
are working there for me it was like
it's such an easy game because I knew I
just had to do my thing that was it so
anyway often attach it so your kids are
starting to say yeah being a sports star
is not such a great gig I guess they're
the interwebz are making them smarter
being an actor that's such a great
aspirational thing because you know
you've got one or two actors relatively
speaking who make the big money and
everybody else is the bad situation and
so yeah that was a kind of interesting
thing for me to read being an old-time
entrepreneur anyhow so I just thought
I'd bring that up don't worry my
entrepreneurial stuff in course is all
coming it's a we're slowly working on it
in between other things so that's it so
there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
