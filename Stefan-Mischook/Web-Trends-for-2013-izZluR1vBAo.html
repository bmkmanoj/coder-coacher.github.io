killer sites calm in this video blog I
want to talk about what I think are the
web design trends and the web
programming trends for 2013 a lot of my
ideas are based on when i see but also
based on what I've seen in the past and
that there are patterns if you will in
the nerd business cycles so you know
I've been doing this since the early 90s
so I seeing this roll around a few times
so what's the number-one trend for 2013
the number one technology you probably
want to learn if you're getting into the
web space and that's html5 and css3 this
is the big one this is going to go on
for the foreseeable future because all
the major players Google Apple Microsoft
etc they all support html5 and css3
wholeheartedly these this technology
works on all the major browsers it works
on android iOS it even works natively on
windows so you can actually write
Windows 8 you can actually write html5
and css3 apps that you can install round
windows 8 I haven't done that yet
because I don't have Windows 8 but the
point is it shows that the industry is
behind these technologies so it's the
future the great thing about learning
html5 and css3 is that you'll be able to
write apps for Android iOS and for your
traditional your traditional web apps
for you know for laptops and desktops
and so on so it's you're killing three
birds with one stone whereas if you
decide to get into iOS programming you
sort of you're basically caught trapped
inside of the Apple environment which
right now is good but who knows what
will happen in a year or two from now
these things to switch really quick and
some of you I know some of you may be
like no apples would be king forever but
look at rim blackberry research in
motion they were dominant for a few
several years and now they're a god so
if you want to be forward compatible you
wanna you want to learn a skill set that
you can use all over the place html5 and
css3 is a way to go so with html5 and
css3 you have to learn javascript
javascript is the scripting language
that glues it all together make sure
allows you to do all those crazy things
with all the dynamic stuff and the
programmatic stuff if you will with
html5 so you need to learn javascript
it's important the great thing about
JavaScript again it's it's it's going to
be I would imagine going to be probably
the most important programming language
over the next few years because again
it's cross-platform it's used on all the
web browsers or all devices it's used
even now on the server with nodejs so
javascript is something worth worthwhile
learning that is for sure apparently now
there's a shortage of JavaScript
programmers I don't know for sure but
this what I'm hearing for people who are
in that in that arena right now so it's
something to look into and javascript is
is one of the key languages and web
design web programming period the next
one next trend for 2013 adobe flash is
going to continue to get trounced
basically because of two things two
things because html5 css3 becoming
ubiquitous and because iOS will continue
to not support flash so that's a big
nail in that coffin and decides that
Android flash player for android is no
longer being supported by Adobe the
makers of flash that's pretty much kills
flash and it's actually dying even
quicker than I thought it would be so
don't be offended your flash programmer
I'm not attacking flash I was one of the
first users of flash when it first came
out I guess suit 1999 or something was
called future splash at the time so I've
been a supporter but you got to be
language and
gnostic in this game who cares today
it's flash tomorrow be html5 you know
don't get married to a technology or
spoken about this in the past yeah move
on your programming skills that you got
programming in ActionScript which is
flashes programming language you can
transfer that over to JavaScript pretty
easily so I wouldn't be too worried it's
not like you're you know it's not like
you're throwing away all your skills
there but again I wouldn't be investing
in flash now because that is pretty much
going of a way of many other dead
languages that we we we don't hear about
any more like lingo like pearl like
Pascal like Delphi if you haven't heard
of these languages well at one point or
another these were big by classic asp
that was huge who does that anymore so
all right let's finish off again
wordpress will continue to dominate will
be the most popular CMS / blogging
engine and as i talked about years ago
you get this class of web designer
called the WordPress I called WordPress
web designers and they do very well out
there as freelancers and so on because
so many websites use WordPress now is
the foundation to their site so you
should learn WordPress and finally of
course I'm a big advocate of that
language that certain nerds hate and
that's PHP PHP is the I called the duct
tape a programming language server-side
programming language because it's so
flexible it can be messy but it's very
flexible very powerful yet all kinds of
options all kinds of choices it's a
great language to learn do you learn PHP
you will increase your earning potential
tremendously you increase the number of
jobs you're going to find it's just one
of these cash cow languages PHP more
than even i would say html5 and css3 at
this point you want to make money
freelance or whatnot learn PHP if you're
especially if you going to be working
with wordpress
or you want to work with my forums and
so on these these type of all these so
many tools are built with WordPress what
I'm talking about tools Tardos web
software that you can stall it's just
crazy not to learn that language you you
can only benefit from it that's it for
now that was my predictions about the
web trends for 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
