you can see i'm at a hundred percent
resolution remember the shortcut is
command one or control one on your pc
and as you can see here we've got a very
simple mask applied to the guy layer
that i can move around here you can see
what's going on if i want to i can
remove the layer mask and i could do so
in a number of ways one way is to
actually click on this little box for
the mask drag it to the trash and it'll
ask you do you want to apply this before
removing it well you could just say
delete for example and in doing so what
we've done here is completely remove the
mask if i press command Z or controls
that on a pc I'll return that back to
the way it was another way of deleting a
mask is to right click on it and you can
delete it from this little drop-down
menu however rather than deleting the
mask you could also disable it by
disabling it as you can see you've got a
little X here and it shows the image as
if there was no mask applied to it
however if you want to bring that mask
back perhaps you've done a lot of work
to make that mask look the way you want
it to you can then say well let's enable
this mask so just doing that you can
bring it all back in certain instances
and if you remember when we were
dragging this mask to the trash it asked
us if we wanted to apply the layer mask
what that means is it will remove the
mask but your image now is looking as
though the mask is still there but it's
not a mask that we can actually affect
at this point the mask is gone and the
image has been damaged while in this
case it looks like it's damaged the
image has been actually affected by that
mask and now is this mask right here so
commands add I'll just return that back
to the way it was so what I want you to
do is to just right click delete it and
now we have the picture with no
application on it so at this point I can
show you a few more things about working
with this particular mask one thing that
we can do is not just apply the mask
as we've done here and then start using
brushes against it you can actually
start with a selection now there are a
number of ways that we can select so I
could use the quick selection tool that
we looked at a little bit earlier don't
worry about being perfect actually at
this point because well part of what I
want to be talking to you about and
showing you right here is how the mask
can actually do a lot of the extra work
that I want to do so at this point I'm
in a little bit of trouble with that
little last selection here that's okay
because we could always zoom in remember
here's a shortcut working with this
particular tool if you're clicking down
and when you do that you can also click
down but we can sort of zoom in on our
area but nevertheless i'm actually going
to leave it like this for this instance
because this is just a starting point
you can see I've left the ear here and
also I've left some areas here like
between the legs and in between the arms
that I haven't really addressed well
let's just start with a very simple
little selection like this and when we
want to create a layer mask but we have
a selection marching around as this one
is when you click on it take a look at
what happens everything outside of that
selection is made black meaning you
intentionally want to remove that area
with the mask but everything inside the
selected area is white so this is great
for us because now we can zoom in on our
area so i can press Z or Z and here we
have our magnification zoom tool and we
can just click in a little bit remember
just click and slide to the right or
slide to the left depending on how you
want to zoom in and then I'm pressing my
spacebar to get my hand tool up here and
at this point you can select a brush
actually I'm going to work with a
regular brush here we go it's way too
large so you can right click and you can
change the size or
me we can press the square bracket and
the square bracket is right here so
you'll notice when you're working with
black it's going to remove the area so I
don't want that but to switch it we can
click on this or just press X and I can
start bringing in some of the area that
i have here now it's okay if you go a
little farther than you want the reason
being is that you can always either zoom
in or even if you just work with a very
small tool as I have right here I'll
make it even smaller and I'll switch to
black once you switch to black you can
come in here and you can start rushing
out some of the areas that you don't
want to keep so just by moving around
like this don't worry if you go too far
in because you can always just press X
bring some of that back nice and easy so
as you can see there's real a lot of
easy work that you can do in this case
pressing X you can take away some of
those areas will refine this even more
in a future example but as you can see
that's fairly easy to do so all of this
area that's greyish I'm just clicking
along getting rid of it it's rather
small brush I know but that kind of
works for us in this instance here I
might want to switch to white and white
will reveal so sorry i'll keep it in
black and underneath that we can see
that the area between his arms is now
starting to become transparent now if I
hide the petri dish you can sort of see
that and if you've gone too far
okay you can just move it around back
again if you want to zoom in or out
again sometimes moving without the tile
or if you do have it in there you can
see that you can get some of that the
scrubby zoom is the zoom that we saw
notice I'm scrubbing my zoom so here if
I want to work with this brush switch
back to my be brush tool we don't want
to hide that area in this case I want
some white in there to bring it back you
might want to use a larger brush so
right square bracket so as you can see I
can sort of bring back that area and
then decide to press X and switch back
to my white one and say okay now it's
time for me to get rid of some of this
extra space that I've got here and
delete some of that so as you can see
just by switching black and white to
bring back or to remove different areas
that you do or do not want very easy to
do press Black Press white so we can
make our brusher smaller remember just
by working like that can make our
brushes larger right square bracket
switch back to white to reveal some of
this area and anything that you don't
want you can quickly remove or return
based on what you have so it's a real
nice and easy way to work and very very
simple means of creating your image and
masking working in this fashion so as
you can see we've got the guy I've got
the petri dish behind him I can move him
around let's go back to a hundred
percent command one notice it's not
exactly one hundred percent per
I could still refine it better and we'll
do that in a future episode as I've
mentioned but nevertheless right you can
see the area in here as opposed to in
here and you can continue working in
that fashion and if you do a really nice
job you'll have a very smooth image by
the way we can also do something similar
just by using something like a magic
wand tool if you do happen to have you
know a lot of an area that looks pretty
much you know the same similar size and
color and notice these little bits here
which are a little bit too much in
certain areas well we could not rarely
have to worry about that because we
could just apply our mask actually
that's gone the other way around so I'll
just apply it this way and any areas
that need refinement like these areas
over here you can certainly just brush
them in just by using and utilizing the
mask area and technique that you have
right there so masking is very easy to
work with and there are a lot of similar
things that we can do with it but
there's even more that I want to show
you with this and will do so in just a
second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
