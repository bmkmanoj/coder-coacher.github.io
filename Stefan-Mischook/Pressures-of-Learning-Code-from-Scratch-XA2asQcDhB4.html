to head out but I thought I'd crack out
a quick vlog for you guys with regards
to learning how to code when you're
totally new
well this applies to learning anything
when you're totally new and bringing
this up because I have over last year
been learning how to manage my fancy
DSLR camera this is a camera with
interchangeable lenses it has all kinds
of settings I've been learning how to
control the camera well how to control
the camera I've been doing videos of
screen capture videos since 2003 and
I've done the occasional vlogs like
video or live video where see me but a
lot of times I use a webcam about a year
so go I decided to step up my game so I
bought a fancier camera and and then I
had to start learning how weave cameras
works right now I'll just get to the
point when you are learning something
new coding HTML Python CSS PHP Java
whatever server technology whatever you
happen to be learning new when you're
first starting out it's daunting because
it's kind of like a dark room and you're
walking through and you're not sure if
you're going to bump into a wall and you
will bump into walls and you're not sure
when you're actually going to start
seeing the light when you guys start
getting a good idea about the layout of
the room if you will so which you have
to do when you're starting off something
new is you have to recognize that that's
going to be the case you have to sort of
almost have faith as you move forward
that the knowledge will become clearer
and clearer as you progress slowly
slowly step by step so it's a very it's
an incremental process you learn a
little bit a little learn a little a
little more a little more a little more
a little more and things will start to
clear up the haze will start to lift
it's quite acceptable if you just keep
consistently working at it so try not to
get frustrated especially when you're
starting out it's very daunting so I
bring all this up because I've been
reminded of the
recently over last year where I said
well I want to up my video game I want a
video my video in turns a live video
game so I had to get a bit better camera
so I got a decent camera and so I had to
learn how to use the camera had to
understand all these settings in the
complexities why because I wanted more
control over the quality of the video
that I'm producing hopefully it's higher
quality video if I wanted to have a
blurry background I wanted to know how
to do that
etc etc etc etc so it just takes time
and I would say now after about a year
just really you know left full time not
even close to full time but just taking
the effort to slowly learn how these
fancier cameras work so I can go into
there's many different modes on these
type of camera different levels of
automation in the camera so I would just
I typically just said to full automatic
and it would just you know 85 9 % of
times cool no problem but if I wanted to
have that particular control depending
on circumstances lighting blurry
background not so blurry background fast
movement or slow movement etc except I
didn't know what to do as I said I had
to learn this stuff so I step by step
increase the level of for lack of better
turns complexity in terms of my ability
to handle the camera and now I'm at the
point where I go in full manual mode
where I control just about every aspect
of the camera which gives me a much
better control over the resulting image
same thing with coding and programming
you start off light you start off light
you start doing simple things and slowly
step by step and you'll see at some
point the haze will just list away and
also a lot of things have been confusing
you for months perhaps well so now I
understand and you'll be wondering why
you thought it was difficult to begin
with the key to this is that consistent
relaxed effort towards the go every day
a little bit more every day a little bit
more
so it's basic theory on what you're
working with that's the foundation you
do that every day and then you do some
actual work so in terms of coding you
learn the basics then you do so you know
simple things let's say you're doing
some HTML you and the basics of what a
tag is you learn three or four tags then
you you write a bunch of tags out on
tongue and code you write it out then
you go to the next level you learn a
little bit more that you implement
implement means you just basically take
what you learned and you've actually put
it to use I first got this from my
martial arts background so for example
when I want to learn how to box when I
do first day in the gym I got in the
ring and I sparked I took a beating next
time I got to jail I took another
beating but every time I got into the
ring and I started sparring my skills
always slowly got better and better in
between sparring sessions though I would
have a coach and teach me the basics and
the foundations and I get in there and
try to put him to use and it's a back
and forth back and forth back and forth
back and forth so I apply that with my
camera work where I got my you know
semi-pro camera I went off full auto and
I went to semi-auto
so it could where the camera will
control some of its functions
automatically and I would be able to
control one of its functions for
instance and I continue to continue now
I'm at the point where I'm using full
manual so I had total control although
there's one aspect of the cameras
functionality of you I let the camera
handle for reasons that we'll get into
now I'm not doing a camera how to work a
camera vlog here but the point is it's
the increments an incremental process
don't let it get you down which is all
cloudy and hazy now in a good course
should give you that nice solid
foundation coupled with little mini
projects more Foundation more mini
projects more Foundation basics and then
slightly more complex projects and then
and then you know when you get to an
intermediate level more when you're
moving away up to that stage except the
projects should become more and more and
more complex and you gradually get
better just like if you were
lifting weights you don't start trying
to live 200 pounds you start with
whatever you can lift in the beginning
right 25 pounds 50 pounds liver it is a
slowly everyday you build a build or do
it up and build up and that's it so I
hope you found this vlog useful and now
it's time for my shameless plug so you
may or may not know I wrote this book
web design and web design start here
find it on Amazon highly-rated I wrote
this book so it's not too thick nobody
wants to read 500 page both this book
was designed to get you the big picture
of what designs you learn html5 css3
touches javascript and you learn about
the big picture around it and you learn
the key aspects of each of these
languages and when you finish this book
well even way before you finish this
book you're going to be able to build
modern websites that are responsive
meaning that the work in the working you
know big normal computer screens the
resize and reshape automatically for
small devices and a whole bunch of other
things as well the idea again my
teaching style
please teach the key basics give you
projects that you can put those basic
skill sets to work which will take you
into an intermediate level but then the
most important thing is you're going to
understand the foundations of all this
stuff so you'll be able to then explore
these things on your own you'll be able
to go and I mentioned other resources
where the documentation for HTML the
documentation for CSS it won't be just
all gobbledygook won't be so confusing
to you because you would you will have
the solid foundation I wrote this book
by the way as the to prepare myself for
my new courses on studio web so if you
like video you have those options as
well
and I guess that's it for the shameless
plug have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
