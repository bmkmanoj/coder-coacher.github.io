with killer sites calm and Killa pH be
calm in this quick video I'm gonna go
over what I call the professional web
design process a roadmap this is
actually a series of steps and questions
that that are involved in the web design
process these are questions that you
should ask when you're starting any new
project I've been asked many times by
people to try to tie it all in together
for them because they're not sure how to
how to proceed so this is what I've been
doing for a long time and that's how I
approach every project and it really
simplifies the process speeds things up
and so it's pretty useful to learn I'm
assuming for this video that you've done
my complete web designer over my
complete web program or packages or at
least you know you know your way around
HTML and CSS and design and maybe a
little bit of a Jeff script a little bit
of PHP these sorts of things so what I'm
gonna do this is a an actual PDF guide
if you will that comes included with the
complete web designer and a complete web
programmer packages so this video here
is really a supplemental to this list so
I'm gonna read off the list some I'm
looking at it now if you haven't figured
it out but I'm gonna add color I'm gonna
supplement the point forms and quick
little examples that I have in the in
the PDF so let's start with the
beginning so the five steps questions in
the web design process when starting a
new project number one you have to ask
yourself this question if the site will
be updated very often or more than one
person will be editing the site's
content then which you should be
considering is building off of a CMS
like Drupal Joomla CMS is short for
content management system or maybe a
blog software like WordPress and these
days blog software and CMS is they're
the very similar there's a lot crossover
functionality so if you were having say
a smaller site you know with one or two
authors contributing you know maybe you
know whatever a few hundred pages couple
subsections that kind of stuff then
WordPress is probably the choice for you
if you find that you may have many
authors and they may have all kinds of
different levels of access many
subsections we have a much more complex
site where the content is changing a lot
then you probably want to go towards
something like Joomla or Drupal or any
other CMS a kind of full-blown content
management system simply because they're
they have the infrastructure in place to
be able to handle about much more
complexity in the site once you've
decided to either go with a CMS or not
this is step two it's time to work on
the fuse at this time better say you
know when I say views what I'm talking
about is the pages that people actually
will see so if you're working with a
client what you would do would sit down
with them and you might draw a little
diagram say okay what do you need you
need products pages Contact Us page what
do you want to have a home page and you
sort of map this out you know if they're
gonna have any commerce store what are
you gonna need so you map out the views
and the reason you do this and draw it
on paper or something and the reason you
do this is so that you and the client
can have a clear idea of what you're
looking at in terms of the scope of the
original site so visit this this is an
important step and it helps clarify the
project number three once you've defined
your pages and so on and this will
change of course as a project evolves
because I can assure you that clients
will will have different ideas so you
gotta be ready to to be flexible
next thing you want to do is you want to
define the global style and the
structure of the site so first of all
page layout style you know whether the
page is going to be left aligned or
Center aligned these type of things you
know what are going to be included in
the main menus
you know like on killer sites we ever
talk mean many of its consistent
throughout the site what's gonna be in
that main menu what's important to the
client you want to also look at the
specific design elements like the font
styles for both body text and header
text this way you just either find this
in your CSS pages so this you can roll
out and make sure it's consistent across
the site those type of considerations
are very important especially with
static sites because if you're using a
Drupal WordPress it's it's really it's
easy it's really easy to update that not
scratch that it's pretty easy if you
design your sites properly with CSS this
is all pretty easy to change very
quickly it's good to set things up so
you set up your master stylesheet from
the beginning so you sort of define all
this so you'd have to go back and you
know it's often to change everything
further to that site colors you know you
want to choose well matched colors if
you're colorblind you may want to go to
Adobe to have this cooler tool it's kind
of cool so you can you know let's say
you take your clients logo and you can
put those colors into the cooler program
it's a web program by the way Adobe
provides for free and then you can you
know cooler will tell you which colors
would work with the logo so then you can
use that as the basis of the color
scheme for the site okay so step four if
you're not using a CMS plan on the use
of PHP includes to create common page
elements like footers headers and menus
so in stage four and step four rather
there's an assumption you're not going
to use a CMS because if you use the CMS
then all of this is defined for you if
you've ever used WordPress or Drupal all
the slide many menus are there and this
is all defined in the theme but you use
for a particular CMS again I'm assuming
that you've done my videos on these
subjects I'm not going to elaborate
about the themes and CMS's and so on
anyway what step for us up your
structure for your pages I always say
you should you know you shouldn't use
basic HTML pages anymore there's no
point to that you just you just
handcuffing yourself in terms of
functionality if you just use plain HTML
what you should be doing is going in
there and using at least PHP pages so
you can take advantage of PHP making
mechanisms like the include mechanism so
again step for you use includes the
create column page almost like your
footers your headers your menus and so
on statch stage 5 or step 5 I'm gonna
read this right off when you have steps
one to four cover it's time to start
building so you notice you know before
we actually you know wrote much code you
know you moved it some your basic CMS
CSS and your basic you know pages you
know at stage 5 is when you actually get
into it and you actually start building
out the site for real and one point I
make is consider the use of templates
for at least the structure of the page
and if you can find it a template could
also be used as a basis of the site in
terms of design remember don't reinvent
the wheel so I'm not saying that you
should use templates for your design all
the time this no but you can you can
it's it's a viable option you find a
nice template you base the site on that
you reconfigure it you tweak it this is
done all the time it works good it
doesn't necessarily have to look like a
template site because you'll change in
you you you modify this you know so it
looks different that said you should I
wouldn't be typically I wouldn't be
trying to build CSS based layouts the
structure of the layouts from scratch
you know there's so many structural
templates out there for instance
Dreamweaver cs4 cs5 and so on the
outcome of all these free CSS templates
you can grab it I want Center lined and
you know that those templates will CSS
templates
we'll be bug free and well tested so you
don't have to worry about screwing
around with how the layout works in ie6
versus IE 7 this will be done for you
you know so what do you need to know to
do all this kind of stuff that was it
that was the five steps by the way right
number one you know choose whatever now
you're gonna use the CMS or not number
two you want to start figure out what
pages what views nerds call pages the
views could you view them right I
products page contact page you know I
sit down with the climb you start to
figure this out and then number three
you define your global styles and your
page layout your menus your font colors
number four then you if you're not using
a CMS or a blog then you use you set up
your your common elements for your pages
your footage your headers your menus and
so on I suggest using PHP although you
can use any dynamic page technology if
you want to use ASP or asp.net sup to
you I'm a big big proponent of PHP and
you want to know why just go to killer
PHP com you learn all about that so you
set that up and four and Step five is
actually start building everything with
this information you pull this together
you may leverage a visual template at
least leverage a structural template so
you don't have to screw around with
layout issues across browsers stuff that
you could run into so what should you
know you need to know a little HTML and
CSS you should know some PHP some
JavaScript I always say that web
designers should also learn at least a
blog or our blog like product like a
WordPress and get to know well because I
can guarantee you that you're gonna run
into clients are gonna want
functionality that these blogs or these
CMS's will provide for free so why why
create hassles for yourself learn one
and
and get really good at so you can just
go implement it really easily another
thing you're gonna need to know for
modern web designs you need to
understand an ajax library there's a few
out there jquery script Acula s-- and so
on I've decided to hitch my boat to to
jQuery because it's used quite a bit and
I think Microsoft is with it and a few
other big companies it's a very robust
library so you want to add all kinds of
fancy JavaScript based widgets at page
jQuery is a way to go another thing you
might want to learn it's the pick us
forum software to install and get to
know how to configure a lot of sites may
require forums it is not as much of a
priority as the other things but it's
still something to have in the back of
your head another thing to learn about
is a credit I had to reshoot this last
segment again my apologies because the I
don't know what the camera just stopped
working for some reason
anyway the last thing you should learn
about is you should learn a credit card
processor something like PayPal or
whatnot it's just so that you understand
the process of setting up credit card
and an e-commerce type of transactional
situation I think more and more going
along from my theme but I've been
pushing it but we're going to see a lot
more small business out there that are
gonna be using websites I think knowing
how to set up an e-commerce situation
makes sense so you should in that case
you're gonna need to use some third
party processor we we use one of our own
for own credit card processing we also
use paypal paypal is quite easy to set
up there's many different levels you can
set it up just using basic HTML or you
could set it up using a combination of
PHP and HTML so you can you know send
things back and forth and you actually
and people actually rather also provides
a full API so
you can do everything seamlessly within
your site so they offer a good range I'm
not trying to push PayPal you can use
any processors you like there's many
good ones out there it's just the point
is it's taken the point is is this just
to learn at least one so you understand
how it works and they all pretty much
worked the same way there's nuances and
differences and some are easier in
certain contexts than others but once
you know one to work with other
processors other payment gateways is
pretty simple or not compared to not
knowing any anyhow that's it if you want
to learn more about the skills that you
need to know become a professional web
designer web programmer you can check
out the killer sites comm magazine it's
killer slice comm / magazine and just do
a search for skills of professional web
design and then go into detail there big
list and some comments along the way I'm
Stephanie shucks I hope you liked this
video my apologies for the interruption
I don't know why the camera stopped but
yeah technology alright have a good day
we'll talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
