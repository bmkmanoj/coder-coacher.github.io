number four is there such a thing as a
killer product of course there is is
there such a thing as being able to
identify a killer product all the time
in you see often enough in business and
I've seen in my own business where the
founders or the CEOs people in charge
figure that product day is going to be a
big hit and product D turns out to be
the actual biggest hit and so you know
product a but they thought was going to
be big hit turns out to be yeah and the
the some strange product down the road
you know down this down the list rather
is the big hit so you never know what's
gonna work in business you never know
what's gonna work in business that's
just a fact of life even with the
biggest ones you know you have some
flukes where you got like the Zuckerberg
who get it the first time out but
they're flukes
you know the he for instance Zuckerberg
did Facebook fine big huge hit of course
very unusual you can't look to guys like
Zuckerberg as the example because
they're exception it's like looking at
the guy or the girl who wins the lottery
ticket and figure okay we got to do what
they did because they win the lottery
winning lottery is very rare most of the
millionaires self-made millionaires most
of the wealth or generate by by people
who have small businesses that earn
steady money over of years and he
managed the money well and that's how
wealth is generally accumulated the
Zuckerberg and the Steve Jobs and Bill
Gates's of the world those are very very
rare exceptions so never model yourself
off of them so let's talk about again
the killer products yeah the killer
product good selling product rather is
the key to successful business you have
to have a good product at the end of the
day you're gonna have great marketing
you can have lots of contacts and so
forth but if your product is no good
people don't like your product whether
it be a proper service or a physical
good what not it's not going to work for
you so since you have no idea what is
going to be a great product what it's
not going to be a great product you know
I'll tell you my personal experience I
had in my first business where I was
involved in hybrid bacteria
water purification and rare fish I
remember we had a set of six or seven
products for water purification using
aquariums and so on and we were
convinced that this product over here
was gonna do amazing and but what
actually happened was this product over
here was the big seller it's the one
what we thought was going to do amazing
didn't do well at all this one over here
was a big seller I've been a friend of
mine as well he got this product where
you would it was like this powdery
chemical and you throw it on liquids and
it would except up the liquids and as it
was sucking up the liquid this powder
would turn into a beets Boosh
and it was suck the liquid so let's say
you spilled grape juice on your carpet
you throw this stuff on it pulls the
grape juice right out of the fibers in
the carpet so you don't stay in your
carpet so we saw this would go wow this
is an amazing product so oh my god it's
gonna sell so well so you put it
together put together presentation so I
went with I remember when I saw some
huge retailers up here and mirror one of
the guys said yeah yeah we've seen this
before about five years ago company came
out we felt was gonna be the best thing
ever but we put on the shelves and
nobody ever bought it so we had a few
people experience in business including
a manager of a big retail chain they
thought it was gonna work but for some
reason it just didn't work so now that
we've you know I've covered the fact
that you don't know what products gonna
work but a great product is key to
making your business work at the end
what do you do what's the business
strategy the business strategy is it's
like fishing you gotta go out there and
you gotta get out as many products as
you can as quickly as cheaply as you can
to see which ones will stick that's the
strategy and then when you see which one
will stick you do what you do what one
of my mentors told me follow the money
the sales will tell you where to go in
terms of your products now well here's
something I want to speak about remember
Zuckerberg you know he's the Facebook
guy and so he got Facebook and you know
he did well that's great and he's modest
he's a smart guy there's no question of
that so you figured out the sky is
amazing you know so his second business
he bought oculus rift oculus right VR
headset well apparently that's not doing
so well apparently that's crashing and
burning last time I heard could be wrong
but even one of the most successful
entrepreneurs in history they really
Zuckerberg total failure it looks like
with all the money and the prestige and
the power and the ability to promote it
looks like the oculus is not going to be
going too far so keep that in mind I was
just an example I'm not taking a shot at
his echo Burke you know the kid days
super successful but I'm just saying you
don't know you don't know so you got to
sort of approach it like somebody goes
fishing you keep throwing out the line
trying different bait trying different
spots until you know something hits and
the same thing with a box or boxers out
there throwing jabs until something hits
so that's pretty much it for
