sites calm killer PHP com in this video
blog I'm going to answer a couple
questions that were put to me in
response to a recent video blog I put up
called choosing a web design software
and so I got a comment from this guy
named calls himself goon to four or five
and stuff is there any advantage to
using Dreamweaver or Komodo in an MVC
environment I couldn't say offhand I
believe that at least I know for sure of
it dreamweaver supports a version
control systems now version control
system is basically a piece of software
but tracks of changes you make to your
files whether it be HTML or PHP files or
whatnot and if you as you update the
system it keeps track of all the changes
so let's say on july first you have you
know you have a page a PHP page with 500
lines of code and by july sixth it has
seven hundred lines of code and then you
realize you want to go back to the july
first version is click a button and the
version control system will allow you to
go back instantly and get that Oh
version of the code this is all done
automatically so it's version control
version of the project control so it
also dreamweaver I believe support
subversion I'm just looking at my my
notes here I'm not sure of comodo does
so y'all should have never used Komodo I
just looked at it very quickly looks
good I'm and I'm going to do a
comparative review I think of Komodo
versus Dreamweaver and others some time
to future for people so yeah is anyone
superior in an in an MVC environment I
couldn't say just occasional no MVC is
short for Model View can
roller and it's just a way of
structuring your web site or your web
applications and you should only be
concerned about model-view-controller if
you're really getting into programming
web application web design programming
as opposed to building websites with
some program programmatic elements
injected in there so if you're building
a site with a simple ecommerce saying
that you're dropping in or maybe you're
dropping into a wordpress and maybe some
jquery stuff in there you don't have to
really you know concern yourself about
MVC but if you're building something
from scratch you know when you want to
start learning about that of course
that's the standard way of building
these things these days and when it
comes to a version control then you're
looking at you know you gotta several
options GI tea and subversion and there
are others yeah so let's see let's get
to the next question my next question
they asked about what about a colleague
door 855 and he's asking what about
linux and open source software what are
your thoughts about that or do you think
web design could only work with ms
windows or OS 10 Apple I'm thinking
Photoshop of Linux open sources grades
fine you know if you're a tech oriented
type of guy then you might want to go
with Lennox cuz everything is there you
a lot more control you can optimize the
linux operating system so it runs really
really fast with your software what do i
mean by that many years ago i get 10
years ago a good friend of miles of
linux nut and what we did is we took an
old machine i had that ran windows
pretty slow and we we took linux
installed it but we re compiled the
linux kernel now the colonel is
basically
part of the operating system think like
a kernel of corn you know and so he did
most of the work as I didn't know too
much about Linux oh you know but weary
compiled it so that we stripped out all
the exits drivers all the excess stuff
and we made that installation of Linux
specifically for my particular computer
for its CPU the hardware the video card
etc so ratan really fast so when we
compiled it it was incredible it was
incredible how much faster the
recompiled Linux was because we got rid
of all the extra junk so the computer
just ran super efficiently it was really
cool because it just took this old
computer which was really becoming too
slow and made it very very fast and
there's a lot of fun the problem of
Linux at the time was that you really
had to you know yet issues with hardware
support and limited software support
it's much better today avidly I haven't
looked at Linux and years except you
know we use it on our servers but I just
use it as a user so I don't take it
around in there i just know basic linux
commands that said it's great for web
development around people who do
software development programming and so
forth all analytics there are photoshop
replacements so you don't need I don't
believe Photoshop runs on legs but there
are there are other programs like the
GIMP which you know runs on linux and
that project might be others I think
perhaps a version of corel photo-paint
you can still around that I believe
there's a Linux version that all said
Photoshop and image editing on the web
is much less important than it was just
five six years ago much much less
important you know photoshop was a major
part of the web design process or some
full editing program in the past now
it's really you know an afterthought it
really is because of the power of
CSS and now no html5 and css3 your use
of Photoshop is diminishing of every
year and ultimately you just need
something to be able to output clean
crisp clear PNG's or JPEGs or gifts
depending on your circumstance are
depending on your knee driver and that's
about an T 0 in the old days you have to
use Photoshop to slice images place
things and these things do it for image
rollovers all this is really old school
stuff that's quickly being replaced so
yeah I wouldn't be too concerned about
the image editing software because it
has a far diminished role in the whole
web design process so there you go wit
I'll conclude by saying when it comes to
web design software to revisit that you
know the original question you know MVC
Linux or Windows Mac OS a lot of this
comes down to taste I really depends on
the individual how they like to work
what they like to do I think that
designer types are probably going to be
much more comfortable on mac or windows
especially Mac Mac as a tradition and
and then the realtek geeky guys guys
rule I get to hard code the MVC guys and
the Java guys Ruby guys they might be
gravitate more towards Linux because of
that that ability to configure the
operating system although I would argue
you know since Mac OS is actually sits
on top of freebsd which is a type of
unix it's you know basically you know
linux is a type of unix freebsd is a
type of unix you get much in a control
and power of a unix based system in Mac
OS but you get the tremendous user
friendliness that you have in
coeds and since the operating system is
you know Mac OS will cost you thirty
bucks of course you have to write on my
card over which a little pricier but
it's top-of-the-line stuff I recommend
people go to Mac you i've used linux i
use windows for years and i've been
using mac OS and think it's about 2007
some relatively a newcomer to mac and
have to say once you go mac you never go
back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
