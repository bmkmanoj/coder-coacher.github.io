I've lived well for days I was out of
town I took a little mini vacation down
to Florida an old friend of mine was
gracious enough to invite me down to his
place on the Intracoastal if you don't
know what intercoastal is basically I
don't even I don't know if I would call
rivers but it's basically all these
canals if you will that are connected to
the ocean but there are separated from
the ocean so in South Florida there's
this network of all these canals these
are not man-made these are naturally
occurring and as a result of these
canals you have tall saltwater and you
have all these people with houses and
condos right on these canals and there's
this big boating culture so you can go
to restaurants right on a canal Oracle
Intracoastal right on these these these
intercostal you dock right at the
restaurant even some restaurants will
serve your food it's very relaxing
because where my buddy liz is in a place
called Hallandale or Hallandale it's
just north of miami and so you have the
best of both worlds there I find where
you have the feeling where you are in
the tropics palm trees everywhere it's
you you can easily get the quiet places
in the intercostals and fine
beaches are not so populated or if you
like what's an action you can pretty
quickly get down to Miami South Beach
dock there that's pretty cool anyway so
with this log I just want to quickly
talk about a grind in business and in
software development and they go hand in
hand in the sense that when you're
approaching any project any job
especially business or learning
something you literally had a code you
have to understand that they're going to
be point or you're going to have to grow
and it through where it's not going to
be the most pleasant thing necessarily
and that's just part of the process and
so let me just jump into business for a
second the grinded business is huge
it's huge because when you first start a
business it's exciting at first new
ideas you're launching a product then
you get it out there and then there's
this grind to make it work it's like
walking through three feet of snow you
know or if you're not from a co not come
from a cold climates like walking in the
ocean in three feet of water slogging
through is slow and it's difficult and
as such when people tell you when you
hear but you better really make a
passionate about your business well
maybe passion is a too strong a word
perhaps but you have to really like what
you do you have to be enthusiastic about
what you do has to be fun because it's
not fun and when you hit that inevitable
wall that slog that that grind that
you're going to have to do count on it
unless you're really lucky you're not
going to want to do it and if you're not
willing to grind and push through those
moments you won't succeed so you have to
be sure that your approach is something
that you like to do so if you are an
aspiring coder at coding fascinates you
fantastic now for young people out there
don't think that you're going to make
any huge mistakes by learning this
language versus that language oh should
I learn Java or Python should I learn no
in JavaScript that's not such a huge
issue but I'm going to tie this back to
the original idea here so you know
because all these languages share many
to say characteristics so if you decide
to for example they're Python and then
you decide well for type of work I want
to actually I want to get into
JavaScript node it's not like you wish
your time with Python everything that
you learned in Python will be applicable
or 90% to no so you won't be wasting
your time so when it comes to learning
to code
learning technology what are the things
that I suggest to people and I know to
be the case
is that understanding the basics of
these technologies is essential I would
say for any entrepreneur even if you're
not getting into tech even if you're
getting into travel tourism you're
getting into selling some arts and
crafts that you do understanding at
least the basics of coding and my
suggestion would be the web stack first
that's HTML CSS some JavaScript and then
you can take it from there to pay or
what you want to do understanding these
basic technologies is like having a tool
belt that you can get to at any time
even if you're not going to be writing
the code yourself being able to
understand it being able to communicate
with professional developers is such a
valuable tool set to have and so going
back to the grind what you'll see in
small business having a web presence and
leveraging technology is essential so
having these basic coding skills comes
comes to bat and it's going to help you
tell you it's gonna help you many times
in those grinding periods where you're
working on the marketing where you're
trying to tweak your website and you're
just trying to get things right etc etc
etc etc I'm a big advocate that
everybody should learn to code because
it's been so useful to me in my life
since I started coding in the early 90s
94 as I believe what I've wrote my first
web page so it's is such an important
skill it's for me reading writing your
first language math and code these are
four pillars of anybody should have
under their belt in this day and age so
there you go that's it I'm going to how
long we're going so to close off this
video remember that there's going to be
a grinding period whether you're
learning a new technology or new skill
set or whether you're starting a
business and being
are it's going to be a grind period at
some point as such jump into something
which is fun for you interesting for you
intellectually I think perhaps depending
on how many people watch this video
comment on this video I can start doing
videos on some tricks to handle the
emotional pressures that learning
something new and starting and running
and building a business can bring onto
and that's very useful all right
to jump
