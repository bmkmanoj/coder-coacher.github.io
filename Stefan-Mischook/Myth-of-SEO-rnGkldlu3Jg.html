sights calm in this video we're gonna
talk about the myth of SEO the myth of
SEO so SEO is show for search engine
optimization and it is the process of
messing around with your website's code
and the text to make it more search
engine friendly this is a practice is
this thing this is a thing that you had
to do maybe 10 years ago if people build
websites user using modern techniques
and everybody does these days that's
html5 css3 based web design and web app
development you don't really need to do
any SEO in a traditional sense so if
somebody tries to sell you SEO
optimization for your website unless
your website was built 10 years ago
using heavy images and lots of flash and
stuff like that you don't need any SEO
work the reason you don't need SEO work
again well two reasons actually a
because web development and design
coding techniques are far better today
they're naturally search engine friendly
they're naturally search engine
optimized and then number two the search
engines are much more intelligent today
the search engines are able to crawl
your website crawl meaning search
through your website much more easily
than they did 10 years ago Google Bing I
would imagine they're incredibly
powerful today in terms of you know them
being able to extract information
I've actually actually written a blog
post and within a minute it appears in
the Google search engines it's it's
crazy fast these days so no you don't
need to really do SEO optimization on
the other hand you have to do web
marketing and web marketing means you
have to at the heart of it really you
have to write really good content for
your site and number two you have to
have social engagement for your site
that means you have to make sure get
your site on on this social networks
Twitter Facebook pin
interest whatever Instagram I don't know
about Instagram but anyway you have to
get your site out there in being spoken
about in the social networks the search
engines pay much more attention to that
than they used to in the past so this is
nothing new but I just wanted to spell
this whole SEO myth we need to a search
engine search engine optimize your site
the best way you can search engine
optimize your site is to have a really
have really good content on your site
and be to get your site socially engaged
if you will all right that's it for now
sorry I was it's typical for me
incognito I've been working months now
on new courses and training packages and
so on so I've just been really busy too
busy to video blog but I'm getting close
to getting things done so we'll talk
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
