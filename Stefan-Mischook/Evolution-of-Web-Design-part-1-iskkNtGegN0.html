killer sights calm in this podcast or
video cast or screen cast whatever you
want to call it I'm going to be
discussing the evolution of web design
and what this basically is about is
about how every once in a while web
design goes through a major change and
this change actually is often reflected
in an advancement in the technology the
importance of this video is for managers
web designers aspiring web designers the
importance of this video is for them to
recognize what the current trend is so
that they can identify the skillsets
about a modern web designer needs to
know today in 2010 and probably for the
next several years
today a modern web design is actually in
the middle of a shift
from the from the glass change and the
shift is moving into what I would call
the web 2.0 web designer and that's
somebody who not only understands the
basic technology of the web HTML CSS
browsers and so on but this is a
usability and a kind of stuff a web 2.0
web designer has the understanding and
ability to implement to insert the web
to point all capabilities into their web
work so we're talking things like blogs
and content management systems we're
talking about Ajax enabled widgets
things you know things that will slide
open and close like for instance here's
an example here see that little widgets
that slide open and close here this is
basic basic stuff using modern
techniques for instance go to contact we
have a contact form this is built you
know everybody can build a form but how
do you process the form is very simple
PHP will process this for modern web
designers should know how to implement
these simple things because be
hard-pressed these days to find a
website where you're not going to need
some those kind of widgets those kind of
gadgets for instance they go to killer
sites another quick example little web
2.0 widgets you know very useful and if
you as a web designer have to go back
and always find a programmer to install
one of these scripts for you you're
gonna be in a major disadvantage versus
you know guys who actually embrace the
new web
I'm not gonna get into detail about this
modern web designer you have a good idea
I'll put out a new podcast on that
specifically very soon what I want to do
is I want to go back and I want to show
how in our recent history and web design
how this happened a couple of times
before just in case you're not convinced
about this big shift and how important
it is to move with the changes in the
web design world so we're going to go
way back back to nineteen 1994 I guess
that's what I desired my very first web
page and in those days you know if you
had a an image in your web page a color
image or like a superstar most of the
web at that time was non-commercial most
of the web was university websites came
from a hobby website it was pretty much
text only maybe a couple images here and
there but it was it was pretty ugly and
basically had a bunch of nerds who were
involved all these nerds very few of any
had graphic design training so the web
was really an ugly unusable place and
then there was a shift was the book
creating killer websites I can get to it
about actually now this book was
actually killer sites actually was
founded on this you know to support this
book initially this book was probably
the best-selling book at its time and
basically it helped it helped usher in
the first evolution of the web where in
this book the author they had seen ow he
basically preached that you should as a
web designer utilize design principles
you know you know alignment and good use
of fonts that kind of stuff in your web
design work and then he showed web
designers how to hack this out because
at the time the technology was really
weak in that regard
so that was the first evolution of the
web from being just a bunch of text only
pages with the occasional image and it
was just a giant mess to becoming a
website becoming a web world where
design principles started to creep into
web design and the web became a much
more aesthetically pleasing place at the
same time the beginnings of usability
started hitting in late 90s where they
started talking about how sites should
be usable how information should be
findable and so on and we saw a huge
evolution in those days a web designer
was either a geek who just decided to
start designing pages and threw out
these monstrosities you know these are
three pages and on the other hand you
had moonlighting graphic designers who
saw that there was money in web design
and so they started using things like
Photoshop to layout pages and to slice
them up and you know put them out there
on the web so that was the early stage
the web designer in those days was
really a nebulous hybrid type of thing
it wasn't a clearly defined profession
it was only defined by the work that you
did but it wasn't really so defined by
the technology because a web designer
back there was much more about graphics
than it was about web technology believe
it or not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
