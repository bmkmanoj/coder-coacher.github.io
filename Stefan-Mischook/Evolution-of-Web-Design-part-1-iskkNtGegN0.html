killer size calm in this podcast or
video cast or screencast whatever you
want to call it i'm going to be
discussing the evolution of web design
and what this basically is about is
about how every once in a while web
design goes through a major change and
this change actually is often reflected
in an advancement in the technology the
importance of this video is for managers
web designers aspiring web designers the
importance of this video is for them to
recognize what the current trend is so
that they can identify the skillsets
about a modern web designer needs to
know today in 2010 and probably for the
next several years
today a modern web design is actually in
the middle of a shift from the from the
last change and the shift is moving into
what I would call the web 2.0 web
designer and that's somebody who not
only understands the basic technology of
the web HTML CSS browsers and so on but
this is a usability and I kind of stuff
a web two point all web designer has the
understanding and ability to implement
to insert web two point all capabilities
into their web work so we're talking
things like blogs and content management
systems we're talking about AJAX enabled
widgets like you know things that will
slide open and close like for instance
here's an example here see that little
widgets that slide open and close here
this is basic basic stuff using modern
techniques for instance go to contact we
have a contact form this is built you
know everybody can build a form but how
do you process the form is very simple
PHP will process this for modern web
designers should know how to implement
these simple things because you hard
press these days to find a website where
you're not going to need some those kind
of widgets those kind of gadgets for
instance they go to killer sites another
quick example little web two point all
widgets you know very useful and if you
as a web designer have to go back and
always find a programmer to install one
of these scripts for you you're going to
be in a major disadvantage versus you
know guys who actually embrace the new
web
I'm not going to get into detail about
this modern web designer you have a good
idea i'll put out a new podcast on that
specifically very soon what i want to do
is I want to go back and I want to show
how in our recent history and web design
how this happened a couple of times
before just in case you're not convinced
about this big shift at how important it
is to move with the changes in the web
design world so we're going to go way
back back to nineteen nineteen
ninety-four I guess that's what I
desired my very first web page and in
those days you know if you had a an
image in your web page a color image or
like a superstar most of the web at that
time was non-commercial most of the web
was university websites occasional hobby
website it was pretty much text only
maybe a couple images here and there but
it was it was pretty ugly and basically
had a bunch of nerds who were involved
all these nerds very few of any had
graphic design training so the web was
really an ugly unusable place and then
there was a shift with the book creating
killer websites I can get to it about
actually now this book was actually
killer sites actually was founded on
this you know to support this book
initially this book was probably the
best selling book at its time and
basically it helped it helped usher in
the first evolution of the web where in
this book the author they would see how
he basically preached that you should as
a web designer utilize design principles
you know you know alignment and good use
of Fox that kind of stuff in your web
design work and then he showed well
desired how to hack this out because at
the time the technology was really weak
in that regard so that was the first
evolution of the web from being just a
bunch
text only pages with the occasional
image and it was just a giant mess to
becoming a website becoming a web world
where design principles started to creep
into web design and web became a much
more aesthetically pleasing place at the
same time the beginnings of usability
started hitting in the late 90s where
they started talking about how sites
should be usable how information should
be fine upon so on and we saw a huge
evolution in those days a web designer
was either a geek who just decided going
to start designing pages and throughout
these monstrosities you know these ugly
pages and on the other hand you had
moonlighting graphic designers who saw
that there was money in web design and
so they started using things like
Photoshop to layout pages and to slice
them up and you know put them out there
on the web so that was the early stage
the web designer in those days was
really a nebulous hybrid type of thing
it was a clearly defined profession it
was only defined by the work that you
did but it wasn't really so defined by
the technology because a web designer
back there was much more about graphics
than it was about web technology believe
it or not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
