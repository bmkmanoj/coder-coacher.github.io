seen what a fixed pixel layout looks
like and at this moment what we're going
to be doing is structuring the basic
HTML and then applying our CSS to it but
in the meantime let's just go through a
couple of things first you'll notice
that here on my desktop I've got a
little folder here called killer sites
layout so if you've downloaded this
through killer sites you're also going
to receive this folder and it's going to
have a finished version of what we're
doing as well as a little archives
folder right here
well if you're using these files that's
fine you can continue along in that
fashion otherwise if you want to start
from scratch just create a new folder on
your desktop as I've done right here and
I'm just gonna show you what we're gonna
be looking at in terms of our design I'm
gonna be creating a very simple two
column layout and in this two column
layout there are gonna be a number of
IDs now again we're assuming that you've
got the basics of CSS covered and you
know what an ideas and how an ID is
different from a class or any other sort
of CSS selector so if you are
uncomfortable with those ideas then I
would refer you to the killer sites CSS
training tutorials and at this point
what we're going to be doing here is to
create a very simple two column
structure as you can see we're gonna
have an area defined as header we're
gonna have an area over here for our
navigation which we'll call nav our main
content area and a footer around all of
these divs that we're gonna be naming
with IDs we're gonna have one div one
div to rule them all and in the darkness
bind them that's right they're binding
everything together with this div here
called container so the lord of the divs
so to speak is our container it's
holding everything in place it's what's
going to make our design a fixed pixel
design and we're going to work with the
and 60-degree width that we spoke about
in the earlier example you'll also
notice that there is a three column
sketch and eventually we'll be turning
our two column layout into a fixed three
column layout and along with that we're
gonna have another ID over here called
the aside so if you want to take a look
at those they're inside the archives
folder that I've provided for you but if
you're not using that archives folder
that's perfectly fine what I'd like you
to do is to just create a new folder and
within that new folder there are a
number of things we're gonna do I've
already got an index page here but quite
literally as you can see I'm working
within Dreamweaver in the code view and
we're only going to be doing code so
that even if you don't have Dreamweaver
you can do this in any text editor
that's right you should know at this
point that HTML can be created as well
as CSS for that matter in any text
editor so create a new page save it as a
HTML page file save of course and give
it the name index.html mine is currently
blank because we're gonna start with the
very basic code and I'm going to walk
you through everything that we're going
to need to make that work and again
we're going to be following the same
design that we talked about here in the
archives with a container a header nav
main and a footer alright so some other
things that you might want to do this
folder that you've created on your
desktop will be constantly referring to
this as the root folder here you'll
notice that I've got an index.html page
I'm going to create a new folder right
next to it called CSS and this folder
will eventually contain our CSS page
will go through creating one and saving
it in just a second and more importantly
linking the CSS page to our new
index.html but we'll get to that in an
upcoming video simply because all we're
talking about in this one is the basic
HTML structure that we're going to be
looking for inside of our index page
ultimately we would event
they have things like images and other
things if we're using fonts that we want
to put up onto our server using the css3
@ font face declaration we would have a
font folder in here among other things
and we'll eventually get to all of those
things but at this point all we're
really concerned about is the fact that
I want you to create a CSS folder
currently empty and inside your text
editor or Dreamweaver or text made or
whatever you're using create a very
simple HTML page so it's a blank page
right now let's go about creating the
basic HTML structure so of course we're
going to need a simple HTML tag and I'm
just going to separate that tag a little
bit and come in here and close that tag
so I've got the opening HTML closing
HTML as with any HTML structure within
those tags we're going to need our very
simple head tag don't forget to put in
your tags properly as I did not right
here so I'm just going to close that up
and of course I'll leave a little bit of
space because we're going to be putting
something in the head in just a second
you'll also notice that we will need a
very simple body declaration so we're
anthropomorphizing our simple document
so open HTML closing HTML open head
closing head body and body very simple
nothing really all that complicated
involved in this however now we're going
to add a couple of other things to our
document most importantly when we're
working with a very simple HTML type as
we're doing right now HTML page the
simple thing that we need to remember at
the very beginning of this page is to
include something called a doctype now
in the past doc types have been much
much more complicated but since the
advent of HTML 5 we can work with a very
simplified doctype and it's written
something like this we just come in here
we say doctype don't forget to put the
exclamation mark first and then I'm just
gonna say HTML so doctype HTML is really
all we need at this point as most modern
browsers will accept this and we're not
really gonna have to worry about the
older declarations that we would
normally have written so at this point
as the time of this particular recording
we're going to just accept the doctype
as it's written here and for those of
you who don't know as much about the
doctype remember this is not really a
HTML tag per se it's just really
instructions to the web browser about
what version of the markup language the
page is written in and it's important
that you specify the doctype and all
HTML documents so that the browser knows
what type of document to expect we're
not really working with 4.0 or earlier
versions html5 is not really based on
sgml and does not really require a
reference to DDT's but we need a doctype
for browsers to behave the way they
should so that's important for us to
remember and we're going to include that
in here even though this is a much more
simplified version of the doctype it's
one that will be accepted now to also
continue I want to place two other tags
inside the head section first thing I'm
going to do is to include in here
something called a meta tag and if you
know your basic HTML as I'm assuming
most of you do coming to this video this
is not an introductory video in HTML or
even in CSS for that matter those videos
can be found at killer sites so if any
of this is very new to you you can go
back to those earlier videos and you can
find out more information but I'm just
going to come through and write out HTTP
- equivalent quotation content
- type before I continue I missed my ve
here so HTTP - equivalent nth type in
quotations and you can put a little
space and then say content equals open
quotation text - HTML and you can put a
semicolon right there and then we're
gonna include the character set so you
call this char set equals utf-8 - 8
closed quotations with a closing bracket
so essentially all this is really
telling us at this particular moment in
time is the type of content that we're
going to be looking at or that the
browser is going to be dealing with this
content is going to be text slash HTML
and the character set we're using is
utf-8 so that this document can support
many different international characters
aside from the very common ones that we
would be using so it's going to be a
much more friendly page for
international videos visitors or any
unconventional character sets that we
would generally encounter so it's good
form and put that in also inside of our
section I want to include the title tag
title tag being one of the most
important tags especially from a search
engine perspective so depending on what
your site is about you should include
some good keywords as well as a good
description of who you are and what
you're all about I'm just gonna come in
here and write killer sites CSS layout
example
and of course I'm going to close that
title tag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
