killer PHP calm and this is part four in
a seven part series on jQuery and doing
a jquery introduction today what I'm
going to be doing is looking at how we
can introduce Ajax into our project
we're going to start with some very
simple Ajax and in the following video
we're going to be looking at how we can
incorporate PHP into that Ajax but this
is going to be pretty straightforward so
that we don't get overworked too quickly
I'm going to start off by just going
back to a very simple project by
deleting what I had in the last video
and i'm going to call this introducing
ajax we're just going to delete all the
other stuff that we have down here and
i'm going to save this file as
introducing ajax HTML so we'll go back
here this is our new file i'll say
introducing ajax HTML and there we go so
we have a very simple project setup
there's not too much here yet but there
will be soon so the idea of ajax is that
you make call asynchronously using
javascript and that you get in return
xml or XHTML in other words you make a
call to another website usually on the
same domain on the same web server and
you say hey give me some content and
then the response gets filled in
wherever you want on your page so in our
case I'm just going to create a class or
a div rather of type content
and we'll have a paragraph here with
some text let's imagine that this is
some kind of comment retrieval system
I'm just going to copy this let's say
this is my wonderful text my blog post
what have you I'm talking at great
length about something of great import
and then at the bottom here I have this
little button with an ID called get
comments and it's just going to say read
comments and that's it and then
underneath my wonderful content I'm
going to have an ID it doesn't really
matter if it's an ID or a class because
we just have one technically you should
only have one ID of a certain name on
any HTML document or X HTML document so
if you're only going to have one comment
container then an ID is probably more
accurate than using a class and that's
it I'll refresh this again we've got
read comments it doesn't do anything
we've got some text and that's about it
now in order for this to work we need to
create a page that can be requested now
typically when you go online and you
search Ajax tutorials they clutter the
introduction with a whole bunch of PHP
which isn't really necessary to get
started if you go I've got an empty text
file here and I'm going to create
basically a next an extra file here and
this is just going to be called and i'm
just going to save it as some requests
dot HTML ok so it's an empty file and
it's not going to be a complete HTML
document I'm just going to have a div
inside here with a comment box you'll
notice that I'm using a class this time
because it's a
possibility that we could have multiple
comment boxes and we're going to have a
header three with a comment title and
let's say we have a class of type
comment meta with a bit of meta
information so we'll have date and then
we're going to have a paragraph with my
new comment so we've got some just kind
of a little snippet of HTML code with a
bit of data in there we can imagine that
this would very easily become dynamic
data but for now let's just look at it
as HTML nothing more nothing less
there's no server-side happening at this
point now doing the Ajax call is really
quite simple and here all I need to do
is start with a click event so this time
we're going to say get comments click
open up another anonymous function and
then we'll just do a return false at the
bottom and now we're going to look at
the Ajax function we just do dollar sign
dot h ax close that and in here we're
going to be using those squiggly braces
again the same ones that we looked at in
the animate function so I'm going to
open those up and we're going to be
passing in certain parameters and then
variables associated values associated
with them so the first one is type and I
want it to do a get as opposed to a post
so when you're thinking about PHP you
might have seen this variable the get
variable will get is basically grabbing
parameters off of the URL and post is
grabbing variables or parameters in a
header section of an HTML request
our URL is going to be some requests
HTML and then we're going to have this
variable called success which is
actually going to be a function so in
JavaScript you can have variables behave
as functions basically what happens is
that when the variable gets accessed it
just runs the function in this case I
know that the Ajax library returns a
response object and that response is
basically whatever is found in the
calling page so for starters I'm just
going to do a console dot log on
response hit save refresh this we're
going to open up Firebug if I click on
read comments you'll see that we did a
get request on some requests at HTML and
we just got a whole bunch of HTML data
what's interesting about Firebug and I'd
like to highlight this at this point is
that if I click on this I can see that
this is the response and I can also get
some information about how it was passed
from the users browser to our server and
then what the server actually responded
with because if you get some PHP in
there and you've got some errors in your
PHP you might not actually see them in
your page if for some reason your Ajax
call doesn't work properly and you get
you know some issues with your return
variables anyways so now that we know
that the response is actually working we
can use our dom manipulation tricks from
the last video to actually show some of
these comments instead of the console
dot log I'm just going to append to my
comment container and I'm going to pass
in my response let's refresh that and
there we go so these are actually being
pulled in asynchronously now it's not
very pretty at this point in fact
they're just kind of getting dropped in
there and one of the nice things about
Ajax is the animation that comes with it
as well now I could go back to some
requests at HTML and specify that my
class is you know a visibility hidden or
something like that but if you're
thinking of the concern of the Ajax call
you want to limit the amount of view
specific data or page specific data
associated with the request because
really we're talking about animation and
the the calling website should have that
choice not necessarily the Ajax
returning server in other words we don't
want some requests to be bound to the
site that it is being accessed from
necessarily and we can get around this
by just hiding and then fading in
whatever the response object is so
instead I'm just going to wrap the
response in a jQuery object and then do
a hide in other words we're going to
hide it and then we're going to fade it
in refresh this again and then you'll
see that now we're getting this kind of
fade in effect just kind of neat so
that's it for my introduction to Ajax
and in the next video we're going to be
looking at how we can actually do a bit
of PHP in here as well thanks for
