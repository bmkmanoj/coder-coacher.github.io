basic principles or one of the basic
things that you heard in many different
schools many different styles was not to
focus in on becoming a big black belt
rank or the master rank or the teacher
rank to not be focused on that because
when you focused on the ultimate end
goal every day it can become pretty
disheartening because takes a while to
get there it takes a while to become a
black belt it takes a while to become a
full-fledged web developer takes a lot
of become a developer so what you ought
to do and it's a great psychological
tactic and something that they
succinctly said in martial arts schools
is enjoy the journey embrace the process
and so we can break that down and less
esoteric ways and we can say what you
should focus in on is setting goals that
are daily goals so instead of thinking
about oh I want to be a full stack web
developer who's a master of Python or a
master of nodejs and JavaScript what you
should do is say my goal is every day
and I put in whatever amount of time
into learning something new half an hour
an hour whatever you have in terms of
your schedule but that's the goal the
goal is to have your daily activity that
you execute on and it's very satisfying
now this guy Scott Adams Dilbert he
calls it a systems versus ago and it's
very reflective of business in business
you have a long term goal so I have my
long term goals right now with Studio
web before example but what I
concentrate on is all the things that I
need to do on a daily basis on a weekly
basis on a monthly basis to take studio
web to that long-term goal and there's
daily activities there's daily things
you have to do and so on and the same
thing with learning how to develop
apps whatever type of apps you're doing
there's certain things you have to learn
so for instance if you're learning web
development so you learn html5 css3
javascript and then from there you have
all these different choices you go PHP
with JavaScript node you can go Python
you can go C sharp asp.net you can go
Ruby on Rails really early idea so what
you have to do is you have to set a
program for yourself so that daily or
every other day you hit your goals of
doing just a little bit sometimes an
hour a day sometimes half an hour Dre
whatever it is a Zappos always thinking
about old boy I guess so what you're
going to learn and I want to be
developer there's 10,000 things I got to
learn there's a lot of pressure that you
put on yourself but I used to do this
back in the day and I was a teenager a
young teenager with martial arts and
there's so much tech Nino's it's
overwhelming
same thing with business you have these
big goals and business of course
and if you keep concentrating on the end
goal its again it's going to be
emotionally very jared draining because
every day you're not hitting your goal
every day you're not hitting your goal
so you should make your goals the daily
process that you have to execute to
eventually get to that big goal but you
know what at the end of the day you
don't know what that big goal is going
to be so you may start off learning HTML
CSS and JavaScript with the idea of
you're going to become a full stack web
developer and you're going to get a job
doing that but you may find yourself
getting into html5 based mobile app
development or you may actually develop
your own app from scratch you never know
what's going to happen so create a
process execute on that process on a
regular basis that you goes executing on
that process and you let this system
that you develop the system is basically
your daily goals or weekly goals and you
let that take you to where you're going
to go now at the end of the day when
you're learning something new when
you're execute when you try out
different technology and you're building
things it can only lead to good there's
no waste of that a lot of people always
worry about all say learn this language
that language like like the
thinking like going down a road that's
going to lead you to nowhere
that doesn't happen because as you learn
how to code you're learning how to code
so whether you develop your chops in
Python or PHP or JavaScript these skills
are very much transferable so I wouldn't
be too concerned about going down the
wrong path in that regard so at the end
of the day to summarize this video
create a system that will lead to an
ultimate goal but really forget about
the ultimate goal really that should be
an afterthought you should work on that
daily process that weekly process that
moves you forward and what you're going
to do all right that's it for days log
