to base a concept of tags so the next
thing I'm going to look at is the idea
of tags being included or nested inside
of other tag pairs type within a tank
exactly so here's attack HTML the
closing here is HTML this is the mother
of all tags this is a tag it tells the
web browser but this is the beginning of
HTML code and this is the end of HTML
code so when you're writing your web
pages everything is going to lie between
these two tags you can think of it as a
giant package or a box that holds
everything everything's in it the one
exception is this up here this is a tag
but tells the web browser that this is
an HTML document that's why you see doc
let you sort for document no doctor
document type and the document type is
HTML what does it do you need to tell
the browser that the browser has a
built-in program in engine that reads
and understands it interprets HTML so
what this tag does it tells a web
browser to activate the HTML engine
activated there are several flavors of
HTML over the years and this particular
doctype there's different ones tells the
browser to use the latest version of
HTML right so we should put that on top
of every web page it should be there now
you can you can get away without using
it but then you're going to get some
weird behavior sometimes because the
different versions of HTML worked a
little bit differently the safe than
sorry so back to the concept we were
discussing HTML tags can lie within
other HTML tags so we see for instance
of edit the HTML I'm other HTML tags and
we see all these in between
here's another example we have our head
and head and in between the head and
head you have this meta tag I'll get
into that in a second you got the title
tag so it goes on now what I want to do
now is I want a boy too macho let's
actually change this template page here
it would see what it looks like okay so
what I want to do is actually change the
title and call this episode three I said
that movie so we'll save that and we'll
see what it does okay in the browser
that this is it said the title so let's
just press refresh now the reason I
press the refresh button up here is
because whenever you make a change to
your HTML code you got to tell the
browser to read load that code reload
that page reload so you see here in the
tabs as title of your page three tell
your page right that's what you typed in
before exactly if we look at the source
view source I say this is the first
example for me will you change something
in the text and it had the result on the
web page now our page itself is still
blank yeah and the reason that is
because anything that you see here red
has to be in between these tags with
anything on the page is in the body
exactly so what we should do now is
actually add some code to the body some
texts and see what it looks like all
right
to save time I'm just going to copy this
and then let's go back and edit this
page file and it with notepad now I'm
going to go into the body right and I'm
going to just cheat a little bit i'm
just going to paste in the text like
this it's going to work but it's not
what you should do you should actually
put this text inside of a tag I'll get
in town in a few seconds so i'll save
that and you put you put something in
the body now exactly i put something by
now I try to say that I said the process
cannot access file because being used by
another process okay I hate these
windows that you can look I know what
that is so I'll just press ok for now
the reason it's doing that because
because i have this file selected so i
have to deselected and then i have a hip
save again now works no problem so now
let's just reload this page again oh
that is so we've just built our very
first HTML page right and this is all we
need to know now this is pretty simple
but we just build up from here it's
incredible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
