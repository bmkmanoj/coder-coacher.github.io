vlog you thought I was tired in the last
vlog as I sit here I am exhausted I
can't wait I'm going to Florida in a
week and I'm just gonna do nothing for
one week except lay on the beach and
then go eat stone crab at night but I'll
come back rested ready to do a whole
bunch of new vlogs in the last couple of
days I've been updating my PHP my SQL
course not bad it's terrible
it's like 98% up-to-date there's a
couple little things in there that are
out of date not that would hurt you at
all but I know some people have kittens
if they see that that older stuff so I'm
pulling that out putting a brand new
stuff and it also gives me an
opportunity to implement my new style my
new some of the new things and I do now
but I didn't do what I produce that
course anyhow it's a minor part of the
package but I figure why not that's what
I do by the way I I update things as
they need to be updated inside of the
package so instead of having new names
for courses like I used to do I'm just
going to keep the same names but I'm
just gonna update the contents within it
on a need-to-know basis fortunately for
a course creators like me the technology
is pretty stable now in terms of the
basics meaning you don't have these
radical changes that you used to get
every five years now html5 is it's
pretty much where it was since 2012 css3
javascript yes are the advanced and some
things have been added to JavaScript on
the advance and some things have been
added as PHP 77.1 whoever it is now but
in terms of the basic foundation of the
core is the same so I update underneath
to nerd basis I just wanted to comment
on this vlog about a fallacy a
something I don't know what other word
to give it a fallacy or a stupid way or
an uninformed way of looking at things
what I'm seeing out there people are
quiet man if I would have bought Bitcoin
seven years ago or six years ago I would
have bought five hundred bucks I'd have
a hundred million and oh what a mistake
and I'm I talked about that and it was
tongue-in-cheek what I talked about that
because any experienced investor will
tell you that the chance of you keeping
a thousand dollar investment in Bitcoin
till today words worth a hundred million
is pretty much zero unless you're a
crazy person you'll never do it I think
there might be a handful of people who
have done that very very very rare and
it's kind of silly in fact if you buy a
stock or a Bitcoin or whatever it goes
up ten times 200 times
and if you don't lighten that load you
don't take profits you're really playing
with fire I have seen people lose
millions because they just got greedy
there's an old expression I think it got
it unfortunately from CNBC but it's the
old expression they say yeah Bulls make
money Bears make money and Pink's get
slaughtered now if you don't know
anything about the stock market a bowl
is somebody who bets on stocks and
commodities and I guess cryptocurrency
is going up and a bear bets that they're
gonna go down you can make money
investing that a stock will actually
lose value make money and I won't get
into the details here anyhow and a pig
is somebody who makes a lot of money and
just holds on to the trade and then
watch you know that goes up and up to
make it all kinds of money and then I
just watch it fall fall fall and it was
all kinds of money so that's the only
expression Bulls make money Bears make
money pigs get slaughtered if you made
ten times your money or five times your
money or heaven mistakes you make a
hundred times your money on a
cryptocurrency trade you're crazy to
hold everything hoping it's going to go
up more it could go up more but when you
see such meteoric Rises it always at
some point I don't know
but at some point it always crashes just
as bad just as bad is this me saying
that cryptocurrencies are terrible and
there's its kryptos bad no crypto is a
great technology it's gonna be
implemented
I just think 99.9% of coins as they
stand are going to go to nothing because
there's nothing stopping a major banking
institution from implementing their own
coin why would a bank to watch to use
crypto technology to make moving funds
around easy why would a bank want to
invest billions and billions of dollars
to buy ripple or to buy a Bitcoin or
something why would they just create
their own they set the price at 5 bucks
and that's it then they back it and they
don't have to pay anything right except
for to develop the cost of the coin so
it's kind of a hose it's it's a silly
bubble but just because it's a silly
bubble doesn't mean you could make money
but be careful
pigs get slaughtered so remember that
anyway that's about it many more vlogs
come in and tell you many more people
have asked me what camera are using
Steph what camera I'm using a cinema
camera which is a high-end camera from
Canon it's a c200 it just came out four
months ago five months ago something
like that and it has huge advantages
over DSLRs it's much more expensive but
the workflows and the quality and the
flexibility but it gives me is
stupendous so I love it and I'm also
using 18 to 35 sigma lens which gives me
this nice shallow depth of field and the
clear image no matter what the lighting
is and so on anyway some people asked
I'm not gonna get into any more details
because this is not a camera of vlog as
you know ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
