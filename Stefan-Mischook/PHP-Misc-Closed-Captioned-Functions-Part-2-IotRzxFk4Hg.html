able to cut and paste the mail function
in here for you guys to see so as you
can see again it's it's much like string
word count in that you have the name of
the function in this case it's male and
you got the following you got our
bracket pair that gives you a spot to
actually insert your arguments now with
male function in that it's a more
complex function
it required a few more arguments as you
can see we actually have three arguments
for the male function it needs these to
operate now what you should take away
from is is that functions that have
multiple arguments like male each
argument is separated by a comma here so
you got our even number one argument
number two and I'll give it two or three
of course the last argument doesn't need
a comma if you actually put a comma
there it's gonna give you an error
so we've learnt a few things in our
introduction to functions we've learned
the structure of a function its name
followed by the the brackets pair and
you gotta end it off of a semicolon and
we've learned that functions can return
a value so in the case of word count its
value is the number of words it's
counted in your in the argument that you
provided right in the sentence that you
provided I've sometimes functions will
just return a true or false value true
or false and whether returns a true or
false value depends on whether or not
the function was successful in doing
what it's supposed to do and this can be
very useful in your PHP scripts now
we're gonna demonstrate how this can be
useful now so with the mail function
when it successfully sends a mail it
will return true and if it doesn't
successfully send the mail it will
return false so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna watch how we can
use that inside of an if statement
inside of a conditional statement again
this is something we've looked at in a
previous video and we can see how we can
make decisions based on whether or not
the male function has done its job
so what I've done here is basically
created a variable did underscore sand
and it's created as variable to capture
the result that the mail function sends
back to us once it's tried to complete
its task and in this place in this case
rather to send an email and when I've
done afterwards of course is just a
simple echo to show us what the variable
did send what it was what it captured
from the mail function so let's launch
the browser and see what happens so we
get the value of one one of course is
equal to true sometimes in PHP when a
functions is going to return true or
false whether or not true yes I was able
to do what I'm supposed to do or false I
wasn't sometimes it will return a true
and false as in the world as in the
words true or false and sometimes it
will return 1 or 0 1 being true 0 being
false it really depends on the function
and you have to just you'll get to know
this on a function per function basis
that's one of the little inconsistencies
in PHP and it's kind of a wet and wild
language PHP is and that's because it
was developed over the years on e on I
like to call it on a nerd to use basis
so there's in consistencies in the
languages in the language into P and PHP
itself and that's one of the reasons why
people nerves anyway will complain about
pH people from time to time but to me
it's not such a big deal so what I've
done here in this step is to actually
use the did send variable inside a if
statement and if this of course is true
if it results in one near statement well
the PHP will print out this text here
mail sent so let's just demo it real
quickly
of course mail sent so we know that the
mail has been has been sent in the
function has been successful what you
need to take away from this is that
you see how I'm able to use functions
and your return values inside by for
instance in two ways I can use them to
populate variables or I could also use
them within the context of content
conditional statements to do stuff to
make decisions sometimes variables will
return excuse me
sometimes functions will return a lot
more advanced information for instance
there are functions that might change
all your text from lowercase into all
caps and then you could use the result
they return in in your pages you can
echo it out you can do all kinds of
different things you can even use text
from one function and insert it into
another so for instance right here a
string word count basically returns the
number 11 so I could take it in the wall
it was number five since there's five
words in this particular sentence I can
do that
and stick it in here in the mail
function so this last argument in mail
function remember we have three
arguments argument one two and three
separated by commas this last argument I
know because I know the mail function
actually writes whatever is in here to
of a body of the email in the body being
in the main part of email that people
see see this is the body of the email
this is the the title there are the
subject of the email rather and this is
to whom you send the email to so in here
I'm actually grabbing the resolve from
one function and sticking in another I
can even do it directly like so
and that also works as well so it really
depends on certain functions can work
well with each other depending on the
argument so that one function needs
versus what another function spits out
to you now PHP is very very very very
flexible in that it does its best to try
to sort of wrangle if you will orphan
angle functions to work with each other
and to work with whatever scripts you're
writing so this could be a good a good
thing and in some ways because things
work more easily but in the other ways
it can lead to kind of strange hard to
find bugs in your code I'm not going to
get into this now because it's a little
bit more advanced but it's something
that just to keep in the back your mind
and you may run into things later on and
perhaps we'll cover some examples in
another video anyway so let's take away
I think we've covered the basics here
let's take away from this that we
functions can be used to feed other
functions functions can return values
for instance results like word counts or
it can just return true or false in the
case of functions like male where you
just want to know whether or not it
worked or not for instance like in this
scenario
perhaps your script you don't want your
script to move for unless you know for
sure that the email is sent out to the
user that's just once an hour for
instance so I'm sure you can start
coming up with other ones for instance
there's a very important function in PHP
one that allows excuse me to connect to
the MySQL database something we'll cover
soon enough and it's very important that
you you get messages messages back from
the functions whether or not you've
actually connected to the database if
you haven't why see that's another thing
sometimes functions there in such a way
so that if they don't work for some
reason the return value will be
something intelligent something
intelligible that you can use to debug
to figure out why something do
perhaps with the MySQL function you
didn't give it a proper username and
password something and in the function
will return results saying improper
username and password so just something
to keep in mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
