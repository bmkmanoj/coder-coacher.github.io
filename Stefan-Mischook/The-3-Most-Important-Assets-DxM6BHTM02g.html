96.7%
so in this vlog i want to talk about the
three most important assets you can have
going forward now assets can include
houses include investment in stocks it
include intellectual property Yetta
Yetta Yetta Yetta so you'll see in life
in economics and business that the value
of things the value of assets classes
and asset class again it could be
started to be cash it could be
commodities like oil and gold and it
could be doing for property as I just
said so the value of asset classes will
fluctuate and once every once in a while
once every once in a while there will be
a major change in the perceived value of
a particular asset class for example in
Europe there was a time maybe a couple
hundred years ago and your seaside real
estate was considered lowers if you live
beside the ocean that was the slums it
was like 200 years ago or so maybe 300
years ago why was that the case because
in those days you had pirates and
pirates with raid coastal villages and
so you didn't want to live beside the
ocean because you were subject to waves
and all the rich people lived in the
hills where it was safer and of course
now that we've in Europe at least we've
taken care of piracy people now value
living by the ocean now there's been a
shift in value in terms of real estate
values like there's all one asset class
is not necessarily a good example yeah
you get the idea so what are the three
most valuable assets that you can
develop as a developer
as a coder as inspiring coder what are
the three most valuable assets number
one and is the most difficult to develop
something called IP intellectual
property whether that be software custom
software that you all in wrote it could
be a patent for some invention you came
up with it could be a book that you
write it could be videos that you create
IP intellectual property and this is
something
music music tight IP as well now of
course developing IP is the hardest of
the assets to develop in my opinion and
certain types of IP are going to be very
very difficult to make money with to
monetize for instance music music is
much more difficult to make money with
than it was 30 years ago
now that was easy 30 years ago but it's
even harder now simply because everybody
and his neighbor can make professional
sounding music with a very simple setup
the equipment to be able to record great
sounding audio is relatively inexpensive
by 30 years ago before in a computer
revolution really took over in terms of
music it was really hard maybe 40 years
ago you have to learn studio space and
you have to go to reel-to-reel tape it
was very expensive to produce a
professionally sounding album these days
you're doing you're in your dorm room
you know so anyway yeah so IP if you can
develop it it will have that so for me
my IP at my videos my course is and most
valuable by far studio Webley the the
app and so forth so number one asset
classes developers IP number two is
skillsets the more skilled you are the
better so learning how to code varying
different languages developing
organizational skills developing skills
are valued by other people it's
important they have to be valued by
other people you become an expert basket
weaver that might not be such a valuable
skill or might be I don't know you know
you have to look into the market for
basket weaving but you get the idea you
have to find skills that are relevant
for today and tomorrow so skill sets
huge and that's why in my courses I
always emphasize the basics of coding
the basics of software development and I
try to bring in the business and so that
would you as you become a decoder you
come in developer you will come into it
hopefully at a higher level than the
typical person because not only am i
teaching you about coding I'm teaching
you about the business and if it had a
fake of coding from real life
perspective as opposed to just academic
perspective and that will already put
you at an elevated level versus somebody
just learn how to code straight up and
the third most valuable asset going
forward is reputation reputation is huge
is even more huge these days because of
social media
everybody will check up what your record
is online on social media they're going
to check your Facebook your Twitter feed
your Instagram whatever whatever social
media network becomes popular so you
have to be very careful about the image
that you put out and the your social
record if you will because reputation is
huge you hear about it where people have
been fired because of what they done on
Facebook
they've been there they're not hired
because of what they said about on
Facebook very important reputation is
huge so I would strongly urge you and
suggest that you take care about what
you say online what you do what you post
what you share these things are all very
important think twice and then act on
that you know before don't try not to be
a pawn sometimes it's hard I know trust
me I know but very well those are three
most viable assets in summary IP
intellectual property number two skill
sets valued skill sets if you learn how
to make horseshoes I'm not sure how
value that might be so valuable skill
sets
was encoding and everything else
speaking skills etc etc and number three
is of course your reputation
hoo-whee that reputation goes to your
network of people that you know and so
on this is extremely important the old
asset classes of value will fall away
anything physical I think will fall away
physical physical technologies will fall
away in value because of robotics AI and
automation everything is going to drop
in value I think over time according
houses and cars and everything else is
it's all going to drop down over time so
I'm not sure how fast this change is
going to be but I think it will come to
pass sooner than later
so again IP reputation and skills I hope
you found this useful
