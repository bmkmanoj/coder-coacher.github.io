killer PHP calm and today what I'm going
to be doing is looking at html5 now
html5 I don't know if you've heard about
this is a new version of HTML or XHTML
and with that comes a whole kind of new
way of thinking about markup as well as
the assumption that you're going to be
dealing with css3 which is the latest
version of CSS now this is going to be
sort of a multi-part video series where
we're going to talk about XHTML and you
know what web standards look like today
where they're probably going to be
headed within the next two to five years
i would say what some of these kind of
next-generation browsers can offer and
how you can prepare for that as a web
designer and web developer so the first
thing I'm going to be doing is in this
video just looking at what XHTML looks
like today here I have a very simple
basically a simple HTML page you can see
here I'm just going to zoom this out a
little bit so you've got you know my
wonderful website you've got you know
post title some two column layouts here
or pull quote over here a sidebar so
you've got all this you know stuff
happening pretty standard fare and if we
look at how its constructed you can
probably find some areas where this
could be in fact improved and I'm going
to show you how you can take a site like
this and you know with a little bit of
work make it look you know just as good
if not better with html5 so i'm going to
show you in another example which we're
going to build up ourselves this same
website except now we're not using any
images at all you can see that we've got
the same sort of visual effect we've got
rounded corners and everything we even
have our pull quote and you're going to
look at the the markup and we're going
to build the html5
and look at the CSS as well and just see
how much easier it is to really sort of
prototype a website when you don't have
to jump into Photoshop just to get
little effects like rounded corners and
gradients in there so in looking at this
template you can see that we've got sort
of a background here if I right click on
this image and I say view background
image you can see that this is just kind
of a gradient oftentimes if you want to
have like a header on a website you you
know you're going to be creating these
rounded corners manually you're going to
want to have you know some gradient
effects to give it a bit of depth and so
on and so forth all these effects in X
HTML and CSS to have to be done manually
you know you look at this this header
this top nav bar if I view the
background image here you can see I'm
using what's called a sprite where we
have multiple versions of the background
image and then if I just quickly jump
into the CSS you can see here that i'm
using this top map jpg file and when we
hover over it we're using the same
background but then we move the
background image so that we get a
different part of that same background
image and this is called a sprite so the
hover and the active state are simply
the same image we just you know jump it
up a bit and then we get that background
image now just something to know about
this series some tools that we're going
to be using we're going to be using the
latest version of Firefox primarily
we're also going to look at Google
Chrome or which is you know essentially
WebKit you could use safari instead of
google chrome if you want we're going to
be using the web developer toolbar here
and there just to help us navigate the
the Dom the HTML markup and I'm going to
be using a tool called the BB edit and
really it's just a text editor you can
use any other text editor if you're on
Windows machine you could use notepad
plus plus you could use Dreamweaver
really anything goes so let's take a
look at how this page is built you'll
notice that at the top
we have this xml version encoding UTF
business and what this is is it
basically says hey this is an XML
document in other words it's got these
opening and closing tags and at the end
of the day it follows this model of XML
where you have a tag and the tag has a
corresponding closing tag or you have an
opening of a tag and then you have
what's called a self closing tag where
it ends with a slash and a greater than
symbol you've got attributes and then
those attributes have values and inside
of a tag you can have other tags so this
is straight XML and it is a subset of
XML called XHTML and that's what we call
a doctype here you'll see that we're
describing that doctype with this xmlns
reference which basically points to the
world wide web consortium which is a
group of nerds that basically dictate
how we should be writing our web pages
and making sure that they're all
standardized and then we've got our head
section and our body section and that's
about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
