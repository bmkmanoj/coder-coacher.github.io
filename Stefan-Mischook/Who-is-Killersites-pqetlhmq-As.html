killer sites calm and killer PHP calm in
this video I'm going to do a little bit
of shameless self-promotion because I
want people to know that when you're
watching our videos or watching one of
my blog during one of my articles doing
one of my courses I want people to know
that you're learning from a credible
source I'm not just some neared out
there on the internet I've actually am
out there in in the web design world in
the web programming world i'm i'm not a
little bit i've i've participated in
some books I've my articles are written
extensive tutorials for magazines many
times our videos and our content appears
in a printed magazines like most
prominently is web designer years now so
you pick up at issue of web designer
chances are you're going to see some of
our videos in there or maybe some
reference or some articles as well so
for instance here's an older issue four
points ago lookie here they're promoting
one of my videos on easy killer PHP you
know when I was teaching examp and basic
PHP to web designers that's one of the
things that's why I put out your PHP in
the first place another thing you see is
some sometimes again I know I'm being a
shameless self-promoter here but yeah we
understand here in this this issue here
top 50 CSS techniques and see my ugly
mug here where I'm quoted in reference
the whole point of this video's to say
this the content that you're getting
from us is recognized by web design
professionals and web programmers around
the world and professional organizations
and publishers for the quality of our
content so you're getting legitimate
stuff from a legitimate source here
that's all it is
I also believe that our stuff is Stan's
stands up to the test against others out
there the main focus really is you find
that her stuff is very real and very
practical I've been a web programmer web
nerd since the mid and early 90s I think
I built my first websites either late 94
definitely in 9595 one or the other so I
have a lot of experience at the field
and since those days my main goal was
not necessarily the technology but
really it has been how to use that
technology to get the job done so you're
going to see a very practical vein if
you will consistency in all the content
that we produce whether this stuff that
I predict create or one of the other
authors and I should point out of all
the authors I'd kill sites and killer
PHP they're all people who are actually
real web programmers and developers who
actually work in the real world who do
contract work or who have done you know
commercial work as web developers or web
designers it's it's a it's important
distinction because having that
practical background really injects
itself into the type of content that we
do produce and how things are presented
its again the main goal is to make sure
that you guys get practical skills and
skill sets into your hands as quickly as
possible thanks for listening and you're
going to see many more videos coming out
over the next several months from killer
sites</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
