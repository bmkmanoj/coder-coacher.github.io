update since the first video number one
the fo the FAU X blurry background thing
they do have that on the iphone but
that's just to create an exaggerated SLR
like blurry background you can still get
that depth of field effect with the
iphone 7 socially now you have that
smaller aperture that one f 1.7 aperture
in the excuse me f 1.8 aperture in the
iphone 7 the smaller bat number like the
old iphone 6 @ f 2.2 i think it was when
you go down to 1.7 that means it's got a
bigger aperture bigger hole means it let
let's in more light and it's easier to
get that book effect if i pronounced
that properly just for the record the s7
has an f 1.7 aperture so slightly better
again that lower number means bigger
hole means more light comes in means
better low-light images but to be honest
with you both sitters between F 1.7
versus 1.8 you know advantage but the
iphone 7 has is that the front facing
camera is 7 pixel 7 megapixel vs. 5 on
the s7 so that might have an impact in
terms of image quality if you're doing a
selfie video and then one big thing
though that the samsung has and i'm
surprised iphone 7 didn't put it in they
would have mentioned i figured is the
dual pixel focusing capability do put
pixel focus is like instant lightning
fast it's unbelievable stuff if you
anybody who uses some of the you know
canon 70d canon a TD or so forth they
understand how important do pixel focus
is and and i'm using my lumix here i
wish i had dual pixel focus it's just
it's so much better so the s7 does have
dual pixel focus which is huge in my
opinion beyond that i will have to see
in terms of what camera will be best for
vlogging and taking video I have to say
though that the the iphone 7 plus I
guess is the better one the bigger one
it does have not only optical image
stabilization like the other iphone 7
but also has the two lenses so it has an
ability it has another lens that does
two times optical zoom which is kind of
cool I guess if you want to zoom with
your cell phone and Samsung does not
have optical zoom like that so that's
that's a pretty big deal I suppose a
certain circumstances you know when you
look at specs on these cameras in terms
of hardware and so forth it's it's very
hard to determine necessarily especially
since they're so close which camera will
be best at even end of the day it's a
whole bunch of factors that go into it
so we're going to have to see what
people come up with in terms of video
and picture results with the iphone 7
and we'll compare that to the s7 of all
I have to say that dual pixel is could
be a game changer as you can get that
super fast focus something's will be
back and grab it right away with dual
pixel focus where if you don't have it
it's slower and can be significantly
slower if if not very problematic in
terms of being able to capture focus
quickly you know think of something
moving quickly in the wind or something
I don't know that's pretty much it it's
one up to update cue again the fact that
Apple added in that you know to me it's
kind of a gimmicky thing to add in that
software depth of field effect on top of
what you can get normally that's just me
I think it's kind of gimmicky who knows
time will tell bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
