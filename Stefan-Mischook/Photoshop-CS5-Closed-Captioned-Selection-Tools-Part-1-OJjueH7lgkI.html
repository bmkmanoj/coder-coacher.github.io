talking about is working with selections
and selections are really the key to
understanding how to work inside of a
Photoshop environment what you can do
I'm just going to close that previous
image that we had and I could move
directly to bridge myself if I wished or
I can just go to the mini bridge as you
can see here and whether you're in
bridge or the mini bridge what I want
you to open up is the Rose photographer
or studio picture that you see here and
as you can see I'll just collapse mini
bridge for a second and i will go to the
specific mode screen mode that i want to
see and remember you can see screen mode
with the menu bar and you can see those
by pressing F as well just the simple F
fox keyboard shortcut so what we can see
here is we've got this particular image
at our disposal now if I wanted to I
could make a selection which allows me
to take a portion of the image or some
of this image and remove it for example
from its background or create something
a little bit different what I'll also
introduce you to is this little icon
right here which is the layers icon it's
this one that i'm pointing to right here
if you don't see that for whatever
reason you can all let's go to the
window menu and open up the layers icon
right here f7 is the shortcut and you
can attempt to do that however if you're
on a Mac that might be different from
what your f7 shortcut key is configured
to do right away but nevertheless if
you're on a PC f7 work just fine so as
you can see here I've got the layer
palette right now the layer palette is
written or on it is written the word
background it's just one flat layer
that's all that's really going on here
you'll notice that it's also a locked
layer if I were to take this black arrow
tool and attempt to move it it's going
to give me a little error icon that says
hey it's locked sorry you can't move it
if I wanted to I could just double click
this icon and change the new layer layer
options
to give it a new name like layer 0 now
if I were to move this you'll see that
it actually does move and this entire
layer that i have here actually happens
to have a transparency right now see if
i were to move it over here all of this
checkerboard pattern and background
represents a transparency so that's some
of the basics but what if i wanted to
make a selection and sort of remove this
from its background or you know just
position it somewhere else well a couple
of things that you can do you can work
with the rectangular marquee tool now
let me show you something about
photoshop or any other you know adobe
program when you look at them inside the
toolbar you see that there's separations
here these little lines that separate
the tools that generally means that each
of these groups of tools usually work in
conjunction with each other or do
similar things so the first set of tools
here are all about selecting and you
know moving objects and doing different
things and there's a number of different
tools that we'll be looking at that will
allow us to do just that well here the
first one and very easily we can see
that this one here is a marquee tool and
what that allows us to do is to click
and drag so for example if I were to
click and drag around this you end up
seeing what we affectionately call the
marching ants selection around this
object so that's specifically targeting
the area inside of this object here if I
wanted to I could go to the Edit menu
and I could do a number of things I
could say let's cut what's in this
selection and we could paste it on
another layer or you could copy this and
do a number of other things as well do
note the shortcut command X for cut
almost think scissors and copy is
command C and paste is command V those
are extremely important shortcuts if
ever you're unhappy with what you want
to have happened or let's say I didn't
like this selection can always press
command Z or undo and as you can see
here edit undo will undo that selection
well let me mention some
else now I could come in here and i can
make a different selection and if i
wanted to step back more than one step
instead of just pressing command Z you
could go edit and look here commands ed
and you add the option or alt on your pc
and that allows you to jump back a
number of steps not just one but
multiple steps see this now it's more
than just it says background instead of
layer 0 as we did before so commands
that moves back one step command alt or
option Z moves back multiple steps how
many steps does it move back well it
moves back 20 steps but that's it if you
wish you can go into your preferences
and increase the amount of undos that
you're available to step back but
remember Photoshop is enough of a hog on
your ram memory as it is and if you were
to do that it would just eat up a lot
more so usually 20 should suffice so
remember this if I make a selection I
could command Z to undo that selection
but the best way to undo that selection
is to look at here select menu up at the
top if you want it to select all
everything on this canvas that's control
a select all but if you wish to deselect
just press control D or command D on
your mac and as you can see here kamandi
control the will undo that selection so
that's really important now let's see
what we can do with it let's say I was
happy with this and I'm wanted to say
copy it command C copy and then if i
press command V you'll notice that I
happen to have two layers here one layer
on top of the other one let's see what
that looks like I'm going to take my
black arrow tool the move tool you could
oppressed V on your keyboard shortcut
and let's see this notice by default if
I click on the background I'm not able
to move the background I'm only able to
move the one on the top and why is that
well let's see the move tool that i have
here has auto selection area right here
and
see that I could select a group or I
could auto select a layer I like to use
auto select layer wide because look
layer 1 is highlighted here if I want to
move layer one that's great but what if
I want to move layer to the back our
layer 0 of the background well now all I
have to do is click on that layer and it
will select the background here or click
on the front selects the one in front so
look we copied what was in the selection
and we pasted it into this area over
here right up on top so that's great but
you know if i were to hide the
background you would see all of that
transparency that we did not copy so
that's a real good start and we can see
how that transformation or the or how
the marquee selection copying and
pasting it can work for you but when we
come back we're going to explore some of
the other selection tools that will
allow us to get in a little bit closer
around this edge and produce something
that's a little bit different from what
we've just seen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
