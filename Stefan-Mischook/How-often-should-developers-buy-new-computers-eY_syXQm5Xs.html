channel I tend to do two or three vlogs
at the same time so that so that I don't
have to set up the shots if you will
multiple times it just saves me time
when doing all this stuff anyhow so in
this video I'm going to talk about
computers in development very briefly I
talked about in a previous video and a
couple years ago actually the optimal
computer and the optimum computer I
won't get into the details for me as a
professional developer is a laptop with
SSD drives and they have a flat panel
display one one or two and that's the
optimal I will not get a desktop these
days for coders and developers I would
not get one of those all-in-one IMAX
I like the flexibility of having a
laptop I can move around sometimes I
want to do some coding or some writing
in another room my living room or maybe
in that coffee shop cuz I gotta get out
of the office or something so that's my
recommendation especially if you're a
nomad code of course you need a laptop
anyway so this video is about how long
before you should change your laptop how
long now back in the old days we used to
change them every two years sometimes
every year if you're really busy because
the technology was moving so quickly
laptops all computers this got much
quicker with every year much better
and very every year well significantly
better anyway every passing year this
has changed this has changed quite a bit
the laptops now have reached plateau
computers have reached plateau in the
sense that there's not significant
improvements with laptops on a yearly
basis you do see you know some leaps
every now and then but it's not like it
used to be for instance my macbook pro
retina is a 2012 retina and it 15-inch
it's a great computer it was a leap
because it was a Retina display but
since that time and I'm recording this
in 2016
we are I am recording this in 2016
since that time not much has changed in
the MacBook Pro except the processes are
a little bit better and maybe the hard
drives a little the SSDs are a little
bit faster but that's about it I have
seen my friend was MacBook it snapped up
faster and the fact that matter for
coding and writing and video editing up
to 1080p anyway my four year old MacBook
Pro Retina is still plenty plenty plenty
fast I only now I'm starting to see some
slag enos with it because only went
rather I'm in a very hot room and I'm
doing webinars with multiple people
logging in then the thing starts to tank
on me especially if I have more than I
have two big monitors hooked up to it
then it's starting to have some trouble
but you know it that's yeah it's very
rare you know I'm not doing the webinars
every day I was doing twice a week I
actually had to switch off my Mac
because the webinars were extreme we're
streaming video and I got video I got
people logging in from Texas and people
logging in from from Tennessee and you
know then it started to slag because the
room got hot so the CPU got Hass the
whole computer started tanking and I had
two monitors hooked up to two externals
and you know but that is a rare thing
and still before your old computer now
it's still very good works great if
you're a coder you can get yourself a
2012 a 2013 14 15 16 MacBook Pro retina
with SSDs and you're gonna be coding
quite nicely quite nicely so these days
computer upgrades are far far far far
far less required
so yeah that's especially when you
consider how cheap external hard drives
are and of course I will never get a
moving platter hard drive now these days
it's you can get USB keys 128 K for like
20 bucks 25 bucks you can get 256 for 50
bucks the key Lou USB keys and then of
course you got a cloud storage you
between Dropbox Google Google Docs and
as your Microsoft's you can get a you
know an account in each all right you
know like I did I got you know I got you
can get a link Dropbox you can google
google cloud you can get 70 gigs for
like two bucks a month or something so
you probably best to do that you know
and so yeah that could extend the life
you computer quite a bit so that's
pretty pretty much it so in terms of how
often you should upgrade when your
computer starts getting slow then I
would look into it other than that you
know I figure you got at least a three
year lifespan on a machine maybe four
I'm assuming again you're coding you're
doing coding if you're doing maybe 3d
animation or maybe heavy-duty Photoshop
or video editing 4k of all I don't know
why you would want to do 4k video these
days I know you know who watches 4k yeah
so these days you're looking at three to
four year lifespan on your computer if
not longer if not longer right my four
year old MacBook Pro could probably take
me for another three four years if I
really didn't care but you know they it
looks like they may have they may have
for 2016 finally a significant upgrade
to the machine I might just buy it for
fun just have a change and get a little
bit more speed out of it but there you
go three to four year lifespan and
typically but just look for speed speed
is the key if if you feel that your
productivity starts to slow down because
of the speed issue with the computer
that's the time to get a new computer
Chacho I keep forgetting to add this in
so this is the first video I'm going to
start doing this now if you write a book
one of the things you're supposed to do
is promote it so I've been negligent on
that and pictures my book on my website
and I mentioned once in a while that was
a book I wrote in last year 2015 but
strangely enough the sales are actually
increasing as far as I can tell so slash
time pretty decently I know complaining
so I'm going to shamelessly
my book if you're a beginner to web
design you want the big picture you want
to learn html5 css3 a bit of JavaScript
a bit of bootstrap just tiny bit tiny
bit of jQuery no and you want to learn
how to all fits together and you want to
written up in an easy non nerd language
and have pretty pictures and charts and
all kinds of stuff like that pick up my
book and get it on Amazon you can get it
at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble you can get it in
bookstores in North America and in
Europe and it's getting very good
reviews getting very very good reviews
so if you liked the vlog you just watch
because I'm just gonna stick this on the
vlog at the back end of the vlog then
you're probably gonna like my book</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
