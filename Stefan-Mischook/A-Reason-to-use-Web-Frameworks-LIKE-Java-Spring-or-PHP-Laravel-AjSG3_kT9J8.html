there and tweak some things in the
killer video store now the video store
has pretty good functionality it's a
shopping cart system but hooks into
paypal and in a another payment gateway
for credit card processing it has built
in testimonials it sends out reminders
to users to rate the videos after a week
blah blah blah days as a star systems
all built in now
this was good many years ago and it is
PHP based and it is object oriented but
no framework it was just you know roll
your out roll your own thing out because
it was just it was not a super complex
app that said it works it works fine
does a lot so I was looking at it I said
you know this testimonial thing is not
working and why is it when we getting
the hits what's going on why isn't it
registering so I'm going through things
and this manual thing as it turns out
whatever it is X years ago I decided to
basically put aside my whole retail
business with videos for the most part
and I was cluttered on my with my
institutional clients and other things
outside of video sales I just lost
interest and so I had shut off a couple
things
little triggers so things were working I
was I got the codes broken which was not
working and we had switched servers I
thought maybe it's different
configuration issues and so forth at the
end of the day it was just I had
basically turned off a switch on
something I'll get into specifics
it's literally click and that's it
everything was working again it's that
simple the biggest problem with that
codebase is because it was non-standard
it was not based on any
NBC framework Mao's number one because
if you build an app that's based on
let's say PHP laravel or Java spree or
Python Django or Python flask anybody
coming to it will go ah this is flask ah
this is spring ah this is laravel I know
where things are what is supposed to be
right but what is a custom job even if
it works
that's what are the downsides of a
custom job
it's non-standard you know you have to
stick around so the next problem with
the code base is that there the guy who
wrote it for me he didn't comment it at
all
so you have to really know it you have
to spin I spent a half an hour an hour
okay this is where this is where this is
he should have put in a comment you
should put some comments in there you
know you should have put in like a
readme this is Holly I basically works
this this this live set of libraries are
calling this set of libraries and
getting whatever naming conventions were
clear these are basic best practices in
software development that really make
the difference between easy to manage
code and not so easy easy to manage code
if the programmer I'm not faulting him
we were hacking to see how quick I guess
it's been years if he would have taken
that time the extra twenty minutes to
just document the code put in a few key
comments I read me filed and outlined
this just this large set of functions
business is that that when you want to
set up the new product is that it's all
the testimony just a little write-up
like that that would have gone a long
way making my life easier comments
readme files a nice simple breakdown how
your app code works is huge and again it
goes back to a consistent theme in which
I talked about
logs the key to success in your app
development and your coding is to adhere
to basic principles basic best practices
self referencing bear Bill's consistent
obvious naming conventions good
documentation are huge huge in fact in
the open source world a lot of people
say that they'll say the key between the
successful open source projects and not
so successful is really good
documentation as developers as
programmers we kind of discount that we
kind of discount the soft skills the
communication skills the good writing
they were much more concerned about
learning nodejs or or learning django or
learning how to do react when oftentimes
if you just really look at those basic
best practices I just spoke about you're
going to be better than a sloppy nodejs
guy you're going to be better than a
sloppy react guy you know what I mean so
keep that in mind - ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
