is Chuck and welcome to killer PHP's
course on object-oriented programming
with PHP this is a beginners course
where I assume that you know absolutely
nothing about object-oriented
programming or object oriented PHP all
you need to know is your basics of PHP
going to know what functions are and
variables and so on and if you have that
you're ready to move forward in this
video course since php5 PHP's
object-oriented capabilities basically
got up to the level of the other major
languages out there that are
object-oriented things like Java
ActionScript C sharp and so on though
it's been I guess a couple years since
it came out i'm doing this video in
mid-2007 i still believe that today the
majority of PHP coders are still doing
things old-school meaning or using the
old functions based procedural or
event-driven type of PHP coding they're
not doing object-oriented programming
and I believe the reason for that is
watered a couple major reasons number
one people don't like to learn new
things often enough once they got
something that works why change it and
there's some validity to that and the
second reason which i think is the
biggest reason is because
object-oriented programming is a very
different way of programming and it's
it's harder to learn than the old the
old PHP method the procedural methods so
when something's harder to learn and
you're using something that seems to
work for you it makes it makes it
difficult for you to want to learn a
learning object for your PHP for those
reasons but I will
student now that there are some very
major compelling reasons to learn
object-oriented programming in PHP and
I'm going to cover that in the details
in another quick little video but take
it from me or in this at this point that
learning object oriented programming is
very very very important and you'd be
missing out on a heck of a lot if you
don't do it my approach to teaching
object oriented PHP is a really
reflective of my overall practical and
minimalistic personality when it comes
down to it I'm going to spend a lot more
time on practice and a lot less time on
theory so I'm going to introduce to you
the minimal amount of theory necessary
so that we can actually do something by
the end of the course you'll feel
comfortable using object-oriented
techniques in PHP and you'll be able to
create objects and base your projects on
an object orientated infrastructure it
you won't we won't be covering
everything in this course this is more
or less a crash course on the subject
but you will have the important
fundamentals under your belt if you will
such that the more complex and advanced
things with in object-oriented
programming will be much much easier for
you to approach
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
