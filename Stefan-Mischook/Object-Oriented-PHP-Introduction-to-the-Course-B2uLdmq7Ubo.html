miss Chuck and welcome to killer PHP es
course on object-oriented programming
with PHP this is a beginners course
where I assume that you know absolutely
nothing about object-oriented
programming or object-oriented PHP all
you need to know is your basics of PHP
going to know what functions are and
variables and so on and if you have that
you're ready to move forward in this
video course since PHP 5 PHP s
object-oriented capabilities basically
got up to the level of the other major
languages out there that are
object-oriented things like Java
ActionScript c-sharp and so on though
it's been I guess a couple years since
it came out I'm doing this video in
mid-2007 I still believe that today the
majority of PHP coders are still doing
things old-school
meaning they're using the old functions
based procedural or event-driven type of
PHP coding they're not doing
object-oriented programming and I
believe the reason for that is watered a
couple major reasons number one people
don't like to learn new things often
enough once they got something that
works why change it and there's some
validity to that and the second reason
which I think is the biggest reason is
because object-oriented programming is a
very different way of programming and
it's it's harder to learn than the old
the old PHP method the procedural
methods so when something is harder to
learn and you're using something that
seems to work for you it makes it makes
it difficult for you to want to learn
learn object-oriented PHP for those
reasons but I will
you know that there are some very major
compelling reasons to learn
object-oriented programming in PHP and
I'm going to cover that in the details
in another quick little video but take
it from me in this at this point that
learning object-oriented programming is
very very very important and you'd be
missing out on a heck of a lot if you
don't do it my approach to teaching
object-oriented PHP is really reflective
of my overall practical minimalistic
personality when it comes down to it I'm
going to spend a lot more time on
practice and a lot less time on theory
so I'm going to introduce to you the
minimal amount of Theory necessary so
that we can actually do something by the
end of the course you'll feel
comfortable using object-oriented
techniques in PHP and you'll be able to
create objects and base your projects on
an object-oriented infrastructure it you
won't we won't be covering everything in
this course this is more or less a crash
course on the subject but you will have
the important fundamentals under your
belt if you will such that the more
complex and advanced things within
object-oriented programming will be much
much easier for you to approach
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
