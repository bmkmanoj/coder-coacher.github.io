about is the line tool very simple
drawing tool nothing really to it as you
can see just draw out straight lines and
depending on the information your
property window you're determining what
the stroke color is by the stroke color
here as you can see I've got black
strokes and underneath that in the
options you'll notice that there is snap
to objects that just makes it easier for
you to sort of align these two or three
lines to each other as I've just done
there and as you can see if you overlap
these things really quite easy to use
not really much difficulty with it
pretty self-explanatory however I'm also
going to take a look at yet another tool
that we have available to us and that is
the pencil tool as you can see right
here well this one's more of a free-form
drawing tool as you can see and while
I'm making sort of squiggly lines as you
can see it's done it's best to sort of
match that but every once in a while
it's created these straight lines as you
can see here and there's one reason for
that as you can see in the options for
the pencil tool pencil mode is actually
there are three of them straight and
smooth and ink so if you were to work in
straighten mode you'll see that some of
the lines become straightened I'll
select all of that control a delete them
once you're in smooth mode that gives
you something a little bit smoother and
as you can see if we turn to ink mode
one gives you pretty much exactly what
you're trying to do and as you can see
snapped a little bit but it does allow
for a little bit more free form now
that's fine if you want something that
looks squiggly or scribbly if that is a
proper adjective but on the other hand
if you're looking for more precise
drawing I would suggest that you use the
pen tool because that does afford us the
most accuracy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
