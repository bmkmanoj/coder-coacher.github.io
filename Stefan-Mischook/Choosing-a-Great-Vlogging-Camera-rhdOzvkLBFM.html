to talk to people who are looking at
producing videos or vlogs and you're
looking at all the equipment that you
can get DSLRs or video cams and whether
it be Canon or Sony Panasonic this lands
or Badlands you're going to hear all
kinds of different opinions so I've run
I've ran through this gauntlet if you
will over the last year to trying
different things I first bought a
Panasonic lx100 very sharp lens blah
blah blah I won't get into specifics
then I moved over to Canon which is a
proper DSLR and so I could change lenses
I had this flip screen here so I can see
myself very important if you're doing
solo video work so let me just give you
a couple tips you can do if you're doing
a solo video work you need this flip
screen so you can see yourself as
attached to the camera so you can turn
it and look and see what you're doing
number one number two you need camera
with a lock solid autofocus or even what
the Sony or the Canon a TD or 7d for
sure so uh yeah those are the two main
things that make a huge difference if
you're doing solo video shooting okay
now I'm going to back away and here's
the big big picture in terms of
assessing video gear for your video work
number one and I don't hear this in any
vlogs that they don't mention this is
the overriding rule the fundamental rule
that if you follow this you'll go you
know we can't really go wrong with this
the lens that you put on your camera is
twice as important as the body so you
know if you get DSLRs you get a body and
you got it lens especially you know you
can attach different lenses right then
we stay together the lens is twice as
important as the body and professional
photographers all tell you this you've
asked them it's the glass they call the
lens that call it the glass so let me
give you a quick story I went out and I
bought a mid-level Canon a TD because it
had the
do the super super fast dual pixel
autofocus and it had that flip screen
now the Canon ADB has the best focusing
auto focusing system in the market I was
a candidates do anyway and then the Sony
or close second so if you're doing solo
video work like me this is crucial
crucial to your video work that you have
this super fast autofocus now if you're
holding the camera then you've got a lot
more choices with other systems that may
not have as good a focusing system like
Panasonic I'm not saying this camera is
better than that I'm just saying if
you're doing solo video work you need
the flip screen so you can see yourself
and you need to do a pixel you need to
great autofocus Canon or soda you choose
of course Sony don't have no flip
screens so you got to keep that in mind
anyway what's the underlying issue you
got to spend your money on the lens the
body again is half as valuable as the
lens in terms of picture quality half is
valuable or you put it the other way
spend twice as much on your lens than
your body so let's say your budget I'm
just going to use round numbers and make
my life easy let's say your budget is
three thousand dollars you spent two
thousand on the lens and a thousand the
body and people who are well what do you
mean what do you mean just me the lens
is everything it's most not everything
but it's two times more important and
the investment in cameras by the way is
in the lens because you can take this
lens which you spend two grand on in
this example and you can switch it to
the brand new body so your lenses last a
long time lenses will be good for could
be good for 10 years or longer much
longer and it'll be super sharp so I'll
just take everyone ten years from now
you know whereas camera bodies where you
got the chip the sensor is that that
technology changes every couple years
quite a bit so the bodies you you throw
a lot of a few years but the lens you
keep so it's worth putting money
economically speaking into the lens and
by the way even if you've got the best
camera body at the best sensor if you've
got a crappy lens in front of it is
going to get a crappy linage image
because the lens will determine how
sharp your image is determine how how
nice the colors are displayed to a great
extent
and there's a few other things that a
good lens will deliver like chromatic
though they call basically this color
fringing good quality lens will have
less color distortions very minor only
camera nerds will pay attention to this
and a good lens will have a much more a
much more even distribution of sharpness
of your picture and will have a much
more even distribution or much more
pleasant distribution if you will of the
color in the resulting photography
whether it be photos or video anyway I'm
not a camera expert I call myself that
I've entered your realms of
intermediate-level camera guy like if I
was doing karate that'd be like a blue
belt maybe a green belt Bluebell
intermediate level guy I don't claim to
be an expert but I'm telling you I went
through a few lenses I was looking for
my lenses of here and I tried like the
lens that came with the camera they
called the kit lens hmm I got the better
kit lamp yeah and then I got like a
cheap-ass wide-angle lens this is fives
kind of soft and then I got another
cheap-ass lens and then I said I just
saw Kate forget it and then I said I'm
going to bite the bullet and I luckily I
found an $800 lens retail this Canadian
is like 600 u.s. I bought it for Half
Price from a guy and it was brand new
you know it looked brand-new it was
great so and I put it on and the quality
of the image is much better I can shoot
in low light and it doesn't it looks
much better it's just much better thing
say camera much better image and in fact
when I put out my first video of myself
with the new band some guys and stuff
you look really young now you look much
better you look like you've gotten some
rest and I didn't get any more rest is
just at the lens just a bit of lens and
it didn't make me look so blotchy and
stuff and when you become like a
middle-aged Deezer like me you got to be
concerned about those things anyway that
was my muscle short rant so you can read
my advice cameras videos blah blah blah
Spang
two-thirds of your money on your lens
you will not regret it
for all the reasons I just mentioned
that's all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
