all thanks for those who are paying up
the Python course the pre-order by the
way I've had several people get confused
that the course was a pre-order so they
would buy and then they would say I
can't download the course on the start
well that's because the course is not on
the story its pre-order but what I've
done for people is that I've made it
available through other means so if you
do buy the pre-order just send me an
email it's to find at killer Sykes calm
and I will arrange for you to be able to
download the videos right away pretty
darn quick PDQ so my point of this vlog
was discussed audio now here's ago I
used to put out some audio podcast I had
a series called the business of web
design where it talks about setting up a
web design business and I'm thinking of
putting out a new version of that course
new version of those those discussions
if you've been watching my youtube
videos you know I got a lot of
information out there where I talk about
a whole bunch of different subjects that
is made possible but if I I've been in
business since I've been 18 years old we
started with $200 to my name and that
includes the value of the mattress no
sleeping on so wasn't exactly rich to
begin with and so I'm thinking putting
together a series of videos or perhaps
audio on the business on business and
general entrepreneurial entrepreneurial
and ships or entrepreneurial activities
how to start a business how to be an
entrepreneur I covered a bunch of things
here and there in the vlogs of course
but I'm thinking of taking it and to a
much more structured level of course and
so this would be a course that I would
deliver partly in video but I think I
would just do it a lot of audio because
I think that's a subject that you could
listen to while on the way work on the
way to school etc etc where each episode
if you will would discuss a particular
aspect
being an entrepreneur out starting a
business and so on and so forth and all
of my ideas all the things I've
expressed in my videos that you see on
YouTube and elsewhere they're all based
on personal experience I've read a bunch
of books in the past and there's some
good stuff out there which I could
mention but generally speaking the best
teacher of course is real-life
experience and you know having had
several businesses in different
categories in different markets while
different categories better word that
has given me a good perspective so let
me give you an example the fact that I
had dry good product that sort of source
I chose life like live animals for zoos
and stuff that was allowed I can talk
about that little weird business then a
serve an individual contractor in
software
I did some 3d animation and end design
work I did of course independent
software developer they ran a web design
studio that Studio web was originally
web design studio then I had you know
had people working for me and stuff then
you know then a SAS service slot for of
a service type of business then in
digital publishing Yeley area so I have
all a range of businesses small
businesses but they've all made money
and I've never been bankrupt and like
when you learn how to program where you
if you learn Python then you learn
JavaScript also in your understanding of
each language will be a little bit
better because you can be able to
compare and contrast away for example
Python handles functions and JavaScript
handles functions how Joseph handles
object orientation and how Python
handles object orientation by learning
both you're going to understand the
course subject for example functions
better and you see that with business as
well when I would move from one category
of business in soft manufacturing to
service business to software as a
service business to providing
typical services each time I've switched
over to a different category of business
my understanding of business became much
better because I was able to identify
those Universal concepts those ideas of
principles those techniques those
tactics that work and apply across all
industries in whole business types
anyhow so let me know is this sort of
serious interest you I'm probably going
to do it anyway and I think I'm going to
deliver it in both video and audio
format show four aforementioned reasons
that's about it I'm going to head out to
meet a friend for lunch and because it's
a nice hot sunny day and because parking
is a pain downtown I just jump on the
bike</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
