vlog I'm going to respond to a few
comments that were sent to me so I'm on
the comments tap here and my I don't
what you call this my video manager my
Creator studio excuse me so I'll stop
started at the top of him work away down
creepy mug that will make for a fun
coffee break from Tiffany yeah this is
the mug she's talking about
I bought this mug because it's kind of a
strange mug but I'm using it for my
Python course as a silly prop so anyway
so there you go the mug next comment
Mike from Texas let's go to paraphrase
I'm 45 years old I want to change my
career to tech world
he's been learning how to code but it's
all very foreign to him because you've
taken the wrong course do my course it
would be very easy to understand from
the beginning then you can do any other
course that's the key of so many of
these cold courses but out there are not
designed by teachers and that's a huge
issue because teaching is a skill and
it's a talent and a teacher does two
things first of all teacher breaks down
seemingly complex subjects like coding
like programming and so forth and the
other thing that a teacher does is that
able to pinpoint the important aspects
of a particular subject because with
coding for example there's so much to
learn there's so much out there but the
reality is that as a developer you just
need to know some of the key concepts
key techniques I don't know what the
percentage is maybe 20% maybe maybe 10%
something like that of of a coding
languages there are totality you take
the totality of Java for instance you
don't need to know more than 10% of it
to really become practical and capable
in Javas to save me with JavaScript and
Python and PHP or so forth you know some
might argue 25% who knows anyway but you
get the idea when you are learning how
to code or learning any subject the
teacher has to be able to pick out the
important aspects and present those to
you in the right order so that you
understand some things make sense and
probably see so many cold courses out
there they popped up recently in the
last several years is because a lot of
these people have never talked before
it's pretty clear so people who are new
to coding go there and they're
frustrated because it's hard and maybe
coding is not for me and it's a shame
because the fact that they're having
trouble has nothing to do with them as
all to do with the fact that you have
people who are not teachers trying to
teach that's my criticism and of course
I am biased given that I've been
teaching you know for 13 14 years or 14
years anyhow this purse is saying you
know Anatomy trauma surgeries
tools instruments not sure if computer
to right for you trust me just keep
writing code keep iterating basically
keep just writing code you might be
ready to go blind at first you might not
know exactly what the code means at
first but it will come with time so
don't give up
people say that nodejs is gonna take
place takes P HP's place impossible the
reason being is that PHP is the most
widely used web development language the
most widely used web development
language by a longshot
there are so many small businesses out
there whose website is based on PHP and
they're using content management systems
like Drupal Joomla and by far and away
the most important and the most popular
WordPress these three content management
systems collectively power something
like 35% of the world's websites if not
more and they are written in PHP for
that reason alone PHP is going nowhere
right write that in there and the fact
that matters PHP is so powerful
performant know it has some advantage in
terms of us a synchronous communications
as so forth ya know it's super fast but
in terms of 99% of websites needs PHP 7
which is I think we're at 71 now it's so
fast it runs circles around Python and
Ruby and it's just such a great language
to get into for web development because
their job prospects because of WordPress
because of Drupal plus a Joomla and and
and there's so many web sites are
dependent on PHP it's not going to
replace PHP it's it's kind of a a joke
I'm not trashing node no it's great but
it has its niche in my opinion next
question I'm learning Java Enterprise
Edition j2ee should I continue or start
another language hey I'm a huge fan of
Java
I did most of my coding when I was a
freelancer and working for people as a
Java developer
it's a great language just understand
when you're getting into j2ee you're
getting into Enterprise Edition
enterprise meaning huge corporations
mean we're working for an IBM working
for huge businesses like that that rely
on Javan so many do it's a different
beast than working for example as a
freelancer in the freelancer in world
you're more PHP or you're more maybe
some Ruby maybe some Python but when it
comes to I'm thinking web development of
course when it comes to Java Enterprise
Edition understand what that beast is
now Java itself is a great language to
learn because not only are you doing you
can do web apps with it you can also do
and spring is the most popular framework
these days in the Java web development
and you also a droids also excuse me
Chavez also used for Android development
snot g2w II but it's Java so should you
continue well if you want to do
enterprise yeah for sure if you're not
sure if you just this is your first
language there's nothing a lot wrong
learning Java but I always talk about
the career what are your career goals
whatever your job goals regardless of
programming and development take a look
at my playlist where I talk of careers
in coal traffic 2030 videos on that and
I go over all these things
check check out also my videos should
you learn you know Python should you
learn Java should you learn by PHP
Exeter and I get into all these details
about language choices relative to
career choices so but Java is great
whatever you learn in Java you can
transfer that easily into whatever other
language you may find yourself doing so
don't worry about it should I keep my
name I asked a few weeks ago or last
week or whatever it was
should I change my channel name from
killer PHP which is based on my own
website to my name I'm probably just
going to change to my name I haven't got
around to it
this guy Jeffrey writes video starts off
four minutes yeah sometimes I get into a
bit of a rambling before I start the
main subject of the video
okay I'm gonna reverse that I think I
better go into the main subject with the
video they don't end with my rambling
and maybe some scene
scenic scene from somewhere around my
where I live here my job guy says
waiting for my Python course it's coming
it's coming
I had to wait for this cup before I
could do my Python course so anyway now
the Python course is coming soon I just
got caught up in a bunch of work of
studio web development and so forth
finally got a new developer on board
he's really good thus far and we're
gonna get another one I think as well
because some the old guys are moving out
so that's pretty much it there's enough
for the mail bag of this week if I have
time I'm going to transfer from my pixel
so 4k video and a shot of a snowstorm
that's going on right now in Montreal I
hope you enjoyed a video ciao ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
