calm and today what I'm going to be
doing is looking at how we can do a bit
of cleanup on our project so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to start off by
just fixing up we've been doing a lot of
new column killer PHP models user and
these can be really long name spaces and
it might seem a little bit overkill so
we're going to clean that up we're also
going to get rid of all of these this
render this render this render since
we're basically repeating ourselves in
our controller so we're going to clean
those two things up and then we're going
to look at how we can clean up our
models and how they're defining various
parameters so we're going to start there
and then we're going to go and we're
going to refine our persistence we're
going to move stuff into our lower
layers and let the the models handle the
persistence of objects and so on and so
forth so we're going to move the user
exists flag down to the user model and
we're going to be passing the whole
request object down to the model so that
the model can handle that request by its
own self so let's get started the first
thing I want to do is I want to stop
typing calm killer PHP models user
because we always know that we're
working with killer PHP and it seems a
little redundant so I'm going to use the
use declaration at the top and I'm going
to say use calm killer PHP models rather
use calm killer PHP and then that way
down here I can just say new models user
which is a little more precise and well
it's not more precise but it just means
that I don't have to always type in comp
it killer PHP so that's just a nice
little shortcut if i refresh this
nothing will change which is good so
that's the first thing I wanted to do
the next thing I want to do is I want to
pass the whole request object into this
user and I also don't want to use the
constructor the reason I don't want to
use the constructor is because it's not
very good practice to rely on a certain
number of arguments for your models if
you do then it means that we always have
to put in a first name and a last name
and an address and this can be kind of
hectic so rather I'd rather just declare
one constructor that is a little more
free form or doesn't require any
arguments so instead here i'm going to
rename i'm going to create a public
function here called construct and we'll
just leave that empty and then here we
will rename this to save parameters and
instead of saving the parameters and
requiring that this be the first name in
the last name in the address we're going
to do this a little more dynamically and
what I mean is that I'm going to take in
whatever the parameters are and then for
each of those parameters
I'll assign the necessary variable which
makes a lot of sense at this point so
I'll just say this key equals Val now
this is all fine and now what you'll see
is that because we've got a dress first
name and last name and because in my
form over here I've got a dress first
name and last name and they're identical
then in my index controller if instead
of doing current user equals like this
hold on one second so now I can just say
this new models user okay so that works
so now instead I can just do session
current user and then save parameters
request and what it'll do is this can be
treated like any other variable right so
the only difference between saying user
equals new models user and session
current user equals new models user is
that this is going to be stored in
session or in memory on the web server
the other thing yeah so now I'm just
passing in all those parameters as the
request object and then here everything
else is the same so let's see what
happens if i refresh this again nothing
is going to change however if I go back
to the default page and I say let's say
my name is Jane Roberts and I live in
Vancouver BC and I hit submit let's see
what happens okay it says require once
com killer PHP controller models user so
we're getting this error here saying
calm killer PHP controllers and then
models and then user dot PHP and this is
happening because of my use declaration
I made a mistake since I still new to
this stuff
myself so we say use calm killer PHP and
here I'm just going to say as KP and
then down here I can just put in new KP
backslash models user and there we go so
Jane Robert and she lives in Vancouver
submit the query and then if I go back
to welcome index actor index controller
and then welcome then we'll see that
Vancouver and Jane and Roberts and all
of that is being persisted properly so
now what's happening is that basically
that request parameter is getting passed
into the user object which is actually
being stored in session so this is all
nice and fine and dandy the other thing
I want to do is I want to move this user
exists function into the into the model
so if you look here we could actually
create a user object before setting all
the parameters a lot of very rich PHP
frameworks will let you manage these
kinds of parameters and the setting of
various session variables whether you're
using symphony or the zend framework
because we've got a very rudimentary
system here and we're highlighting all
these different neat tricks with PHP 5.3
and the MVC architecture for now we're
going to leave it as is and we're going
to shift our focus over to using session
to store users and how we can basically
pass or handle the call back in one page
so that we can simplify our example and
then move the example over to a
aggregate or collection of users rather
than one user so that's what we're going
to do in the next video the last thing
that I want to try and just kind of
highlight here is that we've been using
this render repeatedly in our example so
I'm going to delete that
and delete that and I'm going to delete
that as well and now our pages aren't
going to render anymore however if I go
back to the controller abstract class at
the top I can just run this render after
we run the particular method and then
everything will be back the way it was
so we render a method dynamically we
don't know what it's called or what have
you we know that it ends with the word
action and then we render it and that's
when we do that's how we fire off the
rendering of function so this is just a
little bit of code cleanup which we
should be doing along the way anyways so
we've managed to save parameters here if
we wanted to we could easily check to
see if a user exists and pass that
functionality down but I'd like to shift
the focus a bit and look at how we can
render multiple users using the user
model since the user model is storing
anything related to user management it's
not just a user it's also going to be
handling the persistence of multiple
users and so in order to properly
illustrate this we're going to shift our
focus from the current user session
variable to the users session variable
