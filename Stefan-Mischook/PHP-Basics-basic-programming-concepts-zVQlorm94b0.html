problems when trying to learn PHP or any
other language because of a lack of
understanding of the basics with that in
mind and I'm assuming that you've never
written software before you've never
programmed before I want to cover a
couple key basics but I hope we'll make
the process of learning PHP that much
easier
what is a programming language in a
nutshell a programming language is a
written language that has its own
special rules and special words that it
uses that essentially gives instructions
to a computer
it tells computers what to do examples
of programming languages include PHP
Java Ruby pearl and there are dozens and
dozens more so a question that comes to
my mind is why are there so many
different programming languages if
they're all doing the same thing the
answer that question is actually the
same answers why we have many different
types of automobiles or cars why do we
have sports cars what do I have Jeeps
what do we have pickup trucks like
automobiles each programming language
has something that it's it's very good
at doing each programming language is
designed to do a very particular task so
for example PHP is designed was designed
from the ground up to create dynamic
database driven websites
programming languages are very flexible
typically meaning that a language that
may be specialized in creating dynamic
driven websites something like PHP you
can also do some things that other
languages better maybe specialize in
something else for instance Perl is a
programming language designed to process
text really well though Perl is
specialized in that and PHP really isn't
PHP does have some capabilities that
Perl has and on the flip side though
Perl was not originally designed to
create dynamic websites you can use Perl
to do that we know that programming
languages are specialized to each have
their strengths and their weaknesses and
we know there's a lot of crossover in
terms of the functionality of each of
these programming languages so we know
that PHP has certain capabilities that
Perl has and vice versa
with all this in mind it's safe to say
that once you've learned one programming
language like PHP you're going to have
learnt a lot about many many other
programming languages PHP boils a lot of
stuff from Perl and a lot of the
concepts and ideas seeing Perl you're
gonna see in Java and you're gonna see
in Ruby and so on so in learning PHP
you're going to open your your eyes to
many different languages out there in
time you'll find that if you decide to
learn other languages it just gets
easier and easier with each one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
