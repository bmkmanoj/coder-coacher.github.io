takes time to master there's no question
so what I'm trying to do with this video
is again I want to emphasize the dream
weavers tools for managing CSS and using
CSS and I'm also just going to try and
teach you the the more practical aspects
of it because like I said there are
several books written on it and I'm not
going to be able to cover much of it and
especially in this video that said if
you really advise but you learn a little
bit more about CSS in terms of the raw
code you should really get into it and
I'll tell you why because though
Dreamweaver is very powerful in terms of
what it does with CSS and HTML it still
has certain limitations there's always
so much you can do and it's not a about
taking a shot at Adobe Dreamweaver here
I think it's a great program it's just
what you need to know the basics behind
the scenes you need to know what
Dreamweaver is actually doing because at
the end of the day when you're clicking
all these Dreamweaver buttons and so on
during the verses writing code for you
right it's just writing code so you have
to understand that code you don't have
to become a guru but you have to
understand it so getting back to CSS I
recommend that once you do this stuff
and you can have practical workable
knowledge from this dreamweaver cs3
course but I would recommend my web
design one course where I get into
detail about code again into HTML I get
into CSS and strangely enough the course
is not actually boring you see once you
understand code using a program like
dreamweaver or front page or any web
design program will become much easier
because you're going to understand the
basics and trust me it's really not that
hard you just got to give yourself that
extra hour so to learn this stuff anyhow
let's let's move a little bit forward
now what I want to do is just show you
again to remind you how we can attach
these style sheets to multiple HTML
pages so let's
create let me go just let me just
collapse this for sure first let's
create another HTML page so I'm going to
go file new see I'm showing you
different ways to do it and I'm gonna
say blank page new page and this all
kinds of neat stuff i'm going to show
you later but anyway new page and say
create head loop run a print type a
little from staff there we go so we got
a page and was going to file save and
remembers going to ask us what we want
to call a page so i'm going to be
original to call it page page to yet i
recall exciting see these page names are
actually you know except for the index
you know what the index is about but you
know if you were building there's a
little tip when you named your pages try
to give them names that are
self-describing so let's say you had a
dog grooming business you're building a
site for them so you might put price
list give the page a name priceless if
on that page you actually have the price
list or you might call it dog grooming
bad one bad one I know dog grooming you
know dog grooming photos there we go dot
HTML on HTML there we go again you see
the page name tells me except something
about what's going to be on that page
right keep that in mind when you're
building your site's give the names
intelligent give the page names rather
than tell them intelligent names so that
it's easy to remember what's going on a
page provides a sort of a
self-describing logic to it if you know
what I mean and it's actually good for
google and search engine optimization so
keep that in mind anyhow so I create a
page 2.html and here it is of course so
let's so let's attach a stylesheet to it
again we've done it before what's let's
do it again you know this way we've done
this way right we have attached
stylesheet but we could also do down
here sort of shore
cut way you can all down here on our
style drop-down list and hit attach
style sheet and it gives us the options
right here so right now it's see style
that CSS and go browse see style to
style and so let's say style that
success hit ok you go ok and there we go
so page 2 I just saved it page 2 html is
now linked to style dot CSS and we know
it is because if you look in our style
CSS style panel we go all you see that
CSS Styles is now includes now we can
happily apply our style rules cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
