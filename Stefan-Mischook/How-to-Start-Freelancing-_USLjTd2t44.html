steps to becoming a freelance web
designer web developer number one you
got to learn your foundation programming
that is the HTML CSS and JavaScript once
you get those three down what you have
to do is then build a profile website a
website of your own it's kind of like
your calling card or your business card
or your brochure you have to have a
website because if you're gonna sell
yourself as a professional web designer
you should have at least a decent
looking website so you learn your basics
just with my HTML and CSS course you'll
be able to build pretty much any type of
design but you see on the web and when
you get to that stage you've got to put
up some sort of site so again so people
have a place to see and then the next
step is to go out there and talk to a
local business or somebody's starting a
new business and do a simple project for
free you could be building a site from
scratch it could be building installing
a wordpress template and configuring it
and making sure it looks good and
everything works well just something
simple and the reason you're going to do
the first one for free it's kind of like
your stash you know a lot of people will
go to boot camps and spend five ten
twenty thousand dollars because they
they want to get into a stash because
the boot camp will say you are you past
win ten grand and we'll get you a stash
at some sort of company now the thing is
you don't need to pay a boot camp for
fast you could just do it yourself so
you learn your foundation scales your
HTML and your CSS and just with those
two you put up your site and then you go
to local businesses they say I want to
do something I want to build a site for
you or I'll help modify or upgrade your
WordPress whatever it is and of course
you're not gonna know everything getting
into it the first time that's normal
that's normal professional developers
even with people who have a lot of
experience will continuously be learning
new things as they go through the job
that's actually part of the job and
that's why I emphasize those
foundational principles and skills and
the courses anyway so you put up your
site then you go see small business
owners say I'll do your site for free
it's free training you don't have to pay
the bootcamp $10,000 to get a job
working for Sony for free for training
and you may have to do one or two small
jobs small gigs working for small
businesses just to learn the back and
forth so you start learning how to
budget your time you start learning how
to communicate with clients just
understanding the process and once
you've done one or two you're going to
feel very comfortable about building
sites for people and then you'll be able
to go out there and then start getting
real paid gigs at first they start off
where you're making less because you're
not as productive you know it's good but
if every project what you do you're
gonna be able to make more money because
you could work faster and the quality of
your work is going to be better right
off the bat it leads to something else
that people ask a lot about this how do
you become you go from beginner
intermediate how they go from beginner
intermediate to becoming an expert web
designer developer is it doing a
specialist course no it's actually
building projects that's the key to
modern development you should learn your
basics you learn your foundations and
then you get out there and you start
actually building things and you learn
on a need-to-know basis this has been my
experience over 20 years now I hire web
developers all the time and I was a
freelancer for many years I could tell
you just this is the way it works and
this is the quickest way to getting
there where you start making a lot of
money now once you've picked up your
first couple clients at first it's a
little slow when you're starting off as
a freelancer you may get one here one
there a little bit of space in between
that's okay that's normal but what
you'll see all of a sudden you're
getting all kinds of clients too many
clients you don't you know know what you
will not know what to do with him very
common as well so what you have to do
from the first clients you get even the
free one you have to start developing
something called workflows these are
ways of working that will maximize your
time which will multiply the
effectiveness the effectiveness of your
time so you make a lot more money for
your time
so there's no question successful
freelancers
after a reasonable period of time
depends on how hard you work how lucky
you are and stuff like this but you'll
be making much more as a freelancer than
you would be working for somebody not
that there's anything wrong with working
for somebody because there's a solid job
you get your paycheck it's a high page
or highly respected in that work but if
you don't have that the huge potential
remember if you're being paid I was just
going to pull number here just to keep
it it depends where you live how much
you're getting it paid per hour right if
you're in India it's one thing if you're
in Russia it's another thing in u.s.
it's nothing if you're California's is
one thing if you're in Wyoming is
another price right that being said so
let's say you're being paid $30 the hour
you're paying being paid 60 grand a year
as a web designer well your boss is
gonna have to Bill you out it's going to
have to make a hundred twenty grand a
year just to make money with you that's
the way it goes we won't get into all
the details here so think about that if
you're doing your own work for your own
clients you don't have to make pay
yourself six thirty dollars the hour
right which is 60 grand a year you have
to pick you how you can you can make
that 120 for yourself
anyway that's another story get into
when we get into freelancing a bit more
so there you go I was three steps
learning the basic skills HTML CSS
JavaScript post also really good go out
there put up a site then talk to local
businesses start doing jobs dude first
one or two for free just to learn the
craft which a big part of it is working
with the clients and managing a project
I hope that helps bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
