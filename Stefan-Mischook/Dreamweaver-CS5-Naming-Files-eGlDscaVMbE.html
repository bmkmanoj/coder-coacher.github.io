a little bit about some basic
information regarding HTML and we saw a
little bit about that already we talked
about tags what HTML hypertext markup
language stands for how those tags are
open and closed to describe areas of
information if we were to go to file new
and just create a new HTML page and
again doctype you could definitely go
with the default but I'm just going to
say none for this case if you remember
we kept it rather simple I could even
take away the meta tag that's in there
will describe a little bit more about
that later as well so you can of course
change what the title indicates inside
here so HTML page or call it whatever
you want obviously should be something
that makes sense and a search engine
friendly so inside of my body tag you
can see I've got my information my open
and close HTML information blah blah
blah so if I were to come in here and
say hello world I just want to speak to
you about saving this page so if I were
to save file save command s is the
shortcut and save it wherever you want
on your desktop anywhere else for that
matter you'll notice there are a couple
of things about the information that you
should be aware of now normally the
first page of any website is called
index.html but I want to speak to you
now I've called mine index.html and
that's fine but I want to speak to you a
little bit about and you'll notice I'll
just press return to make a paragraph
here naming convention so when you're
naming your files don't use special
characters and special characters are
you know any kind of crazy special
character like this do not use them so
I'll just come in here and I'll say no
special characters also no spaces we
don't want to see spaces inside of your
words now a way that you can get around
no spaces and no special characters is
to use one of the three special
characters that are available
they are the minus sign or the dash the
underscore or the tilde mark those are
the only three special characters that
are okay and as you can see here look
I'll just say okay so these three are
okay so if you are naming something
without using spaces so for example if I
were to file save as let's say I wanted
to say this as a different page right if
it was two words like say Red Dog I
would not use this red space dog HTML on
the other hand i would use something
like underscore red underscore dog makes
it easier to read because we've
separated the two words and still it
conforms to our naming convention so
keep that in mind remember your naming
conventions if you you know forget them
and you have these problems in here
you're going to end up with a lot of
problems with your HTML site overall on
the server locally whatever the case may
be so keep that in mind when thinking
about your naming conventions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
