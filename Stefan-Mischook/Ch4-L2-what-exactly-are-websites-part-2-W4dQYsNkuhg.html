I'll just do another save as call it my
plans maybe I want a web page where I
can list my plans things I want to do in
the near future I'll save that so let's
let's check out our folder so you see
we've got three pages now we got the
index page which is the first page but
the web server will load when we visit a
website we got my friends we got my
plans what could we do let's do another
one now you notice I'm using the same
page here the same code as a template so
I'm using it over and over again just to
save time that's a strategy in coding
they'll use templates though to write up
some code that they know that will be
used across many pages and they'll just
keep receiving receiving from this basic
template it's just it's like a cookie
cutter right where you you save time
this way so let me just say this one
again save as when you save as you're
telling sublime text you're telling the
code editor to create a new page if I
just did a save it would just save the
same file on top of itself right you
would just save a new version of the
same file but I want to create a new
file so I do a save as I'm gonna call it
my word and there we go so there we go
we set up our basic website we have four
pages our index my friends my plans my
work you know is we have no spaces in
our file names we have a dash because we
don't want to screw up things just to
remind you let me just show you the
space like this will be no good better
do something like this or have no space
at all maybe an underscore or you're
gonna have you know a bunch of letters
if you want doesn't matter as long as
you don't have a blank space like that
so I like using dashes and you notice I
keep everything consistent I don't use a
dash here and an underscore here and I
don't use no space you know I keep it
consistent this just makes your pages
and your code everything easier to read
and to work with you'll see why as we
can
you to build out our website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
