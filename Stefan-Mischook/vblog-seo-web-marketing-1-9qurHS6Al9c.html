with killer sites and killer PHP calm in
this video blog I want to quickly talk
about SEO and web marketing SEO is of
course short for search engine
optimization and web marketing we'll get
into that in a little bit so basically
SEO is a practice of tweaking your web
pages in terms of text and the code in
the page to get more traffic to your
website that's the basic idea that most
people you know consider it to be no so
question is whether or not this stuff
really works so now the view perspective
I run my sites were technology niche
sites and collectively we get about
400,000 visitors a month about two and a
half million pageviews per month than
we're growing so I have a pretty good
idea about how to get traffic to coming
to your website that said when it comes
to SEO search engine optimization it
really the process of editing the code
changing keywords in your text doesn't
make your site more attractive to search
engines it doesn't increase its his
attractiveness its pole if you will what
it really does is by tweaking keywords
and texts and tweaking a code it would
change the category in which the search
engine will place your website so let me
give you a quick example so let's say
you have a site on pet grooming your
brewing cats and dogs you can change
some little keywords in your site and do
some of the code changes to effect a
change where maybe at prior to the
changes to your code you may be getting
a lot of traffic for people want to get
their dogs groomed so you change them
the keywords and you emphasize more cats
and the search engines may start sending
you more cat oriented grooming traffic
so if there happens to be more people
searching for cat grooming that would
cause your website traffic to increase
on the other hand if there's less people
searching for cat grooming and you
switch over to cat grooming then you're
going to have less traffic in either
case by tweaking the code in your pages
you're not actually getting the search
engines to perceive your site as being
more valuable all you're doing is
setting the category in which the search
engine is placing your site or your
particular order pages I hope that
distinction is clear for people a lot of
people think that if they put in meta
tags and change keywords also the sites
will be more valuable it's going to be
more attractive for search engines
that's not the case from my experience
the way you get more traffic coming to
your site into in terms of making your
site more attractive or are considered
more valuable wider search engines that
all that all has to do with web
marketing and the lifeblood of any web
marketing campaign is links coming in in
bound links so I'm going to get into
that in this video but I just want to
understand that SEO tweaking on the site
what it actually does and so you know
what you're getting into is should you
decide to hire web an SEO firm or you
start doing it yourself so you really
understand what's going on behind the
scenes when you're doing it that I'll
said nobody really knows exactly what
Google or the other search engines how
we're ranking things now they're
perceiving things they tend to keep a
big part of that stuff under wraps
because they don't want people gaming
the system they don't want people
cheating as they used to do back in the
nineties again but that being said
though you still we still know quite a
bit in terms of what they're looking for
at the end of the day my single greatest
SEO tip and web marketing tip is number
one be honest and present good
information that people would want to
read and in time if that's the case if
you do present is this good information
the search engines will reward you in
terms of optimizing your code for the
engines that's more that was more
important back in the 90s when people
wrote really bad code or the early 2000s
these days if people right good clean
standards-based code and who and our
taught proper web design techniques the
sites will be user friendly to begin
with in church wall I user from the
search engine friendly to begin with so
you don't have to worry so much about
that it's more about set in a category
there's all kinds of other things that
you can do in terms of web marketing and
there's a bunch of SEO tips that could
help strengthen your position a little
bit you know it's you know with the SEO
the code tweaking its that's more like
icing on the cake that's more the
sharpening of the blade of you will the
big move is is in terms of the
popularity of your science really create
is really based on the amount links and
the quality of those leaves coming in
anyhow that's it for this little video
blog I hope you found it useful and I
may actually come out with a course on
SE calme I'm marking if I get enough
people requesting it I do get every so
often people are asking for that I just
haven't got around to
so that's it ciao I'm stephanis Chuck
