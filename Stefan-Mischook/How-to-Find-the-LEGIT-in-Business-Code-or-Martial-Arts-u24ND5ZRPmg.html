video that I recorded about three weeks
a month ago and the reason I'm doing
this intro here is because you'll see
that I'm sitting in the car it's
actually raining out and recording this
right here recording this in the winter
so it's a little out of context I just
got lost in the mix and in that vlog I
discuss how to identify legitimate
sources if you will whether it be
business partner coders that you might
work with or a boxing coach or martial
arts coach and I give you some tools
some ways of thinking about how to
identify the JIT players in any given
field this is something I learned over
last two three decades of being an
entrepreneur being a coder and being a
martial artist and so forth so I thought
it might be useful one other thing with
this vlog it ends abruptly because the
camera just shut off I was using my cell
phone camera and even it would happen
with my old DSLR so here's my DSLR I
used this to record about 400 videos
that you've seen on YouTube and other
places and it's great the problem is it
would randomly shut off at points
because it would overheat and that's one
of the reasons why I went with this Pro
Cinema Camera which doesn't shut off and
that's what it reasons why you get Pro
equipment have discussed this in the
last video get pro equipment so that
it's fault-tolerant so that you know
it's not gonna it's gonna it's not gonna
break down at least it's got a lot less
chance that's gonna cause problems for
you don't get me wrong this is the Canon
a TD fantastic camera if you're
recording a video for the first time if
you're just a corporate video or
vlogging or whatever type of video this
is a great first camera cause it's not
too expensive it's extremely capable
don't get me wrong most of the time it's
gonna work great
reason but I would have I was having
troubles because I would push it to its
high-end use case if you will and in a
hot room it would shut off on occasion
which is really
pain-in-the-butt still much better than
other cameras anyway sorry I'll get back
to the vlog so yep this is back in early
November record is so still raining and
it ends abruptly but I think that you
understand where I'm going with I think
what you watch it you all understand
what I was where I was going with that
I write thanks a lot bye-bye you know
what I'm gonna do one little thing here
before we get into that video album of
the day I did these a few times people
liked it not too much ice stopped it but
anyway here's a quick suggestion this is
Led Zeppelin houses of the Holy
it's got some crazy good tunes on here
it's one of my she's my favorite that
Zeppelin album of all time kind of a
weird cover there's one song on there
well there's a lot of great songs
there's one tune on there but the
Beastie Boys used as the backing track
if you will they sample it heavily for
one of their big hits so houses of the
holy legs up and fantastic album if
you're interested in exploring different
music maybe you're aware of this maybe
you're not fantastic album alright
that's it bye
all right let's get to it so how do you
determine if somebody is legit you know
what you're looking at whether it's a
business and of course you're looking at
maybe you want to take a martial-arts
maybe you want to get to boxing how do
you determine if somebody's legit well
online you have of course reviews and
ratings that helps another thing and I
think is even more important to a great
extent is reputation and background is
background reputation and background let
me give you a quick story
it was straight my point this is off
line this is not an online stories and
all phones for it so what I wanted to
learn how to box so what did I do
well I look for somebody who had a very
good boxing record somebody who actually
won fights and have been in a lot of
fights so I found my coach who had a
record of 77 in and 277 and 2 that means
out of 79 fights they actually won he
actually won rather 77 fights this is
like world-class stellar record
unbelievable record and this is verified
so what does this tell you why is it
important that I find a fighter who had
a stellar record with lots of fights
under his belt rather than maybe finding
somebody who read a couple of books on
boxing and he did some marching classes
and then is decided to teach well the
guy who has the record of 77 to has a
much deeper understanding when the guy
who hasn't fought much or maybe lost
fights because the difference between a
successful and a not so successful
regardless of the field is really in the
subtlety of the execution so what do I
mean by that the great boxer
knows all these little subtleties that
add up to making them much more
effective as a fighter subtleties in the
way their body mechanics subtleties in
there and their training methods
subtleties in their tactics etc etc same
thing with software development by the
way you can get some guy who's done a
couple of courses from whatever you know
YouTube whatever and they they may know
superficially how to do certain things
but unless they've been taught by highly
experienced developers and unfortunately
so many courses out there are taught by
noobs and by people don't know how to
teach so they they don't they only have
a superficial knowledge they don't
understand the core of the language is
they don't have a deep knowledge so how
we execute is going to be poor people
like that are going to be like the
people who the boxing coaches have never
fought for who fought a few times and
lost these are not the people you want
you want to work with so let's get
outside of that let's get into business
how do you determine if somebody is
successful in business and that they
know what they're doing when it comes to
business is it by the money that they
have no because Mike Tyson made hundreds
of millions of dollars as a boxer but
and he lived lavishly for several years
but did he ended up being bankrupt
because he doesn't know anything about
business he doesn't know anything about
money management so they had talked
about how money manager is so important
but he won ended up broke many NBA ball
80% of NBA players 80% or more of NFL
players and a bankrupt within a couple
years retiring from from the game again
clearly these people made a lot of money
and you saw they have the houses and the
cars and stuff the winner within a few
years of bankrupt so that tells you that
they actually are terrible at business
because they didn't make their money
business and they're terrible money
management and you see that a lot so the
way that you can discern whether
somebody is legitimate when it comes to
business is whether or not they have
longevity
and a variety I would even argue one-hit
wonders like founders of startups that
grow up huge and then you don't know if
they're really good at anything they may
have been just very lucky any fool can
get lucky and ride away right you know I
got famously I got lazy I didn't buy my
Bitcoin but had I bought my bitcoins
today my Bitcoin stash be worth 98
million us now reality is anybody who
has any experience investing knows
you're never gonna have I wouldn't have
carried and held these bitcoins up up
until today I was sold out walked I
would go you know but that being said
let's just say for the argument I was
wasn't having what wouldn't have been so
lazy I would have just bought those
bitcoins put them in a drawer and forgot
about them and then they say hey look I
got these bitcoins are worth 100 million
98 million does that make me a business
genius or does that make me somebody who
won the Super Bowl the Super Ball the
lottery ticket I'm just a lottery ticket
winner well if somebody has started up
YouTube and after five years I sell it
to Google for four hundred million
even though YouTube the business is
still losing money to the state youtube
losses of I think it's one or two
billion a year it's still losing money
after about 10 15 years so the guys just
started YouTube are they geniuses or are
they really really lucky that Google
decide to buy even though they had a
business that was losing tons of money
for me they got very lucky because they
didn't really build a viable business
for me a viable business business
actually makes a profit
you know I'm old-fashioned that way I
think businesses should make a perfect
so you have to in my opinion in my
suggestions when you're evaluating
somebody special out there in the
business world this vanish maybe I
should put in my business battle plan
course yeah I'll put it as an extra
perhaps any up when you're going out
there in a real business world when
you're evaluating people you might want
to do business with whether you're being
those partners or you partner with them
or whatever
more detail and of course you have to
look at their long-term track record you
got to make sure that they're not
necessarily one-hit wonders
or maybe Danis inherited their parents
business I want to think it's one of my
pet peeves rich get rich kids guys just
say well I went and I worked for my
father's company and it was only doing
four million a year and then I went in
there and I built it up to 50 million or
whatever it is okay
that's it's a bit of a fiction first of
all you went in and you work for your
dad you know come on the hardest part
about starting a business is actually
starting at figuring out inventing it
come in with the product line coming
with the workflows come in with the
distribution channels etc etc that's the
hard part so when you go into a business
that's doing millions a year all the
hard stuff is established was just a
question of driving pushing that monkey
right getting it going and just
capitalizing on that but rich kids don't
realize how easy they have it they have
it because they go work for dad and
that's the reality so I don't know if I
would trust these guys either because
they've never really done it
I've had several mentors and I think the
most viable or he was not really a
mentor I guess he was but what was
impressive about this guy it's raining
outside so nothing here is what's
impressive about this guy's when he
builds several businesses they were not
alike he had a business in category A
and Business Academy be somewhat
manufacturing and furniture clothing and
all kinds of the businesses and he was
able to make most of them work that's
pretty impressive because he was able to
go into different industries and and use
his business skills to make viable
business out of these these companies
that to me is a guy really
he's doing because it's not just a one
hit it's many successive hits that's
what you should look for track record
look for reputation and then I think
you're gonna have a better judge whether
somebody is legit so if you're looking
for a martial arts coach or a boxing
coach I would find somebody's actually
developed good fighters or somebody
who's fought a lot of fights and won not
the losing a winner because any fool can
teach you too superficial of any
technology or any skill set anybody can
pick up a book go watch some YouTube
videos and then they give it back to you
but what you're gonna get is a bunch of
superficial stuff that's actually in the
end could be very damaging to you it's
kind of funny and say I remember when I
was like an orange belt or something in
judo and a lot of people say that's when
you're most vulnerable because you're
still learning we're sort of caught in
this framework and won't be natural and
it's not a good place to be when you get
to be an expert where all the training
becomes natural and instinctual then you
become much more effective as a fighter
in real situations same thing with with
business and saying expanding with
coding you're dangerous and you know a
little bit you think you're gonna create
some really bad cold perhaps you're
dangerous especially in business if you
know a little bit you're gonna make be
maybe speaking mistake perhaps you're
not taught properly we go you're not
aware of things I've made a lot of
mistakes myself in my career fortunately
I had some things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
