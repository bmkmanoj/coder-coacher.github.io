just beginners my regular viewers know
the answer to this now I've seen the
courses a pop up where they say learn to
convert HTML to html5 now that's kind of
weird to me because html5 is just the
latest version of HTML and if you're
properly trained in the basic concepts
of HTML that markup language taking your
html5 your foresight I guess it would be
I'm bringing it to html5 should be a big
deal now some new tags you have to learn
some new structural tags I've been put
into place like footer and header and so
forth and the main if you do any modern
HTML course go teach you these things
but there's that a huge need to convert
things now if you're going from X HTML
and you want to go to html5 there's a
little bit more to it than that because
XHTML is actually xml's on HTML it's XML
which is another type of markup language
and it it's x8 XHTML says XML made to
kind of work like HTML but that is now
extinct you don't want to use that at
all and that you might have to do some
minor conversion but it's really pretty
trivial it's really pretty trivial just
change your doctype and you know maybe
that's pretty much it ain't your doctype
if you want to get rid religious about
it you can replace some divs with some
of the new tags in html5 but that's
beyond that is it's not imperative in
fact all the new browsers will be able
to read all code that's that's that's
the great thing about the web browsers
they are pretty forgiving especially if
you just have well-formed code if any of
this doesn't make any sense you need to
do a good beginners web design course
that teaches you proper HTML 5 and the
other supporting languages all right I
hope that helps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
