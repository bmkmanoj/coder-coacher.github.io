studio Webb calm and other sites yeah
yeah will kill us ice and killer PHP but
I've recently we've a little while ago
we've launched a studio web thing so we
can't use the word killer because the
schools don't like that and I don't
blame the schools trust me I don't but
anyhow so in this video if your nerd
learning web programming and web design
you probably don't want to watch it it's
gonna bore you but if you're a teacher
who is teaching web design and web
programming these three tips might be
useful to you I've been teaching web
design programming since 2002 2003
something like that no 2002 through my
articles and my online videos my videos
are over seen around the world blah blah
blah for for over a decade now so it's
been a while and I've gotten feedback
from thousands and thousands of students
and over the years so I can give you
three big tips that will help you to
teach web design and web programming
effectively tip number one I'm just
gonna refer to my list here keep theory
to a minimum you don't want to drone on
and talk for 20 minutes half an hour
about some nerd theory most students are
just gonna fall asleep within 5-10
minutes depending on the age of course
the older the more dedicated they are
the more likely they're gonna pay
attention for longer but typically you
know we live in a youtube generation
where kids have shorter attention spans
to that point even within the studio web
system which is being used by k-12
schools and some colleges as well we are
going to be shrinking our videos and
lengths some are six seven eight minutes
of you know some but are 10 minutes and
what we're finding now if the in the
classrooms especially in the high school
and middle school you want to keep the
video lanes shortened so we're actually
going to be shortening all our videos to
under five minutes yeah the next thing
you want to do tip number two is less
theory more practical examples
so it should be a little bit of theory
more practical and especially when it
comes to writing code you really want to
have students write code you want them
to actually type it into keyboards or
even do little exercises all ready write
it out on paper I find personally when
you write stuff on paper it sticks in
the brain better but especially you know
when it comes to code you want them to
write code you want the code to be
evaluated you know in the case let's say
you were doing JavaScript you want the
code to be evaluated by the browser
engine so they can see their errors or
if you're using studio web the studio
web engine will evaluate the code and
they can see their errors and get
interaction because that's how you
really learn how to code is to actually
start writing the code yeah when it
comes to teaching anything I found over
the years that the split should be maybe
20% theory 80% practical 20% theory 80%
practical and that's the best way to do
it again from my experience and my final
tip is if you can try to have the
students build something somewhat
interesting now so people are doing that
at bay you see they build games stuff
that's cool but I think smaller simpler
but interesting things are cool so for
instance when we teach our PHP class all
week me when I teach my PHP class within
studio web or people by orbit my videos
outright what I try to do is I try to
get into real useable PHP right away I
don't go on forever about all the you
know the five different ways or the ten
different ways you can you can play with
a raise for instance or you know or all
the different aspects and variations
functions I teach them the bare minimum
and then we get into real things so for
instance I teach them a function what a
function does some of the built-in
functions in PHP and then immediately I
show them how to send an email with PHP
so they do something real right so on so
those are my three tips to review keep
the theory to a minimum otherwise you're
gonna have people following asleep use a
lot of practical examples my preferences
80/20 split 20
theory 80% practical and get them to
build things small little things quickly
as possible stuff ever to use see stuff
that they would use in the real world
and that's why with Studio Webb the
courses we're always trying to introduce
follow these rules and to get them to do
real things that you do in real life so
for instance with PHP they learn how to
process a form they learn how to send
the email with JavaScript you learn how
to validate forms they learn how to
activate the Dom and to have menus pop
up and that kind of stuff so there you
have it those are my three tips so if
you're teaching people code this is what
you want to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
