sights calm in this little V blog I'm
gonna answer a question that was between
recently and it's let me just read it
off the comment here Stefan I might be a
little off topic but for an absolute
beginner how do you feel about project
oriented learning by that I mean only
learning from projects you want to do as
opposed to learning how to code
traditionally from the beginning of
textbooks to screen so basically you're
saying you know do I have to go with the
textbook approach were they cover every
single detail about a language so let's
say we're talking about web development
web app development so you're looking at
the three key languages or of course
HTML CSS and JavaScript and if you want
to get into programming apps that
interact with a web server then I of
course recommend a PHP of all there's
many other languages out there
environments there's Java Java and
judgment they're not the same keep that
in mind
there's Ruby Eaters Python or Staunton
that there's others you know so yeah so
what's the best approach I'm a big
believer and project-based training but
you can't jump into projects straight
away you still need some sort of basic
understanding of the underlying
languages that's the HTML the CSS
JavaScript and and you need that basic
understanding of the underlying
technology understanding how the web
works itself the request response cycle
client versus server computers these
sorts of things
any decent course on web development
basics is going to cover these things
now again I don't believe in going over
every in the case of HTML for example I
don't believe in going over every single
tag in the HTML universe this is
pointless
the way to approach teaching and
learning this stuff is to figure out
what are the important aspects of the
language or a technology to focus on
those important concepts and then knows
important parts of this technology and
then quickly as possible getting to
projects the best way to approach that
of course is to start with many projects
so that's how I do it personally I've
been teaching this stuff since 2000 to
2003 I don't remember the exact date
somewhere between there somewhere but
anyway so what I would do for instance I
was teaching HTML I teach you the basics
of what a web page is what tags are
teach you some basic tags but I would
concentrate on the key topics breaking
them down making making them
approachable and simple and then I would
teach some of the basic tags not all the
tags not all the rules just the
important one so you can move forward
and then once you have that base then
you can get into projects but even as I
am teaching that base to you I'm
actually doing mini projects if you will
so for instance I might teach you about
nested tags in HTML something very
simple and but I would show you how to
do that of course with a list tag and I
show you how to use lists and how to
build a little list inside of your pages
so it's kind of a mini project in there
if you will but you're actually learning
practical skills but you're also
learning something conceptually but once
you have that basis that basics down and
you understand what tags are and pages
are and so on and how to create websites
then we get into a bigger broader
project of course so let's fast forward
let's say it was teaching you a language
a programming language like JavaScript
there's something a JavaScript called a
function now what I would do
I wouldn't teach you every single thing
about functions because there's a lot to
learn but you don't need to know all
these things that's where it important
that's a one important thing about
having a good teacher somebody who who
not only knows how to break something
down into their simple components but
also somebody who understands the
language it has experience using the
language in the real world so that they
can identify the important aspects of
the language or the technology and just
teach you that so in the case of
functions you know I would break it down
I would say a function is like a mini
app inside of the JavaScript
because remember javascript is a written
coding language programming language but
it's also an app there is a JavaScript
app installed in every single web
browser in the world and the point of
this app is that it processes all that
JavaScript code because you remember
code all computer code doesn't matter
what language it is HTML CSS and then
you got programming languages like
JavaScript Java etc the point of code is
just to tell the computer what to do
it's a set of instructions so when
you're writing JavaScript code for
example you're writing instructions that
the JavaScript app will process for you
so going back to functions functions are
just mini apps built into JavaScript and
you can also create your own functions
as well and functions of course is short
for functionality they provide
functionality they are mini apps inside
of JavaScript there's all kinds of rules
that go along with that so I would teach
this you know I'll just give you a
little snapshot of how I would teach
functions and then I would teach you
some basic functions that are built in
to be a JavaScript application image app
app and then I'll teach you how to build
your own functions and then we would do
something practical we might do
something like I don't know validate a
form to check to see somebody put in
their name or their email address
properly etc etc etc once you have that
basics though once you have that basis
rather and you understand the basics of
the language then we would get into some
real stuff right away I'm a big advocate
of project-based learning apartment
because I've been teaching the stuff
since 2:02 2:03 sigh steno you learn
over the years how to teach properly and
secondly it's from my martial art
background did a lot of martial arts
2530 years a lot of ring fighting as
well and one thing I learned is once the
student has a basic knowledge of how to
punch properly kick properly etc you
want to get them in the ring right away
sparring because that's you know one
month of sparring is worth probably ten
months of of hitting pads and doing
drills so yeah project-based learning
yes but you still need some
he fundamental understanding and again
that's where a good teacher comes in
they break down those key elements of a
language or technology and they they're
knowledgeable enough and have practical
real knowledge in the technology so that
they can identify what parts of the
language they should teach the important
parts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
