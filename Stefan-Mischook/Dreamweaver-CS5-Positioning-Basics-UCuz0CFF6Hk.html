working with tables and we've discussed
how that's an older method of dealing
with layout now before we actually get
into some concrete examples of how to
achieve layout ourselves by using CSS
and most specifically by using something
called an ID which we haven't seen as
yet so we'll get to that eventually but
right now we are familiar with things
like classes so I just want to talk to
you a little bit about working with
different types of positioning for
example I'm going to come over here and
I'm going to just write out the word
absolute me and we're going to select
this object and format it as a paragraph
alright so you know very simply we've
got our paragraph nothing fancy in here
and let's go about creating a very
simple custom class one that will
actually go about creating the absolute
positioning that we want to achieve and
I'll tell you a little bit more about
what that is first let's go to the View
menu and let's turn on our rulers if you
don't already have them showing so as
you can see the top left-hand corner of
my design view let's just go to the
design view is represented as 000 on the
x-axis and 0 on the y-axis and you'll
notice that as things increase on the
well actually this might look like
decreasing if you're familiar with high
school algebra but at this point it's
really quite simply something that you
know will go down and it will increase
the value or the number of that
particular amount so if I were to say
here back in the split screen view if I
wanted to have this object you'll notice
that by default there's a little bit of
you know padding inside this body tag so
it's pushing it off but as we can see
here that's the default positioning for
this particular you know paragraph if I
wanted to I could create a new CSS rule
and we'll put it in this document only
again something I would never recommend
you do in any other circumstance this is
just to explain a very simple little
effect here so I'll make a custom class
and i'll call it
absolut and what I'm going to do is go
to positioning and Cey absolute
positioning there we go and here in the
placement area you could say you know
move it so much from the top so much
from the right but look if I were to
just by default say 0 top 0 on the left
and click ok now we would have to select
this element and we would have to apply
the absolute class to it and check it
out now it's sort of being determined by
this box here as you can see and you
could even move this now this is
actually really quite cool if you were
to select this and as you can see here
I've got left positioning top
positioning and look what happens once
you have this defined in Dreamweaver you
can just go around moving your object
and positioning it where you want to now
that might seem amazingly cool and like
oh my gosh that's exactly what I was
waiting for that's one way that you can
work with positioning but it's often
times doesn't really give you the best
results so as you'll see there's sort of
like a mix of relative and a supposed to
absolute positioning where you could use
relative positioning to work with your
pages and something called float based
designs now we're going to be doing an
amazing look at we're going to be taking
an amazingly long look at working with
flow-based positioning because i'm going
to show you how to do a two column and a
three column fixed or liquid based
layout and as you'll see that will be
described in full detail a little bit
later but this is what absolute means ok
also let's take note of something else
if I were to say exit that paragraph as
you can see here and create another
paragraph and you know just to say
relative me and if I was to do that
you'll notice that number one even
though the absolute appears before it in
the code view what's happening inside of
our view over here well relative comes
first absolutely comes second because
I'm absolutely positioning
it somewhere on this page right so as
you can see I can even put it on top
which is kind of gross but nevertheless
it gives you an idea of what it's doing
it's removing it from the regular flow
of things right so the regular flow of
things here it says relative and you
know I could have yet another paragraph
and another paragraph and you'll see
them all here in the code but absolute
is supposed to be the first one but it's
removed it's almost like you just popped
it out of the regular flow of the HTML
environment all right well let's say
relative me is something that I want to
do by creating another class called
relative and relative just basically
means well look right now it's
positioned in a specific spot I'm going
to go to positioning i'm going to say
relative now i'm going to say relative
to where it should be right now i want
you to push it down maybe 20 pixels or
let's make it really noticeable 200
pixels i want you to push it over the
left hand side from where it's supposed
to be right now another 200 pixels as
well so if i click ok if i select this
relative me text that we have here and
then i apply the class in here called
relative me look what happened to this
one relative to where it was supposed to
be which was right around here it's now
been moved 200 pixels down from the top
and you could see it their relative to
where it's supposed to be and 200 pixels
over again relative to where it's
supposed to be so it's as you can see
it's got the default so that's how
relative positioning works so when you
come back we're going to be discussing a
little bit more about working with flow
based designs and we'll take a look at
how we should really go about creating
our web pages and making them look much
more stable and in a much better
situation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
