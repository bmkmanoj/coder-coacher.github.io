lead
but Python and Ruby are coming out of
the gates here comes JavaScript
easy to be having a little bit of
trouble with JavaScript all it's a
package conflict c-sharp Java C++ are
not out yet they're still writing the
code still writing the code here comes
the sharpen Java
we got a late entrance swift switch new
language got all kinds of optimizations
you're still writing that C++ code all
right it's compiled
hey guys in programming programming
languages you have three ways you can
measure their speed three ways you can
measure their speed just like in martial
arts and fighting there's a couple of
ways at least and you could argue three
ways you can measure speed in fighting
the three ways while these two is the
physiological speed number one that's
the miles per hour speed in terms of how
fast you can you control punch or a kick
or whatever then you have timing speed
timing speed allows you to time your
opponent's properties so even though you
may not move as physically as fast of
them as fast as them using timing speed
you could beat them to the punch
pun intended and then there's tactical
speed by using tactics properly in a
fight you can actually maneuver more
quickly more efficiently than somebody
you may actually have naturally faster
hands than you so there's three types of
speed yes or three types of speed in
fighting you got the physiological speed
you got the timing speed and you got the
tactical speed timing speed and tackle
tactical speed can be used to easily
overcome somebody who is naturally
physiologically faster Venu alright back
to programming in programming there's
three ways to look at the speed of the
language there's speed of writing it how
much code you need to write to actually
get something to happen
so for example Java great language I
like the extractor of it was my favorite
language back in the day it's a very
verbose language meaning you have to
write a lot of code to get anything done
versus say a more nimble language like
JavaScript or PHP or Python Ruby a swift
Java is just a very long-winded language
that's why you see a lot of the Java
work today is for legacy work older work
they do it for Android but now because
Java is long winded and verbose people
are now going to start looking at Kotlin
for writing native apps for Android as
opposed to using Java
just like in the iOS world Apple came up
with Swift because objective-c which is
the language for traditionally you would
use the create iOS apps and Mac OS apps
a little long and a tooth again a
long-winded language Java asked if you
will so speed of writing is a very
important part very important thing to
consider when writing code in fact
experienced developers will always tell
you that they would prefer to use a
nimbler language and turns out writing
to at write time when you're writing it
that may be a little slower at runtime
we'll get into that in a second versus
versus doing the opposite so that's why
Kotlin I don't know if it's good
actually might run just as fast as Java
when it compiles down but we'll look at
Python Python in the AI world a lot of
top AI guys they would write the core
engine for an AI and C++ but then they
would use Python and do everything else
so 5% of their application would be in
C++ the rest is all in Python why
because they said if they did it all in
C++ it would take 800,000 years to
complete so again right time speed
writing time speed if you will is very
very very important versus runtime so
you got write time speed then you have
deployment speed or ease of deployment
if you will whatever reasons I jaw
dropped Java in the day beyond the fact
that was very verbose language took
10,000 lines to do HelloWorld
it was that deployment was a real pain
in the butt as well it was you had to
compile yeah then you had to upload you
have to stop and start the app server it
was just a pain especially if you're
doing many deployments
whereas with nimble language like Python
and PHP because it's just you know it's
it's a it's not compiled you just upload
done it's it's it's running right PHP is
a king especially when it comes to web
apps PHP if you want to get your PHP up
and run he's uploaded boom it's done
it's it's pretty cool that way so yeah
so you got writing speed right time
speed you got deployment speed and the
final speed of course is runtime speed
how fast does the actual
run when it's actually running as a
program or as an app Java will run of
course faster than Python or Ruby or PHP
and C++ code run much faster than just
about any other language you got 4 C
maybe you get the idea so you got also
runtime speed to consider now here's the
great thing because computers and
servers are getting so fast these days
like our smartphones today like the
average flagship smartphone is far more
powerful computer than a very powerful
laptop from just five years ago four
years ago so as time goes by for most
apps runtime speed the speed at which
your code runs when the app is actually
being used is becoming less and less and
less and less important and in fact for
most apps these days I would argue maybe
99% of apps 98% of apps these days
runtime speed is really not too
important because servers are just so
fast and programming languages even the
slow ones are so performant these days
so for me when I look at languages in
terms of the business perspective I'm
much more concerned about right time
speed meaning I'd rather use light
nimble languages at right time and
deployment speed if you will deployment
ease you know and less concern about
runtime not no concern I didn't say that
and say there's no consider front time
speed but less concerned because of the
things I just mentioned
I hope this talk makes sense
