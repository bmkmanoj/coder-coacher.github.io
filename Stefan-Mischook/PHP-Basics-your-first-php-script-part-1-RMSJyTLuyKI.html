completed we've installed the web server
using zamp or WAMP
or you have your own hosting service set
up and ready to go
what we're going to do in this video is
actually write our very first PHP script
we're going to look at some basic PHP
rules and this will create the
foundation and from here we can get into
the meat of PHP programming
so the first thing you want to do is
open up a text enter something like
notepad or simple edit on on Mac or if
you have a program like micrometer true
Macromedia Dreamweaver well now it's
Adobe Dreamweaver you can use that to
write your PHP code it doesn't really
matter what you use as long as you can
write text inside of a document you
don't want to use something like
Microsoft Word because it will try to
auto format the text so you want to use
something either designed to write HTML
or PHP code or you want to use something
very bare-bones and simple like like
notepad on windows or like something
that BBEdit on Mac
I'm going to be using Dreamweaver MX
2004 simply because I have it installed
here and it actually makes PHP editing
simpler than it might otherwise be
because it comes with some built-in PHP
buttons that allows me to insert PHP
code very easily but you don't need
these to do what we're going to be doing
actually you don't need any of this
stuff to write PHP called . there's
actually many PHP programmers out there
and programmers and many other languages
that prefer to use very simple tools so
that they have total control this is a
taste issue personally I think a little
automation along the way to help speed
up the process in terms of writing your
code comes in handy
with all that said let's start by
inserting a block of PHP code now I'm
just going to click the insert code
block button with Dreamweaver and it
pops it in for me but you can just type
this by hand now as we cover briefly in
another video PHP code blocks always
start with the angled bracket the
question mark the word PHP and it closes
with the question mark and the angled
bracket you notice that there has to be
no space between the question mark and
the text PHP just hit the backspace here
and there should be no space here as
well this has to be touching but in
terms of between this first tag here in
this closing tag here you can have all
kinds of space if you'd like as long as
they're not touching so you can't have
this
but anything like this or like this it
doesn't really matter it will work fine
now this opening and this closing tag
here forms what you would call a PHP
code block and basically what that means
is that any code any text that you type
in between these tags the PHP engine
will assume that you're writing PHP code
you can think of it like a standard HTML
tag I'll make some room whereas we have
our body tag which is opening and a
closing body tag and anything in between
those two tags is interpreted by the
browser which is another type of engine
it's a cold processing engine if you
will it's interpreted by the browser as
being HTML code that's going to display
be displayed in the main page so same
thing goes with the PHP tags except in
this case What's in between the PHP tags
is PHP code as far as the PHP
interpreter is concerned
so our next step is to actually write a
little bit of PHP so as we're going
along before I go on as we're going
along feel free to pause the video and
actually type in the code as we go it's
very important when you're learning how
to program but you actually follow along
and type the code and actually do things
you want to see mistakes happen you want
to you want to get your hands dirty if
you will it's it's cool and it's alright
if you just want to sit and watch for
now
but you're not gonna really learn until
you do wait having said that let's
actually type in a very simple PHP I'm
just gonna save that HelloWorld is the
classic first thing that you do when
you're learning a new language every new
language does it so I figure what Moz
will do it here so let's look at a
couple of things with this particular
line of code first thing we should
notice is we have the print command here
now print is a built-in thing we'll just
call it a thing for now they're actually
called a it's actually called a function
it's a built-in tool or mechanism in PHP
that basically
prints things to the page so when I
print when I say print hello world I'm
telling PHP to print out the text hello
world
PHP knows it's text because there's a
quote there are double quotes around the
text now nerds will call texts strings
you can think of this as a string of
text there's a string of text because
there's one piece of text followed by
another it's strung along so oftentimes
you're gonna hear programmers refer to
strings so now you know when you're
talking about strings are actually
talking about text now a string could be
any length it could be actually a string
could be just one letter or it could be
pages and pages long again back here we
got this built-in function and again a
function is thing that is built into PHP
that performs an action
and in this case this function is
printing the text or as nerds will save
a string hello world into a web page
you'll notice the semicolon which I just
highlighted at the end of this line of
PHP code semicolons in PHP have a very
particular meaning they basically act as
a period as far as the PHP engine is
concerned essentially when PHP when this
pages gets processed by the PHP engine
it hits this code block it goes up okay
this is some PHP and then hey and then
it continues down and hits and sees is
the print command so then it prints out
this line of text and when it sees a
semicolon it knows about this particular
command the print command is finished so
then it goes on to the next line and you
might have you might have other print
commands or all kinds of other functions
and all kinds of other things you can do
I just want you understand that the
semicolon acts like a period in the PHP
language it just tells the PHP engine
the interpreter that this is the end of
this particular PHP command in this case
is the print command I know I'm
repeating myself many times I'm doing it
on purpose that sort of drone a point
another word that people might refer to
commands it would calm statements as if
you're making a statement to the engine
so I'm stating to the engine print this
so oftentimes and PHP books or when
other programmers are talking about
things or taught those speak speak of
statements so now you know what
statements are
so let's save this very simple page and
we actually preview this using lampur
zap using a web browser and we're gonna
actually see what PHP does
here I've launched Firefox and you
notice I'm at the 127.0.0.1 s that
universal address of my own computer and
I'm in web 5 and since we're here when
you load up one 5 at the local host
address this is what you call the root
because I'm not in any subdirectories
lamp pulls up this very useful page and
you see here besides the tools that you
can access you have a list of the
projects now these are websites but I've
created within the web subfolder let me
jump into that and you see what I mean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
