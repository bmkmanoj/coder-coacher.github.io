an ambitious video ten languages
discussed just to give you an overview
because people are always asking what do
you think of this what do you think it
would even use C++ what do you think of
C what do you think of prepped Python
where you think of Ruby what do you
think of sleuth so I'm going to give you
a quick overview of I don't know about
ten languages now super quickly
understand how they're used what type of
business what type of work that they do
so you can make a decision as to what
you want to focus in at this particular
moment in time so we'll start off with C
C++ these are lower-level languages what
I mean by lower-level meaning they're
closer to the CPU what does that mean it
means basically it run really really
fast so people use C and C++ to create
either little apps that control devices
like watches or thermostats or something
devices that don't have a lot of
horsepower don't have a lot of CPU so
you need a very fast efficient language
so when you're writing C C++ code you're
writing for those kind of devices you
may be writing a gaming engine like D I
think the Unreal Engine or something or
whatever it is there's all these gaming
engines any type of very high
performance program will be written in
these languages so these languages are
not great for freelancers these
languages or for people who I don't want
to look work for a company these are
languages that are used to build
software that is not client facing what
is that what does that mean that means
that these are either writing software
if it's not actually people don't
interact with there's going to be no
views typically well having exceptions
you know we would write apps like Adobe
Photoshop or something in C++ but you
would have to go work at Adobe or
something so you understand C++ C you're
working for big companies big
corporations usually for high
performance requirement required
programs and apps okay all right let's
get into the next one
Java Java was invented to make it easier
to write code of easier than C++ there's
a bunch of things bunch of bookkeeping a
bunch of things you have to manage with
C++ that you don't have to manage with
Java the downside with Java is that it
is slow compared
C++ it runs really slow but for many
many types of that many business apps
Java runs plenty fast and has plenty
capable what the big advantage with Java
is that it's easier to write in some
respects of C++ and it gets the job done
faster especially for type of apps like
web apps and stuff you would have read
in a web app and C++ you could but it
would be it'd be crazy it would take you
forever to do it you do it in Java much
much quicker much quicker indeed GI was
also used in Android development as well
although that might be fading because
there's a new snizhne blur faster
language called Kotlin I think it is
that Google has endorsed and it's it's
easier and faster to write with Colin
over Java so Java may fade in terms of
being used to create apps for Android
devices but today Java is used hugely
for legacy apps legacy apps that are
web-based and server based again working
for very large corporations and the most
popular framework which is basically a
giant library loose loosely it's the
library is called spring so if you're
doing Java probably be doing Java spring
with the spring framework or you might
be doing Java for Android development
there's other uses for Java but those
are I think the dominant uses so Java
again easier to write in certain
respects of an C C++ but it runs much
slower but it's also has more
flexibility in other ways as well since
you're getting this right things really
really quickly alright let's jump into
python python general-purpose language
you think Java runs slow woohoo Python
runs really slow nonetheless python is
really easy to learn really easy to
write easier than Java so see yeah it's
kind of abstract super fast but it's
hard you got to write a lot of code and
take care of a lot of bookkeeping if you
want to get anything done C++ a little
easier a little faster not faster but
faster right but still still super fast
with us running Java much slower but
easier to write thing with C++ and C
when you write that code it's for one
platform so you write an app in C++ it
runs so Windows doesn't run on Mac
you're gonna have to rewrite it for Mac
blah blah blah blah with Java the theory
is you write it once Java it runs all
over the place so I'm Mac on Windows
wherever it runs that's one of the
advantages of Java Python pretty much
the same thing as well
it runs on different operating systems
Linux Windows Mac excetera it's used a
lot in machine learning
robotics it's used in web scraping
server automation it's one of those
general-purpose languages means use all
replaced easy to learn the syntax of
code that you actually write is actually
pretty readable pretty human readable
much easier to get going with Python
than it is with Java but it's very slow
at runtime but computers are so fast
these days and for certain types of
applications X or aspects of machine
learning certain app aspects of AI
certain web apps it's plenty fast it
does a job with switch over next
language javascript javascript ho not
related to java in any way it is a
different type of language it's a it's a
scripting language what does that mean
it's kind of more of a lightweight
language so you can get stuff even
faster JavaScript was invented to add
programming capabilities to web browsers
and that's at around the same time as
Java in 1995 94 something like that
because 95 and Java has now been
transported moved to two server with
this engine called Noah Jaso JavaScript
actually runs really fast and it's used
for
does a really good job of messaging
system so let's use quite a bit there
javascript was one of those essential
languages if you're doing web stack
you're learning JavaScript in some form
or another so that's another language
you could use and you're looking at Java
you're looking at writing client facing
web apps that's what it is you could
also use it to create mobile apps use
with the help of the react native
library but I don't want to go into too
many details but now you know what you
have Script basically does you're doing
the web and it's more client oriented
type of code as opposed to writing the
code that manages a clock that that's
what C or C++ would do okay let's talk
jump to the next language PHP PHP is a
server-side programming scripting
language and it's gets a lot of bad
press because of old versions of PHP let
me just say for the record today PHP 7
plus is just as capable as any other
programming language and I would say for
freelance developers web developers
rather it is the language PHP is use 99%
at a time to do web app web app
development so Facebook is create with
PHP as an example this primitive biggest
example so PHP can produce huge apps but
it's used quite a bit I think 80 to 90
well 80 odd percent of business websites
are run on PHP think about 80 percent
but part of that reason is because
WordPress is created with PHP WordPress
is Joomla is Drupal is they're all
creative PHP and so many shopping cart
systems etc etc are created with PHP so
PHP is huge so if you want to do
freelancing you want to build small apps
PHP I think is the best choice because
of not just the fact that it's easy to
approach it's very powerful it's very
refined at this point but it runs really
fast like in terms of runtime terms of
when it runs PHP is far faster in Python
far faster than Ruby which is another
language that's used for create web apps
so PHP is another option that you have
open to you all right let's talk about
Swift Apple Swift
Apple came up to Swift language I
believe in 2014 and why did he come up
with Swift
a light nimble language which is kind of
Python like not exactly Python but it's
Python like in that it's light nimble
easy to read that they wanted something
to replace their old Objective C
Objective C is kind of a flavor of C and
it's heavy-duty it can be a pain in the
butt to program Objective C so this is
for writing iOS apps and Mac o has apps
so they came up with Swift which is
their answer to writing really fast to
write apps really quickly for iOS or for
Mac OS now here's the thing two
important things about Swiss Swift was
open source by Apple meaning anybody can
start contributing to it so I BM took it
up and now iBM is doing some pretty cool
stuff using Swift to create services
based server-side services you have to
go look that know basically iBM is
looking at a new style of web app using
Swift as the backbone why Swift cuz it's
easy to write etc but here's the cool
thing about Swift it's super fast it's
nearly as fast as c plus plus that means
swift at runtime is faster then much
faster than Java my shots from PHP much
faster than Ruby much faster and Python
metric might roster in JavaScript
probably I'd have to check that but it
prevents super super fast so that's the
advantage of Swift on the server is
still kind of very nice she right now is
just beginning and who knows if it's
actually going to go anywhere I'm
recording of us a 2018 so right now if
you learn Swift you're basically just
doing iOS apps for for it but
nonetheless it is out there all right
SQL SQL is kind of a strange languages
it's a 4gl language fourth-generation
language g io generation language SQL is
the language of relational databases the
most popular type of database out there
there are many relational databases out
there there's MySQL server
there's Microsoft sequel server or SQL
Server
there's Oracle there's post-grad may
many SQL based databases or other words
otherwise called relational databases
SQL is the universal language of these
databases and SQL is used to actually
talk to date database is used to
and request two databases update the
databases read from the database delete
records from the database it's a simple
language it's actually designed to be
easy to read and write reads like human
so and the four basic operations of SQL
language is credits create read update
delete these are for operations these
are for things you do to databases
remember a database is just a program
that holds information stores
information is a base of data data as a
nerd word for information so crud is
create you create a record you know a
story this guy bought two apples you
read a record and you read from the
database how many apples did he buy you
update the record he's gonna buy an
extra two apples and you delete the
records not gonna buy any apples he's
had enough so that's the crud operations
so you see that like in my course I have
a crud course I teach you how to do
those basics and guess what the vast
majority of time when you're doing with
apps web apps especially any
client-facing apps apps that people
interact with you're storing the
information at some point you got to
save it right somebody creates a
document somebody creates an order on
Amazon etc etc etc this information have
to be safe a lot of the times it's saved
to a relational database and that's
where SQL comes in so if you're doing
any type of web programming there's a
99% chance you're going to learn SQL
great thing about SQL you don't have to
be a super wizard in it and it's
actually pretty easy to learn the last
language are going to cover there's so
many other languages but this is the
last language you're going to cover
because I think these are the ones
you're going to mostly run into c-sharp
c-sharp is a Microsoft language for the
microsoft.net platform you use Microsoft
c-sharp to write things like web apps
using asp.net which is their framework
for writing web apps so if you don't
know what that is don't worry about it
basically a c-sharp could be used to
write web apps it could be used to write
Microsoft apps for Windows it could be
used to create games and engines I think
certain engines will I use
games with c-sharp I forget the name of
the engine you can look I think unity is
the name I don't do that kind of
programming so I'm not too familiar with
it so c-sharp is another viable option C
sharp is a language that freelance gigs
again maybe doing some freelance web
apps with asp.net and C sharp mostly
alert but I think what c-sharp would
like so many of the other languages
you're going to be working for a company
typically but c-sharp it's kind of a
general-purpose language but I think
it's morally mainly if you're doing work
with Microsoft products and that's it
where's Java does we discuss that PHP is
the king for freelance I'll talk about
Ruby quickly Ruby is that a clever
little language about 20 years old as
well and it's used largely for web app
creation using the Rails framework but
it's slowly falling into nish there's
still jobs high paying jobs with
rooby-roo is a great language I'm not
critical of any of these languages
technically by the way they all have
their strengths and their weaknesses and
they all have their use cases meaning
there's certain places where Ruby would
do better and certain pages where PHP
would do better but the fact that
matters Ruby had its heyday in the mid
2000s I think 2007 2008 that's when it
peaked it's been a slow decline because
all the new hipster nerds are moving
into JavaScript and PHP is super
dominant for the small business space
80% of websites dynamic sites are
powered by PHP for enterprise or big
huge organizations you're either looking
at asp.net c-sharp or you're looking at
Java so for machine learning you're
looking at Python
maybe if yeah for Python and you're
maybe C C++ for machine learning where
they create the engines and C++ and
maybe they work with Python to do that
so much information in this vlog but it
was just designed to give you a quick
overview so you understand where each of
these languages stand in the marketplace
when you're looking at a language you're
looking at any technology don't just
consider the technical nerd arguments
try to consider the lifestyle arguments
what does this language do for your life
where does it take you in terms of the
type of work job or business
opportunities I hope that helps but my</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
