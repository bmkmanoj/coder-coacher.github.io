Florida near Miami to lose a friend
partly for vacation also to talk about
and look at his new app that he just
developed with his team and it's an app
that I can't get into too many details
because of business reasons but
essentially it's an app that does a lot
of complex reporting and a lot of
handles a lot of complexities that
typically engineers would handle and he
has been an engineer in this field for
quite a long time and so he saw an
opportunity to automate the process and
really disrupt the entire industry and
this is a classic example of two-phase
well number one where I've mentioned in
previous vlogs that having domain
knowledge knowledge of a particular
domain can help a lot in terms of your
ability to see an opportunity to
leverage coding skills to automate
certain processes within that particular
domain so this guy in particular works
as an engineer and I won't get into
specifics because of business reasons
but he saw a huge opportunity so I
mentioned I mentioned this because I've
talked to people who come to the blog or
send me emails whatnot they may have
experience in marketing or accounting or
biology pick whatever domain whatever
field you like and they're wondering if
coding might help and or whether they
should learn to code in their 30s or
early 40s and I say yes because with
that domain knowledge behind you you
will be a very interesting person to
hire or to work with because not only
will you have that domain knowledge
you'll have that coding skills and you
be able to marry those two together
which could be a very powerful
combination as my friend Justin now he's
doing it he's launched the business off
of it and he's picking up clients so on
so forth
the other interesting thing about this
app is that it was created with two
languages it was created well there's
two parts to it there is the web app
part of it that was created with PHP but
the AI component and that's the other
part of this he leverages AI is custom
AI was built with Python of course so
you see a classic example most web apps
are not not most all web apps are
creative multiple languages coding and
programming languages so you have of
course HTML and CSS you're always going
to have JavaScript and then in terms of
server-side it depends where you want to
go could be dotnet c-sharp could be Java
could be JavaScript with node it could
be PHP it could be Python on the server
but then you have particular languages
that are very good at particular tasks
so in the case of AI if you're going to
write AI you're going to do in Python so
he has a PHP web app that is sending
requests to if you will is sending
information to the Python based AI the
Python based AI does its job sends back
the results to the PHP app to PHP apps
and displays these results this is an
example of how Python is used in
conjunction with other programming
languages to get the job done so the big
picture in all this is that you see how
AI is starting to transform entire
industries it's just at the very
beginning but you can expect to see this
happen more and more and more and more
which will have two problems first is
going to be dislocation people's jobs
will be lost unfortunately but that will
open up a huge amount of opportunity as
well don't worry coders are going to be
lost ago they may go in 25 years 30
years when the true AI starts really
coming in but so I would be too
concerned about it as a coder at this
point but the first jobs are going to be
the simple jobs you for sure like in the
next four years you're going to have all
the sub
that's weird the phone fell in the next
five years you're going to have the
self-driving level-5 fully autonomous
vehicles which is going to really hurt
well it's going to end truck driving and
deliveries and all this kind of stuff
that's going to really be nailed you can
have much greater automation so they
have to learn to be more nimble in terms
of what we do
learning to code is a big part of it
developing good communication skills
written and verbal is a big part of it
so it's yeah that's it for that for that
now I just want to close off where
people may be worried about AI in
robotics in that it's going to mean
Terminator and all this kind of stuff I
don't think that's going to be the case
I think it's going to be opposite
history teaches us that as technology
enters into our lives the cost of
everything drops and the quality quality
of life increases so I think what's
going to happen and they're already
talking about in many different
countries about universal basic income
they're going to have to do it and
they're going to have to provide
universal basic income this is not the
same as welfare or communism simply
because in a communist situation where
you still needed people to work and when
nobody's everybody getting paid and
there's no incentive to work harder then
productivity drops and everything falls
apart in the world of AI and robotics
you don't have that problems because
robots don't get tired they don't get
lazy robots don't go on strike etc you
know productivity doesn't follow robots
in fact it's quite the opposite throw on
top of that AI and then it's like it's
like almost like a Star Trek world now
this is going to take time to evolve I
don't know how many years could be 10
years 15 years who knows but that's
where it's going but anyway I just you
know I you know I don't have a crystal
ball so I don't know all outcomes but if
you look at history you can see that in
western and advanced societies the very
poor today are living much better off
and very very
400 years ago like much better off and I
of course you know his variations and so
off so on from country to country but I
have a friend of mine who I went to high
school with and he's basically become a
bum and but he gets his welfare as he
calls it his welfare and he has a nice
apartment he's got a high-speed Internet
he's got a 50 inch LCD display TV
it's got computers and he's able to
watch all the who is he why he's
entertained and he fooled is relatively
cheap and so you know he actually
probably lives a better life than many
of the very wealthy people from a
hundred years ago 150 years ago
definitely Perot deafening definitely
have been in life so you know take this
and put it on steroids take this and you
know qubit in terms because when AI
comes into place and robotics really
starts to roll out in a big way the cost
of everything is will be so inexpensive
so - how's my lazy bum friend like I
will say his name to put them in a nice
place and give them all the services
won't cost society hardly anything if
anything if since robots in AI are going
to be doing all the work anyway it's
nothing that's right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
