and job availability this is something I
saw in one of the comments the guy said
you know all the Nerds all the
programmers are all excited about know
lots of buzz on the web about Noah but
when he went looking for jobs there were
no node jobs I don't know how many no
jobs there are out there I have the
impression there's far fewer than you
would think in the world because frankly
you know it is brand-new and in my
opinion except for some very specific
use cases meaning a very specialized
situation where node is superior there's
not much advantage to using node over
more traditional web app server side
programming languages so node is not a
language it's a framework it's an engine
but it is coded with JavaScript and the
big appeal of militares people say wow
you write your front-end code your
browser programming with JavaScript so
why not use JavaScript for the backend
fair enough but at the end of the day if
you're doing web apps you're gonna be
doing HTML CSS JavaScript for sure and
then some back-end language the nature
of the web is that it is multilingual
yeah multilingual so it yes 0 5 and css3
are certainly not programming languages
once a markup language html5 css3 is a
styling language and JavaScript of
course is a programming language now
some people love JavaScript some people
don't like JavaScript at all Java
scripts got some weird behavior relative
to other languages and in fact I would
say a Java Script is not necessarily the
best first programming language to learn
because it's got some weird behavior if
I could trip up beginners don't get me
wrong I love JavaScript and it was my
since my second language I've learnt in
fact so it's cool again as I always say
when you're considering a programming
language or a framework
nodes the framework nodes the engine was
the framework I would always look at the
job
tee's to determine well to play major
role in terms of whether or not you want
to become an expert in a particular
framework or language programming node
based apps is very different from
programming I don't know whatever Python
ai you know it's so that's a big factor
I talked about choosing languages and
technologies in a previous vlog so I'm
just going to get to the steps the three
steps in terms of determining nodejs
node in JavaScript and whether or not
you're going to do node in JavaScript so
number one step one do a basic language
course first so if you're new to
programming and you just heard a lot of
buzz about node before you make that big
decision you should know first of all
the decision of your first programming
learning language that you learn is not
super important because if you learn
let's say JavaScript and then do some
node and you see that there's no jobs in
your area or you don't really like it
it's not time lost because what you're
gonna see is 95% of what you learn in
JavaScript is applicable to Python PHP
Ruby c-sharp Java etc so you're not
really losing anything by learning a
language so it's not like you're going
down the path you you can't return from
so don't be so concerned about your
choosing your choice of a programming
language it's not super important
because you're not losing really step
two you should look at the job market
where you want to work now you may be
living in somewhere in the UK and you
may want to end up in California so look
at the job market for node and
JavaScript programmers in California if
you wanted to move there to see what the
requirements are how many people are
doing node work and JavaScript work very
important that you look at the job
market before you invest so much time
into a particular framework
this is beyond learning basics as I
described step number one step number
three as I mentioned in previous vlogs
consider the type of work that you want
to do
you may find that nodejs work is just
not for you you may prefer writing PHP
apps using a wordpress base well not
really a PHP app but you may be you may
prefer working with small businesses
doing WordPress work very lucrative I
talk about that because a lot of people
have this weird negative few feeling
about PHP not realizing that there's so
much working PHP because so many small
businesses depend on PHP and WordPress
so keep that in mind so step one do a
basic language course doesn't that be it
doesn't have to be mine but just to get
a feel for programming if you don't know
programming doesn't matter what language
you choose javascript you do Python or
PHP whatever language you want just
choose a language to learn it so you get
a feel for programming then look at the
job markets look at the job line make
sure there is an actual demand for the
type of coding that you want to do you
may love ActionScript for flash but
there's no flashing strip jobs pretty
much out there anymore so kind of stupid
to learning flash ActionScript today if
there's no jobs same thing with any
programming language or framework right
number three consider the type of work
that you want to do very important
because programming a gaming engine in
C++ a whole different type of
programming than writing PHP based
laravel apps which is a totally
different type of programming than
writing Python AI etc etc X earth so you
notice when speaking about the node and
j/s and jobs you notice how I'm not
paying too close attention to the merits
of the load engine and the JavaScript
language the every language framework
library has the strengths its weaknesses
generally speaking they're all pretty
good depending on circumstances that
being said a friend of mine who has a
company that's I think they're into six
million now in funding and it's an
educational app and they use a lot of
messaging so they built the messaging
component in node and they built the
rest of the app in PHP and what they
discovered after building in a node
is that node was in his about a year ago
they built this is immature had some
problems but they got it to work worked
fine but he said they could have done
pretty much the same thing with PHP
without all the node headaches I'm not
bashing node but I'm just trying to give
you perspective about how these
languages are really neck-and-neck and a
lot of times he'd perceived advantage of
her language of framework on library is
really minimal and highly specialized
anyway that's what I've seen over the
last twenty years of being a developer
