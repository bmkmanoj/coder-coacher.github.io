chapter 1 the basics chapter 1 is all
about basic nerd concepts that are
important to understand because knowing
them will make a learning web design
easier I don't want to put you to sleep
so we're going to try to get through
these things as quickly as possible
don't worry if you don't get things
right away because we will be talking
about them later on in the course so let
me give you a couple quick learning tips
if you miss something you can rewind a
video if I'm talking too slow because
join the video I'm going to be talking
at a piece that's kind of like this so
that everybody can pick it up then you
can just speed it up using the playback
controls and finally take some notes
take out a piece of paper and a pen or
paper and pencil or whatever and start
writing notes because by writing notes
it's going to help you to remember
things more easily it doesn't mean
you're gonna read your notes later on
but just writing it out you'll see it
helps a lot alright let's get to it so
what exactly is HTML HTML is a computer
language that is used to build websites
actually it's more important than that
it is the language that creates the
foundation it's the basic building block
language that is used to build websites
you can think of HTML kind of like
bricks on a house the house bricks form
the walls and the basic structure of
your house
that's what HTML does for a website
every single website in the world uses
HTML you have to use HTML to build a
website HTML is just one of three
languages that are used to build
websites today that includes HTML for
the basic building blocks then you have
CSS another computer language used to
make the site look good change colors of
fonts and so on and finally you have
something called JavaScript JavaScript
makes your webpages intelligent it
allows your pages to do things simple
things like checking to see if somebody
put in an email address properly or very
advanced things like creating
videogame right inside of a webpage so
what exactly is a computer language in a
nutshell a computer language is a
written language that gives instructions
to the computer
there are many computer languages out
there there's HTML CSS JavaScript Ruby
Python and many many more each of these
computer languages have their own
special thing that they do hTML is the
language for building websites</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
