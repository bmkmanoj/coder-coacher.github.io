get into freelancing while working for
another company and the short answer is
of course and that's actually what I
recommend before you go full-time as a
freelancer it's best to slowly work your
way into it because like any other
business
even with freelancing there is going to
be this inertia period the period where
it's gonna take a little bit time to get
your first good clients so you don't
want to be out there not making having
so you don't want to be out there not
earning anything you want to go out
there you want to have a flowing of
income from your current job and
meanwhile on four weekends and evenings
you start taking on small projects with
particular companies that you may run
across so it's gonna be slow in the
beginning unless you've got a lot of
contacts to begin with and that's cool
especially if you're learning the game
somebody else in another comment said
how as I told them it took two to three
two point three to two point five times
as long as they had initially judged to
do the project that's partly because you
know you're new and so you haven't you
have a hard time people tend to
underestimate the amount of time it
takes to do something especially if
you're new at the game where you haven't
done detailed project tracking in terms
of your time so he learned that and so
it's better to learn how to develop a
project with a third party client with a
client how to time it out properly how
to budget it properly in terms of time
there we go wow you still have some
money coming in so this could be a six
month transition from your full-time job
to going full-time as a freelancer it
could be a three month it could be a
year depending on the circumstances but
you have to understand that in the
initial stages of being a freelancer
there's always this like time between
you you know starting out and getting
your nice stable steady clients because
here's the reality of freelancing you
need to have at least three four clients
in your stable because you may start a
project with client a and then client a
will give you the images pictures will
give you the initial feedback that you
need and then client a will pay you a
certain amount upfront you should always
get payment upfront and then they'll
disappear for two months this is calming
because they get busy with this or bad
the other thing so you need a client B
and C and D so that you can rotate them
it's kind of like juggling balls so when
client a goes dormant you have work from
client B and C to do now what will
happen is though these clients will drop
in and out of existence if you will
depending on their particular workload
so having a stable of clients they have
a stable flow of income coming in is the
key to being a freelance well one of the
things you're going to do as a
freelancer one of the strategies that
you have to put into play so this takes
time to develop your ability to cost out
projects and time out projects takes
time so better to start with small
projects working on the side on the
weekends on the weeknights smaller
projects of course because if you're
working full time you can take on big
projects and this way you have income
coming in from your current job while
you develop a few sub skills and you
develop some reputation and you develop
some contacts in industry and you'll
know when you see you got enough
freelance steady work coming in to
replace your salary then you can leave
your job and just go pure freelance what
you might do at that point when you got
a pretty good stable of freelance
clients and you may go see your current
employer say listen I want to work 20
hours a week with you because I'm going
freelance and if they they complain
about that you don't can't do it then
you have your freelance clients you go
okay I'm sorry well I'm leaving two
weeks said you say bye you may find my
thing okay sure yeah that's cool we can
transition you out you can do 20 hours a
week a lot of people will probably
appreciate that to be honest with you
because they're going to want to
transfer your knowledge to other people
as you transfer out so there you go can
you do both at the same time yes and I
actually recommend it if you want to go
freelance and you're working for
somebody now
transition out slowly takes like small
side jobs on the weekends for weekends
and for night work remember when you're
a freelancer you don't have to do to
work at any particular time you just
have to get it out by a particular date
that's it
so whether you do the work at half an
hour every night and how every night or
you do four hours on the weekend it
doesn't matter right so there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
