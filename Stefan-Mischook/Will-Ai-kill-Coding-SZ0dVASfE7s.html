Chuck with killer sites and other sites
so I got a question put me by somebody
and I thought it was a pretty cool
question and I did want to do some
documentation work what I had to do
because it's pretty lame stuff so I
decided I'm going to do some vlogging
today well right now so the question was
the fan could you make a video about the
future of the IT industry many people
say that programmers are going to
disappear pretty soon as artificial
intelligence will be able to solve
programming tasks what is your opinion
I'm not an expert on AI artificial
intelligence but from what I understand
there's still a long way to go they
still have problems evaluating sentence
structure so to be able to come up with
complex code to solve problems for
people it'd be very difficult because
it's it's be a nightmare setting it up
magic you get you got one coding problem
where you want to you know you want to
do some synchronous programming so you
pull out node and JavaScript for
instance or you want to do web app in
you you got jangle so people must have
jangle apps I got rails apps they got
larvae Symphony apps I got Java spring
apps or maybe they want to do ilt
programming Internet of Things where you
have very specific uses for the
thermometer you wanna you want you want
to automate there's too much variation
right now you know in terms of coding in
terms of app development I think that I
think that hey I will would be will be a
long way away at least a decade or two
before I think it could actually take
over from start to finish you probably
see AI or a component based coding
become more prominent as it is now it's
it's changing and it's in place now
think about it I remember back in the
90s when we used to develop web apps
versus today we used to work on really
basic infrastructure type of code we
used to come up
our own frameworks we used to come up
with our own database abstraction layers
we used to come up with our own UI
widgets I remember a friend of mine on
one particular job would like a week or
two just creating a date picker app
widget you know for a web app you know a
date picker now you know now with html5
you just you know input type date you
know that's it or jQuery if you want to
even go more primitive so I've seen an
evolution over the last 20 years we've
seen the role not the role but what
coders are specifically coding change
from what we did in the past in fact in
some ways it's simpler in some ways it's
far more complex that's for sure like in
the old days a lot of people developed
apps with very you know they would just
roll out their own structure it would
come up with it and you'd have real
messy apps that's for sure but these
days to get into a web app development
you have to at some point especially
when you get out of the basics you
should be learning some sort of
framework so if you're Python and Django
PHP it's Larry Paul symphony or maybes
and if it's Ruby rails Java it's spring
etc etc etc so in some ways it's more
complex today in some ways it's simpler
and I imagine you're going to see the
same type of evolution in coding over
the next 10 and 20 years you will see
the changes occur based on what people
demand so I I would imagine though if
you do get AI and AI foe AI comes about
under now it's 10 20 years then yes then
they would be able to replace not just
coders everybody you couple that with
robotics and you couple that with
renewable energies imagine how superior
will battery technology be 10 years from
now how superior will solar technology
be 10 20 years from now so I can foresee
hyper-intelligent well robots but are
powered by Sun power with ultra
efficient solar cells and amazing
battery technology and it would
literally change the fabric of society
and we seen this before we saw this when
the Industrial Revolution came about and
prior to that everybody was a farmer
everybody worked on farms Industrial
Revolution comes about everybody moves
into the cities so that was a huge
change in terms of how the entire world
worked right I think now a four percent
of people are farming I think when AI
comes of age
whatever that is I would imagine 10 20
years who knows things would change in a
big way so we you know my thesis on that
so I also keep the politicians and the
greedy people in check I'm not saying
all politicians agree but as long as we
keep we're fair Society you know what
are you going to do for instance when
you have all these self-driving vehicles
hit the road they're coming out they'll
be out with the next few years you know
if not next year you're after and you're
starting to see already in the oil sands
up in Alberta Canada I'm from Canada
some of the big oil sands producers they
have now ordered robotic trucks these
massive trucks that are controlled now
through you know their self driving
trucks essentially and their control
through robotic technology I don't know
I don't know all the details in terms of
the tech but point is now with these
giant robotic trucks all these jobs and
probably hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of jobs not more they're gone
these drivers used to make 200 thousand
a year two hundred fifty thousand here
driving around these big oil trucks
you're not gonna have those jobs anymore
because they bought these trucks from
Japan are self-driving and a lot of jobs
are driving jobs
so imagine uber cars taxis but are just
self-driving and in fact self-driving
cars once they figure out all the other
details are gonna be far safe for the
roads are gonna be far safer than they
are today because you know I just had a
little
little fender-bender recently and it's
because a couple of a couple of bad
judgments a guy in front of me
sped up and it's braked immediately and
I sped up and I'd have time to brake and
it was my fault for not giving him
enough distance and it was his fall for
braking like a like a loser
why were you know anyway but point is
this was a human error too to human
errors if you will that if you had
self-driving cars there wouldn't have
been that accident so does this mean
when you have AI coupled with robotics
coupled with highly efficient renewable
energy
I think solar would probably be the end
result
you know I'm thinking 10 years down the
line imagine you get these AI working on
developing ultra efficient solar cells
so what does that do it changes whole
society again so I wouldn't be so
concerned about your coding at that
point in time you know I know this
sounds silly but you know it's largely
you know everybody's reasonable we could
be a society of slackers really because
when you have these three elements
robotics AI renewable energy that's very
efficient resources will literally be
unlimited
you know the reason people work reason
people strive is you know a lot people
do most people do it while a lot of
people do to to you know you know for
food clothing and housing right and if
you have robotics and all the three
elements I just mentioned and this these
things will literally become unlimited
and the whole idea let's talk about it
appear in Canada on the federal levels
how idea of the basic income comes into
place right where everybody's gets a
basic income and why not if there's
unlimited resources essentially robots
are doing the work you don't have to
drill for energy much because you got
ultra efficient solving an AI figuring
out diseases and stuff like this humans
could do other things think it's kind of
like the Star Trek thing and I'm not one
of these utopian guys I'm actually a
pretty cynical guy but that's the
logical conclusion to it what do you
do with all these people who are not
capable of creating stories or high
levels of thinking you know the truck
drivers and in the laborers when these
robots come into play over the next 10
20 years what are you gonna do with
these people well I think you just do
basic income and you have to pursue
their things why not if the world is
ultra efficient why not just you know do
that but I don't think that's you know
10 20 years away and you know sometimes
people get excited about technology they
overestimate how quickly technologies
will evolve like I've seen that in like
if you look at videos in the 50s
watch these futurist news clips in the
50s they thought everybody was going to
have spaceships by today you know so
we'll see what happens but from my
experience over the last 20 years with
programming and coding to get back to
that it's going to take a little bit of
time before I would be so concerned
about AI because of all the complexities
remember the hardest thing about coding
is not writing functions and classes and
arrays and the hardest thing about coins
actually architecture it's the big
picture figured out how to best do
something what's the best approach which
which language to use which framework to
use which within the framework in the
language that you choose you know
JavaScript node express yes or Python
Django PHP laravel whatever you choose
depending on the job then there's the
architecture in that how do you best
adapt how you best design I'm doing and
faced with that right now with one of my
apps we're looking at how to best deal
with an older code base and we went to
micro services to extend its life I
talked about that in another video so I
wouldn't be so concerned about that
yes coding will change and evolve over
time that is for sure
but just you know we'll just be doing
different things for next 10 20 years I
will be concerned and when AI comes
about if and when it comes about in a
big way it's just going to be a game
changing for the entire society
and I think in a very positive way so I
wouldn't be so concerned
ai robotics and unlimited renewables
through the Sun have an imagined would
be a blessing the technologies here now
I think that would just change society
that's my thinking about it
so yeah I've and so what do I know you
know so what I'm going to do is going to
end this video with something I thought
about doing for a long time now I'm
going to introduce my favorite albums as
in music and this is old stuff I guess
for many of you but a lot of the artists
that you know of today which you follow
today they're probably inspired by these
people they probably listen to these
people or at least things the artist
might inspire them listen to these
people so I'm going to start just
mentioning some of the top albums of all
time you know of course you just go to
roll your soul but from my personal
collection and that's it at all and it
so we'll start with this so I don't know
if you can see that Ziggy Stardust
spiders from Mars yeah yeah this is
David Bowie he died recently maybe five
six months ago so I figured would be a
good place to start
fantastic album 100 seminal albums out
there it's a bit of a story album in a
way but it's very cool music and David
Bowie had his unique style so if you're
looking for new music you want something
different try david bowie's ziggy
stardust spiders from Mars
fantastic down this is vital right what
you thought you might find curious is
this thing here this is called the
Japanese Obi it's like a sash with
Japanese information so I had a Japanese
pressing of a vinyl album why don't I
jump eni's pressing because audiophile
nerds like myself to a certain extent
I'm not a super crazy audiophile nerd
but I you know I appreciate better
quality sound they go after Japanese
pressings because the Japanese we're
more more they were more meticulous
about their pressing of vinyl so the
quality was better I won't get into that
now but
- yeah so Japanese pressing bio this
sounds like much better than CD or mp3
or Spotify but you have to have good
speakers here - difference otherwise
forget about it
that said vitals gray I love I know I
have lots of I know but you know if you
get HD 24-bit music digital files
they're as good as HD I've done the
comparison so anyway so you started as
spiders from Mars if you're looking for
something to listen to you got to get
into it it's like a concept album you
know there's some hits on there for sure
but the whole concept album and its
really well record some nice sound to it
so let's somebody listen - all right
we'll talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
