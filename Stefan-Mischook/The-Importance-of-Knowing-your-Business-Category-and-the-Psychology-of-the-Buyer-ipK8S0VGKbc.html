they've done a car of vlog like this so
excuse the Sun it's now June 2017 and it
was a very cold spring thus far except
for a few days so nice to have some nice
warm weather for a change anyway in this
vlog I'm going to talk about getting
into a new business one of the key
things that you have to do that you
don't hear people talk about so whether
it be technology business doesn't matter
what type of business be any type of
business and I've been in a few
different sectors so I can tell you this
this is the case regardless of the
sector what I mean by sector whether it
be you're in education what I mean now
whether you be in restaurants whether
you be in I don't know how related
fitness apps etc etc any broad category
of business that you're in now each of
these categories at the end of the day
they represent some interests that
people have so if you were making stereo
speakers for stereo that you know a
certain level interest in you know there
are certain types of speakers that are
designed for the audio files the guys
really are the girls who really mostly
guys who really care about quality of
sound so they'll spend a lot of money on
great speakers and other equipment as
well so that's a very that's a category
right that's a psychology of an
individual if you go into just your
they're running a middle speaker but
people have for convenience like you you
might come out of like you know not
computer speakers like the Alexa or
something so most people are not so
picky about that they're much more
concerned about features but surround
the speaker like voice commands these
days or really good remote controls etc
etc or streaming capabilities so these
are broad examples here but you
can see how even just with speakers you
have two categories of markets if you
were to market categories one is the
audiophile person the person who really
cares about the sound that's the key
consideration and the other casual
listener is much more concerned about
the features the convenience features
around the speaker's not so much about
the sound okay so that's pretty good and
but that's about it
in terms of sound and even within the
narrow scope of speakers you've noticed
how I've been able to categorize two
types of clients who have totally
different perspectives about what makes
them decide whether they want to buy a
speaker or buy a product or not buy the
product and this of course is something
that you see in all categories in all in
all markets all market niches so when
you are getting into business you have
to sort of think about not sort of you
have to think about the psychology of
the end-user the psychology of the buyer
what drives them to want to spend their
money on a service or product what is
the key factor what is that killer
product if you will it's very important
that you do that otherwise it's going to
be you're going to be just you're going
to be just shooting in the dark trying
to figure out what that that buying what
that buying incentive is so what you
ought to do is you got to immerse
yourself within the context of that
mindset so if you're interested in
getting into the speaker business for
audiophiles you have to become an
audiophile you have to know it really
well so you you understand the
psychology of those people and thus
you'll be able to maybe if you're lucky
finding ish a need that could be filled
within that context within that mindset
that is the basic strategy that you
should take away from
this video now there may not be obvious
niches there may not be obvious
opportunities because that's just the
way markets go like for instance today I
don't think there's much of an
opportunity to build a cell phone
operating system we have iOS we have
Android and then we had a few others
like blackberry Microsoft's and all
about Android and iOS and unless you
have a very long game and very deep
pockets meaning lots of money to get
into the mobile operating system would
be kind of crazy same thing if with
regards to desktop or traditional
computer operating systems you have
three real ones right now while
Microsoft Apple and Linux and that's it
it's like to get into that game would be
crazy would be absolutely crazy there's
no opportunity there that market is
pretty much done unless something
happens like for instance for many years
Windows dominated followed by a distant
distant second Mac and some Linux here
and there and there is no operating
system opportunity but then came the new
forms like the new device the smartphone
which allowed for a new operating system
battle to occur so iOS came in boom
Windows tried to port Windows improperly
into cell phones or into the smartphones
but so I gave it opening for Google to
come in with Android and so that was an
opportunity that came in the operating
system marketplace but only because a
brand new device made an appearance and
that was the smart phone the final point
I want to leave you with is that
something that you'd only hear discussed
in business discussions too often I
don't know why is that it's very very
very very very very very rare
if not next to impossible that somebody
comes out with a product or service and
it's right on the money right away
typically it's a it takes years and
years of refinement to get what you
really want and or what the market
really wants rather and even Facebook
right the original Facebook's far
different from where it is today and the
difference between a successful product
and unsuccessful product is in the
subtleties and all these little
subtleties come together so for instance
in my educational apps to do web there
may be a hundred elements and I'm not
kidding there may be a hundred small
elements that contribute to making it
extremely effective in terms of
Education and each element literally
adds one percent but you know yeah that
a lot of you get that hundred percent
you get that that product that services
at that structure that app that really
hits the nail on the head now this took
I think make the product it's like seven
years old now and it continues to evolve
and continues to get better but I think
we kind of hit a sweet spot in my life
sweets but we kind of hit a point a
tipping point there it is we kind of hit
a tipping point meaning we hit that
watershed moment that tipping point
moment where it's like okay now's really
effective
that took us several years to get up and
running together to the point it was
good out of the gate was pretty good but
had a lot of problems and we worked with
schools and districts and teachers and
hundreds of thousands of students to
data from them to refine what we have
and how we build things and we're at
studi was three now we're about to
release 3-1 which is essentially just
some fine-tuning
but we're rewriting from scratch still
uf4 is a rewrite from scratch to be able
to take advantage of new architectures
and new arms and so forth and it will
incorporate new things that we learned
in the field a lot of the ideas games to
do what now are derived from input from
actual
users and that's why it works because
it's not just a fantasy out of my head
it was really a product that we
developed because of years and years of
experience working with schools so there
you go if you want to start a business
sell product or service you have to get
into that mindset of your buyer the
mindset of the buyer and that will help
you just to to navigate much more
successfully than you would otherwise
there are some exceptions there are some
exceptions like iPhone that's exceptions
or iPad exceptions but those are rare
those are rare you know you can't plan
out your business strategy strategy
based on long shots Hail Mary passes
view unless you get into the VC funding
game and VC guys that's what they look
for they look forward to disruptor
disruption technologies but 90% of them
fail so they don't mind because they
spread the money around a whole bunch of
companies and they know an 80% to 90%
are just going to go tits up they're
going to fail they don't lie because
they make so much money on the ten
twenty percent of do succeed that
doesn't matter to them the rest failed
the problem is if you're the developer
or the founder who's in that 80% of the
company's ninety percent of companies
where you've been working underpaid for
five six years and then at the end it
just fails
you've been underpaid for five six years
and developers and people with the skill
sets most of them who are able to lead a
startup if you had just been working for
a company or just been doing freelance
work you'd be up a lot of money over
that five six years six five six year
period rather than working for the
startup because typically when you when
you even if you are the founders in a
start-up you're going to be working for
less than you would if you just did
contract work or you're working for
somebody else so they keep in mind and
the that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
