here alright so let me give you a couple
of tips in terms of learning to program
learning to program can be frustrating
at times you're definitely gonna hit
those walls you're gonna hit those
roadblocks and you're just not gonna
understand things so let me give you a
couple of learning tips which is gonna
really make the process of learning a
code that much easier this is off the
top of my head so number one you have to
give yourself time when you're working
out you're doing push-ups you're lifting
weights any weightlifter will tell you
any professional athlete will tell you
as you train hard and then you got to
give yourself rest you gotta train hard
give yourself rest train hard give
yourself rest you rest so that the body
can repair itself and assimilate the new
knowledge same thing with programming
you have to give yourself rest so one of
the things I've been telling people
recently is that it's better to spend
twenty to twenty twenty-five minutes a
day programming for five days a week
then spending four hours once a week you
have to give your mind time to
assimilate the new data so sometimes
you'll hit something you'll be working
on at home you'll be working on learning
functions or you'll be alert working on
learning object-oriented programming and
it just won't click but what you have to
do in those situations tip number one is
you have to just write the code even if
you don't quite understand what the code
is doing it's very important that you
write it because by writing the code
you're essentially telling your brain
that this stuff is important and it
needs to put a little bit of effort into
deciphering this so what you'll find is
let's say you spend half an hour writing
our code you don't quite understand it
what you do is you take a day off after
that come back the next day or two days
later and you write out the same code
again what you're going to find is
you're going to understand a little bit
more if not all of it and that's the
process you want to keep that in mind
and repeat that do this repeat write a
bit of code you don't understand give
yourself a break could be a day could be
two days it could be five hours who
knows but give yourself a break come
back into the code with fresh eyes fresh
brains or clots of water
Coffee if you can to stimulate the
synapses of the brain and you see that
you're going to learn much more easily
with much less frustration if you follow
this process one important thing you
have to do when you learn how to code is
you have to write out that code and you
have to get it to work so in one of the
projects we do for instance PHP and
JavaScript validation of a sipper form
and the idea behind that is to show you
how to use PHP and JavaScript together
as you go through that little mini
project in the project section of CD web
again some of you may feel a little
frustration where you don't understand
everything that's going on at first but
again follow the formula write the code
even if you don't know what you're doing
write it blind do you take a break and
come back later next day five hours
later whatever it's required what an
important is you have to do is you have
to get the coat or get it to work so in
fact the validation works and the mini
project works why why do you want to
work because you want to see working
code you want to give your brain that
map from writing code to getting it to
work it seems silly but really plays a
role in making these things sink in
making this technology sink in now
here's a final tip I'll give in this
video once you have your code working
and you don't quite understand break it
change it remove a semicolon remove a
line break it and see what the error
message is break the code and in once
place knot into place if in one place
break it look at the error message then
fix it then break it again look at the
error message then break it somewhere
else check it out look at the error
message this back and forth for breaking
your own code and then fixing it in
yadda yadda yadda it's gonna really help
accelerate the learning process trust me
in fact in my courses I will do that I
will purposefully make mistakes although
I pretend I'm up doing it on purpose
when I do it on purpose to make mistakes
and I leave the mistakes in there I
could have added to them out but it's a
great way to teach people but first of
all everybody makes mistakes the whole
process of reading codes full
stakes don't be afraid to make mistakes
this is not like your driving you know
by a clip where you make a mistake
you're dead if you're right code doesn't
work you just fix it no big deal don't
be afraid to make mistakes and look at
the error messages that the web browser
is giving you if you're writing
web-based code or if you're writing
Python code with the Python course look
at what Python with the Python error
messages are giving you I cover this a
lot of the courses of the course etc
with the PHP core same thing pay
attention to the error messages the
error messages are actually giving you
you're pointing to where the error is
so the error messages are pretty cryptic
some are more obvious but the more you
see an error message based on code that
you break so the more you break code and
you look at the error message to break
the code on purpose look at the error
message you're going to start really
understanding the error messages better
you can start understanding the code
better you're going to SuperSpeed the
process of learning to code trust me
alright that's it for today's tip bye
