about working with f5 the little brush
window that we have here you can always
press f5 to activate and deactivate that
one and now that we've seen a little bit
about how some of these work let's take
a look at some of the brushes that you
can actually load so I'm going to press
B for my brushes again and if you right
click one more time you'll remember that
we have the options that we see here and
as we saw there are only a few of those
that are available in the basic ones
that we have here and you know there's
some very interesting ones and quite
nice things that you can do with them
however I'm just going to show you that
by clicking on this area here this
little triangle what you can do is load
a number of other brushes now as you'll
see if I just for example go to the
assorted brushes here it'll ask you
whether or not you want to append which
means to add to the existing set of
brushes that you have here and if you
choose yes you'll keep these brushes and
add a bunch to them I'm going to keep
things simple just by saying okay which
does not append it got rid of all the
other brushes and now we just have a
number of brushes here and as you can
see here I'm in white so I'm going to
press black as you can see here these
ones are just empty sort of brushes and
you can click on any one of these and
you can make them bigger or do whatever
you want or make a slinky effect or
something along those lines you know
it's really up to you command delete I'm
going to just make that white again and
as you can see here there are all kinds
of crazy sort of brushes that you can
use command delete one more time and i'm
going to show you that you can also add
again the basic brushes or if you come
in here there are calligraphic brushes
what is the difference between
calligraphic brushes and the round
brushes well you'll see that it's
squeezed in and if you'll notice when
you're working with something that is
squeezed in like that
and for example here I'll use something
that's a little larger what it ends up
doing is it will give you more thick and
thin transitions in your areas see so
there are going to be thick areas and
there are going to be thin areas
depending on what you're doing and even
if it's just a little bit you'll see
that it still has you know a little bit
of information in there that will be
thick and thin so those transitions will
in fact be thick and thin so you'll see
there's thicker areas thinner areas when
you're working with those calligraphic
brushes however there are some other
brushes that we can take a second to
look at there's DP brushes as you can
see here which are kind of strange when
you're looking at them right like this
but you know that can be a very nice
little branchy element that you can use
and it could be something that you know
you could still make smaller and as you
can see there you'll have like smaller
branch work I wouldn't necessarily brush
this in a stroke like that although you
know if that's something you're looking
for go ahead and not a problem however
there are some other ones in here this
is pretty weird and wild and I'm just I
just clicked once I didn't you know drag
it or anything like that which wouldn't
really make it a lot of sense command
delete I'll just fill that up let's see
what else we've got natural brushes
actually look like as you might imagine
sort of a different kind of brush stroke
and as you'll see here they're meant to
sort of emulate different types of
brushes that exists notice here you've
got watercolor watercolor three see that
and if you were to choose maybe
something like this you'd see what that
actually ends up doing for you so like I
said I encourage you to experiment with
the different fonts not font excuse me
experiment with the different brushes
and as I mentioned there's a lot of
brushes that are available to you just
have to load them
here's our some thick brushes see that
wow that's really a nice sort of look if
in fact you are going for something that
is rather distressed as this one ends up
being so again it's really all a matter
of how you want to address these brush
strokes you want them to look what you
want them to do inside of your design
now remember brushes and which brushes
your loading are really all about what
specific job you're using them for so
whether you have a hard edge or a soft
edge remember we've been using masking
with brushes doing a lot of different
things like that as well and all of
these are really wonderful if you wanted
to be working with some brush work and
stuff like that all you'd really have to
do is to place them on their own
individual layers and then you could
color in and do just about anything that
you want to so for example if I were to
come back here and I wanted to reset all
the originals just go back to reset
brushes click OK and then you've got all
of those basic ones that you had to work
with originally so right here you can
come in here and you'll notice when you
click on one of these you can perhaps
even see that there is this little brush
that's showing you exactly what that
brush looks like and how it works when
you will work with it and if i press
command delete i can delete all of that
and let's say i wanted to you know come
in here and just create a small little
character of sorts and if i were to come
in here and put in some ears or
something like that notice this is all
being done on the background layer I
shouldn't really do that if I wanted to
draw something I would you know put in
the black areas right around here and
you know depending on what kind of
element you want to have yeah some crazy
crazy sort of creature you can
do that just directly in here and based
on what you've done whether or not
you've done a good job and this is
rather rudimentary notice all you really
have to do is to create a layer that's
underneath the other one and then you
can go back to you know painting and
doing some colors inside of here now
certainly I could come in here and I can
choose a color like you know one of
these soft colors here and if I wanted
to start coloring in on this remember
what layer you're on I'm on the
underlying layer so all you really have
to do is to you know click in here make
your colors larger if you wish notice
I'm on the underlying layer so that's
great it sort of fits in quite nicely
with what I want to do and I could just
come in here and don't worry so much
about going outside look I've gone
outside on purpose there and even in a
couple of other areas now let's say you
did sort of like this way it is here you
can always switch to the eraser tool so
you see II for a racer and you can come
in here and you could just erase some of
those colors that are going outside the
lines if you don't want them there you
can just erase them come in here and do
your work like that nice and easy and on
top of that you know you could do any
number of other things with this and
choose different colors but i'm going to
show you a little bit about choosing
some colors let me come back in our next
exercise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
