PHP calm and killer sites mother the
sites I'm in a video blogging mood today
so we're going to be blog about Ellis
labs and code igniter so I recently
talked about the demise of co igniter I
suppose and somebody put a question to
me we're asking about if since Ellis
labs has now stopped supporting code
igniter and in fact they were looking to
sell it off so we slow down them at
their website you look back way back in
2013 07 09 else labs seeking new owner
for code igniter and that's the last
post here now this is we're now 2014 in
May so it gives you an idea where code
igniter is going so since Ellis labs has
dropped it the guy was asking me what do
you think is going to happen to V the
core code igniter libraries now there
are people are still developing stuff
apparently so many plugins for code
igniter I'm not in touch with the code
igniter community so you know I'm only
going from what I hear so they're asking
me whether you think is going to happen
his core framework as time goes by as
PHP develops and so on well first of all
I think peachy peach p is pretty stable
at this point and I would imagine that
any apps that you build with codeigniter
over the next couple years will probably
be fine assuming that the core libraries
are stable I don't know I think they are
and we still run a one or two projects
internally here that are based on
codeigniter at least one but we're
moving in the later stuff we're moving
to lara val because we feel you feel
it's a better framework and I've
discussed this in other and other videos
that being said if you like code igniter
as i said before then use code igniter
I've seen people use classic asp not
asp.net
classic asp this goes back to technology
from the mid-late 1990s people have
developed really good apps with this
antiquated really primitive web page
technology dynamic web page technology
it's not even close to what you can do
with PHP and Ruby and Python music is
not even in the same ballpark but
nonetheless if you know how to write
good code and clean code you can still
bring something to market now I'm not
saying you should use classic asp no no
but the point is a the lifespan of your
code igniter projects no matter what
anybody has to say about code of manner
will still be I'm sure they'll have a
long life if you just write the apps
properly so at the end of the day I
think though that the code base in
codeigniter will suffer because you can
have a few diehards and no probably be
scattered support for it over next few
years but I've seen this play out over
and over over again when a technology is
you know when the main community
especially the people who created it
when they decide to move on to something
else that project will quickly fall into
the niche and so it's not something you
want to be is as a web developer you
want it you know so you want to get the
jobs you probably want to keep your eye
on what's going on you know what's
coming down the pike or pipe pike what's
coming down the road and get ahead of
the game that way so for me I would
suggest if you're actively in
development or you want to be a PHP
developer I be looking towards I think I
are valves way to go I'm not saying drop
your codec matter right now but you know
keep your you know keep your eye on that
what's going on in the future and start
slowly learning the new framework
and I think financially at least you're
going to be in a much better position to
do that you don't want to find yourself
coding in the 90s you know when
everybody else is in the 2000s if you
know what I mean I've seen that as well
I see I remember there's a language that
he was called Delphi and it was a very
good language and but it got trounced by
believe it was vb and the delphi guys
they were like ha delphi is better than
DB and then they found that they had no
work because nobody wanted a delphi
development they wanted vb development
and simply because if you think about if
you're somebody who's hiring a coder or
the butt of a developer or your business
you don't want to be using a technology
that is falling out of favor because
it's going to be harder and harder for
you to maintain the apps that you build
because they're going to be much less
Delphi programmers if we define than VB
programmers so what's fast-forward 20
years today it's the same thing you know
if I was looking to develop a new
project I would not be using coding
matter simply because i know that it's
fading and fading fast and i want to
sort of try to stick you know stick to
what's the current trend is and right
now that's larry bell anyway that's my
two cents with regards to that see you
