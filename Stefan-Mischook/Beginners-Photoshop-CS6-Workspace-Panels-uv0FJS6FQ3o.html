to be dealing with photoshop's interface
and some of the essential tools that
you'll be needing to create your own
designs to begin with let's make sure
that we're all on the same page and what
I would like you to do is to go to the
top of your Photoshop menu and go to
where it says windows now one of the
things that you can look at four is the
workspace and in workspace there's a lot
of different types of work spaces that
we can deal with however the one that I
want to be dealing with is the one that
you'll have when you open up Photoshop
for the first time and that is the
essentials workspace so if you don't
have the essentials clicked I'd like you
to click on that notice that there are
some other ones like if you are into
photography you can open up certain work
spaces that have particular tools and
panels that will be useful to
photographers however since our
particular video tutorial is dealing
with web interface design the essentials
or the default is going to be more than
perfect for what we need at this point
let's discuss some of the basic panels
you'll notice over here on the left that
we have the toolbar and within this
panel you're going to have all of the
tools that we are going to be working
with inside a Photoshop some of which
will pay more attention to for this
particular video tutorial and others
that will be looking at only in a
cursory fashion however do note this
that when you are working with your
toolbar the little double arrows that
you see up here at the top if you click
on them will allow you to see your
toolbar is either a two column toolbar
layout or if you click back to the
default a one column layout as I have
right here couple other things that I
can bring to your attention whenever you
click on any one of these tools you'll
notice that there's an area up at the
top that gives you a number of options
for that particular tool so clicking on
any one of these should be changing the
tools options that you see right up at
the top
here another thing is that these tools
oftentimes will have a little arrow at
the bottom next to them if you notice a
tool that has an arrow that means to
access the tool you can click on it but
if you were to hold on to that tool a
little bit longer you'll notice that
there are other tools buried underneath
this specific icon so this one here I
would click and hold to access the other
ones same thing with this one click and
hold some other things that you can be
aware of is that whenever you put your
cursor over one of these tools but not
click on it you'll notice a little
context menu opens up and it gives you
the name of that tool but there's also a
letter associated with that tool and
those are the keyboard shortcuts that
you'll be using to access these tools
now this is a really important thing to
try and get used to because working with
shortcuts can really help speed up your
development time really makes things a
lot easier to work with and saves you
from having to move your mouse back and
forth back and forth throughout your
composition so it also allows you to be
more creative because you're not
wrestling with the tools and interface
as much as a beginner would down at the
bottom inside your toolbar you'll see
that in Photoshop we also have
foreground and background colors now the
foreground and background colors can be
changed all you would need to do is to
click on it and this would open up the
color picker window which would allow
you to come in here and choose from any
number of different colors and for
example if I were to choose green but
maybe I didn't want green I could use
this slider to move to blues or two reds
or other colors as well if you were to
click OK you would see that that color
change would take effect in the
foreground color if you wanted to change
the background just clicking on it will
open up the same window and then you
could go through choosing your own
colors as you go along
you'll also notice that here on the
right hand side we happen to have a
number of panels these are the default
panels that open up with the essential
workspace and you can see here that they
too have these double arrows these
double arrows with regards to the right
side panels will expand those panels so
you could see them a little bit better
you'll notice in that first row we have
history and properties by default just
going to collapse that and you'll see
here in the second row that you have
color and swatches adjustments and
styles layers channels and paths look
what happens if we collapse these icons
now in some cases you can move this so
that's a little bit larger and that you
could read what they are notice if I put
my mouse here I can do the same thing
however if you needed a little extra bit
of real estate you can just slide these
down so that when you collapse the
panels they're not taking up as much
room as they normally would if you were
to click on any of these panels when
they are collapsed they will just open
up as these small little side panels
here same thing for these as well now
another thing that you might notice is
that these panels actually happen to
have some iconography here at the top
the line separating them as you go along
what this means is these are groups of
panels that can be actually opened and
closed or moved together for example
you'll see here that when I've expanded
them color and swatches are together as
a group when I collapse them I can
actually move this group if I grab that
little dotted line at the top here and
move them around this will enable me to
create a floating version of that panel
and I can click on the tabs to jump
between each one of those elements so
jumping between swatches and color is
pretty easy to do if I wanted to return
that back all you have to do is to drag
this and as soon as you see a blue line
you can drag it back to where
now if I wanted to I could also take
some of these elements and move them
into other groupings just as I've done
here so that when we expand it now color
swatches and adjustments happen to be
together if I didn't want that I could
move it back I'm just going to class
this take my adjustments and move them
back here where I also have styles one
last thing you'll notice down at the
bottom there are two other tabs one for
mini bridge and one for the timeline now
we're not going to really be using the
timeline all that much in this video
tutorial but we will be looking at mini
bridge a little bit later so just be
aware that double-clicking will close
mini bridge and a single click we'll
open it as well come back in the next
video and I'll show you how we can work
with mini bridge to open up some images
and start having some fun inside of
Photoshop cs6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
