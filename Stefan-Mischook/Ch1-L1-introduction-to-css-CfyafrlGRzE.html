so CSS is the sister language to HTML
CSS is short for cascading style sheet
and it is the language that is used to
add style to add pizzazz to websites so
let me give you a quick demo so I've
launched my web browser and let me just
fit it in here so we can see it nice and
clear there we go so let's check out a
site so yeah here's one of my sites how
to build web sites and so you see the
layout here we've got our images we've
got two columns and the bottom here left
column right column big header tabs the
whole nine yards so let's look at
something so now we're gonna disable all
the styles so what does this mean see
we're on the CSS tab so we're gonna
disable all the CSS styling information
so what does that all mean that means
about CSS is a language but adds style
to web page so by using the browser
tools to remove the styles to disable
the styles we're gonna see what the web
page looks like without CSS code working
on the page it's just like turning off a
light switch so we're gonna turn off the
CSS switch and here we go so here is
what the page looks like our raw HTML
with new CSS so we've seen this before
right you've done the beginners HTML
course we've seen our list items here
these are unordered lists right and our
headers paragraphs and so on we have an
image I get these little tiny images
here these are a little gifts I guess
that's about it well we have this image
of to talk so let's now turn the CSS
back on same page now the CSS is
activated you can see how much of an
impact CSS has on a webpage it's a very
important computer language so in this
we're gonna take it step by step nice
and slow
I'm gonna teach you everything you need
to know about CSS to be able to build
beautiful looking pages like this what
do you need to know to learn CSS you
need to know basic HTML so I assume that
you've done my beginners HTML course and
you'll be using the same text editor
excuse me the same code editor that
you're using to build your HTML you do
with the CSS as well of course just like
with HTML because CSS is just code you
could write CSS with a simple text
editor like notepad or TextEdit on Mac
but it's better to use code editors
because we get all the advantages of
code editors CSS is a bit of a hard nut
to crack
what does that mean CSS a little bit
harder to learn especially the advanced
stuff when you compare it to HTML so
don't worry if you have trouble don't
worry some things don't make sense as
you go through the course as you write
more CSS code as you do more quiz
questions things will slowly come to you
and you know you might not get some
Monday but you know maybe Wednesday or
Thursday you have it and a great thing
about learning how to code is once you
know it you know it and it can't be
taken away what's important is to
understand the basic principles that's
the key to learning how to code and so
you concentrate on those basic beginners
concepts those beginners principles
those beginners ideas techniques and
you'll be well on your way to becoming a
full fledged
nerd all right this lesson is long
enough let's move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
