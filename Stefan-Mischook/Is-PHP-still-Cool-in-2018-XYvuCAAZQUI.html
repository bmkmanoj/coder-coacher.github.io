vlog I'm attempting to record in 60p so
let me know what you guys think if you
even see a difference
and who knows depending on how I render
it out it might not be 60 P when I'm
done
we'll see anyhow so somebody asked me
about PHP in 2018 part of my series I
guess on should you learn this should
you learn that the bottom line is it's
very rare that the big dominant
languages and PHP is one of them it's
very rare that they fade from the system
now you're starting to see that with
Ruby Ruby about seven years ago was very
very big with the hipsters and now the
new hipsters are going into the whole
JavaScript thing with node and so Ruby
is taking it on the chin and I've heard
that there were some big boot camps that
are now dropping Ruby from the
curriculum because of lack of demand
I'm not surprised something I had
predicted years ago simply because you
have PHP on one end which is very
dominant in terms of the freelancer
space and and for small business largely
I would say because of things like
Drupal Joomla and WordPress the CMS is
better our users so much by small
businesses and all these web apps all
these content management systems are
built with PHP so it only makes sense
just because of that PHP is going to be
around for many many many years and I
highly recommend PHP at least until
further notice I highly recommend PHP
has the ultimate server-side programming
language for the freelancer simply
because so many small businesses rely on
that programming language Ruby on the
other hand is I think it's gonna
continue to take it on the chin because
you got PHP on one hand as I was saying
and you have on the other hand you got
Python which is very similar-looking in
many respects to Ruby although there's
trust readers are very different whereas
in other respects because python is very
explicit everything is very obvious is
designed that way whereas Ruby is very
elegant or eloquent no elegant and but a
lot of stuff is kind of hidden but
anyone
into that that being self not dissing on
Ruby I think Ruby is a cool language but
I think it's one of it's going to become
more and more of a niche technology over
time simply because PHP has it cornered
on one end and on the other hand you got
Python and and Ruby's gonna go down as a
result so yeah PHP 2018 big thumbs up
for freelancers for freelancers web
development freelancers that's where the
money is and of course you want to get
into AI machine learning it's Python
anyway we're gonna discuss that at
another time that's it for this quick
vlog I just got back from my coffee run
and I have to do what I really don't
like to do well it's kind of a lover hay
situation today my year end and just
ended in corporate structures at least
in North America and probably around the
world you the year and day is dictated
by when you you sort of set up the
company so my year and it's not January
my year and is at the end of summer and
at that point Tom I have to start
organizing all my paperwork so I can
hand it off to the bookkeeper and then
the bookkeeper hands it off to the
accountant etc etc so we get the
bookkeeping time so I just have to
organize things for the year and then a
month and because I'm recording this
would be beginning of September so it's
yeah it's amongst the most boring work
you can do but it's also satisfying
because it's kind of like calculating
all your points to see how you did this
year and the good thing is that we did
not too bad this year studio web is
continuing to grow more and more schools
or adopting it I'm quite happy about
that and it was really cool is that this
year after years of building up
infrastructure modifying the app
refining the app rather it's now got to
the point where going I'm gonna go from
80% 90% infrastructure work to 80 to 90%
marketing work so that's gonna be a lot
of fun that's why I was talking about
the whole video
because I want to start putting out more
and more and more marketing related
videos beyond the beyond the vlogs of
course and that's all I was asking about
the professional camera in a previous
video to be able to put out really good
content but based on feedback from
people from YouTube and I appreciate
that and some friends of mine who are
pros in video work and stuff and some of
you were correct in saying that a the
lens is a huge part of it be the
lighting another huge part of it and see
a post-processing is also a big part of
the look of the video in terms of color
saturation so forth so what I'm doing I
got a middle-of-the-road lens here and
the smart approach instead of going out
and buying a $2,000 lens that will
likely improve the quality of the video
I'm gonna go rent them I can rent them
as a local camera shop for 30 bucks a
day right the couple lenses take a bunch
of shots and just compare the video
quality and see how if anything the lens
effects the quality of video before you
show out a thousand or 1500 two thousand
dollars on a lens but when it comes to
creating a good impression when it comes
to business it's important that you that
you pay attention to the detail so you
me what your code you know it's very
important that you know you make sure
when you release your code that the app
works well little details about error
messages that are presented to the user
and air trapping these things really
play a significant role in terms of
people's perception of your app and
that's one of reasons why iOS and Mac OS
are so successful because they do do
that they they really pay attention to
those details so iPhone it doesn't have
the majority of the market because
they're very expensive so you know an
Android world they dominate outside of
North America and Europe but I think
iPhone still makes 80 percent of the
profits in the whole smartphone market
and again that's their apples of
attention to detail as far as the user
is concerned that's such an important
part of things
anyhow I digress have a great day
