ready to go the next step is to first go
to your profile page and we want to
change the auto generated password to
something that we can remember so you
click on this link up here and you see
in the profile you have all kinds of
different options available to you so
what we're going to do is actually go
down to new password now I'm just going
to put in something really stupid simple
that we're all familiar of one two three
four five now when you put your real
password to update really try to put in
something a little bit stronger than one
two three four five you know as I
explained before you want to try to put
in a password it has a mixture of maybe
numbers and letters maybe a dash or
underscore here and there and you may
change the case for instance you may
have an uppercase and lowercase just so
that people can't hack it as easily as
one two three four five would be so I'm
just going to update that profile so
there we go so we've updated profile
with the new password replacing the auto
generated password that WordPress
created for us while we're here in the
profile page what we're going to do is
look at some of the options you can
change the scheme the color of the ax
min panel this is a default grade and go
back to the more traditional blue just
by selecting this and you get all kinds
of other options you put your name this
sort of thing can be experimented with
in terms of the pulse so if i change my
nickname too it's the fan when I pulse
this will be displayed as opposed to it
min well not this gives me now I can
choose it right here stuff on display
name publicly Estefan just in case when
you write post you don't want to have a
min being displayed beyond that I think
a lot of these things are sort of
self-explanatory
again you can always update your
password anytime you like whenever you
make changes though here you hit the
update profile and the profile is
updated
WordPress is a blogging engine but it
also allows you to incorporate CMS like
features and one of these features is
the ability to have several authors on
the same blog and you can actually set
the author's type if you will and so you
can give them different privileges
within the context of your blog so what
does all that mean Oh we'll take a look
authors and users right now there's one
author and you see my face and the
reason you can see my face is because
we're press is using something called
gravitas where I have a sort of a
universally accepted face a picture
rather called a gravatar and we're press
the smart enough to know that and it's
bound to my email address again you
could look that up in online you can
find information about that anyway going
back to the authors and users right now
we have all we went off there so let's
look at the add new function here we had
a new author so they're at an author I'm
going to calm Jimmy they're spelled
right so Jimmy and I'll say is dave is
Jimmy and I can anyhow is not really
super important but i want to put
another vmail josh can't use the same
email address and i'm going to use the
same password i always use for this
video and i could set whether this
person is a subscriber an administrator
editor author or computer each of these
different types of users have different
capabilities and privileges within
wordpress so let's say this guy is an
author who has the office privileges and
i'm going to send his password by email
let's say for instance you have this guy
named Jimmy and you want him to
contribute articles to your blog so what
you can do as the
administrator is add the user so does
password and you put in his actual email
address so what would happen now is when
you add this user to a system WordPress
will send an email to this email address
here with its user information so then
the author can logon on his own and
start contributing contents on the
school add user so there we go so now in
the users panel that we have here we can
click on by going here we see we have
two users now we have the admin's we see
their email addresses and you see what
their role is what does administrator
that's the you know me because I created
a blog and I have Jimmy now if i go into
gym i can edit their profile and i can
change anything i want about them
including the password so forth and i
can change the row so let's say Jimmy
becomes a pretty good author I can make
him an editor or I can make him a
contributor you can learn more about
these different roles on the
wordpress.org site all you need to know
for this particular video is that you
can add multiple users to your blog
giving WordPress a CMS like capability
CMS by the way is short for content
management system and with these new
users that you add to the system you can
set their capabilities in terms of well
in terms of their role now administrator
author editor contributor subscriber
they each have their own rights and
privileges of course the administrator
is a super user they can do whatever
they want to the system and the first as
a contributor has less capabilities than
an editor and the author has less
capabilities that an editor and so on
you get the idea you can experiment
around with this and look into this in
the
documentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
