websites so I just wanted to address a
question that was recently we'll just
put to me in one of the comments what
kind of computer would I use to write
code with what if I was going to be a
developer when I go Mac or Windows which
one well there's a couple of issues with
regards to that off the top of my head
just getting straight to the point if I
had to choose today between a Mac or a
Windows machine I would lean Mac this is
a tough decision because the modern-day
Windows 10 computers are extremely
extremely cool now I think in terms of
feature sets and capabilities with
regards to the typical a Mac a Mac Pro
Retina for instance versus the
equivalent dell or whatnot or the
Samsung etc they're neck-and-neck and
each one has their pros and the cons
like for instance I got a surface pro 4
recently and I bought it for a few
reasons this thing comes off I bought it
because my Apple my Apple's iPad 2
basically got bricked with when it
releases what are the updates to iOS
it's just so slow it's painful so I
decided I needed a new Windows machine
for recordings and because there's
certain apps that I prefer on Windows
it's not available on Macs I said I'll
get a Windows machine it's good to have
and I have to tell you in terms of
tablets that the surface pro 4 is in my
opinion are the best in the world and a
reason they're the best in the world
is because it is two reasons they you
got this crazy cool kickstand which goes
in a any you know any angle that you
want and it's very solid just put it
down and also it's got really good
facial recognition I just look at it
let's look at it a you know it's like
something it logs me in and it's a it's
an interesting operating system because
it's a high-bred
operating system right now it's set for
desktop use and I could plug in two
monitors into this saying two 4k
displays empower it
so it's quite a cool so right now it's
in Windows desktop mobile but if I just
click here just pull site I go to tablet
mode so now it works like a touchscreen
device now and it's extremely capable in
that regard very very fast as you can
see here I really like it a lot I use it
every day whether it be as a tablet or
as a daily driver
I usually most I usually I use it mostly
in non tablet mode so let me just get it
out of tablet mode and what's
interesting about this operating system
it's like well Windows 10 by the way
it's got the best windowing features out
there much better than Mac OS in terms
of how you can which you can do with
your windows this is so much better if
you go to tablet mode all sudden it
becomes very flexible in terms of how
you can use it and just give me the
sample so what does this have to do with
coding I bought my Windows 10 machine
because I wanted to have my hands in the
windows world because of the type of
work I do and there was a particular app
that only is on Windows that I want to
use so that's why I got it and I needed
a tablet as well since my iPad was was
no longer usable what's also cool about
the surface pro is full windows it's not
like iOS which is kind of hobbled I can
run all kinds of apps on there I could
run anything I want windows can rich
windows so you can run anything you want
so it's very cool that way again though
if I was going to be a professional
coder when I go to Windows Device or
Windows 10 device at a surface pro or
some sort of the latest Samsung's
ordell's
or would I go with Mac OS they're
neck-and-neck they're neck-and-neck in
terms of capabilities if you want the
power of the retina in terms of all the
features you're going to pay for it in
the windows world that's for sure
the thing about coding those you don't
really need a very powerful computer to
begin with because you're just writing
text most the time it has an impact if
you get into advanced stuff where you
start using virtual machines things like
VirtualBox and stuff like that we're
having a lot of RAM and processor is
important but you know it depends on the
type of work you do of course if you're
doing c-sharp coding and
of course you're gonna get a Windows
machine you know of course if you're
doing iOS coding you're going to
definitely have to get a Mac machine so
you know so I'm sort of torn you know
I'm torn I guess I told you reasons why
I got my Windows machine right now I'm
recording this on a Mac Pro retina 2012
it's still very good for many things
it's great
I've been holding off because it's been
doing everything I need in terms of my
work not even not even you know no
trouble really except for occasional
issue here and there but overall it's
it's I think it's it's slightly superior
in certain ways whereas with Mac for
instance I find that the operating
system Mac OS 10 for all its greatness
the great operating system is very
stable and so on it seems a little dated
now when you compare to Windows 10 in
terms of the user experience in terms of
the flexibility like Windows 10 is both
a touch OS and a non touch OS a
traditional PC so you can switch between
ads oh and it responds more effectively
to touch and so on in the Windows
machine whereas Mac OS seems a little
long and to if it's great though but it
seems a little longer to find a
windowing is far superior on Windows in
terms of snapping windows into place and
so on natively Mac OS doesn't have that
capability it's not as nearly as good as
very clunky and slow really in
comparison but there are third-party
free apps that you can install give you
a lot of power in that regard in that
regard with Mac I wonder why they just
don't put that in that being said
apparently Mac is finally coming out
with a very interesting matte new
MacBook Pro I've heard rumors about what
it can do its got like on the keyboard
with me touch screen people are thinking
it's going to be there I don't know
we'll see what it comes out within the
next month or so or hopefully sooner I
plan to get one because I have a four
year old Mac Pro and I feel if it's
significant in terms of its its feature
sets terms of its that would it you know
in terms of the hardware and so forth
I'll probably get it that's it so if you
are tied for money you beat and you want
to get into coding
get a Windows 10 machine or much cheaper
and you'll be very happy with it's very
cool but if you're really looking if you
got you know you've got some extra money
to spend you're looking for an optimal
coding experience especially if you want
to get into you know the web space or
maybe into especially law of course if
you're doing iOS programming you
definitely need to get a Mac so you have
to think about what kind of coding
you're going to do and think about your
budget and so on but the great thing is
whether you get a Mac computer or a
Windows machine you are going to have
some it will probably last you at least
three four years that's for sure so
that's pretty good value for your money
relative to what we used to we just have
to upgrade every two years in the past
as I mentioned in another video that
yeah I guess that pretty much covers it
so choose what you need one other thing
by the way I want to point out if you do
get the top-of-the-line Mac's you get
the Mac's they've a very high resale
value so even though it's more expensive
than Windows you have to consider the
fact that you could sell your Mac two
three years later four years later and
get a pretty good chunk of money for
instance my macbook my macbook pro
retina 15-inch 2012 yeah it cost me two
and a half thousand for it expensive
wouldn't then tax but but you know in
canada at least I imagine US and Europe
you get your taxes back because your
business of its business use and you
write it off if you have if you have a
small business and to you be able to
sell your Mac I just mentioned to one or
two people near they wanted to buy it I
could probably get a grand for it
eight and eight hundred to a thousand so
that kind of offsets the cost of buying
a new Mac because if you take care of
your Mac you probably be able to set up
for for a pretty good chunk of change
afterwards
not so with mid-level and low-level
Windows machines except I found I
actually had a samsung series 9 which
was four year old ultra-thin laptop
beautiful and I paid a good chunk of
money for about two a two thousand plus
for it and
I sold it for 500 bucks just a friendly
price but on Amazon there's still sign
for like nine hundred dollars so I
thought that if I would have pushed
maybe I could have got six seven hundred
dollars for it not as easy though to
sell high in Windows machine that's for
sure versus a Mac but still something to
consider
