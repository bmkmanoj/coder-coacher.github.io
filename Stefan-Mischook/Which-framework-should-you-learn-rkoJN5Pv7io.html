framework should you learn that's a
question that comes up every and so
often and it was a question I used to
wrestle with when I was really active in
coding
swishy back in the 90s because it seems
from my experience it still happens
today it seems like almost every other
day somebody invents a new framework it
could be a new JavaScript framework of
being a PHP framework it could be
whatever there's tons and tons of
frameworks out there so which one should
you learn well it's always changing and
I'm recording this in 2016 but here's a
general principle don't waste your time
with every single framework that comes
out because there's gonna be so many
when you do decide to look at a
framework make sure it does something
significantly better or significantly
different from from what's out there
now so for instance there's bootstrap
and there's other layout frameworks out
there I forget them also but you can ask
yourself the framework that comes after
bootstrap you know when there's a bunch
do they really bring much to the table
that bootstrap doesn't already bring now
of course the people who push a
particular framework they're gonna say
yeah our framework does this better but
and that could be the case but what
you're gonna find with most frameworks
is that you take framework a and
framework Bay B and framework a may do X
Y and said really good and framework B
will do a B and C real good but you know
they don't do all things really good so
what you'll find is that when you're
moving from one framework to the next
you might be giving up advantages from
your first framework when you move to
the next framework it's not always the
case but most of the time it is so my
advice to you is keep an eye out on a
new frameworks maybe devote 5% of your
time in coding to looking at new
frameworks but really pay attention to
the buzz see what's going out there and
see where the demand is and see where
the manager screen
because I assume you're doing this to
make a living you're not just an
academic nerd and you don't want to
waste your time on some cutting-edge
framework but this disappears and I tell
you most of them do and this is from my
experience in the last 20 years as a
developer in back in the 90s there was
no difference especially in the Java
community that was my main language back
in the 90s there was tons of frameworks
coming out in Java like you wouldn't
believe and they're just about all dead
now all of them so take your time you
can get caught up trying to learn all
these frameworks and there's really not
too much of advantage so all that being
said in 2016 if you're a web developer
of course study and know your html5 and
css3 well because these are the
foundation languages that are not going
anywhere
and of course JavaScript I would in
terms of layout frameworks I would look
at bootstrap I would look at jQuery as
well that's a JavaScript framework and
in terms of server-side frameworks in
the PHP world I would be doing laravel
and on a JavaScript and I would look at
if you want to learn JavaScript
server-side programming I would look at
node.js and perhaps Express J is what
sits on top and old if all this is nerd
to you and you don't understand it don't
worry about it the first thing is you
got to learn html5 css3 javascript and
if you don't know a server-side
programming language then my number one
choice would probably be PHP because
it's so widely used although let me put
it out there even though PHP is
extremely powerful and PHP Ruby Python
they're all neck-and-neck in terms of
their capabilities to each other pros
and cons it's funny PHP is like the
dirty redheaded stepchild of programming
these days it's it's poo pooed upon by
new nerds because they look at PHP these
dirty pass and the fact of the matter is
you can be very productive and very
capable and PHP has all the bells and
whistles that you're going to see Ruby
and Ruby on way out
on Rails especially when you got
projects in PHP like laravel that said
from what I'm seeing JavaScript looks
like it's going to be the big mover in
terms of server-side programming and
with nodejs
underlying underlying rather frameworks
like Express Jas and people really like
it because javascript is used in the web
browser and there's no competing
technologies if you're doing scripting
programming in the web browser you're
using javascript that's for sure
and it appeals to people to be able to
use JavaScript on the server as well so
you have to learn two languages because
if you do PHP or Ruby on Rails
programming or Django programming with
pipe with Python you have to learn two
programming languages because you always
have to learn JavaScript no question so
then on so if you do server-side
programming with you know these are the
languages PHP and Python and so forth
that's another language you have to
learn so you know that's why you see the
move in in favor of JavaScript and it's
growing and JavaScript I think is
already the most popular programming
language in the world so that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
