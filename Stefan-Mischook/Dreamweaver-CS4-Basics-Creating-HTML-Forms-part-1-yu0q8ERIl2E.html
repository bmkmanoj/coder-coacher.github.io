show you the basics of using a
Dreamweaver cs4 WYSIWYG tools WYSIWYG is
short for what you see is what you get
to easily create HTML forms so let's
launch our products page here and if
you've watched previous videos seen why
we have this here so I'm just going to
get rid of this cuz we don't need it
and I'm gonna hit enter I'm gonna go
make this a little bit bigger so we have
some more real estate and I'm going to
go into the insert menu here I have this
may be positioned differently depending
on your setting here so if you look up
way up here in the top you have all
these different views that you can
easily jump to so right now I have it
sets its designer I can go inside or
compact see what Dreamweaver does I can
go to coder plus I can go to classic
this is a classic Dreamweaver screen I'm
kind of used to because I've been using
Dreamweaver for such a long time so I'm
just gonna use the classic setup so you
go up here you select classic so we have
the same screen and then we're going to
go into the forms tab here bang right
you had all these different forms that
we can use in Dreamweaver so we're gonna
put a do something really really simple
just so that you can get an idea what to
do so you see we have a split screen
right now right we have code here and we
have our designer view here so I'm just
going to go into pure designer for you
because you know I'm lazy so what we're
gonna do we're gonna add some form
button so see if we mouse over he got
text fields and hidden input that's
where like passwords hitting important
so I'll show you the difference between
between these two very soon text areas
are all kinds of different form elements
here so what I want to do now is a well
the spry stuff here is this well there's
a little bit more advanced so we won't
cover this here so let's jump into
creating some simple simple text view
so that all text fields one and this
little box pops open so the ID that's
used on the scripting side the
programming side like pH on the PHP side
for example a ColdFusion side so what
it's gonna give it an idea when I say
name you know and we're into what's
that's use for later label we can leave
that one we could put that name too so
wrap with label tag and that's a label
tag it says to do a usability and stuff
again this is a quick video I'm not
gonna get into all the details here but
we're just gonna go okay now all this
stuff access key this has to do with
usability and goals beyond the scope of
the spacing videos we're just gonna
leaving oh I'm just gonna get rid of
name as well and get no label tag right
like put in me more mm-hmm and we could
leave it in but I'm just gonna have no
label type for now so ID name so we just
go okay okay so we gonna have this add
form tag now this form tagging is the
one way up here and I did add it on
purpose cause I want to see that so
basically you need to add a form tag
when you created a forum I'm gonna show
you why now
so I'm going to say ok yes add the phone
tag so you see this red line that's the
form tag so you put your mouse cursor in
here click and hit enter and we're gonna
add another you know add a checkbox
never go ahead checkbox
I'm gonna go ID then go sex and just
leave it like that okay so a checkbox
and we hit enter again and we're gonna
have any list menu here how's that
Alyssa min you're gonna say fish
alrighty it's a fish okay now we want to
expand lossless bias now list boxes when
I was drop-down boxes so let's jump into
that right now so you don't loose values
we had an item we're gonna go
red snapper so that's what is displayed
you'll see in a second what I mean by
that little red dash snapper now if
you're confused at this point
just you know bite your lip hold on for
a second and explain all this stuff to
you in about two shakes so hit enter so
that's been added so without another
item another item so we're gonna say red
snapper gonna say trout and we're gonna
say trout okay that's enough so we're
gonna go key a so you see Oh some red
snapper trout let's take a look at the
code now
this when we save this control save when
you're doing HTML and even if you're
using a program like Dreamweaver we have
to still understand the code because
there's times when you just have to get
into the code so hold on to your hats if
you're a designer we're gonna actually
look at some code now so we're now
looking at code view and we're looking
at the code that Dreamweaver created for
us so this is our drop-down box it's
actually called a select box and you
notice the name fish and ID fish and so
on you notice the option to my red
snapper trout etc so let me scroll down
here so we see it here now what
Dreamweaver when you have a split view
here I'm just gonna double click on this
to give us a little bit more screen real
estate if you click on an item in your
design view down here you see
Dreamweaver highlights it in the code
view and I'll click on this excuse me I
just click on that box you see a box
input type text I see this red dot this
is not red dot this red dotted line this
is the form tag C form right here now if
you don't know tags you don't understand
this you have to go to the you should go
to the main course and I get into all
that there
so when Dreamweaver asked us if you
recall before do you want to stay in
sort insert the form tag so I go yeah
you do that so what that is it inserted
this
this is the opening of the form tag and
it's a closing now what this thing does
and this is represented by this dotted
red line here this tells the web browser
because when this loads under web
browser right it reads all this this
tells the web browser that this is all
one form all these different boxes here
right and so it treats it as one form
and yeah again this has to be talked
about another video but essentially
you'll learn that you can have multiple
forms in a web page so you need to have
these form tags and these form wrappers
like this so the Dreamweaver in a web
browser excuse me
the web browser understands how to
handle all this stuff so let's go back
into pure design view and hit enter
again and I'm just going to put in a
submit button button like this and I go
button I ID I'm just going to type
submit and I say label this is labels
basically what is displayed on the
button submit
and not actually excuse me label is this
thing here so let's get rid of that my
apologies so let's save that preview so
ignore this this is just a security
warning so nothing happens because we
have to tell the forum what to do now
okay so we've seen that the button works
this is the very basics there's a lot
more to learn about forms and we're
getting close to ten minutes here so
we're gonna have to continue this in
part two and in part three of a course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
