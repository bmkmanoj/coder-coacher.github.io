show you the basics of using a
Dreamweaver cs4 wizzy week tools wysiwyg
is short for what you see is what you
get to easily create HTML forms so let's
launch our products page here and if
you've watched previous video scene
while we have this here so I'm just
going to get rid of whiskers we don't
need and going to hit enter I'm going to
go make this a little bigger so we have
some more real estate and I'm going to
go into the insert menu here i have this
may be positioned differently depending
on your setting here so if you look up
way up here on the top you have all
these different views that you can
easily jump to so right now i have it
sets its designer i can go to the side
or compact see what dreamweaver does i
can go to a colder plus i can go to
classic this is a classic dreamweaver
screen I'm kind of used to because i've
been using dreamweaver for such a long
time so i'm just going to use a classic
setup so you go up here to select
classic so we have the same screen and
then we're going to go into v forms tab
here bang right you got all these
different forms that we can use in
dreamweaver so we're going to put our do
something really really simple just so
that you can get an idea what to do so
you see we have a split screen right now
right we have code here and we have our
designer view here so i'm just going to
go into pure designer for you because
you know i'm lazy so what we're going to
do we're going to add some form button
so you see if we mouse over you got text
fields and hit an input that's what I
passwords hitting input so i'll show you
two difference between between these two
very soon text areas are all kinds of
different form elements here so what I
want to do now is a well the spry stuff
here is this whole there's a little bit
more advanced so we will cover us here
so let's jump into creating some simple
simple text view
so google text field one and this little
box pops open soap the ID that's used on
the scripting side the programming side
like ph on the PHP side for example a
coldfusion side so we're just going to
give it an idea what to say name you
know and we're into what's that's use
for later label we can leave that way we
could put that name too so wrap with
label tag that's a label tagging sets do
we use a building stuff again this is a
quick video I'm gonna get into all the
details here but we're just going to go
okay now all this stuff access key this
house still with usability and goals
beyond the scope of the spacing videos
but we're just going to leave you know
I'm just going to get rid of name as
well and get no label tag right right
put in move on and we could leave it in
but i'm just going to have no label type
for now so ID name so we just go okay
okay so going to have this ad form tag
now this form tag is the one way up here
I did add it on purpose cause we want to
see that so basically you need to add a
form tag when you create a forum i'm
going to show you why now so i'm going
to say ok yes add the phone tag so you
see this red line that's the form tag so
you put your mouse cursor in here click
and hit enter and we're going to add
another you know add a checkbox never go
ahead check box when i go ID then go sex
and yeah let's leave like that okay so
you're a checkbox and we hit enter again
and we got any list menu here how's that
Alyssa min you're gonna say fish
alrighty is a fish okay now we want to
expand lossless bias now list boxes when
it was drop-down box or so let's jump
into that right now so you don't lose
values we had an item we're gonna go
red snapper so that's what is displayed
you'll see in a second what i mean by
that little red dash snapper now if
you're confused at this point just now
bite your lip hold on for a second and
explain all this stuff to you in about
two shakes so hit enter so that's been
absolute add another item another item
so we're going to say red snapper are
going to say trout and we're gonna say
I'm trout okay that's enough so we're
going to go key a so you see awesome red
snapper trout let's take a look at the
code now this when we save this control
save when you're doing HTML and even if
you're using a program like dreamweaver
we have to still understand the code
because there's times when you just have
to get into the code so hold on to your
hats if you're a designer we're going to
actually look at some code now so we're
now looking at code view and we're
looking at the code the dreamweaver
created for us so this is our drop-down
box it's actually called a select box
and you notice the name fish and ID fish
and so on he knows the option to write
red snapper trout etc so let me scroll
down here so we see it here now with
Dreamweaver when you have a split view
here I'm just going to double click on
this to give us a little bit more screen
real estate if you click on an item in
your design view down here you see
dreamweaver highlights it in the code
view and i'll click on this oh excuse me
ok just click on that box you see a box
input type text i see this red dot this
is not red dot this red dotted line this
is the form tag see form right here now
if you don't know tags you don't
understand this you have to go to the
you should go to the main course and I
get into all that there so when
dreamweaver asked us if we call before
do you want to stay and sort insert the
form tag so I go yeah you do that so
what that is it inserted this
this is the opening of the form tag is
the closing now what this thing does and
this is represented by this dotted red
line here this tells the web browser
because when this loads under web
browser right it reads all this this
tells the web browser that this is all
one form all these different boxes here
right and so it treats it as one form
and again this has to be talked about
another video with essentially you'll
learn that you can have multiple forms
in a web page so you need to have these
form tags and these form rappers like
this so the Dreamweaver in a web browser
excuse me the web browser understands
how to handle all this stuff so let's go
back into pure design view and hit enter
again and I'm just going to put in a
submit button button write this and I go
button I ID are just going to type
submit and I say label this is labels
basically what is displayed on the
button submit
and lots actually sees me label is this
thing here so let's get rid of that my
apologies so let's say that preview so
ignore this this is just a security
warning so nothing happens because we
have to tell the form what to do now
ok so we've seen that the button works
this is the very basics there's a lot
more to learn about forms and we're
getting close to 10 minutes here so
we're going to have to continue this in
part 2 and in part 3 of a course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
