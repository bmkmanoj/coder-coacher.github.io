learning PHP in 2016 2017 short answer
is yes because I think PHP is going to
be one of the server-side coding
languages that wanted a server-side
programming languages that is going to
not only survive for many years but
actually do very well and there's a lot
of structural reasons for that not
necessarily coding reasons but
structural reasons so let me explain so
in terms of server-side coding languages
out there today you have you have so
many options you have JavaScript now you
have Java you've got PHP you got Python
you got Ruby and there are others you
know c-sharp dotnet you get into that
you can get into Perl even some people
are still doing that and probably others
so which so well PHP do well in 2016-17
and Ford again short answers yes and the
reason being is because PHP is in a
unique position in that it's so
ubiquitous it is everywhere in terms of
web development whether it be simple
little two-page dynamic websites dynamic
websites are just websites connected to
a server using coding and it's an old
1990s term bad so whether it be a simple
web app or something very complex we're
using laravel framework or a symphony
framework to back it PHP is there and
it's just it's it's everywhere and one
of them being reasons is because three
most popular content management systems
in the world are written in PHP that's
WordPress Joomla and Drupal so there's a
heck of a lot of work working with small
and medium sized businesses and even
some big businesses where they have
their their information side of their
sites are driven by WordPress so and if
you worked with are all WordPress love
it or hate it
it is a PHP app so being able to read
and understand PHP each we able to do
modifications
some plugins work with plugins etc etc
etc with WordPress there's an advantage
to learning PHP same thing with Joomla
and Drupal they are all PHP based apps
and between these three CMS's you're
probably powering 30% or more of the
world's websites think about 30 percent
or more and because they're such a
convenient app specially WordPress
WordPress is by far and away the most
dominant these WordPress is not going
anywhere
so beyond that PHP is actually much more
approachable in many respects in terms
of building web apps then especially
Java Ruby rails Python Django
not necessary I'm saying PHP is the best
language there's actually some really
nice things about Python it's actually a
simple simple syntax a cleaner syntax
Ruby as well but again be to get
somebody up and running developing with
PHP is much easier it takes a lot less
time than let's say rails or I would
imagine Django although I have not
looked at Django a year so my opinion
about Django is it's extremely shaky
because I have looked at of course I
could spend tim is looking at it I can
get it I could get an idea regardless so
yes PHP is a should be viable there's
plenty of work with PHP again I'm not
saying PHP is the best language and
everything else sucks no I'm looking at
it as I look at all my technology
choices whether it be a database whether
it be a programming language whether it
be a coded co-editor whatever whatever
I'm always looking at the business
implications and if I was a business
owner I know that I could get PHP guys
more easily than I could get Ruby guys
or Django guys there's a lot more PHP
jobs out there because of this huge
amount of businesses who work up with
WordPress and other PHP based apps so
it's going to make sense I can guarantee
you if especially you want to get into
freelance work PHP is the king of a
server-side coding
if on the other end you want to go work
for big huge corporations you may want
to get into Java Java spring there might
be more opportunity there for you if you
want to get into the startup world you
might see JavaScript server side or
jangle server side Ruby server side
might be better for you but as I said in
my controversial video I released that a
month ago I wouldn't be learning rails
Ruby now because I think that whole
thing is fading and it's all going
towards it's going to be JavaScript it's
going to be PHP some Django
although PHP is maybe much more
prevalent I think and as it is today and
Java cores for enterprise so there you
go yes if you're looking at server-side
language especially if you're looking at
freelancing PHP is my number one choice
by far and away because of the business
implications because when you you know
one final thing you know it turns to
placate on the Nerds out there I am NOT
saying PHP is the best language ever
each of these languages has their pros
and their cons and you can't look at a
programming language or framework purely
from the point from a technological
point of view you have to consider
business implications because at the end
of these at the end of the day these
languages these frameworks are there to
facilitate business processes that's it
so don't lose sight of that so keep that
in mind you know and understand where
I'm coming from I have written
relatively few lines of PHP code
compared to the amount of Java code I've
written I've written apps over the years
I've written apps in 8 or 9 languages
I've lost track now and some of you've
heard of Java c-sharp PHP just off this
off my head
then VB if you script JavaScript and a6
right there and there's a few more
things you haven't heard of
lingo which is some crazy stupid
language and other things so you know I
am NOT a zealot for PHP I just look at
the market you know I look at the market
all right have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
