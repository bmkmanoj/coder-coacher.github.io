PHP and today what we're going to be
doing is looking at how we can perform
some more advanced operations with MySQL
so this is going to be probably a
ten-part video where we're going to be
starting with just looking at what joins
are in a relational database from there
we're going to be looking at how we can
create constraints to make sure that we
have integrity in our data then we're
going to look at what many people who
design databases call one too many and
then many too many and then creating
views we're going to look at timestamps
we're going to look up back we're going
to look at how we can do backups and
restore data and we're also going to
take a little bit of a peek into the
MySQL search engine so to start off
today what I'm going to do is just look
at joins with you and before we even get
there I'm going to have to introduce
some of the tools I'm going to be
working with today as you've probably
noticed i'm using the i'm using a mac
however all this information and all
these different tools have equivalencies
on a pc whether you're using Linux or
you're using Windows I have a very
simple text editor here I it's called
bbedit there's an equivalent free
version called text wrangler which you
can download if you're on a Mac I'm also
using a a map stack which is to say
essentially I have essentially I have
mysql apache and PHP running on top of
mac OS x there are equivalent versions
of this stack of open source free
software usually if you look up examp
xam PP you can probably get yourself set
up on pretty much any platform again
this is free to download and lastly
we're going to be doing a lot of work
with the terminal and we're going to be
working on the command line because
we're dealing with advanced topics we're
going to want to have to you know we're
going to want to interface directly with
mysql and using the terminal is at the
end of the day the fastest in the
simplest way of actually doing that so
on one
I'm going to be creating SQL scripts
that we're going to work with back and
forth so that we don't lose our place
and on the other hand we're going to
actually be interfacing with MySQL at a
command line level you'll also notice
that I have PHP my admin open just to
show you that you know yes we can
actually double check things using PHP
myadmin so with all of that I say let's
get started so the first thing I want to
do is just show you a bit of some of the
tools we're going to be using with on
the command line the first one is MySQL
and because i'm on a mac and because i
am working specifically with the MAMP
version of mysql i am going to have to
be a little more explicit with my
connection to mysql now I already have
the map server running which you can see
right here so I know it's running but I
want to actually use MySQL s command
line tool to perform all the operations
I need to perform just a note about SQL
in general now a while back Stefan Misha
put together an excellent beginner
introduction to mysql with the focus of
being able to run SQL queries from the
from PHP mainly if you wanted to you
know create records update records and
delete records the goal of this video is
really to kind of broaden that knowledge
and make you kind of more comfortable
with how how to do kind of complex
queries with SQL really use the
relational aspects of relational
database like MySQL where you're
actually using different tables and
you're relating data from one place to
another and lastly if you do get into up
you know object relational mapping
frameworks Oh RMS as they're called
where you're not even dealing with SQL
anymore you've got some other package in
PHP like propel or doctrine that's doing
all that for you that you can actually
debug that code and understand a little
bit of what is being generated for you
on the fly so you won't be totally at a
loss
so in order to access my mysql data is
ql database i'm going to have to
actually use the client and in this case
it's sitting in the map folder under
library under bin for binary and it's
going to be mysql so if i just hit enter
then it's going to show me it's going to
log me in and everything looks okay
however something that I need to kind of
check is if I go show databases I'm
going to notice that there's actually
nothing there whereas if i go back to
get to my PHP myadmin you'll see that i
have a whole bunch of different
databases that i use for development
purposes on my local machine so in order
to make sure that I'm properly accessing
my database I'm going to specify a
username and a password and in this case
it's going to be we're going to use dash
you which is the username flag and then
password is root now this is the default
username and password for mamp and i'm
just going to hit enter so now if I say
show databases semicolon and hit enter
I'm going to get all the databases that
I'm getting here so you can see the same
thing in one place as well as the other
now the first thing I want to do is
actually create a database that we can
work with and then from there we'll be
building up our examples together so I'm
going to create a database k PHP with a
character set of utf-8 and a collation
of utf-8 underscore general underscore
CI now let me just explain that for a
minute essentially the create database
is pretty obvious we're creating a
database it's going to be called k PHP
the character set being utf-8 is just a
default in other words we want to make
sure that all the texts that's being
stored in our database is going to be
encoded using the utf-8 encoding
structure which means that if we have
accents and we have span
characters or French characters that
they're going to be rendered properly
the other thing here is the utf-8
underscore general undersea I and this
is how the ordering of those characters
in the character map this is a pretty
standard collation so it's pretty much
recommended the CI at the end stands for
case insensitive and the utf-8 is just
because it's a utf-8 collation so I'm
just going to finish that off with a
semicolon and now if I go show databases
you should see that there is now a que
PHP database so I'm just going to quit
and this time i'm going to log in and
i'm going to specify my k PHP database
at the command line by just adding k PHP
at the end now if i go show tables I
should see nothing in there but
basically now I'm in the I'm in the
client and I'm also in that database so
now we're working within the K PHP
database now the next thing I want to do
is I want to go back to my bare bones
editor and create an empty SQL file for
the purposes of this tutorial and it's
often helpful just to have an SQL file
lying around that you can work with and
work off of especially if you're dealing
with the command line because the
command line doesn't tend to remember
things very well so in the K PHP SQL
folder that I've created on my desktop
I'm just going to create a SQL file
called joins dot SQL and we're going to
do an introduction to joins so before we
go you know too far along I'm going to
have to create some tables obviously the
first table that I want to make is going
to be a table for categories so we're
going to look at how we would want to
structure a blog let's say we have a
blog and in the blog we have postings
like a particular piece of content and
then we have categories so I want to be
able to have categories for my various
posts now this is called
a one-to-many there is one category and
many posts or many to one you have many
posts that are associated or related to
one category now the advantage of using
and join is that if you decide you want
to change that category name you don't
need to go along and start updating all
sorts of Records for all the posts that
have already been categorized let me try
and illustrate this so I'm going to
start off by saying create table
category we need to start with something
right so I'm going to create a table
called category and actually let me just
bump up my font size here so that it's
nice and clear and that's a little
better okay so here I'm going to say
create table category and it's going to
have an ID which is going to be an
integer and a primary key and it will
also auto increment and what that means
is that every time I do an insert
statement it's going to add a new record
to my category table and also I'm going
to have a name and the name will be a
VAR char in other words it's a field of
variable length of 300 and the engine is
in ODB and I'm going to explain that in
just a minute so let's just go through
this together so this is SQL similar to
what Steph was doing in that other video
except now we're actually describing how
we want this table to look and here
we've got an ID which is going to be our
primary key and just like in PHP you can
have strings you can have objects you
can have integers you can have a raise
well in this case this ID is of type
integer and it's a primary key and what
that means is that mysql is going to pay
special attention to this key or this
column in this database table and we
index it and this will facilitate in
searching and speed things up and we'll
also make sure that there's only one of
every one of those rows in each row can
be accessed from its primary key the
auto increment is a handy little feature
where when I do an insert it
automatically adds one to the existing
ID so the first thing I put in there is
going to have an idea of one the second
thing I put in there is going to have an
ID of two and so on and so forth the VAR
char is again it's a type much like the
integer except it's four strings short
strings and the maximum length of my
strings in this case is going to be 300
the last little bit at the end is
important for relational databases so
here what we're talking about is the
engine the actual structure of our table
and how that's going to be stored and
accessed within mysql think of it as the
difference if you if you remember back
in the day when there was fat 32 in NTFS
you know there was different file
systems and you had you know different
ways of storing data on those file
systems this is a similar kind of
structure where you can have multiple
engines and mysql is is driving those
different engines the nodb engine is the
most current and the one that's
suggested at least at this stage in the
game and it's great for doing exactly
what we want to do today which is
relationships between tables so I'm just
going to select these two lines and hit
copy and I'm going to paste them in here
and I shouldn't get any errors which I
don't which is good and if I say show
tables again I should see that we've got
a category table and if I say describe
category I should see that I've got my
ID and I've got my name and I've got a
primary key with auto increment and if I
do an insert into category
name values politics and then I do
another one let's say International and
then I do a select star from category
then I'm going to have an idea one and
an ID of two and politics and
international so so far so good so now
that we've done this much we're going to
make another table and this table is
going to be for postings and I'm also
going to set up some dummy data here so
we have the category for politics and we
also want a category for international
let's say we want one for technology and
another one for entertainment and
another one for sports this is a very
generic blog we're doing anything and
everything and lastly we're going to
have an other category now i'm also
going to create a new table and this
table is going to be called post and
it's also going to have an ID and
instead of there being a name with a VAR
char of 300 characters there's going to
be a title of our chart 300 but there's
also going to be a content column which
will be of type text which means that it
can be any length if you're coming from
an oracle world this is the this is the
equivalent of a club a large character
blob basically a place where you can put
as much content as you want as much text
content as you want and then i'm going
to have a category ID also of type int
and we'll talk about that in just a
second because that's how we're going to
build our relationships so in order for
this to be nice and easy to work with
i'm going to create some drop statements
and a drop statement basically deletes
or gets rid of a table so i'm going to
say drop table
post a category and drop table post so
if i take my drop table category and
paste it in it will if i go show tables
I won't see anything anymore now I'm
going to take all of this all these SQL
statements and I'm just going to paste
them in one by one and if I say show
tables i should add category and post
and if i do a select star from category
I'm going to have my six categories and
everything looks pretty peachy and if I
describe my post it looks also pretty
good so there we have it now let's start
adding some content to our posts and do
some very simple joints so the first
thing I'm going to do is an insert into
post this time we are going to specify
that we want the title and a category ID
and the values are going to be I don't
know let's say there's a political
posting and it will have a category ID
of one right because we know that
politics is one up here and just going
to create a couple more of these and
then i'm going to create another one and
this is going to be more politics so
it's also going to have a category of
one and you're going to see what i mean
when i say one too many and then there's
going to be some kind of international
news which will of course be category
two and then we're going to have
something related to technology new
iphone apps could you need any more
iphone apps I don't think so but anyways
uh then we also want to have something
about entertainment I don't know Academy
award-winning movies let's try that
for and let's just put something in
about sports olympics 2010 and that
should be good we won't put anything in
the other category so at the top I did a
drop table now if I do draw up table
category it'll say fine but then if i
run it again then it's going to say
error you know 1051 a gnome table
category so in order to get around this
in order to be able to easily paste in
our SQL script as we're building it i'm
going to add if exists to this wonderful
call so it'll say drop table if exists
category and drop table if exists post
so now when i select all this and paste
it into the mysql command line and i do
a la select star on post i'm going to
have the various posts notice that the
content right now is null and it's going
to stay null until we start looking at
the mysql search engine at the end of
this series but you could basically put
anything you want in there so we have
the title we have the content we have
the category ID and then we have select
star from category and we have our six
categories now let's start looking at
how we can join the two pieces of data
together and this is where the one too
many thing becomes a little more
interesting so let's say I wanted to get
all of the politics postings right then
I could do something like I could do a
select star from let's see how we could
do this actually let's just start with
just a simple joint so if i wanted to
just join the posts to the categories
then it would be as simple as saying
select star from post p left join
category c on p
d dot category ID equals cid now let me
just explain this for a second so the
light select star from post p i think we
can I think you've seen this before
basically what we're doing is we're just
saying select every column from the
table post now this little p here means
that i want to actually start referring
to the post table as just p it's an
alias it's a shortcut so that select
star from post p the left join is what
we're going to be doing where we're
basically just taking one table and then
gluing it to another table and we're
going to be left joining with the
category table and it's going to have a
shortcut of c and we're going to glue
the two together using p category ID
which is the post category ID when the
post category ID is equal to the
category ID so it's very important that
the to line up so if i hit enter then
i'm going to get essentially the join
that i was talking about where we have
the political postings and their
category name and we have international
news and it's got the international
category and we've got the new iphone
apps and they're in the technology
section and the academy award-winning
movies and so on and so forth so that's
a just a quick introduction into left
joins we're going to be looking at how
they compare to outer joins and or what
what's called a right join a left join
has also called an inner join in the
next video and then we're going to start
looking at constraints i'm john leben
