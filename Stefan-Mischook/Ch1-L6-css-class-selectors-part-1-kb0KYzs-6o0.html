selectors we're going to learn about a
new type of selector in CSS something
called the class a selector so what do I
mean by class while class selector is
short for a classification selector so
what's a classification another word for
classification is kind hey I and D or
maybe style so let me give you an
example let's go to the search engine
and let's look up musical styles you
know you got different musical artists
out there i got jay-z Beyonce led
zeppelin you know who would what do you
guys listen to nowadays justin bieber
i'm sure you guys love Justin Bieber
anyway so he's from Canada to all right
so let's look at beyond seas musical
style so she sings so she performs R&amp;amp;B
music let's say who else who else is big
today well I'm just going to go with
people I know Led Zeppelin music style
blues British folk so they did did a
bunch of different styles of music so
and then you have like I guess jay-z is
rap music so you got rock and roll blues
music you have R&amp;amp;B music so each of
these styles and music you can call
classes of music so it's like a
classification so anybody who does rock
and roll like Led Zeppelin ac/dc bands
like that if you could classify them as
rock and roll let they do rock and roll
music anybody does rap internal M&amp;amp;M
jay-z I guess they do rap music that's
the genre that's the style that's the
class of music that they do I hope that
makes sense so when you're creating a
class in CSS you're creating a style if
you will you're creating a CSS style
that can then be applied to any tags in
your page so let me get into some code
here so you see here we
have our tag selectors now the thing
with the tag selectors if you set up
these rules they apply to all the H ones
in your page let's say you wanted to
have a special style for just the first
heading in your page not all the other H
ones in the page while pretenders rh1 so
okay let's pretend there is a to H ones
here okay there we go so let's say you
wanted to have a special style just for
this h1 and not for this h1 now you
couldn't do that with the tag selector
because this tag selector selects not
just the first h1 and a page it selects
all the H ones in your page right that's
the problem so to solve that we can use
a class selector so let me show you what
that is so to save time I'm just going
to copy and paste this I'm going to
create a class selector and i'm going to
call it super h 1 let me say that so I
know it's a class because whenever you
put a period in front of a word or could
you and just be one letter but usually
you want to put a word that tells you
something about the class also in a
super h 1 this is a class so what you
can do now is you can apply this rule to
any tag on the page doesn't not just
aged ones if you applied to your
paragraphs your body whatever so let's
change a few things so let's first well
keep the color green we'll keep the font
size let's reduce the font size to 32
and let's give it a background color and
we'll say it's large all right there we
go so now we've created a new class
super h one color green that's the font
color green while it's a text color
green set the font size to 32 but we
gave it a background color of orange so
now how do we apply this class pretty
simple i'm just going to copy and paste
it when I say go here and you go class
equals and I put in the name super age
one
and there you go so now what's going to
happen is all this CSS code will apply
will work on this particular h1 here why
because I assigned it the class a super
h 1 so let's open it up
I'm just going to size it up so it looks
good so here you go we've applied a
class now we can apply this class to
multiple items on the same page let's
apply to this paragraph as well though
there we go you see what I mean so with
a class selector it starts with a period
plus the selector the class selector
name and then just like with the tag
selector you have your opening and your
closing curly brackets and then you
start putting in your CSS code your
properties and their values and away you
go and then to apply this class you
actually have to go to whatever tag that
you want to apply this class to then you
have to write class equals open quotes
close quotes and the class name then our
bad will continue in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
