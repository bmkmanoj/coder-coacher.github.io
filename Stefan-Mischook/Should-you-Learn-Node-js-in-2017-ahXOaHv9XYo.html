2017 now I'm recording this in December
2016 but I figure since 2017 is about 28
days away we're going to talk about 2017
and again like everything else I talked
about what I talked about should you
learn this language or that language or
this framework or patch framework it all
comes down to two things a comes down to
the type of work that you want to do and
B whether or not there is those type of
jobs available to you in your area
now node.js just in case you don't know
is a server-side engine it's in an
engine JavaScript engine and adoption
and adoption or not and that an
adaptation rather of a googles of
Google's JavaScript engines for recall
and it's super high-performance super
fast and it's used in in a synchronous
application development basically if you
need to really build a fast messaging
system this is where node will shine
that's it beware of that node and
server-side JavaScript now node you you
write node with JavaScript of course
node and server-side JavaScript is still
a moving target so a lot of libraries of
experimental or changing a lot so you
can spend a big time big amount of time
in configurations and so forth dealing
with conflicting packages and that kind
of stuff
I had long conversations with a good
friend of mine who did he wrote a a core
part of their app with node so he gave
me a lot of information so what el comes
down to is that it is still a moving
target it's super fast and performant
but it's something that I wouldn't
necessarily jump into if I wanted to
become a freelance web developer again
PHP stove by far and away is king node
is much more performant PHP or so or
other
environments Java definitely Ruby Ruby
on Rails Python Jo it's more performant
at runtime but these other frameworks
would be Python Django PHP laravel and
any many if not all of the other PHP
frameworks Ruby rails Java spring
accelerator they may be not as
performant but they're much more mature
much more stable and so easier in a
sense again involved with it
so to find a question I want to bring up
is the the major attractiveness in that
if you use node nodejs
and perhaps a framework that sits on top
of node.js so I go Express which is a
kind of an MVC framework that sits on
top of node again I have not used these
I'm just telling you what I've heard
from people and did some looking around
I'm giving you my perspective as a coder
of encoding from the 90s again these are
technologies that really only give you
an advantage if you have an app required
really fast high performant messaging
and most of us don't need that in that
case I would poke around if you're
interested in node and start playing
around with it a little bit here and
there so you have an idea what it can do
and how it works but I think in terms of
most apps these days I would still go
what are more established frameworks at
this point in time as I said peach fee
django PHP lair assuming python django
PHP laravel two top choices I was doing
Java I've talked about Java member
videos Joe spring etc etc Ruby Ruby on
Rails simply because new still it offers
a advantages only in a very small slice
those high performing apps that you may
want to build and you won't see those
advantages expressed in most
applications I mean it's just kind of
like having a super-fast CPU on your
computer unless you're using that CPU
you're pushing it hard to do some heavy
duty processing you won't see the
difference
Queen you know a CPU is 2.7 gigahertz
versus a 2.2 game Hertz CPU same thing
with node and nodejs
versus say PHP laravel or Python Django
so yeah oh yeah final attractiveness the
thing people kind of like the idea of
using Noah because it's written so
JavaScript which means when you're using
javascript you rage within the web
browser word that's where JavaScript
traditionally runs is within the web
browser you have one programming
language rather than having to like if
you do work with PHP and laravel for
instance you're going to be writing
JavaScript on your for your web browser
because PHP doesn't run in a web browser
and then you're going to be using PHP
often enough to communicate with pete
usually going to be using javascript
often to compute communicate with PHP on
the server side or using javascript in
the web browser and communicate with
python on the server side etc etc now
here's the thing it may sound that it
may sound like writing JavaScript on the
client meaning of web browser and ready
on the server gives you a certain
advantage in terms of fact you only
using one programming language which
you're going to find if you get deeper
into programming is that the differences
between between the languages is not the
complexity it's the differences between
the the frameworks around the languages
that makes a language is harder to jump
into so for the most part so I don't see
a significant advantage in having
JavaScript on the client and JavaScript
on the server it could be some advantage
but it's not significant because if
you've learned any programming language
you know that to jump from say Python
Python or PHP and then to learn
JavaScript it's no big deal it's no big
deal too hard part about learning
JavaScript is understanding the
JavaScript Dom document option model how
javascript is you submit the Dom that's
about it so there you go note join here
for high performing acts if you're
looking to get a lot of work check to
see if there's a lot of
demand in your area and depending you
know they made this they may need you
have more than just know the experience
it may need you in no jobs to have comps
I'd agree I don't know and you know and
also check to see what kind of work you
want to do because if you're inclined to
freelancing like so many people watch
this channel are then no it's not going
to get you any jobs it's still going to
be by far and away PHP with WordPress
PHP with you PHP with true pal but we're
pressed being most dominant so there you
go
no it's cool moving target you
understand I hope it's useful to you
