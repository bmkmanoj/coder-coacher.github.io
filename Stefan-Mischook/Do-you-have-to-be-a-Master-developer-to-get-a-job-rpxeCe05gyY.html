okay I'm going to answer a question that
I got sent to me by email and we'll take
it from there hold on a second the
question okay is it okay that I'm not a
professional in these technologies HTML
CSS JSP SP and can I make money I don't
feel like I'm good enough bla bla bla
bla this is somebody who is looking at
WordPress development but I think it
goes to any type of development I
suppose not I suppose those are any type
of development here's the misconception
a lot of beginners at software
development may have they may think that
they have to be 100% knowledgeable about
each of these languages HTML CSS
JavaScript PHP or some other back-end
language would reject Java or C sharp or
Ruby or Python what not depend on what
you want to do it talked about this and
many other vlogs bottom line is that you
don't have to be an expert in each of
these languages you have to have
competent knowledge meaning you're able
to build some apps with them so since
we're talking about HTML CSS JavaScript
able to stick to PHP since one subject
here you just have to be comfortable
with them nuts 100% knowledge will not
know everything about the libraries not
all know all the various variations of
the tags and every CSS rule ever
invented that you'll get into as you
develop projects the key to development
is just to have a baseline level of
skill so you so that you can produce and
then you just go from there that's why I
always emphasize the basics in my course
my courses my course is on my course but
my course is because
the key to learning all the stuff again
it's always in having a firm
understanding of the basic concepts and
techniques so you understand what you
know functions and arrays and collection
types iteration you understand
object-oriented programming you
understand good structure for your apps
and so on what you're going to discover
discover as you get into app development
or WordPress professional development
we're talking about that is that you're
going to always be not always but you're
going to be learning new things along
the way it's very typical for even the
most experienced developer so have to
learn a new library or figure out a new
API etc as the projects come to them
which separates the novice programmers
from the expert programmers is how they
approach an app in terms of reading it
and how they structure their code not it
not in terms of of how many libraries
they know right so let me say - say that
again try to be more clear what
separates the professional developers
from the amateurs professionals write
professional code not that they know
more libraries they write professional
code and I'll give you an example back
in the 90s when I was learning
programming for first time and I learned
I think it was either JavaScript was my
first language or as my second language
and Java Java just came out and what I
did for quite a while underwater six
months or so as I just read books on a
JavaScript a few that there were and
what did he speak used the computer
books and somebody would come to me and
say how do you do this in jumps with
massage you just use this dysfunction
here you do this there you know I had a
pretty good theoretical understanding of
what was involved in terms of the
JavaScript what what the libraries were
and so forth but I remember sitting down
at the computer for
first times actually write JavaScript
code and I couldn't do it even though I
knew all these libraries and I if you
want to do this you just go here but I
couldn't write code because it didn't
write code and that was a confirmation
something I had learned originally in
martial arts that what separates the
great fighters from the not-so-great
fighters the great fighters have a great
understanding and deep understanding of
the basic the basics of fighting timing
tactics power speed etc expanders do
other things as well not the number of
techniques you have what you see in
martial arts see that these people will
know like hundreds of hundreds of
techniques dozens of forms but they
couldn't fight their way out of a paper
bag a small little kitten would give
them a hard time meanwhile you can have
a well trained Thai boxer or a well
trained boxer I'm just throwing this out
which you know they have very simple or
a limited number of techniques in the
traditional sense but because they
actually trained to fight and they
understand timing tactics and they
develop their speed and their power and
their mental and physical conditioning
these are all the things that really
make a great fighter not the number
techniques because you'll see in martial
arts and all different styles usually a
fighter will have one or two maybe three
techniques that they do really well they
just pull off over and over and over
again and they're quite effective now as
a professional fighter you have to be
aware of you know the whole the whole
game you have to be aware of what people
might try to pull on you so that you can
defend against it if you really observe
the great fighters they usually just do
a handful of things and that's it when
they actually execute in the ring
software development is similar in the
sense where the again you can take a
great an advanced programmer and put
them in any programming environment any
framework even old stuff put them on old
java servlets and pojos and they'll
produce a good app even though it's a
very little technology versus a noob who
jumps into cutting-edge nodejs ando
produced garbage code because they're
just beginners so back to the original
question do you have to be a master of
all these languages to be able to be a
professional developer go out there make
money no but as a developer who's new to
the game your level of your productivity
level rather is much more limited than
somebody who makes who's got a few years
experience on you who's able to work
much more quickly much more efficiently
the code is better so they're going to
command more money for their time versus
a beginner but that's just the way it
goes you start off you start off for a
couple projects you don't make anything
you do freebies and you start making you
know minimal amounts and you move up
from there I'm not specifying dollar
math because it depends on where you
live right if you're in India there's a
you know entry-level developer will make
X if you're in North America an
entry-level developer will make Y etc
etc because it cost of living and so on
right to rent or buy a place in
different parts of India is going to be
cheaper than buying some place in San
Francisco to cite extreme examples
anyway I hope that helps bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
