and other sites so in this D blog I want
to talk about learning to code the fear
of learning to code somebody emailed me
recently and it's not the first email I
got of this type where they were
concerned about whether or not they
could actually learn to code it can seem
very daunting I know for a beginner
because there is so much to learn well
it seems like there's so much to learn
you know you start off which language do
you learn do you learn PHP do you learn
Python do you learn JavaScript do you
learn Java do you learn to c-sharp
actually you have to learn everything no
you don't you don't have to learn
everything as I keep emphasizing in many
of my videos the key to all this stuff
is concentrating on the basics that's
very important that you learn the basics
because whether you end up writing
JavaScript code Java code PHP Python
whatever all these languages share many
of the same basic techniques same basic
concepts so for example if you learn
variables functions arrays objects in
JavaScript you will have learned all
these things in PHP in Java in Python in
c-sharp pick any modern programming
programming language and this is what
you get so try not to be so fearful try
not to feel overwhelmed in terms of what
you need to learn the key is is finding
a good course or a good class where they
teach you two key components of
development whether it be for web
development whether it be for Android
development iOS development whatever
environment you wish to develop in the
key is to figure it out what are the key
aspects of that but if you go back a
little bit and you just look at basic
programming in general a good course
will teach you the key concepts the key
techniques of
and I mentioned a bunch of things as
well as well I just mentioned a couple
things a few seconds ago
so it goes on from there so try not to
be too nervous about it there's two
things that you should take away when it
comes to learning code number one you
don't need to learn everything in fact
you need to just learn subset so I would
suggest that if you were doing iOS
development all you really need to learn
is Swift right and of course
Xcode which is the app that Apple gives
away that allows you to write all your
Swift code to create iOS apps if on the
other hand you wanted to do web
development you have to learn a little
bit more to it it's actually less
complex than it sounds and you have to
learn html5 css3 and a bit of JavaScript
and then you have a choice from there
you can either choose to go into PHP
into deeper JavaScript server-side
JavaScript or Python or Java these are
not things you have to learn these are
things you have a choice of all these
different languages the point is that
you see all these technologies out there
all these frameworks and packages and
languages you don't have to learn all of
them in fact you don't have to learn
much of them you just have to learn some
of them but most important you have to
learn just the key basics and some key
best practices in coding best practices
is basically strategies in coding that
you have to implement regardless of the
language kind of like boxers when you're
boxing you learn I did boxing for a
while you have to learn you got to keep
your hands up at all times a lot of
people get lazy and your hands go down
and you get knocked out you get hurt you
get your nails broke I got my nose broke
three times because I was I would get
lazy so you gotta learn to keep your
hands up at all times when you're
throwing a same thing with coding with
coding there are basic rules if you will
basic things you have to do we call them
best practices and these are things you
have to learn after you learn the basics
so any good coding course will teach
these things that weave them into the
basic training as you go
through the material so yes I wouldn't
be too concerned about that eh you don't
have to learn everything and be once you
understand all these basics and I just
talked about a few other little things
but once you learn these things as a
professional developer you will be
learning as you go that it's it's
expected it's expected that as you
develop projects you have to learn this
you may have to learn a little bit of
this you may have to learn a little bit
of that let me give you an example so in
my coding career in specially in early
years well man about the year of the
early years I was doing a lot of Java
work well in the from 96 and up I was
starting to do a lot of Java work and at
first I would sort of look at everything
as being a java solvable problem so I go
in and say okay how can we use Java to
solve this clients problems and when I
got more experience I realized that was
the wrong approach the real approach was
to go what coding language or what
environment what framework out there
would be best suited to solve the
client's problem sometimes I would use
Java of course I was especially in the
early years I was biased to use Java
because that was my favorite language I
knew it the best but later on I started
learning that math sometimes you might
have to use some other things so
sometimes I look at a project and PHP
mates and sometimes I look at a project
and Java made sense sometimes other
wacky technologies you never heard of
would make sense it really depended on
the job so if I was looking at your
career let's say you were telling me
well stuff I want to be an iOS game
developer so I suppose it's obvious
obvious solution you got to learn Swift
right but maybe you might say to me well
I want to develop apps for iOS business
apps but I also want to do mobile in
general I like to do Java as well so she
you might think to yourself I have to
learn Swift and Java if you want to do
Android development as well as iOS I've
said no if you wanted to just do
business apps then you can do all that
pretty easily with the html5 stack
that's html5 css3 and JavaScript and you
can build incredibly complex and
beautiful mobile apps for all platforms
using those those languages and this
will save you a lot of time so you won't
have to learn all Swift and they're all
Java and then learning the api's rather
than that you just do in html5 and use a
translation layer something called
Cordova is an example and there are
others anyway I'm going down attention
the point is is that in your career you
will have to learn some new things you
will have to adapt yourself dependent on
the circumstances that come up but what
you find is as you do more and more
projects as you learn more and more
things your ability to learn new
technologies will just accelerate
considerably so I learnt this first time
actually martial arts yeah the first
martial art you do to get to your black
belt or the equivalent takes a long time
takes three three years the five years
depending on the school depending on how
hard you train so on but after that you
will find that you can get up to a very
high level and a new style very quickly
because you already have that basis you
are already have that background you
have the timing you have the tactics you
know a lot of the body mechanics and a
lot of these martial arts share a lot of
techniques of all they look at it from a
different point of view
same thing with coding if you know Java
really well for you to jump into
JavaScript will be pretty simple for you
to jump to python pretty simple for you
to jump into c-sharp pretty simple and
so on and so forth so don't be too
concerned don't be too fearful about
learning development learning
programming just take your time you
reach some bumps at first
trust me I'm a nerd who-who was not a
nerd to begin with I know I may look
like a nerd but trust me my mind was
much more of a designer type so once I
just sat down and started writing code
and slowly started building little
UPS and slowly started building
medium-sized apps and then building a
couple big apps you know that's how you
learn you're gonna it's going to be
incremental and you'll see just gets
easier as you go along so at first when
you first started learning don't worry
about it too much just just keep at it
you know that's pretty much it I hope
