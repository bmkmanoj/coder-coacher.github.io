building your very first web app so
maybe just run through the points that's
going to address this guy's question so
so you've done a few online tutorials
some basic project tutorials you know
the basics of html5 css3 javascript PHP
and but you don't know how to do things
off the top of your head somebody said
to you okay let's set up a framework an
MVC framework like Lehr eval you're
still going to have to refer to notes
maybe go check out a video on it just to
remind yourself or maybe setting up a
database whatever this is normal when
you're first starting out and in fact
for first few projects you're gonna be
even with the basic structure of things
your database your for your MVC frame or
whatever you're gonna be referring to
online tutorials you might be asking
questions on forms you might be you know
going to videos
that's normal that's just you know part
of web development but in time you will
get better
you're gonna develop more and more skill
sets and eventually these things will
become easy for you you'll be able to
set up zen-like not saying you'll be
able to set up your framework like this
you'll be able to design your database
without having to refer to you know
documentation how to best design a
database etc etc etc but I can guarantee
you even though you will be able to do
those things without having to refer to
outside sources of information you will
still find things in your project where
you're gonna have to do research this is
just the way goals with development so
active developers even the best world
are always checking out forums
researching watching new videos reading
new books this is just the way it goes
so don't worry about it
but again the good thing is you become
more experienced you you're going to
know more and more and more so you know
to do this a little bit less and you're
gonna be actually quicker at researching
because you're gonna have a better idea
of how to look for things what to look
for and so on and it would just become
easier and easier that's why experienced
developers are actually in the end much
cheaper than beginners because an
experienced developer will be able to
yeah zero in on something and get to the
solution right away so yeah that's the
way that goes one of the point what you
find over time is should develop more
and more skills you'll start forgetting
other stuff there's only so much you can
fit in your brain at least for me anyway
so keep that in mind don't worry about
you forget stuff that's just normal you
the key is to really just have a good
understanding of the basics the basic
principles the basic structures good
practices so you understand the basics
of MVC you understand how to write clean
code these kind of things stay with you
the details about the syntax or the
details about this framework or that
code it's not super important as long as
you have an understanding the basic
principles and ideas and you can execute
these things will come very quickly so
that's pretty much it I hope that
answered the question if you're the guy
who put it to me and you're watching
this and I hope everybody else finds it
