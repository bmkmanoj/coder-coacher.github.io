we're going to be talking about is
working with layer styles and there are
a number of places that you can access
layer styles as you'll see will access
them through the layers window a little
effects icon right here there's also a
Styles window that you can access as
well but we'll get to that in due time
to start with I want you to choose to
create and as you can see here I've got
just this light brown color doesn't
really matter you can go to your
swatches you can choose any color in
particular that you would like and what
you'll notice is that once we apply some
of these styles while these colors are
not really going to be all that
applicable but nevertheless choose a
color whatever color you like and you'll
notice here I'm going to take from the
vector drawing tools well let's just
take one of these rounded rectangles and
if you remember from the lessons on
vector drawing I'm just choosing to
create as you can see here a very basic
shape layer so I've got the shape layer
here's a rounded rectangle I can hold
shift if I want to make a perfect square
or i could just actually make a rounded
rectangle so what you can see here in
your layer palette we've got the shape
layer that we created simply by choosing
this option here when using the drawing
tool now if you're working with
everything at default which is exactly
what we have here and all you've got is
a little icon showing you the color
you'll notice there's a little line
around it but if you remember once we
click on the stage and deselect that
particular item again because i'm using
auto select layer if i click on the
stage here I'm deselecting the item and
we don't see that little path around it
so let's just select this item right
here and what we can choose to do at
this point is to click on the effects
little icon right there and you'll
notice that there are some effects now
we're not going to talk about blending
options right now but we will talk about
things like drop shadow check it out if
I come in here and i click on drop
shadow what it now shows me is that I'm
going to have the option of applying a
layer style I can choose to make this
active or inactive and you can see just
by doing that what happens in the live
update on the stage in your canvas right
here well you'll notice that we have
some drop shadow information and there's
a preview that's going on here you can
uncheck that preview if you wish however
as you'll see here we're working with
black which is set to multiply mode now
multiply mode is going to help it to
create that overlay effect that we see
here now if this was in normal mode
wouldn't really show up all that
different because it is sort of blurry
and it is sort of made opaque as you can
see here so we can slide this back and
forth I'm going to keep it at multiply
though and as you'll see if you slide
these things it's a great way to sort of
get your head around what exactly is
happening and more importantly it allows
you to fool around with the basic
settings because when you're working
with layer Styles you don't want to be
too obvious with them you don't always
want your shadows and your angles to be
in a certain direction or have the
opacity always set to you know the
default which is a fine but you know
it's okay to fool around with these and
it's okay to mess with them notice this
the angle is indicating light source on
this particular image so as you can see
here if the light source was coming from
the left hand side it would be casting a
shadow that would fall on the bottom of
the right hand side now if you wish you
can move that around check it out if I
move it over to this side you can see
that now the light source is coming from
here casting a shadow there just as easy
as doing this if I put it exactly
straight up for example i can say 90 and
you'll see that the drop shadow is
reacting as if the light source was
coming directly from the top now what
about the distance of that particular
item here I'm just going to move it over
here so you can see it being cast this
way you'll notice the distance indicates
well
are from the ground is my object in
other words how far is it casting the
shadow so as you can see if I really
exaggerate that that's way far away or I
can bring that even closer as we see
here also notice that you have something
called spread which is you know doing
what you might imagine it would do and
the spread will indicate how far your
gradient is created or in other words
you see sort of like a fuzziness around
that area and here I'll just move it out
like that the spread indicates as you
can see exactly how much of that you've
got going on here and there are times
when you don't want to have any of that
and if you just keep it down at zero
you'll have something close to what the
default is if you increase the size you
can see how that blurriness is really
going to be affected here so even if you
have the spread at zero if you decrease
the size 20 as well well that is going
to give you a much cleaner edge to your
drop shadow so you see no matter where
you end up creating that drop shadow
this one is instead something that is
not as now notice that so yeah if I
could put the opacity to 100% you'll
notice that of course it's not as fuzzy
as it was before and it's giving you a
harder edge so that's a little bit about
working with the drop shadow layer style
let's come back and we'll explore some
of the other ones as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
