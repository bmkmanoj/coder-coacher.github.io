YouTube question in a vlog video because
it's just easier so Nick hey said said
great vlog as always thank you Nick I am
a beginner programmer at the ripe age of
58 and I was wondering if there would be
work for people of my advanced years I
believe so I think it depends on the
type of programming that you do and this
is something you got to do in terms of
research in your geographical area see
what's out there see what people are
doing in terms of coding and my goal is
58 this could be certain options that
won't be available to you like I would
imagine startups we're probably not one
a 50 year old
beginner but you probably have skills in
another in another profession that might
be relevant so for example I'm just
using this as an example if you were an
accountant and by profession or by trade
and then you learn how to program then
you probably be very valuable for
companies who are writing software for
accounting firms you get the idea as you
have what they call domain knowledge so
that's something to consider so yeah
there is going to be working is going to
have to figure out what niche would make
sense for you we continue I initially
started with Python it's a great starter
language as I written and blogged about
rather in several videos python is very
popular in education because the syntax
the code the Python code is very
readable these like English especially
when you compared to languages like PHP
or Java as examples let me continue but
what you say in this video makes a lot
of sense to me the web is all pervasive
now so learning the three core languages
CSS HTML javascript seem the way to go I
do like Python a lot though I had to
play with the sizing of the window
because Firefox is a real buggy browser
anyway so let me continue
I do like Python a lot though the coding
is much easier to learn yeah
Python is very easy to learn compared to
say JavaScript or Java or PHP let me
continue would you advocate learning
Python alongside the other three as a
fineness of coding stuff up in Python
first ie prototype like I'm encoding in
JavaScript subsequently do you think
this is a good plan for analysis well
pythons use case is quite a bit
different in most of the time than CSS
HTML Javascript Python is used in
server-side coding yes they do have a
web framework Django and flask at No 2
web web frameworks but pythons use a lot
of AI programming is used a lot in
server automation use a lot in
computational and Sciences for report
generation number crunching well CSS
HTML javascript or not CSS javascript or
strictly web languages and javascript
recently with projects like node have
been pushed to server-side coding to
compete with things like PHP Java and
Python you know when you think about
Python Django but you could still be
learning Python at the same time as
you're learning the other languages
because Python and JavaScript are both
object oriented and while they do share
object-oriented techniques and
principles but they are very different
as well you could learn concept with
Python and then live those concepts in
JavaScript although the implementation
the way you do it in JavaScript
generally speaking is a little bit more
a little bit more difficult because of
the nature of JavaScript code JavaScript
syntax so yeah you could learn Python
alongside but I don't see yourself
prototyping in Python and encoding in
JavaScript with some exception maybe
games are you creating games and stuff
it might be quicker to prototype them in
Python because you got packages like Pi
game and stuff with modules like pi game
rather than Python and make creating
games
easy but then again I'm sure these
things are exist in JavaScript I haven't
look recently any jazz with gaming
engines but Java so it could be is quite
a bit for
writing games as well in web browsers I
hope this answers the question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
