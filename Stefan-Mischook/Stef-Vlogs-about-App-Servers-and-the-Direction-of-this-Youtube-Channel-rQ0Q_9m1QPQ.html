just going to be a vlog nothing more and
for whatever reasons I decided not to
film my face so you can look at this
pretty snake in front of us if you think
today the big server move should be
happening I am just in case you don't
know I am moving off of a wall the last
of dedicated servers and we're trying a
new virtual virtual private server
hosting company and they seem pretty
good we transferred a couple of sites
over last week and we had a little bit
of a hiccup there but everything is up
and running and looks pretty good so far
so we're going to be transferring over
the rest of the rest of the sites and
the apps so if you are on one of my
services you may see a slight hiccup two
more also please bear with us if that
happens once in a while when you do
server migrations your going to have
some problems like this is to be
expected I suppose but we'll be back up
and running much quicker much safer once
this is done now this is a big milestone
for me because because this will
essentially allow me to take the hosting
and server management out of my hair out
of our hair really I don't have to have
people look after that for me I used to
run servers in my closet back in the 90s
if you can imagine that I had actual
startups running their apps in my
servers which were in my closets in my
place and I had big battery backups no I
had it like an hour battery backup so so
stay in a pretty big gamble there that
the power never went off for more than
an hour and yeah but it was
windows-based largely I didn't do too
much Linux administration so now with
modern hosting I am always on Linux my
linux skills are very
and to be honest with you I have so many
things on my plate I don't have time to
want to become oolitic s-- administrator
and the conundrum um faced with is that
because what we do is pretty stable and
simple the need to have a Linux
administrator full-time would make no
sense because we just don't have that
need so I've been looking at various
cloud providers to be able to provide
not just the cloud services but also the
turnkey fully managed server experience
now and I'm on digital ocean which is
very good very excellent very reliable
good tools but it's also in digital
ocean is a is a cloud service provider
now the problem with digital motion in
AWS you don't really know what you're
doing it's kind of like step backwards
there's an assumption you're going to
have Linux administrators working for
you and you know again if you if you
have an infrastructure where you have
those kind of funds or you know how to
do that or it's justifiable to spend
that kind of money then I guess that
makes sense but you know there's a hole
here in terms of the market where that
you should be able to get a virtual
private server a cloud-based hosting
solution for yourself and have the
turnkey fully managed solution and
digitalocean doesn't do it AWS doesn't
do it starts another Google one doesn't
do it but I found one of it does in fact
it's a company that I used to I used to
I still have my last of my dedicated
servers I've been with them for 10 or 15
years something like that in between
10-15 years anyway so we're moving over
to their VPS virtual private server and
it's turnkey I got a problem to take
care of it's a guidance they add they
patch it they backup to restore they
take care of all that stuff
firewall management the whole nine yards
so it's very cool it's like having a
full time server expert they're working
for you without having to have a server
at first you know
so there we go so I'm pretty excited
about of a big move because it really
psychologically and we take a monkey off
my back because of my physical dedicated
server there was a single point of
failure as it discussed before meaning
yeah I've had a dedicated box where a
bunch of apps on their sites and if the
RAM failed the CPU fail the power
supply's out whatever had a single point
of failure in fact it happened a couple
years ago one of the hard drives failed
now it was fully managed so they're able
to go in there and get it back up in 15
minutes but that's unacceptable by
today's standards that's got to go away
and I think the days of dedicated
physical servers are numbered numbered
it makes no sense everything should be
cloud everything sure everything should
be virtualized this is so much safer and
more convenient no downtime so there you
go all right so enough of this vlog I
wanted to get your feedback I want to
know whether or not you guys would me to
go into different languages which I
could do but there's a lot of stuff out
there in terms of YouTube videos on
whether it be node or Java or something
I was thinking maybe going deeper into
Python now that my beginners powerful
Python 3 course is essentially out I'm
still we're still waiting to get the
final changes down to the killer video
store we're going to be doing so many
skinning updating you know this logo
here with the Frog and this thistle goes
back I don't know 15 years so I've
decided I'm going to bring in my top
designer and we're going to look at
revamping this logo for first time in
many years and are some other things
that have to be done so this isn't ready
yet to go live for the general public
because we're just going to revamp the
store just a scheduling issue why isn't
done already so we should have a
celebration meanwhile which means I can
extend I will extend I am extending this
pre-order of the beginners Python course
if you want only
two dollars when the final thing goes
live I believe that's going to be the
price which is still missing the price
I've had people tell me why you're
charging so little but mine I might put
it up internal damage so still here for
a little while you pre-order and I'll
just send you access so you can get to
it yeah here download credentials anyway
so I want to know what you guys think in
terms of in terms of content what would
you prefer would you prefer a more
coding more database or would you like
more business-oriented
pure business or oriented discussions
entrepreneur oriented discussions I've
been doing I've been home foreigner
since 2001 2000 since I was 18 so I've
actually have even more experience as
entrepreneur when I do as a developer by
a few years um another thing I wanted to
see what you guys thought of well I
think I'm going to do it I think I'm
going to put more effort into audio-only
presentations now I'm doing this as a
video now because it's YouTube but I'm
thinking of putting together
why will be decided told my team once we
get to revamp of the store and a few
other things so basically for the next
few weeks
I plan on a consistent output of
podcasts of audio only presentations so
that people who listen on a go they will
have that so that's something we can
discuss as well and let me know it you
know this vlogging idea you know we just
log about your day and stuff I don't
know some people are interested in that
I have to tell you I still find kind of
weird being a middle-age nerd I find it
kind of weird that people but but again
then I think about it and then it's not
really not that weird because if this is
you know gone on for ages a lot of
people would tune in to why certain
talk-show hosts and stuff because they
just enjoy you know like I would like
listening to David Letterman for
instance I can see what's going on with
that guy type of thing you know and so
perhaps perhaps that's the
for some people out there let me know if
a vlog format would be better for you
another video vlog or audio vlog podcast
and just give me some feedback because
now that the big server move is done now
that the Python course is pretty much
done just my editors doing some final
changes and stuff I'm gearing up now to
see and also City web 3.1 is done just
has to be deployed a lot of my work is
now finished would have been looking at
at least for the last several months so
that that's now done so I have time to
sort of refocus where I'm going to put
my efforts in terms of what we're going
to put my efforts and a lot of it's
going to be in terms of creative I have
to decide what I'm going to do all those
hours and hours and hours I was putting
into the Python course that's good which
is cool so now I don't know what to do
I'm thinking like I said business vlogs
business podcasts vlogs or daily vlogs
should I emphasize video or audio more
technology discussions or more more
courses I don't know give me some
feedback and let me know and I'll see
what I can do
no promises though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
