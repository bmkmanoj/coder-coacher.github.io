with killer sights calm in this video I
want to give you a basic overview of
what SSL is SSL is short for secure
socket layer and it is basically a
certificate that is applied to your
website to make it secure for online
transactions so let me translate that
into English essentially you get the
certificate and it's a an encoded bunch
of text and it basically allows you to
secure encode encrypt the information
that's going from your website to the
web server it's most commonly used in
online credit card processing so that
when somebody enters in their credit
card information and they hit submit
when it's transmitted over the Internet
it is transmitted in a encrypted manner
so that if somebody were to intercept
that interaction between the website and
the web server they would just get a
bunch of encrypted information rather
than people's credit card numbers for
instance another application that you
see SSL apply to a lot is online banking
sites okay now that I've given you the
nerd explanation I'm just going to give
you a quick example of what SSL is all
about so we're gonna go to the killer
video store comm where we sell our video
packages and of course we take in credit
card information so let's add something
today cart and here we go now right now
if you look at the URL on the website
address you see WWE killer video store
com
add-to-cart PHP this is not secure
because it's just wwl there's no
indication or indicator that it's
actually a secure site even though it
says secure shopping this is not
encrypted using SSL so let me show you
what I mean by that so if we hit the
check out this is actually going to take
us to the secure part of the site so
there you go and why is this part of the
site secure any other because this is
actually a different website look at the
URL up here at the address you notice
you see secure dot killer video store
com
that is a different web address and just
killer video store comm and another
reason you know well the main reason
that you know that it's secure actually
is because you see this HTTPS you see
normal web sites
it's just HTTP so let me give you an
example so I'm going to go here new site
so I'm gonna type in HTTP HTTP colon
World Wide Web
Oh : / / well why web dot killer sites
that takes us to killer size calm now if
I go in here and I try to tell the web
browser but we're gonna go to a secure
version of killer sites calm which is
HTTP s SS for secure watch what happens
secure connection failed why because we
don't have that set up we don't have the
site to be set up to be secure and
that's pretty much it it doesn't exist
but if we go to the killer video store
you see HTTP works now if I had set up a
secure site on the server but my
certificate and you have
go by the ssl the secure socket layer
SSL short for secure socket layer I
would have to go buy it somewhere if it
wasn't set up properly it wasn't renewed
etc etc you would get an error message
like this one here I just got a copy of
this off the web somewhere so this
particular site was not the excuse me he
secured the SSL certificate was not up
to date or something wrong with it it
wasn't installed properly so this would
appear when he hit the page that's it
the reason this happens is because some
people may you know try to pretend that
they have us a proper certificate and so
on this is very rare to be totally
honest with you I think there's a lot of
hype on that but so now you know what
this is all about this basically when
you hit a site and you see this type of
thing it's just that the certificate
that they claim to have there's
something quality about it it could be
something scammy
or more likely they just forgot to
update and renew versa ticket that just
happened to me
or they didn't and they did not install
for certificate on the server properly
so there you go so that's a basic
rundown of what an SSL certificate is
it's something that you buy and then you
install the certificate on your server
let me show you example where you might
buy one so again I'm not trying to
promote here um we just offer
certificates at web hosting at killer
sites calm so you click through and yeah
let's just log in and you see SSL
certificates now you can buy them so I
click through
and here you go you have all kinds of
certificates available all kind you get
a couple you at the standard and premium
now the price of a certificate will vary
from shop to shop and depending on the
level of certificate you know how fancy
the certificate is going to be I go
personally with a standard SSL it's more
than enough for my needs the premium one
it gives you this fancy green border and
some other little doodads that may make
people visiting your site feel more
secure about and they may feel more
secure about your site if you have the
premium certificate and maybe it's worth
it you know if you get an extra sale out
of it in a year you know or a few extra
sales what's what's the extra 50 bucks
right but again we personally just use a
standard essentially you buy this thing
you add it to the card you buy it and
then once you have your certificate then
you have to install it and the company
that sells use these certificates as we
do will teach you will show you how to
install it the good thing is is that in
fact your web hosting company will
likely install it for you
now why would you want to install an SSL
again let's it's probably most likely is
because you want to take in credit card
information essentially you want to
install an SSL when you need to have
that communication between a server and
the web browser to be secure you need
two things to get your sites secure this
way first you need to get a domain name
that is on its own IP address you know
most times when you're hosting your many
different domain names we'll be sharing
the same IP when you want to secure a
domain it has to be on its own
I pee so that's why when you look at web
hosting packages they'll mention that
whether you can get your own dedicated
IP or not because IPS are limited
there's a limited number out there so
they're a bit of a premium so you might
have to pay a little bit more sometimes
for hosting if you want a dedicated IP
and then you need of course a you need a
domain you need an SSL certificate what
you buy there's a whole process involved
in buying an SSS insisted certificate
and then installing it I'm tempted to
show you but I won't because it really
depends on the type of server that you
happen to be hosted on and in fact I
know if you're using Windows Server the
process is different but if you're using
a patchy server or using a server has
cPanel etc etc etc so what I'm gonna do
instead of trying to walk you through
the whole thing in detail I'm just gonna
log in to a very old site that is pretty
much dead in the water and I'm gonna
show you so we've logged in to the
cPanel which is basically to control the
control panel for the website not all
websites will have it control panel but
many will anyway even if you don't have
cPanel the the basic things that you're
seeing here is applicable to regardless
of the hosting I sort of let you happen
to have so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna look for the SSL TLS manager just
to get a quick look at so many options
and basically again this is a part of
the control panel that allows you to
sort of to set up and configure your
your SSL certificate so you can secure
your website the main thing that you
have to start with besides buying the
SSL from the shop like killer sites
domain name same way is you have to get
your CSR which is a certified signing
request and this basically looks like a
bunch of code I'll show you I generated
one myself recently so I think I have it
here
somewhere hold on hold on a second here
we go
so CSR generation four secured on killer
video store calm so as you can see
there's the beginning of the certificate
and here's the end you're going to
basically be provided at some point a
place where you can cut cut and paste
this into into a form on web on the web
and and you're basically applying a
certificate to a server I'm not gonna
get into it beyond that because the step
by step should make it easy for you as
you go through it but you know sake
there you go so you might you might get
a form like this where you you paste it
in and then the server sort of take care
it takes care of its configuration for
you again fortunately for you many hosts
hosting companies will provide this for
you as part of a package service so I
wouldn't be super concerned about that
what you want to take away from this
video ultimately is that if you want to
take you want to take in credit cards on
your website or you want to secure your
website you need two things you need to
have a dedicated IP behind a particular
website you need to get an SSL
certificate and you go to an SSL
certificate provider to do that and when
you apply it and it's your cost can vary
from you know twenty five a year to
eighty ninety one hundred bucks a year
or more depending and at the end of the
day I have to say in my opinion for most
of us the security provided by SSL
though is very good I think it's it's
overkill and in in reality I doubt most
people will be as subject to
you know security breaches if their site
is not secured by SSL simply because I
think the hackers are marched in and
really big-name sites like Sony or
something so the main reason to have SSL
really is is to promote sales because
when people see secure shopping makes
them feel good and that's a big part of
reason also though I have to point out
if you do want to accept credit cards on
your site you do need to have an SSL
site that's just the banks won't let you
do it otherwise although I should point
out when you do accept credit cards on
your site you have to go through
something called PCI compliance which
goes even way beyond as a cell so I
recommend that you actually offload the
collecting of credit card information
off to a third-party site so if we go
for us for instance I'm going to show
you how it works with killer sites we
used to collect our own credit card
information on our own site but because
of the PSP PCI compliance issue it's
this whole new initiative put forth by
the banks and I don't want to get him to
it I think it's a bit of a scam
personally I decided to offload it onto
my gateway which is another company to
hold that basically the company that
handles the credit card transaction
processing for me so when I now we
filled in this personal information here
in the forms I click continue and what's
happening here
though we're still on killer video store
calm always continue here we verify the
order see this loading here we're
actually loading in now a form from my
provider so even though we're on killer
video store calm this form here is
actually we're using an iframe and we're
loading this in from my credit card
processor this whole site still has to
be secured though because this element
is is secure and
I wouldn't let us operate otherwise so I
needed the esse the SSL certificate
anyway alright I'm rambling on here I
hope you understand the whole point of
SSL and I hope you found this video at
least somewhat useful bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
