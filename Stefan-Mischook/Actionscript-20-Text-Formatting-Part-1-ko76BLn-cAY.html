to start with our tutorial on text
formatting and in order to familiarize
ourselves with what we're doing let's
just take a look first and foremost I'm
going to set this to 100% visibility and
we'll just scroll up here to see the
text that we have written if I unlock
this layer here is killer sites MC
author MC portfolio MC and contact MC
they're all movie clips and these movie
clips once we give them button event
handlers like on press and roll over
they'll act just like a button now
inside of this movie clip you'll notice
by double-clicking I enter inside the
movie clip here where our BMC killer
sites right inside of it there is a
dynamic text field and it has the name
my text txt this is particular to every
single one of them each one of these
movies has a my txt txt so in other
words the text field belongs to this
particular movie clip the author one or
the folio or the contact one so each one
is set up in that fashion so I'm going
to lock that layer again they all have
very intuitive names now that we've set
this up here's something else that we're
going to do if I open up the action
script layer of the first frame the
ActionScript movie here we have our mcl
movie clip loader and load VAR lv what
we're going to also do I'll just copy
this information here for a second and
we're going to start
and create some button options so i'll
just say start well actually let's text
format it start text format
okay and let's create another copy this
for the ending just to be nice and neat
and in between these two will stick in
all of the information that we need and
to start that off here's what we're
going to do let's understand what the
text format option is just like we
created objects from classes here the
text format class is going to allow us
to style individual text fields now this
is not CSS styling this is done directly
inside of flesh so while these button
events are taking place rollover press
and all that what we're going to do is
tell this text field to react a certain
way so this is a different way of doing
things than the traditional button with
the different states you know for on
over and all of those here we're going
to script those options but this affords
us a lot more flexibility as you'll see
so first thing I'm going to do is to
create a bar or a variable right and I'm
going to call it B text button text and
we're going to say button text disabled
because if you remember the button text
will be disabled when we're at the for
example killer sites section so in other
words it will look orange and it will be
bold as well as not being able to press
on it but we'll get to that in due time
so let's strict data type this
particular variable and we'll give it
the district data typing of capital T
text field
well excuse me text format is what we
are looking for here so of course we're
going to create a new text format class
and we could just copy this information
make it a little easy on ourselves okay
and we'll put in this information right
here but inside these brackets we've got
some information that we have to
disseminate number one what style of
texts do you want well number one I'm
going to say let's make this in the font
family of verdana comma the point size
will be 12 comma and I'm also going to
give a hexadecimal value now eczema
decimal values in flash are written in
this fashion right we write to 0 and X
instead of the traditional pound symbol
then you put in your six letters or
numbers all right so I'm going to say FF
9900 which I know to be the orange
another thing one last thing a boolean
value for true or false indicating
whether or not this particular format
will be bold or not in this case true
indicating that yes not only do I want
this to be in for data and twelve point
size and orange I also want it to be
bold so anything or any text field that
is associated with be text disable the
look like this all right now now that
we've done that for be text disabled
let's also do this I'm just going to
copy this never work smarter not harder
d text enable
let's do this by putting a capital e
n-able new text format text format again
right now the only difference here is
the color which I want to be the
traditional white which is just 6 f's
two three four five six yes got that
right and I do not want it to be bold so
I'll say false for the boolean value
here so anything that is called or
associated with the variable B text
enable will look the way it normally
does okay so now that we've enabled
those elements let's just write a little
comment to our self here to save for
example if you remember right at the
beginning the first movie killer sites
loads so in that case I want to disable
the first but
button by default all right so in that
case what I'm going to do here is well
let's target the movie so notice there
it is killer sites MC right and look you
don't even need to keep the this in this
case right flash is smart enough to know
that if you're not referencing another
timeline then you're referencing this
timeline instance this is all on the
master level we could just say
technically here killer sites MC well
what about it killer sites MC dot my txt
txt if you remember that was the name of
the text field inside of it if you don't
believe me let's try this again look
inside killer sites MC there it is my
txt txt now okay you could leave the
this or you could take it out it doesn't
really matter but as you can see here
we've targeted that particular text
field now what do we want to do with it
so let's add a dot now check this out
here's a new one we're going to say set
the it's called text format so i can
press enter once that's in place now
what is the name of the text format that
i want to set if you remember if we're
disabling this we're going to say set
the text format to this particular text
format the one called v text disabled
and one other thing that i want to be
doing if i do not want this button to
add this movie clip to act like a button
i can actually turn it off in other
words i can just say enabled is equal to
false
and let's see what that does as you
might imagine right the button or this
movie clip will no longer act like a
button because I said enabled false so
as you'll see we completely turn it off
so I'll just save the work here press
ctrl enter and let's see what happens
aha as you'll notice right we've got
killer site it's bold it's orange and we
don't need anything else happening in
here because it's right off the bat at
the beginning however notice it's not
enabled right what we're going to do now
is enable the rest of these buttons to
move around and at the same time will
apply the option to them so let's
continue that in just a second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
