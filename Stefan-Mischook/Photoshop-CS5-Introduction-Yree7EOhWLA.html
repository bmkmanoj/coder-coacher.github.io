another killer sites com video tutorial
in this tutorial we're going to be
looking at an introduction to photoshop
so all the great things that you'll need
to know on how to create images for use
in either a web environment as most of
you killer sites calm students will
probably be looking for but remember
when you're working in photoshop any
sort of digital photographic image can
be converted for use inside of any
environment whether that's a web
environment or whether you're working
for a print industry or doing some work
for video or any other kind of digital
environment so Photoshop is an extremely
versatile tool it's one of the kings of
the digital imaging world and as you'll
see anyone from a designer to a 3d
artist to a web designer will be working
inside of a Photoshop environment so
while there's a lot that we can do with
Photoshop the fundamentals the
introduction that we have planned here
are going to focus on its use for the
web that doesn't mean that we're not
going to be learning anything for use
with Photoshop in a print environment of
course certainly anything that I'm going
to be showing you in this tutorial can
be used in either web or print or any
other for example video or anything else
however we must remember that due to the
fact that we're working in a killer
sites calm environment a lot of our
students our web oriented students so a
lot of the images that we're going to be
using are going to be ones that will be
sufficient for the web but more than
likely would not be sufficient for a
print environment that shouldn't affect
us in either way because whether you're
working in print or the web as I
mentioned all of the tutorials that
you're going to be learning here will
serve you in any number of capacities so
we're going to start in the next video
tutorial and what we're going to be
learning is how to work with the basic
environment getting a little overview of
how Photoshop works what you can do with
it and we'll see you in just a second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
