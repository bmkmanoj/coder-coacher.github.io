talking about another form element
called radio buttons now as we saw in
the last one we were able to create a
number of text fields using our form
tags and inside those form tags we can
see that we had our input text field and
the type was defined as text well that
was great and just as a side note do
recognize that most browsers will have
about 20 characters as their default in
terms of the size of the form element
but we can define some of those a little
bit later on with some other attributes
or even working with CSS so in this
particular example what I want to be
talking about is working with things
like radio buttons now what our art
radio buttons radio buttons are used
when you want the user to select one of
a limited number of choices so in other
words it's not when you have a huge list
of things that you want them to choose
from so either either or one or the
other or you know one of three or one of
five or whatever the case may be so
let's clean up a little bit of what's
going on in here you'll notice I'm just
going to ask you to take out the first
and last name from the last exercise
that you were working with and this time
we're still going to keep it our type as
you can see here so we have our input
tag right here an attribute called type
and in the first example we were using
text attributes but in this case what I
want you to do is to create a radio and
at this point we can give it a name so
in this case maybe we're going to be
asking whether or not someone is our end
audience member is either male or female
so we will ask them about their sex not
how many times a week but actually how
many or just rather if they're male or
female so in order to do this as you can
see this would not really help us out so
we're going to add another attribute
here and this one is called value and
usually when you're using
input tags as we are right now the value
usually define something that's going to
be written you'll see this again a
little bit later on when we're working
with things like other types of check
boxes or even submit buttons and stuff
like that so the value here i will say
male one of our choices and notice that
there is a br spacing right here but
I'll also come in there and just before
we actually put in that br tag which
I'll just drop off to the second line
there I'm actually going to write out
the word mail because we want them to
know what the choice actually is the
value is not something that they're
going to be seeing at this particular
point in time so now that we have those
that first element in place now I'm
going to do the same thing with the
second one we're going to say radio and
the name is going to be sex again but
this time we're also going to give in
another value which of course would be
the logical alternative female and right
after that we're going to write out the
word female because we want them to see
that word when we actually do preview
this in the browser so at this point
let's take a look it will save our file
they have a good look at what's going on
over here and if you remember from the
last example I had this opened up inside
of Firefox so since it's already open
all I really have to do is to reload
this page and let's take a look at what
we see you've got something in here that
shows two box two buttons and if you'll
notice when you select one or the other
the first one becomes deactivated or the
second one would be becoming deactivated
as well so it's either one or the other
when you're working with radio buttons
there's not really much choice other
than that you can only have one option
that can be chosen so that's how you can
create a very simple radio button for
use inside of your work and as you can
see the male and female is
dictated over here then later on once
this information has been retrieved or
you know taken in after you've created a
nice big form as will have towards the
end of our lesson you can send off that
information and that information would
need to be sent using some third-party
scripting and we'll discuss a little bit
more about that when we get into the
actions the action attribute for the
form tag itself so that's a little bit
about radio buttons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
