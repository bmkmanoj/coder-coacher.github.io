about starting a business this is
something that a lot of people don't
understand even people who are in
business let me explain so the hardest
thing about starting a business I'll get
to the point is actually starting the
business and that is a difficult process
for several reasons when you're starting
a business from scratch not inheriting
your parents or your family's business
or going into it no starting from
scratch which makes a business hard to
start is that you've got to invent the
product or service you're going to
figure out the product or service
actually sells then you got to come up
with a business model how do you sell a
product how do you market a product you
got to you got to set up the structure
of your business whether you get it uh
whatever whether you get a factory
depending on their business already or
you just getting an office space or you
just start from your home which I
recommend then you got to come up with
your workflow you'll work at you so how
do you how do you provide the product in
an efficient manner then setting up the
financing if you need to and then
setting up the banking and the
incorporate all these things are
difficult the most difficult part those
figuring out the business model how you
can actually find a product or service
people are willing to pay for that's the
hard part
once that's going it's kind of like
figuring out how to build a car once you
figure out how to build a car and you
you get it and once the car starts
moving meaning what's the business you
can think of a car is like an analogy to
a business
so once the the car is moving once it's
making money once it's going in the
right direction as well then it's easy
right you just put more gas than you and
you just keep managing it right so
that's the hardest part about starting a
business that initial beginning stages
takes years in fact many times years and
years unless you're really lucky so for
instance to your web this has been
around prototypes been around seven
years now give or take a few months and
it's coming to itself it's viable but
let me tie those years
years of just burning through cash to
get it to a state where it was working
not just in terms of a software or the
material in the courses but also in
terms of how to how to market it and so
forth try to all kinds of different
tactics and different ways of doing
things and fortunately I have cash flow
from previous businesses and I was able
to finance it myself but that is the
hard part so when I hear people say you
know I'm a business guy here these are
these rich kids who say well you know I
walked into my father's business and it
was another big business oh it worth 2
million or 4 million or whatever but
then I we built it up and damaged enos
but these are classic rich kids because
these rich kids have never experienced
building a business from scratch they've
had it super easy but they don't
understand that because they've never
experienced it it's kind of like
somebody who who's never grappled with a
great jujitsu guy or a great judo player
or a great wrestler or somebody who's
never fought against her a good ring
fighter whether it being MMA guy or a
boxer or whatnot and they figure I know
I can take them out and they have no
idea what they're getting into when they
step in the ring against one of these
guys who's just trained at a very high
level it's just a totally different game
it's a big eye-opener for them same
thing with these rich kids I've known
them all I've known several rather and
they don't understand because it's been
handed to him a silver platter they
don't understand that walking into the
business a business that has a few
million in sales and is profitable where
all the business processes have been
worked out all the product has been
worked out the you've got cash flow
you've got flow once you have cash flow
once you have a business model that's
working once you've got contacts and
clients and it's simple this is a
question of refinement and feeding the
monkey so that's the hardest part about
starting businesses at initial stages
figuring out the product and so forth
and so you have to take your time with
that because your best ideas will
probably end up not working out well but
what separates successful entrepreneurs
and not
successful entrepreneurs typically is
wherewithal persistence and the ability
to see where you made mistakes and to
adjust accordingly based on what your
clients or prospective clients are
telling you so there you go that's my
tips on starting a business</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
