recorded this well I just shot this vlog
what I'm gonna do right now but I didn't
replace record so that sucks
I know yeah so let's talk about the the
downside of being too detached from your
codebase now in a previous vlog that the
one I did just before this that was
recorded I talked about how when you get
more advanced and experienced in your
software development career you may get
into architecture where you're going to
get detached from the day-to-day coding
process now the school and there's
advantages to that
now there's also some disadvantages so
I'm going to suggest a middle ground
here now the advantage of pulling away
from your codebase is that you can start
looking at the code you can start
looking at the app rather from the point
of view as a user more but as an expert
developer as well so you have the best
of both worlds and I think that was a
strength of Steve Jobs he was able to he
wasn't a coder but he was able to look
at apps from a point of view and and and
devices from the point of view of a user
and that played a big role in why they
were so usable and so on he's also
minimalist which is also a good thing as
well coding by the way is a process of
like not so much painting we're adding
layers and layers of paint to build your
painting it's more like sculpting where
you're pulling away all of the access
all this stuff that you don't need in
your streamlining think about your code
that weighs about pulling away excess
streamlining if you do that you're gonna
produce much better apps
in the end simpler to code simpler the
architectures better your apps oh yeah
so at one point if you become more
advanced and you start developing you
start getting into the role of
architecture and you're not involved in
a day to day coding because you don't
have time it's also good so that you can
look at your app from a different
perspective the downside of that is that
you're going to be detached from the
code and unless you have some really
good coders working under you that can
lead to a bunch of problems so I've
experienced this myself
and it's difficult when you pull away
from the code to take on architectural
role to go back in again because it's a
different mindset at least for me so the
psychology is different and you just
don't want to actually to a certain
extent but what you should be doing if
you become that architect if you will
you start pulling away from that code
day to day coding which sometimes you're
going to have to do especially as your
app becomes more successful I would
suggest that you do code inspections of
you once it once a month once every two
weeks whatever it is you spend a half an
hour going over the code going over the
architectural decisions going over all
these things with your lead developer or
developers and so you can look at it and
make sure that they're not doing
something that could cause you a lot of
problems down the road in terms of
performance and so forth by the way
little tangent here I had a recent event
with some performance in an app and it
she holds the old bottlenecks still
exists for the most part database is the
most expensive in terms of server
resources it's the most expensive aspect
of web apps opening up database
connections managing large sets of data
that is always has been it still is
today the most problematic area of app
development especially web apps most web
apps are backed by databases so be
cognizant of that and be careful how you
design your database make sure your
database is designed in such a way so it
can scale and so forth again let me
point out as I put it on other vlogs
that doesn't mean you should build a
semi when you just need a van to start
your project but you should be at least
aware of the fact that the database is
usually the bottleneck in terms of balls
to apps so keep that in mind for a lot
of you doesn't really matter but just
you got to be mindful of that
all right back to the subject at hand so
as you become architect in app
development you're going to pull way but
what I would suggest don't pull away
totally unless you have really
top coders working for you who
understand how you think things should
be structured and laid out in your apps
but you should get in there once a month
spend a half an hour to cosa show me
what you've done show me what you've
done any changes the database
what are you doing terms of architecture
or what frameworks you're using what
libraries how have you implemented it
excetera etc etc etc this way you're not
totally detached from what's going on
with the codebase so you don't run into
trouble down the road and also it's just
good to have an experienced coder review
code even on a superficial level even on
a higher level architectural level so
you may not be coding every day may not
be coding at all in a system that's good
just the peak your nose into things
every once in a while and it might avoid
disaster for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
