is stefan miss Chuck wolf killer size
com for this course I assume that you
know absolutely nothing about web design
and by the end of course you will have
built a website the style of the course
is much more like a one-on-one tutorial
rather than a classroom type of lecture
setting the reason for this is that I
find that it's much easier for people to
take in information in this style of
teaching though the course is very
structured I use an ad lib free-flow
style of presentation so sometimes you
may hear me mispronounce a few words I
have to repeat myself I'm not scripted
here let's answer a couple of common
questions that I get with regards to
learn in web design first of all do you
need web design software to build
websites short answer is no and we don't
use web design software in this course
we actually use software becomes free on
every computer whether it be Windows Mac
etc do you need a special type of
computer do you need very powerful new
computers to do this course again the
answer is no that's one of the beauties
of a web design is in that it requires
very little in terms of horsepower to
build sites even at a professional level
so if you're using a 10 year old
computer you're fine you have no
problems following along in this course
and building websites for most of the
course I'm doing all the demonstrations
in Windows 7 not because Windows 7 has
any major advantages over other
operating systems whether it be windows
8 Mac OS or Windows XP I'm just demoing
with windows 7 simply because it's the
most popular
operating system that people are using
today I'm recording this in October 2012
if you're using any other flavor of
windows you'll be fine if you're using
mac OS you'll be fine because web design
and is a universal process there's one
little difference with mac OS and that
has to do with creating text files if
you not to create text files and mac
you'll be able to follow along perfectly
if you don't know don't worry about it
i've included a video specifically for
mac people how to create text files on
the mac so you can build your websites
yes building websites has a lot to do
with building text files but we're going
to get into that when we actually get
into the course itself the course is
actually structured in two major
sections you have the core videos where
we cover the core web design techniques
and you should follow these videos in
sequential order meaning start with
video number one then go to number two
number three etc and then you have the
miscellaneous videos where you can just
just grab whatever ones you want to
learn at that particular moment so you
have a video on embedding video into
your web pages you have another video on
embedding sound another video on
creating forms etc it's more of a grab
bag of techniques so you can just watch
those and at any time you like after an
end in any order after you've done the
core videos the ultimate goal of this
course is to give you practical web
design skills so you can easily build a
website i also want to get into your
hands or into your head a good
understanding of the fundamental
techniques and principles of web design
because once you have these techniques
and principles will be easy for you to
really expand your knowledge beyond
these beginner skills or perhaps you
want to get into a web design program
like dreamweaver or expression web
knowing the basics of web design really
well in understanding how to build your
basic pages and a basic site will be
very very beneficial to you will make
the process of learning the advanced
stuff much much much easier let me
conclude this introduction with three
learning tips as we go through the
course and we're building things I
encourage you to follow along by
actually trying to build the stuff as
you go along do the samples do for work
tip number two the web design process is
a process filled with errors even the
world-class pro web designers will
constantly make mistakes as they're
building out their sites and their pages
so especially for beginners don't worry
about running into hiccups making errors
that's just normal its way it goes and
tip number three don't be afraid to take
breaks if you find yourself getting
frustrated something's not sinking in
just walk away for a few hours 20
minutes or the next day you'll find that
it makes the whole process of learning
web design a lot easier and it will give
you brain some time to sort of settle
into this whole new world and so the way
we have thinking for most of you anyway
that's it I'll see you in video number
one in the core video series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
