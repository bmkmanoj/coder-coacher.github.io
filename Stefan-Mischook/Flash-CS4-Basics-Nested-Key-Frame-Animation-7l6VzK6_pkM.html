getting into some pretty exciting parts
of working with animation and for the
most part we're going to be seeing some
things that we've seen already in
different video tutorials for example
we're going to be exploring again how to
create keyframe animation shape tween
animation and the two different types of
movie clip animation motion tween
animation however what we're going to be
doing with those types of animation is
using them in a much more sophisticated
manner by nesting or embedding them
inside of a symbol and these nested
symbols and nested animations are going
to be put specifically into movie clip
symbols if you remember a movie clip
symbol acts just like the main timeline
it's got its own timeline it loops just
like the regular flash movie would loop
and for our purposes we can get and
create very sophisticated animations
simply by using a few frames that will
loop inside of our movie let me give you
a scenario for example if I wanted to
create a keyframe animation with a bug's
wings flapping open and closed if I
needed ten frame a ten seconds of
animation at 30 frames per second what I
would need then was 300 frames of
animation with the wings open wings
closed open closed open closed imagine
doing that 300 times on the main
timeline well if we work a little
smarter rather than harder we can nest
two frames open wing closed wing inside
of a movie clip and that will
continuously loop and then we'll be able
to move that across the stage and do any
number of different things with it so
why don't we get a little example of how
that works and we'll try doing that by
number one creating simple bug whose
wings will be flapping so you'll notice
here I'm just picking out some color and
I'm just going to take a gray as well as
a green fill color so great stroke green
fill color I could select that and I
could make that stroke be a little bit
larger perhaps I'll say three
stroke so I'm going to with my black
arrow tool completely select that object
and if you remember we're going to
convert it into a symbol now this symbol
i'm going to call bug underscore MC MC
for movie clip because as we can see the
type of symbol i'm using is a movie clip
very important that's exactly what i
want to be doing right now registration
points right in the middle and that's
perfectly fine and we're going to just
click ok so now I've got this symbol as
you can see I'm on seeing one and if we
want to enter into this symbol in other
words i already have the head of the bug
nested in the symbol so let's go inside
and build up the rest of this bug so to
enter or to open the symbol you
double-click now we're in sort of an
isolation mode and you'll see that we're
no longer on scene one we're inside the
movie clip called bug MC I'm pressing
the spacebar just to move my canvas up a
little bit higher and this is our head
layer so I'm going to name that the head
layer I don't really need anything else
on the head layer so I'm going to lock
it now i'm going to create a new layer
which will call body at this point i'm
going to switch back to my rectangular
tool and i'll create sort of a fat oval
shape that i'll be using for the body of
my bug you can sort of a line it as best
as you want I'm just eyeballing it right
here and I'm placing it right now it's
on top of the head but I'm going to
place it underneath the head just like
that now i'm not going to need to do
anything else with that body of course
this is a very simple example of a bug
drawing but as you can see here's the
bug and the head layer both locked so at
this point what i'm going to do is
create el wing that stands for the left
wing so let's go about creating the left
wing here's what we'll do I'm just
moving over my tools for a second so I
could show you a little bit better and
what I'd like you to do is to just
choose you know black color or something
for the fill then click on it again and
we're going to change the opacity to
something like fifty percent
alright well at this point I'm going to
just drag that back into place we don't
really need it so large so after taking
a transparent fill color I'm going to
create my wings for my buck so as you
can see i'm going to double-click it and
using my arrow keys I'm just going to
nudge it into place just like that
you'll notice it's still underneath the
wing which is just fine for me right now
alright so at this point we can copy the
entire frame if we wish for example I
can right click and I could say copy
this frame and then if I create a new
layer which I'll call our wing of course
for the right wing and i will say paste
the frame so now I've got an exact
duplicate and the reason I put it in
exactly the same spot is so that we can
use our arrow keys to nudge that over
just a little bit as well alright so I
think I've got something that I'm happy
with well as you can see right now we've
got both of the wings closed and that's
one frame inside the movie clip however
what we actually want is two frames of
animation so look what I'm going to do
click and drag the entire second frame
here and we're going to say insert frame
now at this point what we have is the
same the whole way through however on
the right wing layer I'm going to select
it and I'm going to say this second
frame I want to be a keyframe so if you
remember inserting a keyframe means when
we select the object and let's
double-click it so we make sure
everything is selected we're going to
rotate it now notice the rotation is
right in the center here and I don't
want that so I'm going to move that up
here so that my bugs wings can rotate in
this direction in fact if you want you
can even hold shift 45 degrees
a bit much for me so I'm just going to
give it a much more subtle variation so
that one's open now I'm going to go to
the left wing insert a keyframe move my
center point up to the top again and
we'll move this one in a corresponding
fashion so doesn't have to be perfect at
this point well let's take a look as you
can see open closed open closed so I've
got my potential for my wings flapping
let's go back to seen one notice what we
had inside the movie clip let me switch
back to my black arrow inside the movie
clip we had a whole bunch of frames and
layers but see their head right wing
left wing body but on scene 1 there's
only one frame that's because everything
has been encapsulated inside of this
movie clip it's all bundled up nice and
neat with a bow tie tied on it so i'm
going to call this the MC layer or the
movie clip layer and remember inside the
movie clip we've got all of the parts of
the bug moving or otherwise so as you
can see here nothing's moving so in
order to preview what the animation
inside the movie clip actually looks
like you're going to have to press ctrl
enter and when you do to test your movie
what you'll see especially if you're at
30 frames per second is pretty fast
flapping all right now imagine that if
we didn't do this inside the movie clip
and we wanted you know 300 frames we
would have to go open-close open-close
create all of those key frames on the
main timeline that's just way too much
work so now instead what we could do is
for example I could take the object and
just choosing my free transform tool I'm
going to rotate him in this direction
let's create a basic new tween right so
I'll say create a motion tween there's
30 frames I'm going to now just move him
let's say off the stage he can nudge him
along if you wish and well I could even
start him off the stage as well just to
show you and if we press ctrl enter
let's take a look
so while the motion tween is moving the
movieclips symbol what's inside the
symbol is flapping so you'll notice I
didn't have to make 30 frames open
closed animation I only did it for two
frames inside the movie clip symbol and
that creates this great little animation
that we have here remember that this is
also movie clips symbols right so given
that they are symbols you know I could
create a new layer here called swarm or
something along those lines and you
could put as many of these bugs on the
stage as you like and when you press
control enter you see these things
moving you notice that you create it
very easy to work with animation just by
using nested keyframes so come back from
the next video because we're going to be
looking at nested shape tweens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
