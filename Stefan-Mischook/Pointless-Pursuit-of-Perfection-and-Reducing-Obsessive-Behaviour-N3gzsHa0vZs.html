because I got a very inexpensive lens
that is designed I was better for low
lights am able to vlog at night anyhow
this is a response to a particular user
who connected with my video I was
talking about not spending or not
getting too caught up in details because
sort of the good enough principle don't
tweak things into it
infinitum and you know where it stifles
your progress whether you're releasing
software or a design of a webpage or
label whatever it is so this is uh it's
all psychological records you could look
at something you go I don't like it and
then you keep tweaking you keep not
liking it and it's really psychological
one day you feel good about it the other
day you won't feel good about it so you
just got to get to a point where it's
good it looks pro generally speaking
it's good you're never going to please
everybody you know I always say that to
people say yes you get worried that some
people don't like your stuff well some
people didn't like the Beatles I don't
know how many people watching these
fields listen to the Beatles but there
were the biggest band what a
biggest-selling bands of all time make
number one you know Elvis number one
Beals / - Led Zeppelin number three
let's up but another huge band and a lot
of people didn't like Led Zeppelin but
they think they sold the third biggest
selling band of all time so you know if
Led Zeppelin if you came up to a you
know there's a bunch of people don't
like your music should they change
everything that they do because some
people don't like your stuff you can
never please everybody just keep that in
mind you can't please everybody you
can't get perfection it doesn't really
exist a lot of times your perception of
perfection is largely dependent on your
psychological state at that particular
moment in time so what can you do to
deal with this psychological impediment
some people as minors some people it's
big for me it's kind of in the middle
slightly past minor what you do is a
violent martial arts as you slowly
habituate yourself
away from these obsessive-compulsive
tendencies so what I would do for
instance is if you're a somebody who's
obsessive compulsive do things that are
the opposite that little things are
unimportant for instance here's somebody
who's obsessed with composite you
probably wash your dishes right away
well train yourself don't wash your
dishes right away but we want to Cali
them there for an hour then come and do
them or somebody has to you know make
your bed in the morning I'm just pulling
examples here don't do it
you know it's little inconsequential
things like that is how you slowly
slowly train your brain to sort of let
go a little bit now you don't leave
important things like you know we have
to get this or the job out in time or
you got to answer client emails that of
course you do
but things like I just mentioned you can
come up with other examples that's a
good way to slowly habituate your brain
to relax just kind of like when you're
if you want to eventually run a marathon
you don't start by trying to run the
marathon the first day which is you you
do little things you run a block about a
half a mile you run a mile you slowly
slowly build yourself up to develop that
your body so that you can take the
pressure of running that marathon now
the same thing if you're
obsessive-compulsive what you want to do
is you want to slowly introduce yourself
introduce your brain rather to things
they're August of that so that you learn
to relax that's just my suggestion this
brings me back to I guess something for
some of the other from martial arts in
life when you're not sure seek the
balance seek the middle the yin and yang
principle of Asian culture always look
for balance you don't here classic
examples don't eat too much don't eat
too little you know don't you know you
gotta sleep get a give your not self
enough sleep not too much too little etc
etcetera till you can find 10,000
examples so yeah so if you're obsessive
compulsives we figure it this is normal
this is totally lazy like my friend eggy
he's like way over here totally
I'm obsessive and you get the totally
obsessive guy what you got to do is you
got to introduce a little bit of eating
this a little eggie big eNOS tennis
laziness into your day your little your
daily activities to pull you a little
bit more towards the middle you may
never get totally balanced or if you if
you're this extreme obsessive compulsive
and maybe with a little work you pull
yourself to here so that it's life's a
little easier for you anyway that's my
tips but I have not a psychologist
although I did study psychology at the
University for a couple years that's all
about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
