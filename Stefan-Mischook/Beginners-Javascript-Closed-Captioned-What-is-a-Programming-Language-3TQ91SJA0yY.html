take a step back from writing actual
JavaScript code and we're going to do
just a little bit of theory don't worry
we're not going to get into some micro
nerd details that's going to put
everybody to sleep here but I want to
cover some basic things that I think
will help you as you explore further
into JavaScript
to cover again I'm not going to take too
long here just enough to get us forward
so let's let's just jump into it and
yeah the pain will be over soon so
number one what it is a programming
language that's the question and of
course some of you may be thinking to
yourself well this is pretty obvious we
know what a programming language is hmmm
maybe but let's just jump into it so
number one it is a written language it
uses normal Western characters like you
see in English or French but it has
special key words that have a special
meaning in the language so for example
in our last video we learned about the
alert function you know remember those
pop-up alert boxes that's just one
example of keyword built into JavaScript
that has a social meaning and gives us a
special functionality in fact the word
function is a keyword in Java Script as
well there are several of them and as we
explore JavaScript we're going to look
more closely at some of these special
keywords
in a nutshell a programming language
provides a way to send commands or in
other words instructions to computer a
programming language is actually created
by programmers this is an important
distinction about JavaScript for
instance is one it's just one example of
a programming language that was written
created by programmers and there's a
reason I mentioned that that's in the
next point there are many different
programming languages because each one
has its own speciality so that's a
question that I'm sure some of you are
beginners to programming you're asking
yourself why do you have something
programming languages what do you have
JavaScript why do you have a c-sharp
while you have cold fusion etc etc etc
and reason is because each language has
its own thing that it does really well
javascript for example was designed to
allow web designers to control web
browsers
here's an important point the key of
this particular video so put on your
thinking caps in there and pay attention
to at least this part here if anything
the written language in this case
javascript is actually processed or read
by the JavaScript engine or in other
words the JavaScript interpreter so you
can see JavaScript as being both a human
readable written language as well as
being an engine software or software
that processes the language and execute
the code so the JavaScript engine piece
of software is actually installed into
all modern web browsers
so I hope that little part sinks in you
can think of the JavaScript engine as
being a separate program that's
installed inside a web browser that
lives in the web browser and the
JavaScript language is the written
language that has special commands and
keywords that allows us to tell the
engine how to manipulate the web browser
one last point quick point javascript
and java are not the same programming
language and they in fact serve totally
different purposes i mentioned that
because a lot of people think that
they're the same thing so JavaScript and
Java are not the same language
javascript is the programming language
for the web browser and java is a what
they call an enterprise-level language
used basically for creating database
driven websites this is all server stuff
so anyway if you don't know about
database driven websites go to killer
PHP com you learn all about it there
and the final point I want to cover this
is a interesting one why aren't CSS and
HTML programming languages in a nutshell
because you cannot make decisions and
change things on the fly with CSS or
HTML javascript allows you to add
control bolt behavior to a web page
that's the key point it allows you to
add controllable behavior to a web page
so for instance you could use JavaScript
to check what time of day it is and to
change the web browsers background color
the web page background color on the
flock or you can have JavaScript time
how much time persons been on the page
and then have something appear these are
things you cannot do with CSS and HTML
so the subtle difference between a
markup language or a written language
like CSS or HTML there are not
programming languages simply because
they do not provide the ability to add
behavior to a web page
so that's it for the new theory in this
video I promised it would be short and
learn about six minutes is pretty short
in the next video we're going to jump
back into some more JavaScript code just
keep in mind what we covered here as
we're working along and you're going to
see how understanding the fact that you
have an engine running back there will
make learning JavaScript just a little
bit easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
