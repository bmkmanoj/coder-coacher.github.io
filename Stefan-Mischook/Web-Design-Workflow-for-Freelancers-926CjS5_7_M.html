some questions from the YouTube today so
if you're shocked by my short haircut
one thing you'll learn as you get older
comfort and utility become more
important sorry about that I had to take
the call so yeah what are they talking
about yeah my short haircut yeah you get
older you care less about you looks more
about what's comfortable anyhow
yeah there we go so I'm actually a
question here from tomorrow public
questions all mentioned here I hope you
don't mind me making a request not at
all any on processes systems workflows I
can no longer handle the amount of work
that I have coming in but know that I
have a lot of room to improve on my
processes and workflows love your
channel thank you I'm assuming is
talking about web development web design
that is typical I've been telling people
that for a longest time now when you
become a freelancer at first is slow so
you have to do a couple of freebie gigs
but then quickly depending on how much
you work but sooner or later you're
gonna start building up so much work you
won't know what to do with it so the
first thing you can do is implement
workflows that will speed up the process
for you next thing you can do after that
is to start outsourcing your work to
assistants you know so for example if
you're a full web stack developer but
you have a preference for front-end and
maybe you can start offloading the
backend or vice versa to--if you have a
preference for the backend server side
coding you could start offloading the
front-end to people cetera etcetera
etcetera etc so let's talk about
workflows now I can't give you a whole
workflow in a vlog but I can give you a
few tips about certain directions I
don't know if I've talked about specific
workflows check my youtube channel check
out web development workflow they may
have done a video specific to that in
the past anyhow here are a couple of
tips number one you want to sell the
client you want to sell a
liens on what it is you're delivering to
them a lot of the times the clients will
have some wacky ideas about what they
want and one of your jobs as web
developer web designer is to guide them
gently and suggestively into a
particular direction so that in the end
the project is better for them for
whatever they want to accomplish but
it's also better for you because if you
can direct your clients in a particular
direction then that could save you a lot
of time so for example when in terms of
designing user interfaces I would speed
up the process by leveraging
all the templates out there not
necessarily using a template but at
least using them as a way to quickly
show clients particular look so instead
of you stripping up from scratch three
or four different looks you tell the
client says listen web development web
design has been around for a while now
so we have certain things are common
that we know work on the web we know
work for web apps we know work for
websites so I'm gonna show you a couple
of designs three designs I picked out
based on what you told me what your
needs were are and these are suggested
layouts now we can use the templates and
save you a lot of money but or we could
design from scratch but at least we
could use some of these templates as a
starting point so you can see visually
where we're gonna be when we get to the
end so I just gave you my little spiel
so that approach will save you a lot of
time it will give clarity to your
clients as well so that will be less
back and forth so that's in terms of the
visual aspect of the app in terms of the
functionality you have to flesh flesh
things out as much as possible up front
so if you're developing a web app you
should try to be as detailed upfront as
you can and then what I would do is I
would deliver to them dummy if you will
dummy apps dummy web apps where the
functionality behind the buttons is just
faked you don't actually do all the
database can
all this kind of stuff you just sort of
have screens that are dummy screen so
they click on this and they can see what
it would be like when you would populate
a table you know just hard coded in etc
etc so again this will speed up the
iterations because the worst thing you
can do is start reading lots of database
code and lots of authentication code etc
etc and then have this the the client
having to change their minds and said
can we change this can we change dad so
you have to restructure your database
you have to start changing or all your
all your SQL calls or your arm calls etc
etc etc so by using templates for your
visual components but using dummy pages
if you will for the functionality sort
of mimic the final functionality this
are these are two suggestions of what I
consider in terms of speeding up the
workflow I could put out like you know
one hour course I suppose on this and
maybe I'll put out like a and a bridge
thing something in the future but I'm
working on so many other things the NICS
course if they are going to put out it
for for public assumptions your well so
many more structures going to be on the
business end of things anyhow I hope
that helps and well I'll let you go bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
