look at is something called a for loop
and to speed things up I've created the
mom creator written the code already so
we're just going to look at the for loop
and watch it in action and we'll take it
from there the for loop looks complex at
first and I remember when I was learning
this way back I found a kind of complex
but what what it does in ways it sort of
combines everything that we've seen a
while loop up here I've commented it out
so that does run our page but it's not
as like with the while loop i had the
count variable i initialize it out here
and then i set the condition here in the
condition this is what the condition
basically is what the PHP script is
looking for whether it be a while loop
or a for loop or an if statement and so
on so what the for loop does it gives
you a much more compact way of looping
if you will so I've initialize the
variable here and this is the condition
basically I'm telling it you know if
they while the count is equal to or less
than 10 do this and this is increased
account and I can also tell it to do
stuff here as well so it's it's a more
compact way and it pretty much does the
same thing one point I want to make is
that this update this this is basically
instructions to the loop to PHP what you
do after a loop is completed I want to
point out this is done first and then
the PHP goes back and does this so this
will get printed to the page before the
increments the count variable to the
next level this is the increment
operator right we looked at in the while
loop section of this of course so let's
save that and we're going to take a look
at it in action here we go for loop one
two three or so on so again whether
using the for loop or a while loop is
really a question of taste and mostly
most of times some people for preferred
while loops
people prefer the four loops I'll leave
it up to you to play with both and over
time you'll probably choose one or the
other for most of your work one tip
though is in a particular PHP project if
you choose one loop one looping
technique you probably want to stick to
it just to be consistent but anyway
that's just something there detail down
the road
hi we're back in this video tutorial
we're going to look over the last type
of loop that we're going to cover in
this video and before we do that though
I wanted to point out something about
the for loop that I failed to mention in
the previous section and that is if you
notice after each segment here I ended
with a semicolon this is very important
that you do that semicolon except for of
course the last element here you don't
need a semicolon because it's the last
element so keep that in mind so you see
initialize it semicolon this is the what
you need to do which you know what's the
condition basically this is what the
loop is operating off of and this is
what it does after the process is this
that said now we're going to move on to
what I feel is the coolest looping
technique in PHP and that is the for
each loop the for each loop was
basically put together to make it really
easy to loop through arrays and thus
I've created an array up here plus loop
so let's let's do it now and we're going
to see how easy it
since the array we're going to loop
through is the shopping cart excuse me
I'm just going to cut and paste that in
so I've created a new variable that the
for each loop will use and will simply
deals will just echo out the value of
that particular item sold
so very have a very simple loop so
basically we first thing we have to give
it is the array and then we have to give
it a variable that will be used to
represent each item in the array so the
for each loop basically looks into the
array for us grabs an item in the array
and then Prince does whatever we want
with that or with that item it sticks it
into this variable rather and then we
can do whatever we want with that and
then it keeps looping through the array
until the array is has been looped
through entirely so let's save this and
we'll take a look at what it what it
looks like in the on the page item fish
item dogs item birds of course this
corresponds to our array here what else
can i point out about the for each loop
it's rather a simple one to use so not
much to say about it it's a very
important looping technique because when
you're pulling records from a MySQL
database for instance it actually comes
back as an array if you're pulling if
you're parsing information from a forum
post as we've learned in previous video
it's actually a type of array so the for
each is actually can be used quite a bit
and it makes grabbing information out of
an array quite easy now you could use a
for loop to grab values from the array
but it will just take more work to build
it so I would just use for each
so that pretty much covers our basic
look at looping in PHP there's a few
more details here in there is another
type of loop that you could use but this
I think is enough we've learned about
the while loop the for loop and for each
loop and I hope you see the value in
these things you can be using them quite
a bit in your PHP coding I can guarantee
you that and I would suggest that what
you do is create a bunch of loops and
give it a go there's nothing like
actually getting your hands dirty and
code to learn this stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
