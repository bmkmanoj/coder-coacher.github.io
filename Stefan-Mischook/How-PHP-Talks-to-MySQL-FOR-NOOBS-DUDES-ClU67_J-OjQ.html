basics of SQL and databases let's take a
quick look at how PHP actually
interfaces or in other words speaks to a
MySQL database to connect PHP to a
database in this case MySQL we have
several ways of doing it now each of
these things here let me just select by
askew well this is a library built into
PHP that allows you to connect to the
MySQL database so we know a database is
just an app that allows you to store all
kinds of information allows you to store
all kinds of data just a quick reminder
so the original library to connect with
PHP was my SQL in fact the people who
created pH being the people who created
a MySQL app used to work together
closely and it produces first library in
this first library contains all kinds of
PHP functions that makes it easy for PHP
to talk to MySQL now what I'm talking
about talking to MySQL sending data from
PHP pages to MySQL database and then
having PHP be able to pull data from the
MySQL database and bring it back to PHP
the MySQL library though is an old
library and it's deprecated what does
deprecated mean it's just a nerd word
that means you shouldn't use it anymore
it's not being updated it's old no good
so they replaced it with a couple of new
libraries MySQL and MySQL i-ight is
short for improved so MySQL on this
library of functions and methods is
basically a new version and improvers of
the MySQL library and they're very very
similar although the MySQL I library is
better it's faster it has more
capability I mentioned the old MySQL
library not because it's something you
might want to use you definitely want to
use this library
I'll get to this library later it's just
important to know what the MySQL library
is because you might find old or PHP
apps that still use it so the MySQL I
library I for improved does everything
that this library does but it's just
better and does other things as well and
this is what I am going to be demoing
with in this course so this again is a
library specifically designed to speak
to MySQL it's a PHP library there's
another PHP library called PHP PDO
this library is another library that
allows you to communicate between PHP
and MySQL but what makes PDO different
it's that it's not just MySQL this
library allows you to speak to a whole
bunch of databases and you don't need to
change any code whereas this library
here it only works with MySQL this
library works with a whole bunch of
databases could be post-grad sequel
server oracle you would have to look up
the list it's not too important right
now
so why do we have these two libraries
well programmers have different points
of view about certain things but the big
advantage that they'll talk about what
PHP PDO is that it allows you to again
to be able to talk to a whole bunch of
different databases without having to
change a code the supposed advantage of
that is that if say one day you wrote
your PHP app and you decide you want to
switch from MySQL to another database if
you're using PHP PDO to switch from one
database to the next is really really
easy because PHP PDO allows you to write
your code so you don't have to make any
changes whether you have my school
behind the scenes or Oracle or some
other database and that's kind of cool
because one of the Holy Grails one of
the things you want to do in programming
is you want to have your code be
independent of other code in the system
what does that mean you want to have the
most flexible code possible so if you
use PHP PDO it's much more flexible in
that regard than MySQL I but the reality
of situation
I've been coding for 20 years and I
never ever seen a situation where we had
an app that was based on MySQL and we
just decided to switch to another
database I've never seen him it just
doesn't happen so up here I have
something called or ORM now arm is
another package of code another library
of code these are all the libraries of
code write me on my SQL package in MySQL
I package the PHP PDO package and this
is an alarm package now while I'm is
short for object relational mapping and
this is a whole bunch of PHP code that
takes care of all the dirty details of
talking to a database a norm will be
based on even a MySQL or PHP PDL
probably more PHP PDL for a lot of the
work in communicating between PHP and
your database
if you use the arm you don't have to
write any SQL you just write PHP
functions so this goes beyond the scope
of this particular course but I just
want you to be aware that a lot of the
advanced PHP apps out there will
actually use an arm nonetheless arms are
not perfect and our times are you're
gonna have to drop down to SQL to send
commands to the database so it's really
important that you'd know SQL and no
matter what so to wrap up this section
which library should you use you should
not use this library that's old news
should use either MySQL I if you're
gonna be using MySQL PHP PDO although
there is an argument for PHP PDO since
it's Universal it can be used with a
whole bunch of databases without having
to change a code but for a lot of people
in big production PHP projects they will
be using an arm so what we're gonna do
now is we're gonna jump into some PHP
code that uses my sqi to see how it
works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
