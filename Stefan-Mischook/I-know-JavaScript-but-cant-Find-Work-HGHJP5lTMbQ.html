a mailbag vlog a mailbag vlog and so
here's an email I got from somebody
asking me if I would be open to
mentorship at this time I just don't
have time to do personal mentoring I am
involved with a few businesses so it's
just very time-consuming but who knows
maybe maybe in the future because the
direction I'm going to be taking in this
YouTube channel is more towards business
and technology or business and code
entrepreneurial ship and cold and
Technology rather than just being pure
programming why am i doing that because
that's really represents my entire
career for me the coding was just a
means to an end the reason I learned how
to code was to help my non tech related
business my import-export business and
that I continue to just use coding
skills and technology skills to do
contract work and then to develop my own
ideas I was never really out to become
the most amazing coder but in the
process of building my businesses and
working with software and working with
development languages I just develop
skills right on a need-to-know basis if
you will anyway I'm gonna answer this
email and yeah we'll continue from there
so my name is I'll omit his name and
stumbled on your content through YouTube
videos I like the content since it was
really helpful to hear clear explanation
of web development topics I have been
self studying jobs for programming for
about two years it's good you're getting
there but I'm having problems finding a
job mmm well just that soon I need the
advice of a professional developer who
has been in my shoes I want to see if we
can talk about receiving mentorship as I
said at this time I can't do personal
mentoring with individuals but you never
dull maybe down the road
it happens Israeli costs are available
and most importantly are open to it I
just add to that either way I like your
video because you seem to have a simple
route to finding a job I've looked
around the web most provide really too
hard to understand explanation which I
think you would be right to mentor me he
says he's creating a hybrid mobile app
for restaurants very cool that's the
first thing you got to do is when you
have developer skills at least low level
skills the basics you should go out
there and actually build real things the
first thing you've got to do is build
your own project so let's say for the
sake of argument you're into web
development first thing you have to do
is get a political website of your own
now if you're not a designer use a nice
simple elegant template put together
stuff so you can serve you're going to
showcase your skill sets but most
importantly have to showcase the type of
work you've done so the first thing you
do after you put together your website
that looks clean and up-to-date is that
you have to have projects that you can
demonstrate if you're getting into web
design development show a couple
websites that you've done for people how
do you get your first website do the
first couple free consider part of the
learning process because building
projects for yourself is a good first
step but when you actually build a real
website or real web app for an actual
client a restaurant a butcher down the
street I don't know whatever you've got
to make suits whatever it is when you
build a real project a real app a real
website a real web app for somebody that
takes it to a whole new level it's like
the difference between going into a
boxercise class and doing boxing punches
like this to to music versus actually
getting in the ring with the gloves
against a fighter and fighting it's a
low different game and there's all these
things that come with working with
clients but you don't get when you're
just working on your own little solo
projects but so first level after you
have your basic skills or your
comfortable
writing the codes let's say you're
you're doing the web stack you're doing
HTML CSS JavaScript you don't
necessarily have to become a master to
JavaScript depending on what your
back-end is going to be the backend as a
server coding that might be JavaScript
with node it might be PHP eventually
flare eval it might be Java with spring
it might be Python with Django and it
might be Ruby with rails both by the way
the thread of a piece boot capture
started as I had predicted the boot caps
are starting to drop Ruby on Rails
because demand is dropping
anyway that was pretty easy to protect a
couple years ago that was going to
happen anyhow so you've got to do that
you've got it once you have your basic
skills so you can actually do basic web
apps in the case of web apps then you
got to go out there and produce some
project for some real client even if
they're just starting up an idea for
business do for free maybe you're going
to be approached by somebody says I have
an idea for a business onto some
ecommerce stuff I can't pay you but we
do we say yeah in that case if they got
no money
is that your beginning do it for a share
a small share the business say yeah I'll
do it but I own 25% of the business I'll
do all the coding for you and that also
gives you a portfolio that's another
little tactic little tangent I'm going
to go on here when I try to do work I
try to get multiple benefits out of a
type of work that I'm doing so if for
example in this situation where you need
to find projects to build so you can
build your portfolio so you can start
your career as a freelancer maybe
eventually get a job that you go then
what you ought to do is is look at
projects where you can double up on the
game I just lost my train of thought my
apology so in this situation you find
somebody needs to build an e-commerce
shop they don't have any money so I'll
do it but I like a piece I'm not you
know I got to pay me but I want 25%
ownership of this website or or whatever
percentage you can negotiate from the
this way you get a piece of the action
and you get that experience and you get
that portfolio piece that you need for
your your site so that's my first tip I
feel like I'm an intermediate JavaScript
developer like other skills soft skills
what direction so yeah so once you get
your your app done have your website
promote the app and then reach out to
local business owners friends or friends
and say look look look what I did I want
to do other projects and approach them
and you take it from there what you're
going to find in the very beginning if
you're into freelancing it's it's a
little slow going because you have to
make contacts make connections and again
the key is is to showcase some of your
work and to get some work with real
people real people you might have to do
one or two small projects for free just
to get some experience dealing with
people and I can almost tell you I come
I can almost guarantee you through word
of mouth etc etc you put it out there
you're going to start getting contracts
and inevitably will happen may take a
year may take another you have or so
you're going to be so busy you won't
know what to do with all the contracts
it happens all the time the web and web
development for small business is still
a huge big demand especially if you go
into the writing issues and that's what
other things are going to be doing with
this chat are going to be talking about
the new dishes
Nisha's initiative measures little
that's a little but these areas where
you can go down to in terms of being a a
real productive or financially capable
developer a professional developer and
here's the thing let's say your ultimate
goal is to get a job working for a
company this route that I'm going to
start discussing the next series of
vlogs will get you there if you want to
as well so some people want some people
may want to stay freelance developer and
take advantage of the huge potential
revenue
get there other people may say well I
just want to do freelance for a little
while work my chops make connections and
then you know what you're going to get
job offers galore everybody who's worked
for me as you've got on to start your
own business some of the multi-million
dollar businesses or they're employed as
professional developers or similar
positions doing very well every single
one because the key to all to all this
the being so successful is that it
develops the skills that you can
demonstrate and to develop what some
people call soft skills the
interpersonal skills the business skills
which I'm going to be getting into more
stress towards entrepreneurial ism and
not lifestyle and more stress towards
and I don't know see what you guys think
about this if you watch the end of this
video if you watch one of my older
videos I talked about the importance of
F F you money F you money and you can
look it up
f you money so important it's it's
really made my middle-age existence so
much easier so important you start young
too and I'm going to be getting into
this whole thing and I think you're
cleaning that I think of coining a terms
of that calling it fin fym sim I don't
know what you guys hang out you got to
get the fin because you get the sim and
you're going to be doing really well
really well very quickly for me peace of
mind choices in life have always been my
priority has always been part of my
priority and fin is the key to all that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
