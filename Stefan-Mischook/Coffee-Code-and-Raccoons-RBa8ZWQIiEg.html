morning so I what are my rituals I like
to do because I do work out of my home
office I have been for many years all my
assistants work from their own homes I
have to meet them maybe maybe once every
two weeks once a week I just prefer this
so what that means though is that I have
to get out of the house I have to get
out of the house just to clear my mind
let's see that's the interesting thing
about that whole experience people go
yeah I love the idea of the home office
and the home office is kind of cool but
one of the things about the home office
that you can feel a little cramped in
your house if you're there all day
writing code or writing articles or
whatever you're doing so you have to
make it a point to do two figs a got to
get out see people clear the mind and
you also have to do some exercise as
well so yeah this is my first vlog I
think official blog I figured I tried
out I always every morning I drive to a
particular coffee shop that is not
exactly close to me and it's not like
they have special coffee or anything but
I just enjoyed a drive and one of the
reasons I enjoy the drive is because I I
get to drive through the park and the
cemetery in Montreal so I guess I'll
show you guys that's all about so yeah
so I'll just give you a view here
what's cool about this is so this is a
cemetery excuse me this is a cemetery a
lot of people get freaked out on a
cemetery stuff you're in a cemetery
that's crazy
I don't know I'm not freaked out by
cemeteries I actually I figure you know
one day this was this is where I'm going
to be so this is kind of cool get used
to it your new home
yeah so yeah this is it
I like coming here because it's it is a
cemetery but it's actually one of the
the most beautiful and relaxing parks in
the entire city and you got a great
artwork right if you look here look at
it look at the carvings here and
actually I'm going to show you something
from actually shot a photo here but I
use it in my book my wet design book and
I'll show you what I shot here
this particular device on that device if
you bought my book you may recognize
this gravestone so thing in this
particular cemetery because it's a very
old one it's the Mount Royal cemetery
you've got a lot of monuments like that
are just quite beautiful and much better
much better location than a typical park
and got lots of flower arrangements and
I just like to come up here and relax I
like reading headstones too which is
kind of interesting you can get some
historical figures local historical
figures but they're all buried her so
it's yeah that's about it so my first
vlog I don't know if this is interesting
to you but there's one of the things I
do this is one of my rituals I drive up
here and I just relax and another thing
I do I stretch my back I know this is
gonna seem really weird but I have this
tree here now if you can see it I call I
called my hanging tree and I actually
hang from the tree for about 20 seconds
yeah 20 30 seconds this is stretch out
my back it's actually quite quite
relaxing it opens up the backs the
muscle in the back it opens up the spine
and when you're sitting all day you're
compressing your back a lot so it's good
to decompress the back by by doing what
they call traction it's you hang up and
you hang from the tree so when you
stretch out to her legs and everything
and you get what's called traction opens
up all the muscles open up opens up the
spine and it helps with lower back pain
in a huge way the problem is you got to
get a real strong hand grip you know but
that's also cool too because if you're
going to code if you're going to be
working on business you have to have a
strong body because without a strong
body your mind is gonna be distracted by
the aches and the pains and it's fatigue
and so forth but so if you're a coder
aspiring coder and you don't exercise at
least a couple times a week three times
a week you should and you should
consider exercise as part of your work
because it's really important in terms
of your productivity when you're in
shape and you'll have to be in great
shape but when you're in pretty good
shape you're healthy your ability to
code your ability to build your business
is gonna be far far far better so I
would highly recommend that you do that
and I highly recommend that you get out
of the house you enjoy little walks
through nature if you have parks if
you're lucky enough or whatever anyway
that's my recommendation okay that's the
end of this particular video I'll end
with one last view of the park
this is just a very small part of it it
goes on for a long way
that's it for now Jojo alright I'm back
so I was just standing around checking
my texts and also needs to random
raccoons
I guess what other kind of raccoons
would you find in a cemetery so these
two random raccoons just just came up to
me they were touching my legs and you
know I guess they were looking for food
anyway III of course it was fumbling
with my camera I couldn't get to the
bloody video to work I don't shoot
videos on my my phone here very often
themself and I choked I choked but I did
get some video though I did get some
video of the raccoons so I'm gonna post
this right after this particular clip
here yeah yeah the cemetery I talked
about the cemetery in a previous vlog I
think and that's it it's got all kinds
of wildlife somebody forget you can get
Fez into your raccoons groundhogs and
all kinds of other stuff as well no
moose oh no moose but definitely lots of
interesting little beasties so yeah kind
of domesticated you gotta watch it with
raccoons though because they can have
rabies so you you got the raccoons they
could bite you and you know you don't
want to get rabies shots but that's a
sucks alright let's stop there bye
this is a wild raccoon and he just
responded to Mike maybe should tell not
to respond there is two of them just
before
there's funny stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
