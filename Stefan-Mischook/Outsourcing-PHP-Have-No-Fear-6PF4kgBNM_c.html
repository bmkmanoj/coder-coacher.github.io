PHP calm in this quick video blog I want
to comment on outsourcing and PHP this
is a major concern I think some
prospective PHP programmers may have for
people going into PHP from another field
they're worried about having their jobs
outsourced or sees this is something of
concern I guess for North Americans and
Europeans this is a legitimate concern I
suppose if you're looking at the
enterprise meaning working for a large
corporation like 18 tea or IBM or
whatnot this is not a concern though if
you're looking at developing web
applications for small and medium-sized
businesses you see outsourcing is really
something that big companies do because
of they have the infrastructure and the
tentacles to be able to do that whereas
smaller businesses don't and in fact I
find that most small businesses want to
meet face to face with the programmers
they deal with in the web designers so
if you're looking at PHP as a career
choice deal because you want to you know
you want to get into a web application
design you want something solid but
you're not worried about being
outsourced overseas then PHP is a great
idea because when it comes to small and
medium-sized web site and web
application development PHP is easily
the king in that realm if on the other
hand you were looking at maybe Java or C
sharp there you have to be a little bit
more concerned because Java and C sharp
are the capable languages but they're
really more or less gear towards larger
organizations and as such chefs are any
Java or PHP job you get not PHP Java or
C sharp job or net job that you get
chances are you'll be working for a
larger organization and by that very
fact you have a much greater chance that
your job will get out sourced so as many
of you probably know though I have a
varied background in programming
java.net PHP and a whole bunch of others
I happen to be a big PHP fan simply
because of besides the fact that that
language is extremely powerful it has
that economic advantage where if your
PHP programmer the chances of you
getting work as a freelancer or working
for a small company or a company are far
more likely than with many other
languages and you're far more likely to
keep your jobs because most PHP work is
in some small business development where
you're not going to see that kind of
stuff outsource anytime soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
