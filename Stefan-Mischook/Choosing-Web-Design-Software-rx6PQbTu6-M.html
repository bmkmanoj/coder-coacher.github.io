calm in this quick little video I'm
gonna answer a question that I get on a
regular basis and the question is what
what web designs software should you use
and does it really make a difference
short answers it doesn't make any
difference really today
web design is very different from what
it was in the past
where the web design software package
that you use whether it be expression
web Dreamweaver or some of the minor
players out there like Komodo and so on
it's not important because the
point-and-click
what-you-see-is-what-you-get WYSIWYG
software where you click on buttons and
it puts tables and divisions on your
page and inserts images those type of
tools are much less important today than
they were just five six years ago and
the reason that is is because the
technology that underlies the web HTML
CSS and so on javascript they're much
more sophisticated and more streamlined
today than they ever were in the past so
you know in the old days when there was
a heck of a lot of code to write it was
a real big hassle to don't mind the
truck going on back
when it was big hassle to create web
pages in these code and web design
software really generated a heck of all
the code to make it work these tools
were important much more important I
would argue than they are today so today
what would I would be advising people if
you're getting into it in fact you know
in my basic course I teach using notepad
on Windows or you can use text edit on
Mac because I want you to really
understand the code that's going on
behind the scenes because at the end of
the day all these programs are doing is
just writing code for you and if you
don't understand the code you're gonna
run into problems I can get it to you
because all these programs are good to
removers good expression web is good and
so on they don't do everything and
sometimes you have to get into code to
fix things and more importantly you have
to structure your code properly so if
the sites are easily updatable easy to
make easy to update easy to maintain and
so that they load quickly and so on
although that's becoming less of an
issue today as well I'm gonna go off on
a little tangent here people still talk
about the efficiency of the code so it
loads quick I would argue that's much
less important today in terms of
bandwidth because we're in the day of
video an audio download people are
downloading HD movies so you know a text
page of a it has a hundred of 200k is
really nothing
it really is nothing and to start
worrying about shaving off 20 30 K
kilobytes KS kilobytes of text from page
to make it load faster is ridiculous in
the old days that was important because
people didn't have high speed
but these days don't go crazy about that
that's just nuts that's kind of
old-school thinking anyway it's let's it
so terms of web design software doesn't
really matter a lot of web designers
don't use them at all I you know the
WYSIWYG tools you know again those are
point-and-click tools and I'm gonna do
some videos I'm gonna show you the
differences between the wizzy wings and
the text editors and so on so to help
you better understand it
you'll see it on the screen it'll be a
screencast so you actually see the
differences in the different options
that you have but I just want to
introduce the subject and what to take
away from this particular videos but you
don't need to use a fancy expensive web
design software to build websites and in
fact many pros don't use any at all
they'll use text editors typically and
you'll find in time as you get more
advanced you probably end up just using
fancy text editors rather than the
point-and-click tools and I guess
Microsoft and Adobe will hate me for
saying it but that's just the way it is
what can I tell you and I've been doing
this for a while personally though you
know I'm involved in the web design
creation every day I don't mess with co2
often anymore because I manage projects
and so on but I still use Dreamweaver on
time from occasion indicate on the
occasions rather that I do create
websites but it's it's the reason I use
Dreamweavers because I just been using
for so long I have you know I have it
and whatever so you know why not use it
continue to use it remember I've been
I've been doing this since 94 I think I
started using Dreamweaver was an early
beta I was still owned by Macromedia and
I guess that's about 10 12 years ago I
forget now exact
so it's more happy than anything else
anyway that's it I hope you found this
blog interesting and we shall talk soon
