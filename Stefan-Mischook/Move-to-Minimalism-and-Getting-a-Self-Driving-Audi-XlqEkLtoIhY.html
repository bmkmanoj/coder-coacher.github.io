this Python course complete celebration
vlog may be a little premature they're
still waiting for edits from my editor
but that's like you know 20 minutes half
an hour work you know it just felt that
word etc etc so yes I'm pretty happy
about that it's a huge monkey off my
back as producing one of my courses a
lot of work
so in this vlog I want to talk about the
move towards minimalism to move towards
minimalism so if you've been watching it
in my blogs you know that I'm a big
proponent of minimalism whether it be in
your code simpler code is better to code
in your writing using simpler terms
shipping out unnecessary unnecessary
words from your writing etc etc etc so
now I'm looking to extend this in terms
of my physical footprints if you will so
I'm here in my place and I look around
and people tell me that I've you know
pretty sparse relative to other people
in many regards but other ways I'm
pretty obnoxious in the sense that I
have very expensive furniture all
designer pieces schemes of lush Beauvoir
stuff like that if you know those names
you look them up you see that it ain't
cheap say they shy as they say in French
so here's the thing though
I went on a furniture buying thing up
until about six years ago I think it was
I was going crazy buying super expensive
couch gym super expensive this and super
expensive that and getting to the point
where it's I I feel it's become a burden
on me now a mental burden there's no
cost of owning furniture but what you
bought it right but it's becoming a
mental burden
burden in that I'm thinking of
downsizing just because of I've been
looking at minimalism revisiting that
again again I got that from martial arts
as well right and everything I do it I
thought I find that minimalism is really
really beneficial and I saw this video
on minimalism recently has really
sparked something in me in that regard
so I'm really considering going totally
minimal in fact my big plan in about a
year and a half your take when the
self-driving cars hit the market
I know Aldi BMW Mercedes depending on
the make they're going to be releasing
their self-driving cars not fully
autonomous but level three which means
you gather don't be able to drive you on
the highway which is a huge thing for me
because that's the most boring part
about driving is being on the highway
for hours and hours and hours having to
pay attention so forth so when those
self-driving cars come up I'm making the
big move I'm going to get one and I plan
is my plan is all things being equal is
I'm going to be a wandering nerd hobo
yeah
wandering nerd and what do I mean by
that I plan on shuddering shuddering
this place may be subletting my place
here or or just getting rid of my place
getting rid of most of my furniture just
keeping some very key pieces some of my
favorite designer pieces putting them in
storage or maybe sticking in my father's
basement or something and then I'm going
to drive over to Dee sell my convertible
and get a self-driving car I'm not sure
what I'll get but that's the plan and
I'm going to hit the road and what I
want to do is I want to visit many many
many many places across
of America mostly in the u.s. mostly in
the US but I want to spend at least six
months maybe a year traveling you know
these days when you're a business owner
technology business owner people who
work for me they work from home they
work remotely I rarely see them we do
video chats and emails and so forth so
there's really no reason for me to be
stuck at particular place I'm not
married and no kids and as far as I know
so it makes sense it makes no sense for
me to stay in one place necessarily most
of my friends I see that once a month
maybe everybody's busy everything I do
is phone Facebook email will mostly
phone email text so it kind of makes
sense to want to get out there and visit
all these cool places that you have in
the US and North America and spend a
good year so that's the plan
and it's all part of this minimalism
thing if you think about it if you go to
hotels if you're staying in the hotels
every day for a long time you could
probably get some really good rates
internal corporate rates and considering
my cost of living here it might be just
slightly more expensive to actually be
on the road traveling all these
different distance destinations relative
to what I spend around here and I know
that's not for everybody that is for me
and I just want to visit all these
places watch while I still can now I'm
in my mid 40s and I'm still relatively
young and so forth but I know from all
the relatives and friends of Mines
people in their 60s and 70s they can't
travel anymore health reasons and so on
so I think there now's the time to do it
and so you're asking yourself well why
don't you just fly it's not the same for
me I really like road trips and I
discovered that about eight months ago
where I went down to down to the States
I did the Rust Belt and I went down and
visited clients and friends and my
furthest I went away with Chicago
visitors some partners down there and I
drove the whole thing I said you know
I'm just going to drive the bloody
things I took seven days and I just took
my time going over place Ohio and
Buffalo New York and in Chicago then up
into Canada to Sarnia and back to
Toronto yeah together it was the
greatest trip ever it loved it I loved
it I just loved cruising on the highway
now
- enjoy your cruise on the highway you
need a few things you need a real good
car you need lots of music and
audiobooks need to take breaks every two
hours and need to drive a moderate pace
and I will get into the details beyond
that but if you do that road trips are
amazing super fun and and you get
yourself a a good cell phone plan you
can talk with people hands-free as
you're driving take breaks you know now
imagine with the self-driving car that's
like a dream because again the worst
part about the road trips if you didn't
call it the worst part is the highway
driving so the self-driving car level 3
which are coming out in about a year and
a half there you go it's perfect you
know if it could take over three four
hours of the day of your driving it's
fantastic so this is all related back to
minimalism I don't need all this stuff I
don't need all this junk I have like
huge TVs that I never watch I always
watch video on my laptop and I have
very good stereo which I rarely listen
to back stereo in my Audi's far far
better 1414 speaker surround sound Bang
&amp;amp; Olufsen sounds amazing in the car so I
listen to more music in my car than
anywhere else
yeah yeah yeah no so minimalism very
appealing sells stuff keep only some
prime pieces get on the road travel
around North America visiting people
friends clients different locations now
started made and Boston New York and
down to the Carolinas Florida New
Orleans Texas and Yellowstone Park you
get the idea
great time great life experience and
small footprint will you need to bring
one week worth of clothes stay at a
hotel they wash your clothes for ten
bucks
16 bucks whatever you move on you don't
if you need some things for some reason
you forget just go buy it no big deal
and that's it laptops are so powerful
editing 4k video on my ultra thin laptop
with no problems don't need a huge
computer anymore the only thing I might
do is might take my flatscreen that
panel my 27-inch monitor just put that
in the trunk so I can set that up and do
my work that's pretty much it so I might
do that because now that all my
infrastructure work is done I move from
the physical servers to the VPS which is
white-glove fully serviced servers
mostly the APIs is very solid and done
study web fours in production now again
I don't need to be around to have that
done so it's uh it's very appealing to
me have to tell you there's an old I
think it's blue this could be Zen I
think it's Buddhist they say in time
that which you possess will come to
possess you and I can tell you 100%
that's the case
I'm starting to feel bound by all this
expensive furniture you know I should
utilize I spend nine thousand on that
piece and I spend three thousand not and
he really would like to get rid of it
cuz you spent so much money if you spend
any money on these things you just like
what whatever replace it like this so
anyway
food for thought minimalism is very
appealing very appealing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
