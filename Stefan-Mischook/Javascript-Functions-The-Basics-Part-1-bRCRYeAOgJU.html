learn about something called a function
in a nutshell a function is a mechanism
inside of JavaScript you can think of it
as a program inside a program where the
big program being the JavaScript engine
but we spoke about before and a function
and there are many many many functions
in JavaScript that you can use to do all
kinds of things like count how many
letters or a name send off emails all
kinds of different things so besides the
fact that JavaScript has many many
built-in functions possibly hundreds if
not a couple of thousand built-in
functions you can actually create your
own custom functions so that you can
bunch up your code into reusable
packages so functions allow you to
segment your code and functions allow
you to reuse code in a much more
efficient manner so let's jump into some
actual function code and we're gonna
play with some stuff so you got a better
idea of what's going on so let's jump
into some actual JavaScript code and
we're gonna work with some functions
great some functions and along the way
I'll slip in some new theory details
just enough so that we can move forward
and get to some real practical
JavaScript throughout this series thus
far we've actually used one of the
built-in functions in JavaScript and
that is the alert function so let me get
into a few details here so we're gonna
clear script block
language for JavaScript and type
text/javascript now you noticed
we just finish this off here guys you
notice that I added this new attribute
you know this script block tag set it
has attributes just like any other HTML
tag and type equals text JavaScript
basically tells the interpreter that in
between the tags we're gonna be writing
text that happens to be JavaScript this
is not necessary because when we see
language equals JavaScript the browser's
are smart enough to know what to do but
anyway just to be complete so we've used
this function many times alert and just
tell say hello hello a function so let's
actually preview this there we go hello
I'm a function so let's get into a few
details here this is a built-in function
and so the JavaScript knows that it is
because it recognizes it it knows we're
dealing with a function because of this
because of the two little brackets after
that this tells JavaScript that this is
a function we just wrote alerts like
this as far as JavaScript is concerned
that would not be a function soon as we
put the two brackets like that we got a
function it's always good to end your
JavaScript statements remember each line
of code in JavaScript is called a
statement it's always good to end with a
semicolon because it knows that that's
the end of the line so we could we could
lie up functions like this if we wanted
to so you can go this because I wanted
to print text you can also put in a
quotes right so let's see this in action
hello on the function hello Stephan and
why does it do that because here alert
alert alert so you see how I can put
them on separate lines and I can
actually include multiple functions on
the same line functions have a few parts
to it first of all who knows like I said
we have our brackets in between the
brackets we have something called the
arguments as in you're arguing a point
to somebody
essentially this is extra information
that you're feeding the function to tell
what to do each function has his own
particular functionality hence the word
function so alert that basically just
pops open the alert box that we've been
seeing many times during this course so
there we go see that's all that function
does it pops opens this box and it sends
optional text to that box let me just
don't need to use to make it quicker so
we could take it out and have nothing in
here and it pops open nothing happens we
can also let's see if you take out the
quotes now let's go on there nothing
happens
let's put in the quotes see what happens
function you got our function thing
popping up you see when you have no
quotes Internet Explorer tells us here
yes
nope Internet Explorer is just blank
whereas with Firefox it doesn't display
any box at all you see how Firefox and
Internet Explorer has slightly different
behavior sometimes anyhow in between see
whatever 9 does this plays night so in
between these brackets you have
something called the arguments the
argument is basically extra information
that you're providing the function that
will affect what the function will do in
the case of alert since it's a very
simple function it just pops open that
box and displays whatever you put into
arguments so what you want to take away
from this part of the video is that
functions are formed by a name of a
function then you have the two brackets
and you may have optional arguments in
between these brackets what arguments
you can put in here depends really on
the particular function and we're gonna
be looking at some built-in functions in
JavaScript to get a better idea of
what's this all about as usual if any of
this is kind of confusing don't worry
about it just bear with me as we get
into more examples and we start working
with some of the built-in functions in
JavaScript you'll you have a better
understanding of this and then later on
and other videos I'll actually show you
how to create your own functions from
from from scratch and I'll tell you why
you'd want to do this and you can see
the advantages that's when the
JavaScript programming starts to get
interesting
so to recap our introduction to
functions functions are like many
programs in a program the big program
being a JavaScript engine functions
provide packaged up functionality that
are there to basically make it easy for
you to do all kinds of different things
we saw some built-in functions like the
alert and we're gonna look at something
called index of very soon besides
built-in functions javascript allows you
to create your own functions from
scratch which we're going to address in
another video custom functions are a
great way to wrap up a bunch of useful
JavaScript code into a virtual container
the virtual container being of the
function so but it is more easily used
in your scripts and it can be used over
and over again again we'll get into
custom functions in our part two on
functions and now let's jump into
playing with some different functions
including index of and we'll see how
different types of arguments will work
in this regard and it will make it a lot
more clear
