to go over one last thing about images
that to be totally honest I really
forgot about in when I was doing the
main images video tutorial and
specifically mommy just select an image
here when you select an image you can
see as you know in the properties bar
here panel at the bottom you see these
edit buttons so I just want to go over a
couple of these things and point out a
few issues number one if you have
photoshop installed you see this PS
button if you click this and you have
photoshop installed on your computer
dreamweaver will launch Photoshop which
will allow you to edit this image in
Photoshop if you don't have photoshop
and installed of course this won't work
but these little things will now what
are these these are image editing
capabilities so that you typically would
not see in a web design program actually
these image editing capabilities or
something which you would typically see
in a program like photoshop so for
instance if I click the optimize button
and you see this thing whole thing pop
open now this allows you to tweak your
image and to optimize it in a whole
bunch of different ways which are if
you've ever used photoshop or paint shop
pro or any photo editing program you'll
see a lot of these things are common
you're able to make changes to this
image and once you understand is when
you'd make these changes to the image it
actually affects the underlying image
permanently so for instance let's go to
this file tab and you see have a scale
capability here so i'm going to say
scale this image
fifty percent you're taking you see how
much smaller it gets now to give you
perspective this is the original size of
the image so let's let's let's click say
okay as you can see our web page the
image has indeed been scaled and unlike
where I showed you in the previous video
where I was just stretching stretching
the image using the handles but the
underlying image wasn't actually changed
when you use this button here these
buttons here you actually do change the
underlying image and the proof is i'm
back in the file system here and you can
actually see indeed a Dream Weaver has
it resized the image as you would expect
an image editor to do let's look at a
couple of the other buttons for instance
you have the crop button so I hit that
and dream we were in fact here gives you
a warning town you've at the action you
are about to perform or permanently all
tovar image so understand that europe
you're actually permanently altering
image so here i can write in my page
crop the image like you would expect in
something like photoshop so once you've
found whatever area of the image you
want to keep you just double click over
a crop and you see you got the crop
happening now this is pretty ugly and
you're not going to want to do this in
real life well you know here it is but I
just we're just going over things here
let's look at another thing let's look
at the brightness and contrast again and
getting that same morning look out these
changes will be permanent so by the way
a lot of these warning boxes you can
tell dreamweaver to not show these
messages over over again because it gets
kind of annoying by checking it off and
then hitting ok i leave it on because it
is you know for the sake of this video
so here we go we get this dialog box and
again like any image editing program you
can increase the brightness and you can
see dreamweaver updates the image for us
real time increase the contrast so you
have pretty good
editing capabilities basic very very
basic image editing capabilities were
you able to do little tweaks to your
images so you can find that Dreamweaver
may save you a trip to photoshop or pay
chopra or something over here if you
noticed well while I was talking I was I
opened up the sharpen option here in the
sharpen tool so you can sharpen images
now you see it's a subtle effect now
anyway you see what you see what's going
on so the point is is that with
Dreamweaver cs3 you do actually have
basic image editing capabilities built
right into it where you actually affect
the underlying image as we see here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
