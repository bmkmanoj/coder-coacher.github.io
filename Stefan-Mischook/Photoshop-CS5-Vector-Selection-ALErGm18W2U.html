you about is working with the path that
we had just created and you can do this
with any path no matter what you're
working with
and what I want to talk about is what if
you are unhappy with the way things look
and you want to move things around well
there are a number of options here
inside of the pen tool if you click down
and hold on it you'll open up this
submenu and it's got some other options
that you have available to you and
another way of manipulating that path is
working with the path selection tools
there's a black one that allows you to
select the entire path and that's pretty
simple and straightforward however
there's also a white one
which allows you to select only one of
these anchor points so the direct
selection path allows me to click on
this point right here and notice
independent from all the others I can
move it around if you want to manipulate
how the handles look well notice by
stretching them out that determines how
wide that curve is going to be for
example if I want this to be even
further accentuated I can drag this one
and make a longer handle see that long
handles long handles what about this one
long handle if you want I can now move
this out higher so you can see how these
points can be manipulated and the
handles can be as well well let's look
at one thing in particular when it comes
to this particular point here I'll just
bring these handles down a little bit
make them a little bit more reasonable
to work with and let's look at this if I
have two handles well when I move one it
moves the other one in direct proportion
to where I've moved the original so it's
an opposite effect so what I want to do
instead then is what if I only want one
of these things to move for example this
but I don't want to move the other
corresponding one so press option again
as you move things well look at that it
allows you now now I don't have to press
option because these two are not
connected in any way so I can move this
around and I can manipulate these things
independently isn't that great
and if I click on this one I can further
accentuate these handles see just
clicking on this one thing I can bring
that one out and do a number of
different things to it so I can select
this point I could say hey you know I
want these to be more exaggerated or I
could say well let's press option and
I'll move these in a separate fashion
notice you've got to make sure that when
we do select it just selecting the one
sorry and moving them so there you go
there are a lot of different ways that
we can manipulate our objects selecting
just one of them moving them in any
number of different positions and you
can create a very very interesting
drawing and interesting effect just
working with those elements notice that
if I were to select that entire path as
you can see here then I could use the
pen tool to do a number of other things
for example I could click on this option
to add to a specific point on that path
notice clicking there clicking there now
I have more points that I can manipulate
the white arrow tool if you don't like
all of those points well then you
certainly can press the minus option and
delete them but now I'd have to change
where my handles look because they might
have gotten a little messed up working
in that fashion so those are some great
options but notice when you're with the
pen tool if you were to press option
actually hold on a second let's select
that first of all so I'll come in here
and with my black our tool I'll select
that path and then with my pen tool
notice just clicking on the edge here
you'll already see you don't need to
activate
that tool with the plus sign because it
already gives you a plus right there and
then if you move over it again it gives
you the minus sign to get rid of it so
all of these things are easily
accessible just by using the pen tool so
when we come back we're going to look at
the next option inside of your vector
drawing and that is working with these
vector shapes here and I'll show you how
you can make the most of them and really
create some interesting things inside of
your work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
