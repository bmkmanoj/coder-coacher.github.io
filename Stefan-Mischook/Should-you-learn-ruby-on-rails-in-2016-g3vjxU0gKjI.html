I'm recording this in June 2016 it's
actually June 16th 2000 2016 which is
kind of cool so what I learned Ruby on
Rails today No unless I had a job lined
up for Ruby on Rails but Ruby on Rails
is slowly fading does that mean it's
going to disappear overnight
no but it's a technology on its way out
it's lost its mojo and you know the Mojo
now today is with JavaScript of course
javascript with projects like node.js
and I think Express j/s is the MVC
framework that sits on top a node anyway
forget about that yeah if you're looking
at Ruby on Rails today I would not learn
it unless you know I would be looking
more towards JavaScript JavaScript based
or PHP PHP love it or hate it
it's very powerful but it's almost
ubiquitous meaning it's everywhere
everybody uses PHP because it's just
very powerful easy to learn you see it
in whitson using so many apps that are
used in modern web sign these days
whether it be wordpress joomla drupal so
many companies use these three learning
not learning management systems content
management systems so many of the apps
use those and they're all PHP based just
that alone is going to guarantee PHP s
longevity Ruby does not have the
equivalent how about Java j2ee or
asp.net c-sharp they're fine they're
fine languages but in they're fine
environments
frameworks problem with that is that you
know they're largely things you use
those technologies for enterprise work
big huge corporations with legacy apps
if you want to do new stuff you should
be looking at I would even do in PHP and
eventually JavaScript Python is actually
a choice I would take over Ruby on Rails
Python has something
silicone Jango I think there's another
one I've never used it I thought very
popular language because it's used a lot
on the server Google uses it a lot it's
great language lots of fun easy to learn
but PHP is much faster if you're going
to be doing web apps in terms of what it
when it's running it's actually a much
more efficient language your server
needs to be much less powerful so I
would be more inclined to PHP in that
regard so there you go I will not be
doing Ruby on Rails today I wouldn't
learn it unless I had a job lined up
because it is a technology that had its
day and it's going away it's going away
so I will never sing again I promise
because I'm not a singer Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
