Studio web com and killer PHP calm in
this video blog I'm going to go over the
rules of programming and this is based
on a blog I just put up so I'm going to
distill my I guess 15 16 years so it
loves that loves that little 15 or 16
years or more a programming experience
going back to the mid 90s in this blog
so rule number one steps rule number one
or programming you will not remember
everything you learn that's something it
comes up actually with people or
beginners maybe he's some between
beginner and intermediate they get a
little concerned about forgetting
details about a particular language for
getting the syntax you know how exactly
do you use this library in PHP or vat
library and Ruby de panne you know
depending on what you're doing and I'm
here to tell you that it's over time
it's inevitable you're going to forget
details about how to write certain type
certain code that's why God invented
Google and PHP net and the case of PHP
these references where you can look up
this particular code that you would have
to write to do something the most
important thing that you have to take
away from when you're learning and when
you know a programming language is to
know the basic concepts of constructs to
understand what a class is how to create
a class to understand when and why you
would use classes and even simpler
things you know what arrays are what
collections are how to iterate through a
raise how to create functions methods
and so on and so forth it's that is the
important thing because once you know
these concepts then the specifics about
you know how to write the looping code
for instance for instance in Ruby you
know there's a basic example but how to
write that code specifically it's not
important all that you understand is
need to understand what it is
is and how you use it why would you know
why would you use a certain type of
iterator as it called versus another but
you know specific implementation
specific code not important now you just
look it up that's why they have IDEs
integrated development environments
these are programs that will you type
for instance you type in the beginning
of a class method from a particular
language and the IDE smart enough to
suggest to you a little drop-down menu
appears will say well you can complete
it with business or that option and
there you go so you know as you learn
more as you come more experienced as you
you will forget things especially if you
stop using a particular language for a
little bit because you switched over to
another for whatever reasons for
instance myself and my career my
favorite language at the time especially
I was really active in Cody was Java I
did a lot of java coding but it's been
years since I've really written any Java
and asked me about you know how to write
XYZ and you know how to do threading in
Java I don't remember to syntax I would
just look it up and I wouldn't start
programming it most important thing is
to know how to use threading in Java and
what are the implications of using
threading in Java threading by the way
is the process of spinning off processes
into their own thread so that that you
know you can have for instance your app
it could be connecting to the database
and grabbing information from the
database at the same time it could be
doing something to the UI one doesn't
have to wait for the other that's why
you use threading and the overall job of
course was not to use threading
whatsoever because it was a real mess in
html5 they're called web workers i
believe ya and you use that to you can
spawn threads within the browser and you
could do all kinds of stuff and that
actually works pretty good apparently
although i haven't done it too much so
and there you go there's an example I
know what it is i know the browsers can
do it I know basically what it does I
don't remember the syntax but you know
what I just look it up and there it is
no way I go steps number to rule
programming to learn PHP code is to
write PHP code now replace PHP with any
other language HTML CSS Ruby Python Java
C sharp objective-c etc the key is the
quickest way to learn to comb and to
hone your coding skills is actually
write the code for some people guys like
me I'm inclined to read books and you
know understand the theory and so on and
then you know and theoretically I could
understand a lot of things but I've
learned through hard experience but
especially when I was first learning
JavaScript back in the day that was my
first language I believe mid-1990s I had
a hard time actually writing JavaScript
code for a first time even though i had
read these thick books and I could ask
me how do you do this in JavaScript I
just do this and this and this but when
I actually sat down to write the code I
was really really bad and it got me to
think about my method of learning to
program and later on to teach you got to
get coding experience into your students
hands or if you're learning into your
hands as quickly as possible it should
be ten percent theory ninety percent
practical in terms of the spread in
terms of learning to code maybe in the
first couple days it's it's maybe eighty
percent theory and twenty percent code
but that's only the first couple of days
and you move into it you start writing
code that's how you're going to learn
the quickest and that's how you're going
to become a good programmer faster my
number three rule of programming there
are many ways to skin a cat and even in
Ruby they they have an expression for
that something about toads or something
I don't know but anyway this is
something that you have to wreck
and in any particular language there's
usually multiple ways to do many
different things and the reason for us
you know sometimes one method might be
slightly more efficient than another
method depending on the circumstance it
also could be just a question of taste
some people prefer to do one way some
the other way so you just recognize that
there's many different ways to do the
same thing don't get married to a
particular method don't get married to a
particular library you may switch in and
out of them depending on what your
project needs are at the time or
depending on how your tastes evolve at
the time so for instance in PHP there
are several libraries that you can use
to connect to databases the most popular
today our MySQL I and then you have
something called PHP p do PHP p do is
pure object-oriented and you can use it
to talk to any database whereas and the
syntax is the same regardless of your
underlying database so you're talking to
mysql one day another day using the PHP
PDL libraries you can connect to
postgres SQL and it's the same syntax
there's an advantage there whereas the
mysql high libraries are specific to
mysql and it has both an object-oriented
layer and it has a procedural layer and
if all what I'm just saying right now
makes no sense then you have to go to
studio com or a killer PHP and learn it
there or anywhere else but the point is
is that you get multiple libraries that
are pretty involved and they do the same
thing but there are nuances as to why
you want to use one or the other these
days in 2014 people are moving towards
PHP p do generally speaking they like
that idea of a flexibility yeah i'm
agnostic with regards to that so I'll
leave that to you to decide rule number
four of programming keep your code
simple simple code the faster runs
typically the easier it is to update the
easier it is to write and the easier it
is to create
simple code is best when you see people
getting into the intermediate levels of
programming begin to all these cool new
ways that you can write software and
some of these cool new ways are
warranted and they make sense sender
because they offer something to the
project they offer they can make it
really take a bunch of cold make it much
simpler or they can make the call run
much faster other reasons too but that
being said I would caution you to lean
on to go towards rather simpler code
khob it's really easy to understand at a
glance even if you're going to write
even if that simple goal means ten
percent more actual lines of code or
fifteen percent depending simpler code
is just easier to to work with down the
road so think about a six month you read
a real complex method or a series of
classes and then six months down the
road you got to come back and look at it
having not seen it in six months you may
have a hard time trying to figure out
you know what your brilliant logic was
at the time but on the other hand if you
have really simple cold it's on is that
simple that's simple simple then you
know for you to update it and get your
head wrapped around that code base you
know later on will be much easier so
keep that in mind this is a judgment
call again it depends you know is where
experience comes in highly experienced
programmers will be able to judge when
it makes sense to go one rouse or the
other but generally speaking always lean
to make your code very simple a
self-describing code what I mean by
self-describing you should be able to
look at a page of code and look at the
method names or function names look at
the variable names and go aya I know
what this what we're doing here you know
the method names should be long you know
they should describe you don't say send
email to users send email to and mins
you know the long method names like that
function names are good because they
tell you something right away so
comments are good
you know we put comments in your code to
tell you something about the code and
they're good but if you have a code
based requires very little comment or no
comments because it's so self-describing
that's fantastic code so there you have
it there are my four rules of
programming for some reason I just
called the blog post the number one rule
of programming no I just wanted to keep
it simple but those are my four rules if
you follow these rules you will be a
much better coder it will produce much
better code and will make your life as a
programmer easier as you continue to
evolve and learn because that's a big
part of programming is to continue to
learn whether it be within the same
language or moving into other languages
because if you know PHP and you start
learning ruby your PHP will get better
because you've learned to Ruby and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
