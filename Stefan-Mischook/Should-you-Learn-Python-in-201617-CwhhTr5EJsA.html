a would I learn a Python in 2016-17
videos since I've done C++ Java Jeff
sweat into Java but JavaScript PHP so
short answer is it depends on the type
of work that you want to do this is
usually the answer of course with any
programming language when you are
choosing any technology you have to
consider number one the type of work
that you want to do because you got to
like what you do and number two you got
to look at your local market demands
look at the local market around you
wherever you happen to live and you
should make your choice based on that
having said that Python has a huge
market potential because it's so widely
used Python is used not just in web app
creation in terms of web apps the
biggest what I know of is Instagram
Pinterest original Google was done with
Python and it's used in many of the
sites now unlike PHP to get Python on
the web takes a little bit more work
because with PHP it was designed from
the get-go to be a web programming
language where Python was really a
systems level language or a
general-purpose language but only what
do I mean by system level language
python was used or is used quite a bit
as what do we call a scripting language
okay it's tuner terms in a row basically
you would use Python to automate things
on a server now it could be automating
just basic server processing like
sending out messages and stuff it can be
used for scanning directories it could
be used for certain types of files and
cleaning up things it could be used to
automate software very complex apps for
instance a friend of mine works in the
film industry and they have very
powerful apps that will process the
video and they use Python code to
control the app in a very
detailed way because they set up all
kinds of click all kinds of buttons
would be too much work so they write the
Python code and it controls the app
rendering app in its details
Python is also use in robotics to
control robots it's used in IOT Internet
of Things it's used a lot in scientific
experiments it's used to process data
derived from from whatever type of
scientific work you happen to be doing
so it's very popular in that regard it's
also very popular in schools and
educational settings because python is a
very approachable language the Python
syntax syntax is just a nerd word for
code the code that you write in Python
or the Python code is actually very very
simple to read it doesn't have funny
symbols that you see in Java or
JavaScript or PHP and it's a very
expressive language I've actually been
very impressed at how expressive it is
what do I mean by expressive what I mean
is that what very few lines of Python
code you can get a lot done I'm going to
be doing some comparison soon some
videos and this is all because as you
may or may not know I'm building a new
Python course because I've had
institutional clients of mine schools
who requested that I do build one now
when I build my courses for studio web
anybody who's used to do what will tell
you that they're much much much
different from your typical video course
that you see on YouTube or any of the
other course providers up there I've
stepped it up five notches and so the
learning experience with these 2d
web-based course regardless of language
whether it be as html5 JavaScript PHP
SQL or whatever Python coming out soon
it's far more involved it's far better
now us but to get that extra boost
there's a lot more work involved in
putting out
course or studio web literally like
three four or five times the work that
it takes to just to put out your
standard video tutorial or video course
anyway back to Python yeah it's a
general-purpose language I would
characterize it so it can be used in
many different areas as I said robotics
software automation web app creation
server automation it could be used in
IOT you can use you could use Python in
controlling Raspberry Pi computers it's
really really been adopted in many
different places and I have to say I've
been putting together my course
experimenting with different things
looking deeper into the Python world and
I've been pretty impressed about how
approachable they've made all the Nerds
around Python have made Python in terms
of feel how good the language is now you
may or may not know I remember back
going years ago when I looked at Python
first time many years ago I was looking
at a Python web framework called Django
and I decided not to go with it because
it required huge amount of resources
meaning CPU and memory to get anything
done with Python it was a very slow
language especially when compared to
Java or PHP and so I didn't go with it
even though the language itself and the
libraries and its flexibilities is very
impressive and that's still the case
today terms of raw speed at runtime
meaning when you actually running the
code in real life
Python is relatively slow compared to
PHP or Java but on the flip side pythons
and all kinds of advantages which I
outlined a few things so something to
consider
that said I've always said that speed of
runtime for most people these days for
most apps whether it be web apps or
are controlling the robot speed is
becoming less and less of an issue
because processors are so powerful today
that it's becoming a non-issue
so something something to keep in mind
though Python does run more slowly than
other alternatives the closest Python
comes to in terms of languages is
something called Ruby now Ruby was very
popular and fairly popular rather in the
web space with Ruby on Rails and the
Ruby language is very similar to Python
certain respects although there are some
significant differences specifically
terminator statements now I remember
basically with Python they make use of
white space and line breaks to to tell
the Python app the interpreter that
reads the Python code you see Python
like so many other programming languages
today they're not just a coding language
there's an app that will process the
code and they'll call this the
interpreter so you've got a ruby
interpreter get a python interpreter you
got a PHP server
you got a JavaScript interpreter or an
engine some people might call it anyway
so with Ruby and I only played around
Ruby in the past I you know again
because of speed issues and other things
I never jumped into it professionally
but they have this and they use an end a
keyword to end off functions for example
whereas Python uses whitespace so it
could be a use of the whitespace could
be a little confusing perhaps now this
is where the Ruby in the Python people
will do battle like so many nerds so
battle about which language is best
which is no bad no good and I have to
say that in terms of having a nice end
keyword at the end of a function would
be something I would prefer but you
gotta understand my perspective I come
from a Java perspective which has
tremendous amount of code to get
anything done it's a very verbose
language verbose means long-winded so
anyway I'll end us all in this here
because I don't want to get into
language war so the point of this was
his Python worth learning yes if it is
something that looks interesting to you
you find letters work in your
geographical area can you get work doing
Python assume you want to get a job or
maybe you have a project in mind you're
wondering can Python suit those needs
definitely if you want to do ilt you
wanna do robotics
you want to do web apps yes five I can
do all those things although in terms of
putting out web apps that are fast and
performance you'd be better off with PHP
in my opinion well not in my opinion is
much faster runtime language but PHP
just as the web Python does over a whole
bunch of other things that's about it I
hope you found this log interesting as I
said earlier in a previous vlog because
I'm busy building this course amongst
other things amongst my normal work my
vlog output will slow down just a little
bit for a little while while I get this
course out but the good thing is I'm
looking to step it up with this course
if you've done my previous courses my
recent PHP write JavaScript course or
whatnot you see the level that it was at
and I think that you'll see with this
new Python course going to be even
higher level because I just don't go
over code like everybody else it's
boring I bring in a whole bunch of other
stuff into my courses to make them make
them more relevant we'll just leave it
at that for now thanks for watching guys
