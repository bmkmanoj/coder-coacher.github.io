calm and in this series of videos what
I'm going to be doing is walking you
through some of the more advanced topics
of found in many of the very popular PHP
frameworks out there whether it's
symphony or PHP cake or the zend
framework and we're going to be looking
at getting ready for PHP 6 which should
be coming out in a couple of months and
just looking at some advanced topics
like magic methods namespaces anonymous
functions creating call packs and doing
a lot of kind of neat things with the
code to just minimize the amount of code
that we're actually writing so that it's
more succinct and so it's better
architected so there's definitely going
to be an emphasis on architecture in
this series of videos so let's get
started the first thing you're going to
need to follow along is just you're
going to need some kind of lamp or xampp
stack of technologies you're going to
need PHP and apache and usually when you
download it it also comes with my sequel
so what i would suggest is to go to
apache friends org and to download a
copy of xampp which is free and it's
actually cross-platform if you're on a
windows box or on on a mac or you're
running you bun two or any kind of linux
distribution you should be able to get
up and running relatively quickly with
XM with that in mind you're going to
need to have at least version 5.3 of PHP
to get started so if you don't want to
install xampp on your local computer
you're going to need to have a hosting
environment where you can work with that
version of PHP or above so i have this
local domain setup on my humble little
computer here which is pointing to
killer PHP which is just a fake address
it's a it's basically pointing to my
local computer so I can develop easily
at home and I've also got this very
simple text editor called bbedit which I
highly suggest but you can get away with
pretty much any text editor or you can
use a fancy one like PDT or netbeans but
really anything is good and you'll see
that basically I've got an index dot PHP
file here with preparing yourself for
PHP 6 autoloading classes which is going
to be the first topic that we're going
to be looking at and if i refresh this
page I can see it right here in terms of
my file structure you'll see that i have
this folder here called killer PHP and
i've got a public folder with the actual
index.php file that you're seeing right
here so this is very important just
we've got the killer PHP folder which is
where we're storing our application and
we have a public folder where we're
going to be putting any public assets
classes or scripts that we want to make
available to the viewers of the website
and in there we just have an index dot
PHP file so if i go back to BB edit here
and i delete these lines and i open up a
PHP tag and do PHP info with a semicolon
i should be able to see that i'm running
PHP version 5.3 which is pretty much all
that's required to get us up and running
and doing some neat stuff with
autoloading classes in future videos in
this series we're actually going to be
building our own MVC framework and it's
not that I would suggest that you write
one or that you roll your own from
scratch unless you have a lot of time on
your hands but it is a great way of
seeing how frameworks are constructed in
general and sort of the power that comes
with using methods that are called
dynamically so instead of actually
calling a function in a class you you
abstract out that responsibility to
another class it sounds a little tricky
at this point but once we get into the
code it'll it'll probably make a little
more sense so let's get started the
first thing that I want to talk about is
just you might have seen this a lot in
legacy PHP code is the statement
require once so if i wanted to load a
class for example and i'm going to
create i'm going to create a class
called a user it's going to be a user
model so if we think about this in in
traditional old-school PHP you would
create a new file and you would say
class user so we just kind of open that
up and then I'm in my public folder here
so I would create user dot PHP hit save
and then we'd be good to go let's say I
created a public function here called
get name and I returned John Smith and
then here if I wanted to use that class
than I would do require once and then
user dot PHP then I would create a new
user object and then I would echo user
get name and then if I went back to my
site here and i refresh this i would get
John Smith now this is great if you're
dealing with one or two PHP files but a
lot of these frameworks have hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds of classes
which means that if you want to create
any kind of structure or relationship
between these classes you're constantly
creating these require once statements
here and there and that can be a lot of
a lot of work for you down the line so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you how you can create namespaces
basically an absolute location for a
class and then you can do away with all
of these require one statements so
instead of saying require once user dot
PHP and then user equals new user you
can just say user equals new user and
everything else will just magically work
now to do that we're going to need to
change our index dot PHP file a little
bit the first thing I want to do is I
want to look at this very special
function called get include path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
