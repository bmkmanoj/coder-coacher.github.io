comments and I had this person here and
see yes school and I thought you were a
nice man and she had written a comment
with regards to this video here where my
mic was let me just get to it yeah so in
this particular video this big mic here
I had forgot to plug it in so she said
yeah you just got to hook it up to
phantom power something like that so I
thought it was like a joke she was
making as I just said laugh out loud and
she got oh oh angry with me yeah yeah
screw it I thought you were a nice man
you have to be very careful when you're
writing text online whether it be on
YouTube or Facebook or when you're
texting your girlfriend
I have personally got into huge amount
of problems over the years when I had
sent out texts to x y&amp;amp;z girlfriends at
particular moments in time and they
mission troop in my texts so there you
go there's an example on YouTube where I
was misinterpreted and I was not making
fun of her I thought you know when you
forget to plug in your mic and it's not
working it's kind of like you know it's
kind of a basic mistake you know
like not plugging in your vacuum before
you vacuum so yeah she was trying to be
helpful and I just said you know yeah I
laughed out loud and she got so angry
but she delete her to comment and you
know here it is anyway
interesting little tip there be very
careful which you write what your text
how you write your text rather because
it can be easily misinterpreted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
