question it was put to me in the forums
I don't have the computer in front of me
I'm just preparing a team anyway so
somebody asked me how do you transition
into selling IP selling intellectual
property from being a freelancer I guess
or for selling your time and the
ultimate goal I think well depending on
what you want to do now for me the
ultimate goal because of lifestyle is to
sell IP intellectual property but it's
actually the most challenging type of
business to set up so you have a lot of
lead time in that situation so my first
business I was actually selling product
and then later on I was selling IP no
selling product that I went into
freelancing and then I started selling
IP in terms of a SAS software as a
service and then I went into selling
content the courses in 2003 so how do
you transition into that first thing you
got to do is you're going to develop
your basic coding skills your web skills
the student web web skills why because
these are tools that you can use to
position yourselves to be able to have
an IP based business initially an
intellectual property based business
whether it be a SAS or whatnot
in his question he said specifically he
didn't want to have to talk in front of
a camera and so forth that I understand
it was very uncomfortable for me for
several years in fact it took me it took
me hundreds of videos hunt literally
hundreds and hundreds of videos before I
started becoming comfortable it's weird
when you see his camera in front of you
for most people that kind of frees up as
I did and I think what it is it's gonna
sound weird I think this is my theory I
think the reason people freeze up in
front of the camera because you got this
eye this giant eye and your lizard brain
your lower brain remember I said I study
psychology in university I was my major
so your lizard brain your lower brain
may perceive that as
an unknown predator this giant are
looking at you what's this I looking at
me for
so you have to get your lizard brain
used to the idea that this eye is not
dangerous again this is one of my
theories based on my study of psychology
so that's why people are nervous in
front of camera okay back on point so
yes you can develop an IP based business
without having to be on camera without
having to produce content assess this is
a big example of that a
software-as-a-service now for me I've
had a few Sasa's out there I have
mentioned my dating site in the past
which I shut down before really started
getting traction which you know in
retrospect I think was a big mistake and
why did I shut it down because I didn't
want to be associated with a bunch of
swingers anyhow so my current software
as a service is you studio web which is
used by many many schools and that's
growing as well but that didn't come in
overnight which brings me to the basic
strategy that I suggest that you
implement so what you have to do to be
able to produce a suspect could be
effective in the market place meaning
where it can make you money's you have
to really know that market place well
the mistake that I see a lot of people
make I don't know this mistake as a
mistake in my opinion is that they they
are coders and from the outside they
look into an industry to try to figure
out what it is they can do to modernize
that industry so why is that a mistake
because when you're looking from the
outside in you only gonna have at best a
superficial knowledge of what's going on
within an industry and so you're likely
gonna make costly mistakes and I spoke
about this in the course I believe I
talked about the bird food situation
where I brought in all this bird food a
couple thousand pounds and
it turned out to be not a very turn out
to be a disaster because they didn't
understand the key component of them it
wolf of what makes a good bird food
anyway I won't rehash that story so with
Studio web when I built that prototype
seven years ago well my team I had an
idea in my head what I wanted in terms
of an educational system based on my
experience teaching code but I didn't
have any experience at that point time
in terms of teaching code within a
classroom I didn't do it myself and what
I discovered
well I discovered a lot of things I
discovered a lot of things about how
schools operates how teachers operate
over time so when I built the first
iteration of Studio web was based on my
ideas and I deployed it to the public
and it worked great but when I got
contacted by a couple schools I had only
built we had only built a superficial
implementation of house to do what could
work in a classroom I won't get into
details it was just basic essentially so
schools couple schools adopted it and
then all this tech support question
started coming in and over the years
we've had to make major major changes to
the studio web codebase and the way the
app actually works to so that it aligns
with what schools need and I would say
that maybe 50% 60% of the original
studio web is in place in terms of how
it works that's there might be a hundred
little things in there in fact allow it
to be functional within the school
context very different from when
individuals such as yourself are just
using studio web to learn from home it's
a different game altogether so because I
was not working inside the school
systems I didn't have internal knowledge
about how schools work in the u.s.
especially now I come from a family of
teachers my father Adam chuckles I had
some ideas you know sit around you you
grow up with teachers you get a pretty
good idea of what's going on there it's
still not the same as be
employee working there so I didn't have
the whole picture I had half the picture
and as a result I had to we had to do a
lot of rewriting a lot of patching a lot
of changes to study web the core app
itself and the business model to suit
what was required to get into the school
systems and that took many years I
perhaps I could have sped it up but
because of the nature of schools it
takes a long time fortunately I was in
the position where I was able to fund it
myself I didn't have to go to VCC saw
self funding and I acted as the angel
investor in the first round myself and
I've brought it through to profitability
studio web was a big money loser for me
for several years and that was because
again I didn't have a good internal
understanding of how the schools worked
in the u.s. how they functioned with the
bureaucracy was and what they wouldn't
need specifically so for you when you go
into any particular industry whether it
be restaurants or the barber shop the
more important thing to have is then
there's been the coding skills that
actually have the business knowledge to
have that business intelligence to know
how that business operates so how can
you as a developer get into this well
first thing you develop your skills and
then what you do you start doing some
freelancing you start talking with
people in different industries business
owners or people working it and
eventually more than eventually very
more quickly than you might think you're
going to start seeing potential and let
me underline that potential
opportunities where you might be able to
implement some sort of sass some sort of
IP that could sell you could sell into
that industry but when you do come up
with some ideas you got to be you got to
be humble about your ideas because most
of your ideas will be wrong see that's
one of the things you have to people
think that entrepreneurs are arrogant
they have to have confidence but the
best art Renault's are confident but
they're also humble they know that
there's going to be a lot of mistakes
and they have to be willing to admit the
wrong and make changes accordingly so
let's say you were
looking at a potential opportunity in
the restaurant business what I would do
is I would do some research as much as
you could on the web start asking
started looking around see what's out
there and if you still see that
opportunity did sort of map out the idea
very roughly on paper so you have a
clear idea and then come up with a like
a way you can describe it to a
restaurateur and just a minute or two
and then you start talking to hopefully
you know some restaurant tours I know a
few myself so I will go talk to us hey I
have this idea how about this this isn't
this what would would you find that
interesting and see what they say and
that you know and don't just base it on
one person asks like five or six
restaurants for example see what they
say different types and find out whether
or not the idea has at least initial
traction that is HUGE if it does have
initial traction then the next thing you
got to do is you got to see if you can
get them to commit to deploying an alpha
or a beta or better yet see if they're
going to invest in the first version in
advance you see a lot of people will say
yeah yeah that's a great idea but when
it comes to actually committing to it it
comes to actually spending money
especially you're gonna see a lot of
people are gonna start not being so
committed so it's a process right it's a
process just like writing software first
versions not the best version you got to
keep iterating through it refining and
refining saving with business ideas
you're going to do that what's going to
be a big problem in the end is not
finding an idea it's finding a good idea
you're gonna start finding all kinds of
ideas like I am literally inundated with
business opportunities which I refuse
constantly because I just don't have the
time so how do you pick the good ideas
well this process is simple well what
you do is you you do which I just
suggested those steps and then you throw
it out there into the market as quickly
as dirtily as possible dirty code alpha
code get it out there see if there's any
traction and how do you know if there's
traction when people are going to put
money down that's when you know of
extraction and that was the piece of
advice that got from one of my
mentors way back in the day I said how
do you choose what business to pursue he
said follow the money follow the money
if you suggest an idea if people win to
give you money for it then you know you
may have something and then you can
pursue that if you hit you have a
brilliant idea
and you go see six restaurant tours to
use that example and they say to you no
no it's probably not gonna be any good
so keep that in mind
you gotta be patient you're gonna be its
ERISA t'v you have to be willing to
explore ideas meanwhile you do
freelancing because freelancing not only
will help you develop your chops you
know have other people pay you to become
a better developer so when you finally
develop your own sass you're going to be
much better at what you do but at the
same time you're going to be making
contacts you're going to be learning
about people's businesses and their
industries I hope that helps ciao ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
