working through the jQuery functionality
specifically related to color box and we
had this so far but I'm going to go back
to Google Chrome for a second and take a
look at the color box documentation here
obviously you can go through it in a
little bit more detail and you can
always download the files and look at
the sample files at the zip file
includes but if you scroll down the page
a little bit it talks about the various
different options that this color box
plugin allows us to use we're going to
be using a couple different ones here
setting the transition will be setting
the href value because we want this page
to pop up immediately on page load so
it's not going to be associated with a
element or anything like that and then a
couple other things for example inner
height and it here we go initial width
and initial height scrolling and opacity
and just as a quick reminder opacity you
go to our demonstration and this is the
effect that we'll be using the opacity
refers to the opacity behind the color
box so let's switch back to Kota and I'm
going to start putting these in place
first one is transition transition
excuse me
and i'm going to use fade and i'm going
to use initial whip i'm going to set
that 250 pixels and also initial height
and i'll set scrolling to false the
opacity 2.6 that varies it goes between
0 which is perfectly transparent and one
which is completely opaque and then
finally the href and this is going to be
the value of the URL which this color
box is going to show and in this case
I'm going to use a little bit of PHP
here so I'm going to open up and close
my PHP tags and I'm going to echo out
the site path like so and then after the
site path I'm going to include app /
login dot PHP and I'll save this and as
a quick note the reason why I'm doing
this within script tags rather than in a
completely external javascript file is I
want to make sure that we can use PHP
and we can access the site path variable
as I said earlier the T underscore login
dot PHP file will be included within the
actual website so we can't really be
sure exactly where in the website it
will be included whoa what path that
particular page this file is included in
is so that's why I'm setting things to
an absolute path and I'm keeping it
within the login dot PHP file so i can
access this variable so i believe that
should be good let me go ahead and open
up index dot PHP and preview this
and it looks like we're currently
getting all sorts of error messages but
the simple fact that this is displaying
is a good sign let me try taking this
off and notice will get the website
displaying as it should and if you click
the link down here at the bottom you get
this to appear and also let me refresh
this page what you see when this pop-up
first appears is you see this little
black box in the center of the screen
with a loading gif let me hit refresh
that the size of that box is determined
i go back to t log in by the initial
width and the initial height so setting
it to 50 pixels each gives it a small
square box that expands then into the
full login window but now obviously we
have some issues to deal with if we're
getting all sorts of errors and that's
due to the fact that we are trying to
access this via under your action know
this login dot PHP file and it's trying
to include files that no longer exist so
that's going to be our first step to
remove these and to tweak this layout in
order to get it working the first step
in that process is actually an include
so I really shouldn't have included that
or deleted that previous line um so what
we need to include is our main in it PHP
file and its quotes around it
so keep in mind that what we're working
with here is login dot PHP this file so
it's in the same folder as in it so we
don't have to worry about path changes
however we do need to work our way
through this file and make some changes
for example there's no longer a template
object like this we need to access it
like this FP template so most of these
changes are pretty simple but I'm going
to quickly go through them that looks
good basically any time where the
template object is accessed we need to
change it to make sure it's referring to
the template object within the flight
path object and same thing with
authorization so we go
okay and I believe we're good so far so
we also need to make some additional
changes here for example down at the
bottom we need to load our view but
specifically we need a load app path dot
core / views viendo square login if
we're doing a successful login we needed
to change some things this looks good so
far but instead of doing and elope we
want the user to be logged in directly
so what we're going to do is we're going
to login excuse me we're going to load a
new file so I'm going to access that FP
template load I'm going to load the file
with in-app path dot corn views and I'm
going to create a new view for this we
call it be underscore logging in that
PHP and what I found is that color box
needs a temporary page to display until
the page completely refreshes and I'll
explain this in a couple minutes but
this is what I need to do so far so
that's good invalid login we do need to
set an alert so that's correct but we
also need to get color box to resize
because what's going to happen actually
maybe I should wait on this and show you
actually demonstrate this so I'll leave
that for the moment but let's go ahead
and make sure we're loading the correct
view here so at path dot core views v
underscore login and i believe
everything else in this file is good
there isn't too much that i need to
change i mean the core functionality is
in place
and I guess same thing here at path core
/ views okay so let me save this and now
let's do a quick preview just to see
where we are so it looks like we're here
I must have missed a template line 36
yeah here we go
there we go so we have a login window
and I'm going to be working on styling
it a little bit in the next video but
you can definitely see that we're making
some progress</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
