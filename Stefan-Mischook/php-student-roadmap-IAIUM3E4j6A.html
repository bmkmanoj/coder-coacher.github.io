PHP calm and killer sighs calm in this
video tutorial I'm going to teach you
the PHP students automatic essentially
these are the things that you should
learn in one order if you want to become
a PHP programmer so you start of course
was the basic PHP language you have to
learn functions and variables and
looping and all this kind of stuff you
also have to understand the basic server
client cycle and how that affects the
way you should write your code you have
to really have an understanding of that
basic concept and I cover that in
several other videos so I'm not going to
go over that here once you have the
basic PHP technology an understanding of
the technology rather in your mind so
you can do is basic stuff the next steps
you want to interact with a database the
most popular database with peach worth
working with PHP is of course something
called MySQL and this is a relational
database now a relational database is a
styled database that essentially
organizes records in a series of tables
think of these tables as being like
Excel spreadsheets they're two columns
new roles and these tables are going to
link together and that's why it's called
a relational database there are
relations that are formed between one
table another table and another table so
typically what you have is PHP talking
to the database and MySQL database
although it could be any database really
peach because it should be flexible and
this is the you know this is a huge part
of the work in most web programming
projects is that interaction between PHP
pages and the database so you have to
understand your data
theory how to build them how to manage
them not to a great degree you don't
want to become a database administrator
but unless you get a million basics and
your basic SQL syntax of course s 2
hours just cuz you don't know
it is short for a structured query
language and it's the language of
databases so essentially when you're
creating a connection between your PHP
pages and your MySQL database or any SQL
based database you're using the SQL
language the structured query language
you know think query is you know setting
queries to or you know you know what
accordions to to the database sending it
information it being database so you're
using PHP to send information to the
database and pull it from the database
and to organize it and to mash it up or
do whatever you want to do with it so
that's the next step so after you got
your basics then you learn your little
bit of basics about SQL databases and
maestro's the most commonly used
database with PHP especially and then
you learn how to connect PHP to MySQL
and do the interactions and all the
things that sort of go around with that
once you have to have that under your
belt I would actually argue in the space
of price people you want to learn a
little bit of JavaScript and how that is
fits into the equation with PHP you see
that javascript is a layer that works in
the web browser of course it's a
different language
once you learn PHP in Jeff's will become
much easier and you use it a lot of
times to make the interaction between
the PHP pages in the server and the user
people actually view the pages you make
that a lot easier so so once you know a
PHP basics in MySQL you learn how to use
PHP to interact with MySQL then I would
argue learn a little bit JavaScript and
how that might work with PHP think form
HTML forms and how you can use
JavaScript to simplify that I think Ajax
where you can use JavaScript to send
requests to your PHP pages you don't
know what a request is oh well I'm not
going to teach that here because you
know we have videos dedicated to that so
that would be the next step
after you've got that going and just
like you know just get your feet wet
with that then you want to start
learning object oriented PHP programming
opie PHP I have probably one of the most
popular tutorials on that on the web if
you want to check it out just go to the
killer peach be coms and you can see in
the top tabs object-oriented programming
I have a I think it's 15 or 20 step
written tutorial and it has a whole
bunch of free supplemental videos and
really make understanding olp
object-oriented programming in PHP much
much easier than you might think
otherwise after you have your basic o.p
structures understanding of the
structures in place then you might want
to jump into something called an Opie
framework and MVC framework now this is
basically packages of code if you are
that are organized in in an ole P
fashion that allows you to more easily
and more quickly build fancy web
applications now this is getting it from
into the intermediate level to beginner
advanced level programming in PHP but
it's still at worthless learning finally
finally now I should mention in terms of
opal P object or to program P PHP
frameworks the big ones out there are
like the most popular when I recommend
it
framework then you have cold igniter
which is very good as from what I've
seen and there's a few others as PHP
cake and others but I recommend in the
Zen framework simply because it is the
predominant framework out there and if
you want to secure work in order get
jobs chances are people going to asking
if you don't Zend rather than PHP cake
which is a competitor or a code of mater
which is another competitor
they all have their pluses and minuses
and to be honest too lately I haven't
really looked at all these individual
ones and I can't really say which one is
it may have the overall advantage today
but I can just say that the Zen
framework has certain advantages because
it's again it's controlled but Zen P by
the same people which is basically
people run run PHP and they're backed by
IBM and you see now already on in very
important companies that are actually
deploying the same framework now so you
have a much better chance of getting
work if you know Zen rather than let's
say PHP cake again this is anecdotal I
haven't done an exhaustive exhaustive
research in that regard
finally if you want to really get down
and dirty or you know once you know if
the PHP language the basic language you
understand databases interacting with
the databases and you know your
frameworks or one framework rather the
next thing is again to something called
design patterns and a design pattern is
basically just a a preset methodology or
a pattern of how to structure your code
your PHP code and it's really a way to
to keep a consistent method again
methodology of
of structuring an application design
patents become very useful actually when
you're dealing with more than one
programmer because you can you can just
cite a pattern say okay for this project
I want use a decorator pattern here and
somebody who's well-versed in design
patterns or even has some understanding
design fashion Boyett decorate better
and they'll know what that means
decorator implies the decorator pattern
implies a certain way to write your code
and and to interact with your the
information with the codes working on in
a particular manner I'm not going into
design patterns here but there you go
that's the five steps it was looking at
my my road map here my PHP students
roadmap once again recap basic PHP then
our MySQL and MySQL PHP interactions
learning Hopi principles and the basics
then learn Hopi framework Weatherbys and
coding that or what not and then study
and learn basic PHP design patterns up
before it'll be over P PHP principles
you may want to look into JavaScript as
I said before just to learn how
JavaScript can be used to use with PHP
to interact with PHP it's can be quite
interesting there you go I hope you
found this video useful we have a whole
bunch of new stuff like PHP coming out I
guess within the next few weeks that's
it Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
