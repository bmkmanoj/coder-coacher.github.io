I want to take a look at you'll notice
that here when you click on the type
tool will also now explore the vertical
type tool and the horizontal type mask
tool as well here the vertical type tool
is pretty self-explanatory if I come in
here and I say vertical we can see that
that word has been typed out in a
vertical fashion if you want to control
the amount of letting on that you can do
so quite simply by affecting it in this
way and that's kind of an interesting
effect that you can apply to it just
about any text and what that allows you
to do is to create something in this
fashion and again of course you're
getting into the realm of creative
creativity here unless you're working
with Asian characters where this would
be very common working with the vertical
type you might want to be rotating the
elements right so you can say command
and you can oops this last thing I want
to do just come in here and rotating
those elements with your command T or
ctrl T free transform tool and as you
can see now I've got these vertical
elements which if i press down on the
option or Alt key I can make copies of
you know it's really up to you to
determine how you're going to be using
this kind of work and what you want to
be doing with it making it look like
rain doing any number of thing i'm going
to select all of those and delete them
and now i want to show you the
horizontal type mask tool well a lot of
different ways you can do this and work
with this and what i want to just show
you is that as you can see when you
click on it it allows you to create a
selection around something so well we
don't really have anything that we can
make a selection around with the type
tool so I'm just going to ask you to
open up something if you remember from
our previous one we were using a US flag
so we can open up this and as you can
see here if you don't have your side by
side like this you can always come here
and just have them side by side and then
I'm just going to drag this into their
you'll notice that the flag is huge in
comparison to the canvas that i was
using just a little bit earlier which
just is a simple 800 x 600 canvas
nevertheless let's take a look at what
we can do here if i select the type tool
and i click on this you'll notice that
it's created this area here which is
acting as a red filter of sorts
everything inside the selection is going
to be part of my mask and if i come in
here you can choose the font that you
want by default you're probably going to
have the text set to none but that's not
going to give you a very nice mask
effect so i would ask you instead then
to set this to something like sharp or
crisp or smooth and you could come in
here and you can say ask or maybe i'll
say stars and you can select that and
make them closer together if you wish
the reason I'm using Arial black is
because if you have a thin font this
effect is not really going to come
through and in fact I'm going to open
this up quite large and as you can see
when you've got that selection made and
if it's on top of an area like this well
moving that selection is going to wow
just change completely what's happening
here because you're sort of extracted
that element from there so I don't want
to do that so we'll press command Z or
anything else and at this point if I
wanted to I've got a selection and if
you remember when you're working with
selections what that allows you to do is
to click on a quick mask here and notice
I've got the Stars worked out in this
fashion now you might be looking at this
and say hey wait a minute I don't really
want to see this portion of the image
inside of that mask I actually want to
have something else going on here well
there's a way that you can do that for
example I can unlink the chain that's
right here now remember when you have
this chain that means you know you
select one you select everything but if
I unchain this for a second
depending on what you've selected for
example if I select the mask I'm moving
the mask see that if I instead select
the image I'm going to move the image
when I click on this as you can see
there so you can change stars and you
can make it appear over here or wherever
you like or if you rather you can click
on the mask and move the mask wherever
you like and find a more suitable or
appropriate element for it so I'm going
to link these back together and now you
can move them together as you can see
here on top of all of this you can also
do a number of things like add perhaps a
layer effect to your piece of text and
as you can see I could come in here and
say hey well how about putting a stroke
on this thing and you'll notice even
where they're touching it really does a
nice job of not overlapping those
elements the stroke really plays out
quite nicely on this and also for
example you know I could come in here
and we could choose perhaps a different
color now that's actually choosing the
black or the white of the mask so that's
not really what I want to do
nevertheless I could come in here and
I'll just eyeball some kind of blue and
for example you can increase the amount
you can make it so big that it just sort
of works in that fashion or you can make
it just may be more of a reasonable
amount you can also determine the
position of that remember inside or
outside or right on the center oki bars
outside I don't mind it being a little
round and do a number of things there
you can also add something like a drop
shadow to it and again you can play with
the size because I've got a little bit
of and more importantly probably the
distance because I've got a little bit
of extra space there so notice these are
all things that you can do either by
creating a mask or as we saw before it
could be a pattern overlay instead so
any of these things that you did want to
due to some text can easily be done
inside of Photoshop just by accessing
either your layer effects as we see here
or by applying a layer mask to your type
as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
