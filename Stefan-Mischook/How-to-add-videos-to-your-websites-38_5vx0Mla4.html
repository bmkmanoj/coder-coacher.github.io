killer sites calm and killer PHP calm in
this video I'm going to discuss the
different methods you have to deploy
video on the web there are several
different options available to you and
what I'm going to do is I want to go
with the easiest sore more complex
although they're not very complex so
when you're looking at putting your
video on the web the first thing you
have to consider is the video format
you're going to use you see you got
different types of ways of packaging up
videos for photo web you have a quick
time I'm sure you may have heard of that
the Apple format you have windows media
format which is the native windows
format and you got the flv format which
is the flash format and there's a whole
bunch of other formats as well that you
can actually view and web sites on the
web the most popular today is the flv
format the flash video format although
that is now slowly being replaced by
something called H dot 264 I know it
sounds complex H dot 264 but all the new
programs out there that are designed to
produce video to transform video convert
video to a web ready format they're all
moving over to h.264 so the first step
to getting your video on the web is
you've got to put it in the format
that's viewable on the web though you
can just put up quick time you can put
up w MV which is window media video
format and you can put up flv I
recommend that at the end of the day you
try to output to your stuff to H dot 264
so what do you do what kind of program
weren't what program rather allows you
to do that a lot of them nowadays if
you're using a video editing program
like final cut pro for mac it outputs H
to H dot 264 if you're using a premier
does that using quicktime pro which is a
tiny little program 29 bucks it does
that as well and the adobe flash video
encoder it now outputs H dot 264 rather
than the traditional flash movie format
of the flv even adobe is now moving away
from flv the flash video format which by
the way is the most ubiquitous format
out there ninety-nine percent of web
servers can watch elf lv like this
nonetheless adobe feels that the h.264
format is superior for several reasons I
guess I haven't looked into the details
but you know if the makers of flash
believe that that's the better way to go
less of it I want to go so you first
step is you find a program to convert
your video into the h.264 format by the
way YouTube supports that format
natively out of the box now and then
from there what you need to do is figure
out a way to get it into your web pages
so if you're not a web designer and even
if you are a web designer one option is
to use YouTube or other video sharing
sites like blip TV metacafe or whatnot
youtube for example has now just
released a new version or an updated
version of their player where they now
allow you to upload high-definition
content HD video tutorial at 720p 720p
just how much HD it is not pure HD but
it's HD and it's really nice so that's
one option so if you have videos
you want to put out there to the general
public you can put on YouTube and then
use YouTube tools to embed them into
your own website and it works the only
downside to that is that you get the
little YouTube logo appearing there if
they click on the video twice or
something it takes them to YouTube site
sometimes that could be something that's
not acceptable and other times for
people to be more of an acceptable
another disadvantage of course is that
if you put your stuff on youtube its
public right whereas if you deployed it
the video yourself and i'll tell you how
to do that next it wouldn't be public so
it really depends on you and which
particular needs are before i leave you
two and other video sharing sites one
thing should also point out is that
using YouTube system to push your video
on the web you you save yourself a lot
of bandwidth that's huge for instance at
killer sites and killer PHP we're moving
collectively three and a half thousand
gigs a month of data we get a pretty
decent amount of traffic a lot of thats
video so i started looking at personally
deploying videos on youtube because you
figured out google can't afford to pay
for that kind of bandwidth you know
finally if you want to embed your videos
on your site without using external
surface like youtube or blip TV you can
get a free flash video player just look
it up on the web you know free flv
player and they will play flv that will
play H to H dot 264 etc it's very simple
you need to know just basic web design
basic code because you're gonna have to
embed this player into the page and it's
not that hard really and
that's that's the way to do that way so
you would store your video on your own
web server and you and you would
actually store the video player on your
web server and you would embed videos
yourself manually into your pages so
that's the the second option the second
option of course gives you more control
you can keep the videos private but it's
harder to deploy not much harder bits
harder and you have to use your own
bandwidth to push the videos if your
videos are you know 100 Meg's or so or
less it's not a big deal but if you
start pushing HD video your web host
provider your servers made that give you
a call and start asking for a little bit
more cash if you start pushing a lot of
data across the web</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
