com welcome to a killer site screencast
on building a tag cloud with PHP and
MySQL I you'll often find tag clouds
online in various blogs for example if
you visit the killer sites com blog and
scroll down a little bit you'll notice
we have a tag cloud on the right-hand
sidebar so what we're going to be
building today looks like this has two
parts we have a list section which is
simply going to list all the tags the
tag ID and the count which refers to the
number of times they're used and also
the weight which I'll talk a little bit
about later below the list we have the
cloud itself you'll notice that we have
links to each of these tags and it links
out to a tags PHP page and they are
sized according to their importance for
example orange is largest because it's
used most often the first thing that I
want to do is to start with the database
I have PHP myadmin open and I'm going to
create a new database and call it tag
cloud and instead of building out all
these tables by hand I've actually
exported this database already and I've
included it with the Swiss files so you
can go ahead go to the import tab select
browse and open up the database SQL file
just click go and it'll automatically
import all the tables that we need for
this tutorial this tutorial assumes that
you already have a basic blogging system
in place I'm only going to be talking
about the tag cloud portion of tags we
are going to assume that you already
have some sort of system in place that
can add and remove tags from your blog
posts to give you an overview of the
different tables that we just imported
we have a post table which V browse it
contains the idea of the post and the
post title I've kept things pretty
simple as keeping in mind that this is a
basic example obviously if you were
building out a full blog application
you'd have a lot more columns you'd have
content at the very least probably a
date etc but just for this example we
have the post table contains an ID of
the post and the post title and then we
also have a tags table which includes
the tag ID and the tag name and finally
we have a post to tags table which
allows us to link the posts and tags
table together it allows us to link the
post ID with a tag ID and this gives us
a simple structure which allows us to
make posts make an individual blog post
be able to support multiple tags as many
tags as we want and also allows us to
reuse tags so for example will only ever
have one red tag because it already
exists if we were to add a red tag to an
existing post we would instead of
creating a brand new tag we'd find the
ID of that pre-existing tag and simply
add it into the post tags table we've
get the post ID of the posts that we
wanted to add this tag to and then we
would add the tag ID in place with Kota
open let's establish some basic site
structure I'm going to start out with an
index PHP file and two folders we're
going to have a models folder
the views folder and all you follow
along with this tutorial I'm going to be
using the MVC pattern this means that
our files are split up into three
different types you have models views
and controllers the controller is going
to be our index PHP file and it is going
to handle any user input in this case
it's going to load our database load any
models and any views our models going to
be placed within the models folder and
that contains the main business logic of
the application it's going to contain
the code that's actually needed to get
our tags from the database and handle
them properly and finally the views
which are contained in the views folder
that's going to contain an HTML file
which is then displayed out to the user
let me create a couple more files within
the models folder we're going to have an
open DB dot PHP file I'm going to have a
close DB that PHP file and finally we're
going to have the actual model itself in
which case i'm going to call this one
tag cloud dot model dot PHP and I should
mention I could potentially just call it
tag cloud model but in case someone had
direct access to this file and could
open up this file in the browsing if you
left it at just dot model the browser
will assume that it's the plain text
file and will display it so I want to
make sure it ends with dot PHP so the
browser understands to do something with
the contents not to display them
immediately to the user so the model
portion allows me to specify easily what
file it is in case I have multiple tag
cloud files
okay and then within views we're also
going to have tag cloud top view PHP so
let's start by getting a couple of the
basics in place so I'm going to open up
index and I'm going to start with my
standard PHP tags and let's open up the
database connection so we're going to do
that with an include once
okay like so and then then at the end of
the file we're going to close the
database connection
placing these both in include files
means that we can easily reuse this code
for other models and controllers and the
rest of our application if we were to
expand this so with that in place let's
load the actual models and I'm going to
include once again see and I'm going to
clewd models tag cloud model dot PHP and
then we're going to actually create tag
cloud here but I'm going to skip that
portion for now and we're going to
simply load the view
okay like so so we have the basic
structure for a controller in place it
opens the database connection it loads
the model it's going to take care of
some creating of the tag cloud and then
it will display the view to the user and
obviously close the database connection
at the end so let's go ahead and work on
the open and close database files and
this is pretty standard if you watched
any of my other tutorials discussing
mysqli the same exact code so I'm going
to start with server in my case it's
localhost my user is going to be root
password just leave it pass it's also
root so your username and password
details may change depending on your
database setup and lastly eat a database
and I called my tag cloud that's that
and then let's actually make the
connection by creating a mysql i object
and that equals new mysqli
and we're going to pass in the server
the user password and the database ok so
this file is set now let's go ahead open
up the clothes database and let's close
out the connection and this is simply
mysqli clothes like so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
