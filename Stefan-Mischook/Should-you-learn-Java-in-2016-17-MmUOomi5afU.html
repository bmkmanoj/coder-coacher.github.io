Java in 2016 and 2017 so this is a
ongoing series of should you learn this
language or that language so I've
covered Python JavaScript PHP so I
figured I'd get into Java and anyone
who's been following my vlogs knows that
when I talk about learning a language it
really comes down most of the time to
two things a the type of programming
work you want to do and B the
marketability of the language it's very
rare but you're going to see a modern
programming language where the language
itself has major deficiencies what you
look at again is market forces in the
type of what you want to do so when it
comes to Java Java is probably in the
top three if not the number one most
important or most used programming
language in the world I mean check
recent stats but it's right up there
Java is used in two areas it's used in
web app creation for the enterprise now
enterprise means very large corporations
it's also used in Android app
development whether it be for Android
phones or tablets so just those two use
cases give it a huge user base and
there's a lot of options for you there
now first of all you have to want to do
either Android development or enterprise
web app development to get into Java you
have to understand when you get into
number one Java web app development I
did a lot of that in my days into late
90s and early 2000s a lot of that these
days with Java web you're looking at
enterprise meaning large corporations
which means that you will not likely get
a job as a Java web developer unless you
have some sort of technical degree or a
lot of real world experience not like
what it was in the 90s you were so
desperate for Java coders and
you could get a job without the degrees
these days I'm under the impression if
you want to get a job of web developer
job you're going to have to go work for
a big huge corporation and that's thus
you have to get to the HR departments
the human resources department which
means they're going to want the degrees
so keep that in mind if you if you're
not looking or you don't have a computer
science degree or pewter engineering or
something like that
chances are getting into the java web is
not going to be there for you because
small companies typically don't use java
web because it's just too slow a
language though to develop in what I
mean by slow well Java is a very verbose
language it's a language it takes a lot
of code relative to more modern nimble
languages to get stuff done so I can
give you a comparison I'm going to do in
my Python course but the amount of code
that takes to do something in Java
versus Python it's you know Python takes
a fraction of the Java code that's why
small businesses don't use Java it's
just too heavy it's too big it's too
bloated but big corporations who have a
lot invested in their Java
infrastructure they could use Java quite
effectively in terms of Android
development again small businesses will
do Android stuff once in a while I
suppose but I think that when you get
into Android apps or mobile apps I would
tend to think it's a bit bigger business
not your typical small business is going
to be building Android app they're much
more likely to get a website up that's
for sure
and if you're doing small business
freelance and you don't have a degree
you want to get into freelance I always
advocate for a server-side pH
server-side PHP cert is service odd of
course you figure PHP WordPress Drupal
development for some people it's not the
sexiest thing to do but they're just for
freelancers and people don't have two
degrees and computer science or Computer
Engineering there's a ton of work in
that even though some people don't like
that area some people PHP is still
wildly popular Java is still very
powerful very widely used I
really like job in the old days but I
don't use it anymore because it's too
it's too slow to you to build abstinent
versus let's say PHP or Python or Ruby
with rails or something it's too slow to
develop in when it runs though Java runs
you really really fast much faster and
Ruby much faster than Python probably
faster still in PHP although PHP is much
faster bitten by paw no Ruby when
evaluating languages I'm always
considering the job prospects and what
the type of work you want to do rather
than the technology itself because all
these languages have their pros and cons
there's no one definite winner over all
depends what you want to do alright have
yourself a great weekend bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
