web developers wave I wrote this article
in response to a question that was put
to me so I figured I'd write a little
article and then vlog about it
so what's the web developers wave this
is the flow of jobs that you can expect
to get as a freelance developer whether
it be whether you be a PHP web developer
Ruby web developer and iOS developer
what you're gonna see is that jobs will
come in waves especially early on in
your career so you may spend two three
months to get a job you may not have any
jobs for a couple months you're like oh
boy and they'll work and then all of a
sudden you're gonna get three jobs and
then you're gonna be super busy and then
you're gonna finish up the work and then
you're gonna have no work for a month
this is normal which you'll see as you
get deeper and deeper into a career as a
freelance developer is that the jobs
come in waves so with this in mind
there's a few strategies that you can
adopt that will make your life a lot
easier as a freelance developer before I
go on though maybe point out as your
business as a freelancer becomes more
mature as you make more contacts as you
work with more and more clients you're
gonna find that this wave will even out
meaning that you're gonna have a
steadier flow slowly slow slowly over
time at to the point where you're gonna
have too much work to deal with then you
might have to outsource the work you may
have to hire other developers or you can
work on streamlining your workflow which
I'm going to talk about here so with the
web developers wave or the developers
wave in mind in terms of inconsistent
work what you should always be doing is
maybe putting about 5% of your time even
when you're on projects you should spend
about 5% of your time looking for new
works planting the seeds if you will so
that means mention to friends family
business acquaintances
random people that you run into on the
street let people know what you do
you're open to new work so you should be
constantly farming for work constantly
working for work
this will help minimize and even out the
wave if you will and again what a reason
you want to do this because it just
takes time for clients a lot of the time
to get to get their game together
so what do I mean by that so you may
approach or a client or prospective
client may approach you about doing a
job for them whether it be a building
iOS app but if a wordpress-based site
create a custom app whatever and they
may have great intentions and they want
to do it but as life and business is
there'll be many occasions where you'll
meet with them a couple of times I'd say
okay we're ready to go and then you
won't here for them for three months for
six months and then they'll show up
again okay we're ready to go now that's
just the way it goes so you have to
understand that there's gonna be these
periods between when you're ready to go
and your client is not ready to go with
a new project so keep that in mind with
this web developers wave in mind the
other thing you have to consider is your
cash now I spoke about this if you look
up on YouTube I have the fu money the fu
stache video and what this means
especially as a freelancer when you have
no idea when you're gonna get paid next
you don't know you can get paid next
week or you can get paid in four months
you don't know so independent
freelancers have to learn to manage
their money especially well and in my Fu
stache video I talked about having at
least six months worth of living
expenses in cash this is separate from
your long-term savings
I recommend really to feel real good
a year or two worth of money on hand and
then you don't have to worry about the
jobs you can more easily manage your
your freelance career finally step
number three you also have to work on
continuously streamline
your workflow a good workflow means that
you're going to be able to get the work
done much more quickly which will
maximize your time and in the end
increase your profitability when you are
independent a developer ultimately
you're selling your time so you want to
make the most money you can't for at
your time
so workflows are huge now an example of
workflow optimization in the web world
is to adopt a web framework these days
you don't want to start building web
apps or any type of apps from scratch so
in the PHP world these days almost
people will go a laravel in the Ruby
world everybody goes rails in the Python
world might be Django or flask depending
on the type of works you want to do in
the Java world it would be spring the
point is by introducing a web framework
you'll be streamlining your workflow and
with the web framework will do it will
allow you to take care of a lot of
common programming tasks like database
access authentication messaging task
automation and so forth very very very
quickly so this is hugely important in
terms of your career as a freelancer
besides the code workflows you also have
to work on developing a nice streamlined
client management workflow so you manage
the communications you manage the
payment structures etc of your
interaction with all your clients again
this will save you a lot of time so
there you go if you want to read the
article I wrote about this it's on one
of my sites killer PHP TOCOM slash
articles slash the - web - developers -
wave you just go to a home page of
killer PHP and look around the February
time frame for every 21st the web
developers wave and you'll be able to
read about it in more detail if this
interests you and that's pretty much it
we'll talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
