answering a quick question any tips in
starting a web development business
the questioner said I know HTML and CSS
so if you've been watching my videos
many of them you'll see that the answers
are all strung up in many of my videos
especially on careers and cold playlist
figure let's call on soon anyway you'll
see the playlist that's said I'll try to
summarize a few things if you know HTML
CSS it will be difficult to start a web
development career because a front-end
web developer somebody who just builds
the front end first of all you need more
of an HTML CSS we need html5 css3 that's
that's always - not all CSS you need to
know some JavaScript you're going to
need to know a JavaScript library like
jQuery and you may need to learn some
front and j/s frameworks like react as
an example what you have to do if you
are looking for work working for a
company you have to go looking around in
your area where you happen to live
geographically speaking and see where
the demand lies you got to look just
look what your listing see what are they
looking for in terms of skill sets and
there's your map in that regard that
being said the money is always in
back-end server side back-end means
server-side web development service like
me writing the logic code a code logical
the code that forms the heart of the web
app and that is colle that's it on the
servers as in the web servers so you're
looking at a bunch of choices there you
can do PHP you can do Java you can do
Python you can do Ruby you can do
JavaScript of course JavaScript is
rising fast going forward to three years
on and now to JavaScript is like if you
want to work for companies that's where
the money is going to be
there's a lot of demand for JavaScript
development these days although it's a
bit of a wild west at this point because
the technology in terms of JavaScript on
the server is evolving quite quickly and
so you're going to see a lot of there
will be some issues along the way but
that's normal I've seen it with many
other languages and many other
communities if you will I saw Ruby is on
a Java assault would see asp.net with
the.net framework excetera if you want
to do freelance I highly recommend again
always the caveat you got to check your
area as a freelancer the big money in
demand is PHP PHP development will
Arabelle or PHP WordPress WordPress
theme or press configuration
developments a lot of work there simply
because WordPress is not sexy these days
PHP even though it's very powerful is
not sexy you see a lot of new developers
look at PHP and go that's oh that's no
good and the reason they think that is
because PHP has kind of a sorted dirty
past it was a procedural language
initially it was an ad-hoc language what
do I mean by that PHP is rigidly
developed just to build simple little
dynamic web pages dynamic meeting pages
that change all the time we connect to
databases and it was very very rough it
was before all the advanced
architectures that we see today were
dealt and so it it has this dirty back
past where a lot of PHP apps developed
in the 90s early 2000s really really
really messy and in fact PHP for the
language was out like with PHP 3 it was
an object-oriented old piece before was
kind of half object-oriented anyway PHP
has a dirty past and as a result a lot
of people still have this impression
that PHP is still the same whereas in
fact PHP since five point
my guess is PHP 5 we're at 7 now it's
very sophisticated in terms of the
language you can do everything that you
can see you
all the modern programming languages
would be Java C sharp Ruby Python yes
each language has a strengthens weakness
of the area but when it comes to pure
web app creation nothing gets you up and
running as quickly as PHP that's why I
recommend it especially as a freelancer
there's a lot of business opportunity so
there you go
to summarize you have to to get your web
development going you have to develop
some more skill sets pick a server-side
programming language like a PHP like a
Python like a ruby like a Java to pay
what you want to do and start doing gigs
your first couple of gigs your first
couple of jobs might be free that's
normal and there you go that's my tips
for starting your web development career
in 2017 something regular viewers of
this channel have seen many times but
whatever oh one last thing I shut down
the killer sites forum over a year so go
because we're getting so much spam and I
was it agai forget it and I've had more
and more people ask me about course
specific forums for the inter
interactive web developer course package
and if you are purchaser of that package
or somebody who just follows my vlogs
let me know if you would actually want
me to restart the killer sized community
it's just a standard form where you set
up a profile and you interact with
people and this way instead of just
responding for instance to my videos on
YouTube you can actually start
discussions about whatever you like if I
do this I would like to get a couple
moderators as well and it's a pretty
robust forum software that is a
commercial one that I use now and so
yeah if you're interested let me know if
personally I'm not you know running out
to do this but if there's enough people
who want to participate then I'll put it
up you know just for your convenience
what's actually there now I just locked
it down a little I don't let new people
join or post so that's pretty much it
but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
