here with another video tutorial this
time what we're going to be talking
about is working with html5 video but
we're gonna be working with html5 video
in an interesting way what we're gonna
attempt to do as you can see here is to
take that video and have it act as a
full-screen background so this is
fullscreen background video right now
I'm using a video that I required from
Wikimedia and it's just a video taken
from Nassau of the Sun and some really
interesting things that are going on at
the time of this recording and as you
can see here the little text that I've
included with this is on top of the
element and it just says in praise of
heliocentrism so it's directly related
to the video that's showing here that's
just to prove a point that you know if
you're gonna be using video as a
background as I am doing right now it
should be something that complements the
text and not just something that looks
cool or pretty or something like that so
that's what we're going to be attempting
to do and I'll show you how to do it
it's really not as hard as you might
imagine all you're gonna need are some
video files and a couple of formats for
those video files and all walk you
through the process of how to get this
working in an html5 environment with a
little bit of help from CSS so I'm going
to just squeeze this down a little bit
as you can see here we'll still be able
to see the video and stuff when I do
check on it but I want to jump on over
to the text editor that I'm using at the
moment it's sublime text
so within sublime text here you can see
that I've got the general structure of
what I'm doing there's a div that's got
the wrapper and ID and that one actually
has all the text that I've included in
that small little example that we were
just talking about the CSS is just a
basic style dot CSS currently right now
you can see that without any information
dealing with the video here I've just
got a body tag selector that is set to a
background color that's a sort of
darkish gray
so those elements are in place we're
ready to go how do we now include our
video into these different areas so
there's a couple of things that we're
going to do but first and foremost I
think what I'd like to do is to go into
the HTML in this case the index dot HTML
file and in the body section we're gonna
add our html5 information so first and
foremost let's put in the video tag
which is a new HTML tag with html5 and
actually I'm gonna close that video tag
right away so that we just don't forget
now once we're inside there we're gonna
add some of our source information in
just a second but before we do that let
me show you a couple of attributes that
we oftentimes will associate with html5
video and specifically attributes that
are going to help us in this little
example first thing I want you to do is
to create the autoplay attribute and
this is going to as it suggests you know
just automatically play this as we open
up the file now that's great and in most
situations it's gonna work perfectly for
us however do keep in mind that autoplay
is not a function that works on the vast
majority of mobile devices that's not
necessarily a bad thing but in that case
what we need to do is to prepare an
option other than Auto playing this
video so we'll get to that in a second
second attribute that I want you to add
is the loop attribute which as the name
suggests will cause this little video to
loop and the key word there is little
video I've edited the video that I'm
using here so that it's rather short and
it's under five Meg's now if you are
working with a video that is really
really heavy
remember bandwidth certainly still is a
big deal nowadays and you should try to
limit your work to I don't know if short
videos looping repetitive videos you
know maybe 30 seconds in length or
something like that and that will allow
you to have your video be relatively
small once you do in fact
now that we got the loop in there I'm
also gonna ask you to say muted and the
reason being is we don't want to freak
anybody out when video starts playing
and blam blaring audio starts you know
assaulting people's ears we want to keep
this really subtle and really discreet
so if you really needed to have some
audio in there or something like that
then certainly you know if you're
capable you can write a little bit of
JavaScript that will allow you to press
play and stuff like that and you might
also notice that this video is not gonna
have any controls if we did want
controls we would just write out the
attribute controls but in this case I
don't want any control or anything like
that happening I just want it to act as
a nice back rounded element alright so
with those things in place we're pretty
much ready to go but there is one other
attribute that I want to introduce and
that's called the poster attribute well
unlike the other ones the poster is
going to require that we actually give
it a value so in here that poster I'm
going to say go into the images folder
that I've got prepared in my route and I
want you to use a JPEG that I've
prepared so it's called Sun NASA dot
JPEG now this jpg file this JPEG file is
actually the first frame of the video
that I'm using why am i doing that
well it's quite simply because if there
is a situation where we don't have the
capability of automatically playing this
video then the thing that's going to
show up is this it's the images as a
poster it's gonna be there as the first
picture that plays now you know let's
say there was some sort of delay or
something like that while the poster
will show up for a little bit and then
it will easily transition into the
playing of the video that's a beautiful
thing and the reason it is is because
well you know there's a seamless
transition there and that's one of the
reasons why I suggest that you use
through your poster the first frame of
your video now the final thing we want
to do in here is to actually give this
an ID and the ID that I'm going to
choose it doesn't really matter you
could choose whatever you want but I
just gonna call this fullscreen by doing
this we'll be able to control what's
going on inside the CSS once we start
mucking around with this particular
video all right so now that we've done
what we need to do to get the video tags
in order what I now want you to do is to
determine what the source of this
particular video is going to be so we're
gonna use the source tag and that source
tag is gonna have an SRC while an actual
source so we'll put in our SRC now I
happen to have some video prepared it's
in a folder called video and it's called
Sun - NASA now here's the deal when
you're working with html5 videos you
might already be aware of you're gonna
need to have three different source
files - will be fine if you you know
cannot provide all three so the first
one that I'm going to be dealing with is
the web M version now notice if you're
using WebM just be clear that there are
certain versions of Chrome that may not
show the WebM video if it's underneath
the other ones the other sources that
we'll be providing
so I generally just as a you know
failsafe plan I usually put the WebM
right up at the top and I suggest to do
the same so let's determine what type
this is and of course it's going to be
type is equal to video and it's web and
the video now WebM video is a video
format that is going to be supported on
most browsers it's one that is non
proprietary and because of that we will
only have to deal with web em now the
other option for WebM is OGG video now
OGG video or the Thira codec is a great
one to work with but you know now as
more and more people are accepting WebM
sometimes you don't necessarily need the
OGG I happen to have one so I'm going to
provide it anyways just in case again as
a fail-safe approach to this and I'm
just going to copy this information here
let me get those tags all set up
properly and it's got the same name
although the extension on mine is ogv
and that's something we'll put in here
and under the type I'm just going to
change this to OGG again another file
format that we're going to be working
with after that I have the format that
is going to work in WebKit browsers like
Safari specifically or in Internet
Explorer browsers and that format is mp4
mp4 is a proprietary method and hence
that's why works on those browsers but
not to worry there are different ways of
taking an mp4 video and converting it
into any of these formats that you see
here and there are plenty of ways to do
that online directly you don't even need
to download anything too crazy so with
all of this information now in place
what we do want to do is to address how
this is going to look with our CSS so
let's command s save that or ctrl s if
you're on a PC and once this thing is
safe we'll go to the stylesheet now here
directly after my opening body tag the
selector that I'm going to be addressing
is the video tag now you might have
other video tags that you don't want to
act as fullscreen so I'm gonna
specifically say any video tag that has
the ID of fullscreen all right so now
that we've got that in place what we now
want to do is to start determining how
this is going to look so the first thing
I'm going to say is position and the
position we're going to apply here is a
position of fixed and the reason we do
that is because well you know if
something is scrolling I don't want this
video to scroll along with it so we're
just going to set it up like that
also we're going to determine where the
positioning of this particular object is
going to be located so I'm just gonna
say on the right hand side we'll say
zero and you could say top or anything
else but I'm just gonna say right bottom
and once we are on the right bottom we
can then say zero as well
then what we need to do is to make sure
that this thing stretches out the way I
need it so I'm gonna actually give a
minimum width of a hundred percent as
well as giving it a minimum height of a
hundred percent as well so we've got
that in place too now once you got your
min height and your min width set up
let's set up just a regular width and
height so here I've got a width that I'm
going to set to auto and that should
automatically get it to be exactly the
width that we need it to be as well as a
height value of auto also and once those
two things are in place we do also want
to make sure that this thing is always
going to be underneath everything so I'm
gonna set it to minus a hundred for its
Z index then what I want to do is to say
well listen if there's any browser out
there that's not going to understand
what the video tag is and we've done a
few things in this CSS file to make sure
that certain browsers will support it
but just as the fail-safe fallback
method contingency plan whatever you
want to call it we're also going to give
it a background image and that
background image is going to act as a
cover that will show up only if the
video is not actually working
so let's come in here and we'll set up
background and in that background I'm
going to determine what a URL is and the
URL that I'm going to be using here can
be found not in the CSS folder so dot
dot slash but then we go into the images
folder and in there I'm going to use
that Sun - nassau jpg that we also used
when we were doing it inside of the
poster method so once we're in there I'm
also going to say no-repeat
and once we got that in place we're now
going to do the last thing which is
we're going to determine background size
and background size is a new css3
feature and this is set to cover which
will do exactly what it says right it'll
cover the background so that whatever
the size of the browser window is this
is going to show up the way we want it
to
so again command S or control s if
you're on a PC we save that information
we got it working pretty much the way we
need and once you go into your browser
and you test it you can see pretty much
what I've got happening right here which
is a full screen video and that video is
playing and notice it's fixed when I
scroll what's happening here on the side
the video doesn't move it's always fixed
in its position and it's looking just
great this is how you can go about
creating your own fullscreen video in
the background or in the foreground
whatever you like but in this case it's
set to be the background of this simple
yet effective HTML page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
