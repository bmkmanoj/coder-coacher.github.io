practice a lot of the things we've been
learning over the course of this entire
video training session and we're going
to actually jump into now pure Dom
JavaScript programming there are two
things I want to point out in this
particular video first of all we're
gonna be working once again within the
document object here and in the object
the document object there are two things
I want to look at something called the
get element by ID function very
important function when we say that
again the get element by ID function and
we're going to look at a very important
property called inner HTML with these
two very important tools we will be able
to create a JavaScript toggle menu very
easily
okay I've popped open into some code
here but I've already written for us and
what I'm gonna do now I'm gonna walk you
through this code so you understand
what's going on specifically this is
gonna make a new one for you guys the
insert text function here but before I
do that let's take a look at the actual
page so it's a pretty simple page
nothing to get too excited about but if
you look over here I got this main menu
but click on it you see this menu pop
open Hair Spray shoes flower socks two
S's there this menu may look familiar to
you
because we built that in a previous
video using a function it may have been
called las' products I don't know we
called it then but I'm sure you're
familiar with this code I'm gonna walk
you through this code and so that you're
reminded of it just in case you forgot
and we'll work our way down
first of all at the top here we have
just a basic CSS declarations here I
change the font family to verdana
because you know I just prefer that font
to default font the Arial I created two
IDs here menu title menu items let's
scroll down here and you see menu title
and we see menu items notice how menu
items is just an empty paragraph I left
it empty so that we can use Dom
scripting methods to populate this with
some with some text our list that we saw
before anyhow let's scroll back up here
so after our CSS let's drop down to the
JavaScript here and let's look at the
first function so our first function is
called list underscore products now I
have a comment here let's pretend we got
these values from a database we could do
that we could have grabbed this from a
database using some well I'm not going
to get into the details about that
because this is just a basics JavaScript
course but pretend that you could have
done that anyway so we've created our
new array we've populated our array and
then we created a variable and we've
used this variable to basically populate
it with stuff that we've held in our
array here so we've seen this code
before the only thing I want to point
out is that we've included a - order -
appears in front of each item from the
array and we've also included a break so
that after one item is displayed we get
a break and the next item and so on what
you want to take away from this is that
by the end of this function we return
the text variable which is basically all
this stuff combined in here so we get
that list we'll just preview that again
we just get this list here right so
that's all we're doing with this
function we're returning all that text
formatted later on I'll show you how we
could create links out of this so we can
have a menu of actual
is clickable via HTML links anyhow just
understand we're returning text now
which is this variable so now let's go
down into the next function so to create
a taco menu we have to track whether
something is off or on whether the menu
is off or on this probably doesn't make
too much sense to you now but just
understand when you're creating a menu
that's toggling you know what I mean by
toggle is the alcohol and off on and off
on when you're toggling a menu like that
you have to keep track of whether the
menu is open or closed I could have
called this open or closed but decide
just call off all and so anyway so let's
just take a look at the code and I think
yeah I think you understand so we have
this function called insert text first
thing I do is I have a big if statement
here right I get the if and I have the
else so I say if the variable on off
right we declared it here if the
variable on off is equal to off then we
do this otherwise it's not equal to off
if T equal to Han then we're gonna do
this before I get into this just
remember that after we've completed all
this stuff you notice how I declared a
variable on here so if it's off once
they've done my business I say okay turn
it on so the next time you come around
it will be on so this will fire here
Sophie drop down here if it is on this
all gets done and then we set it back to
off again so next time somebody clicks
it will be off again so this part will
get farted off I hope that makes sense
this is how this is the basic strategy
rather of how you create something a
toggle button an on/off switch if you
will you create your variable here
outside the function right and that
becomes a global variable we've looked
at that in a previous video and then we
we do our business we check to see if it
done or off rather we do our business
and then we switch it in the other
direction so for us off
you turn on and in this case it would be
on on the house and that means we're
gonna turn it off
I hope that makes sense
in part two of this video we're going to
get into the heart of this and that's
the get element by ID function and the
innerhtml property these two tools if
you will are very very important in
JavaScript Dom scripting and it allows
us to make all those changes to the
pages dynamically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
