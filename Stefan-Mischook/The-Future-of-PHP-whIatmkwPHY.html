kill their PHP calm and killed sighs
calm in this video blog I want to talk
about the future of PHP as it relates to
what's happening in the economy a lot of
people they're wondering about whether
or not being a web programmer is going
to be a good profession again to over
the next you know several years given
the economic turmoil that we're seeing
in in the in the West in North America
US and Europe it's a good question and
so you know besides being a professional
nerd one of the things they do do is I
follow the markets very closely you know
let's not just stock markets but you
know Kabaddi I follow kinds of markets
and I'm looking at where things are
going and in any economies around the
world try to set myself up for that
anyhow so let me give you the news about
what's going to happen over the next few
years what we've seen and you can see
how it relates back to PHP very quickly
what we're seeing now is we're seeing a
permanent or semi-permanent high level
of unemployment in the US and I think in
Europe where you know people are being
have been laid off their work their jobs
and you got a pretty high level
unemployment down and I don't think
that's going to be coming back anytime
soon I think that companies are going to
be very slow to hire four years and so
what's happening now is a lot of people
are getting into building up or starting
small businesses and I think that's
going to become more and more popular as
time goes by these kind of fights it's
sort of like we're going back to what
happened to
the way things were rather pre you know
dustry Aleutians where everybody start
has their own little businesses and
everybody's a trades person and they did
business together and that's what's
gonna happen now
so what you're gonna see is a lot of
small businesses being formed I already
see they hear from people and the good
thing for us web designer is web
programmers is that small business every
small business is going to need a
website just about like 99% so they're
gonna be looking for web designers web
programmers to help build out their
sites so that's cool the other cool so
how does this relate back to PHP well
PHP is ideally suited for small business
website development because PHP is a
scripting language which means it's
really fast and nimble it's really fast
and be able to create things with which
PHP as compared to let's say Java and if
you've been watching my videos or you
checked out you know anything about me
you've know that I actually have a
pretty extensive Java background and
I've also done programming many
different languages over the years
including dotnet stuff like c-sharp need
to be done that and Java and of course
PHP and other languages and I could say
that compared to thought that compared
to Java PHP is extremely nimble
extremely nimble so it means it takes a
fraction of the time to build the same
project in PHP as a would in Java
because of the because of the language
is basically a loosely typed scripting
language if you don't know what that
means you know don't worry about this go
to killer PHP you'll learn all about
that anyhow so the good news which you
want to take away from this video is
that if you're looking at web
programming or web designers profession
going forward I can tell you what I'm
very certain about this is that the
trend is your friend and that you never
see a lot of small businesses pop up
that weren't wouldn't be there otherwise
because of the economic
Herman Wow so if you're in a tight spot
now and you're kind of worried about
your future if you if you're going down
on the web technology path terms of
setting up a career or small business
you're choosing a good path because I
think there's going to be a lot of
opportunity there as opposed to if you
thinking about getting to realist
becoming a real estate agent or a Wall
Street broker or or you know you know
home renovation that kind of stuff it's
probably not a good business again into
now after you know the housing crash and
everything so anyway there you go PHP is
a great language la tigra a great future
because it's a scripting language that's
very quick it's very powerful PHP
programmers to code circles around
dotnet to Java guys simply because PHP
is so fast and then build a program with
and so there's a lot of opportunity
there that's it
