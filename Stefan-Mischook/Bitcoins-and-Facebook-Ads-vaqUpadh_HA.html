killer sights calm and studio web.com
among the sights in this quick little V
between and Facebook advertising and
they may seem unrelated and generally
generally speaking they are unrelated
except for one thing there's a bunch of
BS flying around both these these
technologies so Bitcoin if you don't
know mom I'm sure you do but bitcoin is
this so-called virtual currency now
people call it a currency because it's
got the name coin appended to it and
because people exchange it but people
exchange and buy and sell vinyls on ebay
and comic books and beanie babies at one
point but they are not currencies
bitcoin is it's not a currency it's it's
just a digital pyramid scheme that's all
it is because there's no value a real
currency has to be back to buying
government's when foolish people say but
the US dollar has no value because it's
just paper money they know what the hell
they're talking about they're idiots
the US currency has value because it's
backed by the US government it's backed
by the world's largest military power
the US government owns all one-third of
all all the land and resources in the US
US government taxes every business every
person that operates in the u.s. so that
has a huge amount of backing yes they've
been printing money lately which is not
good and they've been doing stuff that
undermines the value of the US dollar
but it's not worthless it's worth a lot
it's worth a lot more than Bitcoin
that's for sure so you can look at
another way you can look at the US
dollars being backed by the the
population it's backed by the community
in the US community well and also the
world's community right because 60% of
the world's reserves cash reserve money
reserves wealth reserves are in US
dollars so not only does the whole
entire US country
back usdollar most of the world does
Bitcoin is backed by a small group of
nerds and was also some some
entrepreneur not entrepreneurs some
entrepreneurs but also finance guys and
gamblers it's it's it's a medium of
gambling or gambling that the so called
bitcoins gonna go up in value now the
whole thing is starting to collapse
Bitcoin is now priced today at 519 a
coin just a few months goes over a
thousand you see just today it's dropped
nine percent what in a major so called
Bitcoin exchanges shut down again a
there's flaws apparently in the Bitcoin
protocol I'm not too up-to-date with
regards to what's going on in terms of
Bitcoin technology but you know there's
also eighty other 100 now other coins
that are known anybody can start one of
these stupid cryptocurrencies it's a
digital Ponzi scheme do not get in this
you may get lucky but you could just buy
a lotto ticket again lucky there as well
don't do it how does this relate to
Facebook well I think that Facebook
advertising is next to useless I really
do and the reason I do when I talked
about this for years is that the
Facebook is essentially just a giant
forum and you know user forum now I've
operated for on for years and once upon
a time the killer sighs stock coliform
was one of the more popular forums in in
the web design space and we'd get like a
thousand people every twenty twenty
minutes half an hour visiting us just a
forum so it was it was pretty popular
and I can tell you from years of
experience but to monetize to direct
traffic from forums to anything is
tremendous bad it did it's tremendous
terrible bad conversion rates it's not
worth it now this was a tech forum so
even trying to drive people from a tech
forum to tech related products and
services or
if that didn't work so imagine Facebook
where everybody's there to look at
pictures of their you know their cats
and their friend and chat with their
friends and people are leaving that as
well by the way how are you gonna sell
product there and you know I'll tell you
what you know evidence is starting to
come out like I mentioned the whole like
fraud or like scheme that's out there
and I'm not suggesting that Facebook is
involved in this and the Faris Lee I
don't know and I don't want to get sued
either but another thing that just came
out recently apparently when you do ad
campaigns with Facebook and this is
disastrous when you do ads campaigns
with Facebook you're not allowed to have
independent audits of the clicks that
they claim to be sending you there's one
guy who has spent nearly half a million
dollars on Facebook advertising
he had registered on his own search
analytics a couple do you know google
analytics his own and so on and he had
registered something like 160 thousand
clicks whereas Facebook was saying no no
we sent you six hundred thousand so he
wanted an independent audit but they
wouldn't do it now every other ad server
apparently allows for external hunts
which makes sense right if you're paying
for clicks you want to have an
independent person verify with these
clicks are real because let me tell you
any programmer will tell you to generate
fake clicks takes about two minutes you
know it's really easy so the fact that
it's in their Terms of agreement
Facebook that you cannot have
independent audit of their clicks your
advertising campaigns that should tell
you everything about what's going on
with the Facebook campaigns buyer beware
who knows maybe Facebook ads will work
for you for you but I really doubt it so
that's my nerd tip for the day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
