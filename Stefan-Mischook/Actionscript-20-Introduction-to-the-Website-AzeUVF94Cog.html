full working flash website using
ActionScript 2 point 0 with all of the
tips and tricks that you've learnt
already up to this point and a few new
ones that you'll see as we start to work
on this project in order to begin this
project we should at least take a look
at the final version and as you can see
here I've navigated to the folder which
stores all of the information for our
particular website you'll notice that
there is an index HTML page with the
Flash movie embedded on it part of what
we're going to be looking at in this
tutorial is dealing with what we call a
compartmental style of architecture to
load our flash movies as opposed to what
we saw in our first flash tutorial we
noticed how everything was based on the
timeline the entire flash movie had all
of its sections on one timeline now
that's fine if all of your sections of
your movie are considerably small
however in this example as in most
projects the different sections of our
movie are made heavier in fact most of
them are light but I've made the
portfolio section a little bit heavier
than normal just so that you can see how
this works so as you can see here each
one of these different sections with
their corresponding swf is in fact a
small file that's going to be loaded on
top of the master file the master file
is the one that is embedded on the H
index HTML page it will load all of the
other swfs on top of it so if I was to
open up the author swf and you can see
there's not really anything showing up
here because the text that's going to be
loaded into this text area is dependent
upon the master level when we do open up
the master level you'll see that it
contains all of the information that
we're going to be looking for and as you
can see here it's got buttons in place
to load the separate websites or SW
excuse me so this first swf the killer
sites swf has been loaded by as a
default on top of this and then if we go
to the author section it loads that swf
with some external text this is also
something that we're going to be looking
at how to handle text externally as
opposed to writing it inside of flash
not only that but we're also going to
learn how to style it using HTML and CSS
get these nice little roll over effects
here on the hover states of our links
also as you can see here I've included
an extremely heavy image so that when we
get into preloading you'll be able to
see how this preloader will work once we
have something that it has a substantial
weight to be loaded onto it and of
course we just have the final page here
for our info information but as you can
see this gives you a full idea of what
exactly we're going to be working with
it's a very plain website at the moment
there's really not much going on aside
for some text but let's just cover some
of the main things that we are going to
be looking at we're going to be
introducing the concept of the movie
clip loader how to work with this new
object to load our external SWFs as well
as JPEGs or anything else we're also
going to be looking at the load VAR
object because this is going to help us
to load external text data and will also
be seeing how to load this information
but style it also with CSS and HTML as
well be looking at some other things
like creating this scroll bar here or
these scrolling buttons which will do
more than just scroll one at a time
incidentally you could use a scrollbar
component but unfortunately the one
drawback to doing that is that it
increases the file size of your Flash
movie by 40k every time it's there this
way we've scripted it ourselves and as
you can see even if you have a lot of
information I'll show you how you can
implement this scrolling button to
scroll more than one
a line at a time and it will make for a
much more pleasurable experience for you
and your users so other than that we're
going to just cover those basic elements
main structure of every single website
and once you know those fundamentals
you'll be able to make a flash website a
good flash website in any situation any
scenario then it's literally up to your
imagination to decide how you're going
to make that flash website work but
essentially every single professional
flash website that is manufactured today
needs to work with actionscript 2 point
0 and all of the things that I'm going
to be talking about here you'll also
notice that the text is
being changed in terms of the rollover
effect that incidentally if you're on
the contact page notice that button is
inactive what I'll also be showing you
how to do is to work with the text class
and how to style these buttons so that
you can make this whole user experience
a little bit easier to navigate so
having said that let's jump into our
first elements of working on the flash
project and that will be to introduce
and to explain to you the concept of the
movie clip loader which will be using
indispensably throughout the project to
load our external SWFs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
