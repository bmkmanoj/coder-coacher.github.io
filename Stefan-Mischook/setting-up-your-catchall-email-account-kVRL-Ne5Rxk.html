killer sites calm in this quick little
video I want to talk about the default
email address now default email address
is basically a catch-all email address
and most websites the service provided
in while your ISP no excuse about the
ISP the hosting company rather will the
server will probably be configured in
some ways to have this so I'm just going
to go into cpanel here for one of our
domains I'm going to look for the
default email address icon right here it
might be placed differently for you even
if you have cpanel if you don't have
cpanel there's definitely going to be
some sort of catch-all or default email
address so let me just get to make my
point here basically if somebody sends
an email to your site and they send it
to they send this email to an account
and email Calvin does not exist the
catch-all or the default email address
can be configured to route those emails
to some special default email box now
this can be useful if for instance
somebody misspells your name sends the
email address since the email and the
catch-all will catch it and will write
it to a mailbox you can check
periodically that's cool the downside
with this is that if you start getting
spam email email I guarantee you will in
time it could start clogging up this
default email box with tons of spam
that's what happened to me recently I
was going through some long long needed
maintenance of some of our sites and i
found that
for some reason the default email was
set up to actually catch the email
addresses and save them not the email
addresses catch the emails and save them
so I had email boxes filled with over a
gig of emails which just really clocks
up everything another option that you
have with the catch-all zor the default
email addresses is just to have the
system have your server discard them
immediately now there's a couple
different ways you can do this you can
do just a plain discard as we see down
here discard just sold out that's it
emails that come in that or not address
to an actual user on the system they get
thrown out and then you don't have to
worry about it the problem with that
approach perhaps as weapons if
somebody's trying to send you an email
and they misspell it makes misspelled
your name or something and it gets
caught by the default address but
because your default address except just
to just trash it it just goes into the
you know just gets trashed nobody knows
what you know you don't know that you
got this email and a person who is
trying to send you a legitimate email
they don't know that it's been trashed
another option is the option I have
selected up here is to discard with
error to sender so basically what this
does it shows a failure and it gets
bounced back and in this case it says no
such user here this way at least if you
have a legitimate user they will know
that the email did not get to you so
this is probably the best way to do it I
wouldn't do any 14 I wouldn't save it
etc piping to program these are more
advanced options just in case you have
some fancier requirements but there you
go so now you know about the default
email address or to catch all depending
on what server you're using you'll have
it configured no give it a different
rather that's it I hope is this was
useful and we shall talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
