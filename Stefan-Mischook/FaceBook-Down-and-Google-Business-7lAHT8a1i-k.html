little screencast so I go to
facebook-dot-com on Chrome refresh
refresh come on work it was it hasn't
been working for there we go it's not
working
Facebook at somebody but Facebook you
know has not been working for me at
least I tried on multiple browsers for a
good 10 15 minutes I just get this blank
page and to prove a point
killer sites is working hey that's crazy
killer sites is working let's see how
was studio web hey study what's working
- that's kind of weird
there you go I don't know this bad luck
yesterday was Vimeo now it's uh it's
Facebook is down in other news I just
got this email from Google my business
so I put up studio web a little while
ago and they sent me this report which
is kind of cool so I guess this is what
people seen on Google calm regards to
finding studi web on Google so 312
people 105 percent increased from August
so not bad five star reviews great so
that's kind of cool this is something
new Google my business it gives you
ratings so if we go into I'm gonna go to
Google Google Doc whatever and I type in
studio web so now I'm anonymous here and
this is what Google presents to people
looking for Studio Web anonymously
now I'm anonymous because I don't use
Safari very often I use it just to check
out the web from the point of view of
somebody who was not associated with me
in any way if that makes any sense
because if I use my normal browser which
is Chrome then Google is gonna pick up a
its staff and they're gonna present a
different view of search results and
then I get here as an anonymous guy so
anyways there you go I think what Google
is talking about is this the section
over here
which is kind of cool you got to set
that up with Google if you do have a
website and have a business it's kind of
cool people can send reviews etc etc
and that's pretty much it
anyway I will let you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
