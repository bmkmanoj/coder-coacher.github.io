we're going to look at an important PHP
thingamabob something that you can use
in your websites today this thing I'm
talking about is called a PHP include
PHP includes our a tool a thingamabob if
you will that's built into PHP that
allows you to in a nutshell to insert
code that you have stored in another
page into your current page it works and
gives you this and gives you the same
advantages as linking to external CSS
files where you have an external CSS
file where you have all your CSS rules
and then you simply link to it in your
web pages so this way you have one
external CSS file that controls the
style of all your pages in the site
again much in the same way PHP includes
gives you the same capability but you
can do with any type of code so you
could store in an external file HTML
snippets and then you would use the
include mechanism to insert that code
and all your PHP pages
as many of you have probably figured out
include statements or PHP includes are a
very powerful part of PHP and they're
actually very easy to use includes are
actually used in many different
languages outside of PHP you find
includes used in things like ASP and
Perl these are all tools that are used
to build dynamic pages and have nothing
to do with PHP the only reason I
mentioned them is because they too have
includes the reason being is because
it's just such a great tool use so let's
get into using PHP includes and we'll
start with some simple examples and
we'll look at some of the variations
I've opened up Dreamweaver here and I
just want to show you a couple files
first of all I have my footer dot
include PHP file this is the actual file
that I'm going to include into another
page so let's look at the code as you
can see looking at the code it's
actually it's text and some HTML and
it's simply a footer link excuse me it's
simply a footer that would appear on the
bottom of the page and in this case this
is the actual footer event I use in the
killer PHP comm website and I've
included something a little extra here
I've actually included some PHP code in
our file and I basically created a
variable and given a value of fish which
is a text string of course you'll notice
that the PHP include does include any
other code HTML or anything so I don't
have a body tag and I don't need to do
that because the file that's gonna
include this code let's go here will
actually be the main HTML page if you
will or the main PHP page so let's jump
to that right now
so here's my page Mayans core pages of
PHP this is the actual page that people
are gonna be seeing it's a very simple
page I just put the title of PHP
includes and in here I've included can
you look back up a bit we have our HTML
code here of course and what I've done
is there's our PHP script block and
we've seen this before this is the print
function so here's the include statement
it's very simple
you have the word include and you have
the name of the file that you want to
include into your current page in this
case it's footer dot include PHP
statements have to respect paths as just
like when you link to an external
stylesheet you have to respect path so
in this case footer done cool that PHP
if I scroll over here is on the same
level as my page so we have my page dot
PHP and you got footer dot include that
PHP so since they're on the same level I
could just put it straight in like so if
they were let's say I had the include
file inside another folder say was it
called include I'd have to include that
here like so I'm getting to that a
little bit later but anyhow so this is
this this is it you just put the @
symbol the keyword include and this you
of course you get your brackets and you
include the file name and like any other
PHP statement you ended with the
semicolon and we're ready to go so I'm
just going to save that and now we're
going to pop open to browse we're going
to take a look at the page
here we go it's as simple as you get we
got our footer and what's this pew to
source just confirm things our text has
been inserted and as far as the people
viewing your site are concerned is all
part of the same page even though when
we go back to the source code of my page
you notice that footer information is
not there we don't have any footer
information the footer information was
inserted because it include tag
let's look at a couple of details about
the include keyword here and while the
include mechanism in PHP first of all
you notice you got this little add
symbol in front of it now there's a
reason for this as simple because you
can use include or you can state it with
the @ symbol or you can remove the @
symbol and if I just save the page and
I'll just refresh and I'll go back you
notice our our line is still included
our code it has still been included so
the ad symbol has a very particular
purpose and I'll show you what that is
right now so let's change that now
underscore footer died include that PHP
does not exist if you look here in the
project files there's nothing no such
file exists let's see what happens when
we try and clued a file that the PHP
engine can't find so we go back to the
browser include and here we see is a
warning now this text here is produced
automatically by the PHP engine
essentially it's a warning telling us
that a we can't find that file no such
file or directory right so let's go back
now let's include the @ symbol say that
reload the page and as we can see our
warnings have disappeared now if we look
into the source no warning text nothing
at all probably guessed the @ symbol
essentially tells a PHP engine that if
an error should occurred when trying to
include the specified file I should
mention you should put the specified
file in the double quotes of course
anyway if you have the @ symbol it tells
the engine to suppress the error message
so if you want to make sure that your
pages look decent and let's say you were
including some non-essential part of the
site like the foot or something and you
just want to avoid showing error
messages to your users which is usually
a good idea you want to use the @ symbol
in front of the include if on the other
hand you want to make sure that whatever
your you're trying to include is there
and you want to make it obvious if it is
then you just want to delete the @
symbol and do a simple include like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
