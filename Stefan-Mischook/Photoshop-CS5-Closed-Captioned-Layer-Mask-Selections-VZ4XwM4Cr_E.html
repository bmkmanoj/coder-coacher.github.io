you can see i'm at a hundred percent
resolution remember the shortcut is
command one or control one on your pc
and as you can see here we've got a very
simple mask applied to the guy layer
that i can move around here you can see
what's going on if i want to i can
remove the layer mask and i could do so
in a number of ways one way is to
actually click on this little box for
the mask drag it to the trash and it'll
ask you do you want to apply this before
removing it well you could just say
delete for example and in doing so what
we've done here is completely remove the
mask if i press command Z or controls
that on a pc I'll return that back to
the way it was another way of deleting a
mask is to right click on it and you can
delete it from this little drop-down
menu however rather than deleting the
mask you could also disable it by
disabling it as you can see you've got a
little X here and it shows the image as
if there was no mask applied to it
however if you want to bring that mask
back perhaps you've done a lot of work
to make that mask look the way you want
it to you can then say well let's enable
this mask so just doing that you can
bring it all back in certain instances
and if you remember when we were
dragging this mask to the trash it asked
us if we wanted to apply the layer mask
what that means is it will remove the
mask but your image now is looking as
though the mask is still there but it's
not a mask that we can actually affect
at this point the mask is gone and the
image has been damaged while in this
case it looks like it's damaged the
image has been actually affected by that
mask and now is this mask right here so
command said I'll just return that back
to the way it was so what I want you to
do is to just right click delete it and
now we have the picture with no
application on it so at this point I can
show you a few more things about working
with this particular mask one thing that
we can do is not just apply the mask
as we've done here and then start using
brushes against it you can actually
start with a selection now there are a
number of ways that we can select so I
could use the quick selection tool that
we looked at a little bit earlier don't
worry about being perfect actually at
this point because well part of what I
want to be talking to you about and
showing you right here is how the mask
can actually do a lot of the extra work
that I want to do so at this point I'm
in a little bit of trouble with that
little last selection here that's okay
because we could always zoom in remember
here's a shortcut working with this
particular tool if you're clicking down
and when you do that you can also click
down but we can sort of zoom in on our
area but nevertheless i'm actually going
to leave it like this for this instance
because this is just a starting point
you can see I've left the ear here and
also I've left some areas here like
between the legs and in between the arms
that I haven't really addressed well
let's just start with a very simple
little selection like this and when we
want to create a layer mask but we have
a selection marching around as this one
is when you click on it take a look at
what happens everything outside of that
selection is made black meaning you
intentionally want to remove that area
with the mask but everything inside the
selected area is white so this is great
for us because now we can zoom in on our
area so i can press Z or Z and here we
have our magnification zoom tool and we
can just click in a little bit remember
just click and slide to the right or
slide to the left depending on how you
want to zoom in and then I'm pressing my
spacebar to get my hand tool up here and
at this point you can select a brush
actually I'm going to work with a
regular brush here we go it's way too
large so you can right click and you can
change the size or excuse me
we can press the square bracket and the
square bracket is right here so you'll
notice when you're working with black
it's going to remove the area so I don't
want that but to switch it we can click
on this or just press X and I can start
bringing in some of the area that i have
here now it's okay if you go a little
farther than you want that reason being
is that you can always either zoom in or
even if you just work with a very small
tool as I have right here I'll make it
even smaller and I'll switch to black
once you switch to black you can come in
here and you can start rushing out some
of the areas that you don't want to keep
so just by moving around like this don't
worry if you go too far in because you
can always just press X bring some of
that back nice and easy so as you can
see there's real a lot of easy work that
you can do in this case pressing X you
can take away some of those areas will
refine this even more in a future
example but as you can see that's fairly
easy to do so all of this area that's
greyish I'm just clicking along getting
rid of it it's rather small brush I know
but that kind of works for us in this
instance here I might want to switch to
white and white will reveal so sorry
i'll keep it in black and underneath
that we can see that the area between
his arms is now starting to become
transparent now if I hide the petri dish
you can sort of see that and if you've
gone too far that's okay you can
just move it around back again if you
want to zoom in or out again sometimes
moving without the tile or if you do
have it in there you can see that you
can get some of that the scrubby zoom is
the zoom that we saw notice I'm
scrubbing my zoom so here if I want to
work with this brush switch back to my
be brush tool we don't want to hide that
area in this case I want some white in
there to bring it back you might want to
use a larger brush so right square
bracket so as you can see I can sort of
bring back that area and then decide to
press X and switch back to my white one
and say okay now it's time for me to get
rid of some of this extra space that
I've got here and delete some of that so
as you can see just by switching black
and white to bring back or to remove
different areas that you do or do not
want very easy to do press Black Press
white so we can make our brush or
smaller remember just by working like
that can make our brushes larger right
square bracket switch back to white to
reveal some of this area and anything
that you don't want you can quickly
remove or return based on what you have
so it's a real nice and easy way to work
and very very simple means of creating
your image and masking working in this
fashion so as you can see we've got the
guy I've got the petri dish behind him I
can move them around let's go back to a
hundred percent command one notice it's
not exactly one hundred percent perfect
i could still
find it better and we'll do that in a
future episode as I've mentioned but
nevertheless right you can see the area
in here as opposed to in here and you
can continue working in that fashion and
if you do a really nice job you'll have
a very smooth image by the way we can
also do something similar just by using
something like a magic wand tool if you
do happen to have you know a lot of an
area that looks pretty much you know the
same similar size and color and notice
these little bits here which are a
little bit too much in certain areas
well we could not rarely have to worry
about that because we could just apply
our mask actually that's gone the other
way around so I'll just apply it this
way and any areas that need refinement
like these areas over here you can
certainly just brush them in just by
using and utilizing the mask area and
technique that you have right there so
masking is very easy to work with and
there are a lot of similar things that
we can do with it but there's even more
that I want to show you with this and
will do so in just a second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
