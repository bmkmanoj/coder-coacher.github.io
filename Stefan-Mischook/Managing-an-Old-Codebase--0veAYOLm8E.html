vlog I'm going to talk about managing a
code base for a long time this is
something I guess a lot of developers
don't get to do because especially if
you're a freelancer you build an app you
get out of there and you may get calls
on occasion to update it but to really
manage a long term app I'm talking about
three four five years six years long and
what the reality of that situation is
and it's just not just my experience but
I've seen it elsewhere so let me go back
to a story experience i had an encounter
I had with somebody at a wedding and he
was a top developer at Microsoft and he
worked on the Microsoft Word team and I
asked him why is word with every new
version so much bigger 200 maze and 400
maze and 800 mates to install and so on
and he told me what happens is that when
they build a new version of word windows
Excel whatever they keep layering cold
on top of code they don't actually go
and touch the previous code base much at
all they're too afraid to because they
don't want to break anything and so at
the time I remember I was snickering
going well what kind of lousy coders are
they right come on you got to keep your
code up to date at least that's what the
the books will tell you but the thing is
is that when you're actually writing
code in real world and you have to deal
with deadlines doing with changing
requirements you do have all kinds of
unknowns and you just it just it just
doesn't work that way the way it works
is that you're going to you're going to
get it out as quickly as possible you're
going to try to implement some best
coding practices as I discussed in other
videos to try to keep it clean as
possible aim for simplicity that helps a
lot but at the end of the day you're
probably just going to be writing layers
upon layers just to keep things simple
for yourself so let's go back to my code
base same thing with my apps to the web
is pretty much a bug free app now works
very well but I have to admit there are
aspects of the code basis you know not
too good not too good at all and so what
we've done to deal with that is instead
of trying to get into that
can of worms and that could lead to all
kinds of problems that we're not sure
about you know you never know you post
string here and something can break over
there and yes that's a sign of some
messy code but that's the way it goes so
what you do is you you start using a
facade pattern which is basically
building a layer on top of it but these
days with cloud-based technologies with
microservices architectures this becomes
much easier to do much more feasible to
do and that's what we did we wanted to
update our arm because the arm we were
using in the original app for six years
ago now little dated and sort of stead
of trying to gut that arm which would
have been a pretty big job we just
implemented an API which is a series of
micro surfaces and then we process
reports and so forth through this new
API which is far better far more
advanced and then we return the results
the refine results back to the old app
so the old app can take advantage of all
the new crazy powerful arm tools that
are out there now without risking
busting anything in the old app and
everything works fine everything works
fine so that is a reality of modern day
coding where when you are faced with
deadlines pressures and so on you can't
necessarily adhere to all the the
idealisms if you will of coding it's
just the way it is unfortunately unless
you're building really small apps then
you know then you can you know then it's
pretty easy but again that this is a
that does not mean you should throw away
good coding practices that stresses out
even more is you know simple functions
and simple classes good naming
conventions separation of concerns that
sort of thing and if you do that that
will go a long way to help make your
code less crappy and now I leave with
this a good friend of mine once said
well said recently using other words i'm
going to use the the more politically
correct terminology said there is either
a crappy code or crappier code in this
world Jojo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
