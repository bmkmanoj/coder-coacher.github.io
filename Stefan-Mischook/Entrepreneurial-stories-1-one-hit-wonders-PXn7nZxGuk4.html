gonna be the first of a new series
Archer proneural stories as you may or
may not know I've been a professional
nerd since the early 90s but I've been
an entrepreneur for longer so I'm like
20 27 years I have to do you exact math
I started when I was a young lad in
addition to that my parents owned
businesses as well so ever since I was
about 10 years old I've been exposed to
small medium-sized business my entire
life what I plan to do in this series is
to basically just go over all kinds of
entrepreneurial stories things I've done
and experience I see them with my
parents because when I was a kid as
young as 10 years old we would just talk
about businesses all the time it's
supper in the car my parents would be
talking to each other so it's just been
something that's been a part of my life
for a longest time in addition to my
personal and family experiences I'm also
going to talk about experiences I know
from friends so when you become an
entrepreneur if not right away over time
you eventually find yourself becoming
friends with other entrepreneurs because
you share similar interests what I filed
in life at people who are entrepreneurs
have a different mindset than people who
are not I'm not saying better I'm saying
different and it's a different worldview
almost and so what happens you end up
becoming friendly or friends with other
entrepreneurs and so I've learned a lot
from their experiences as well because
it was as much a hobby for me and for
them as it was to make a living so in
this very first story we're going to
talk about the one the one-hit wonders
there we go
one-trick pony or one hit one
entrepreneur or business people and the
message or the warning that gives you so
what is a one-hit-wonder is somebody who
starts their first business and I am
they do excellent they do well some of
them even become huge like Mark
Zuckerberg or something and you figure
wow these people their business geniuses
could be or it could be more likely that
they just got very very lucky now any
honest businessperson will tell you that
luck has a lot to do with business and
you never know what product will work
what service will work and which won't
and you hear it often enough from honest
business people they go into business
thinking that product a is going to do
amazing but they also have product B and
C and what they actually find out when
they get out there it's actually product
D that makes the business this is very
common so even with the business masters
like Steve Jobs consider one of the best
business minds of our time he had many
failures some of his pet projects some
of his projects he thought were gonna be
the best sellers of all time ended up
being losers he didn't want to have in
more recently he did not want to have
the App Store he had to be fought with
and he was had to be pushed into
creating the App Store for the iOS for
iPhones and a good thing he was because
if he wasn't we don't know how
successful the iPhone would have been
because in fact if you recall one of the
big reasons why iPhone was able to grab
so much market share and hold it was
because of the App Store something that
Steve Jobs did not want anyhow off on
the tangent so with the one-hit wonders
somebody who gets lucky right away and
their business grows this can lead to a
sense of
unjustified confidence in their
abilities as businessman so let me give
you a quick story about somebody a
friend of a friend he is going back a
while back so this person built up his
business over time and it did really
well and he sold it for I think was ten
million dollars or something back in the
day when 10 million was a lot of money
so he saw his business and he thought he
was he was the best so he then using the
money from his business he decided to go
into a whole different industry so long
story sharp after about two years he
burned through half his ten million just
gone burned through it because he didn't
know what he was doing in the new
industry and he quickly learned that
just because you're successful in one
business it doesn't necessarily mean
you're going to be successful in the
next because there is an element of luck
that plays into any business that you
get into which begs a business strategy
which I think I'll cover in another vlog
so yeah when you hear about the one-hit
wonders we're gonna give you business
advice I would be very careful about
what they tell you because when you got
the Mojo when you got a product that's
selling really well you know you have to
be you have to do some really bad moves
to screw that up the real good business
operators my biggest mentors the people
I respected the moles or of those who a
started their business from scratch
didn't start with their parents business
I always laugh when I hear about people
gonna say well I'm a self-made guy and I
started off my working for my parents
multi-million dollar company and I was
able to achieve this and this and this
the hardest part about starting business
is starting the business figuring out
the business model figuring out the
processes in a business to make it
efficient when you walk into your
father's business that's doing millions
of sales
and then you just handled a marketing or
you had or whatever you go in there I'm
not very impressed I'm not very
impressed because you're just walking
into a working it's like jumping into a
moving car and say look my car is I made
it go a little bit faster now that's a
terrible analogy but you get the idea
now the people who you should look to in
terms of business Mart's are people were
a who started their own businesses from
scratch without help from mommy or daddy
people who have had multiple successes
in multiple industries different
industries you know if you if you're in
the software business and then you
launch a successful app that does that
are known whatever marketing marketing
apt and soft marketing or software app
I'm just pulling something off the top
of my head and then you go into another
piece of software which you push through
your channels that you've already
established that's fine it's cool but
what's more impressive as you go into
software one business and then you open
up your own a retail line I don't know
you know another business something
totally different you're able to make
both businesses succeed equally that's
much more impressive to me what are my
favorite mentors was a guy who was able
to do that across many businesses many
different industries that are unrelated
and he was able to make them work like
seven different industries the guy is
worth I don't always work today maybe a
hundred million or something so he's not
a billionaire or anything but the fact
that he's able to make many different
types of businesses work and where he
started them from scratch a lot of the
times that is pretty impressive of
course when you got a bunch of money
it's a lot easier to start a business so
anyway that's my entrepreneurial story
for today
beware the advice of the one-trick
ponies or be one-hit wonders and beware
of the advice of people who actually
were as able to startup in their
family's business because that's just
you know that's
kind of silly anyway that's it for now
let me know what you think if you like
this style where I teach lessons through
stories not by just giving you an
adult's you know cuz all these guys they
see they put out business how-to videos
and then you discover that their
business is to teach you how to start a
business and then you discover that you
know well a lot of times I hear what
they're saying I'm saying I think it
sounds like they got that from a book I
don't know anyway Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
