sights calm and killer PHP calm in this
quick little video I want to answer a
question that was recently put to me by
somebody and I think it's a question
that a lot of aspiring PHP programmers
or PHP developers would be interested in
hearing and the question is do you need
a PHP certificate to get a job as a PHP
programmer
the short answer to that question is it
depends on the type of work that you're
going to be looking for let me just get
to the point if you're looking to work
for a large organization I'm talking a
big company where they have an HR
department a human resources department
then PHP certification will be much more
important than if for example you wanted
to start a independent PHP firm where
you're doing contract work for instance
so getting back to the large
organization typically any large
business whether it be private business
or government they're going to be much
more concerned about your certification
your degrees than a smaller companies
and definitely if you're going out there
as a freelancer or opening up a firm you
won't they won't even ask you about
these things it's it's the last thing
they consider so to recap if you're
looking to work for a larger business
certification becomes more important
it's not necessarily a deal-breaker
typically larger businesses the first
thing they're going to look for is
whether or not you have a bachelor's
degree at the end of the day though
whether you're looking for a job in a
large company or in a small company the
most important thing that you're going
to need to have is experience and a
provable track record so I always tell
people we're getting into whether you're
getting into the business of web design
or you want to get into PHP programming
or any technology that you need to go
out there and build sites write scripts
create projects this is the most
important thing so what option for you
if you're getting out of school or while
you're just learning PHP is to just take
on small jobs there are a lot of small
businesses out there who need simple
things done simple shopping carts or
even simple mailers these kind of things
and modifying a blog that's PHP base
whether it be WordPress or Drupal or
something which is a content management
system the point is is you want to get
some coding hours under your belt so
that you can show people that you
actually know what you're doing when I
look at people I know when I'm hiring
people for my for kill sites the first
thing I look at really is their
experience I do
glanced at the resume to see what
they've done but in terms of how I
weight it in terms of the overall
equation I give it maybe 10% weight 50%
way personally I'm much more concerned
about their experience in the field and
what kind of projects they've worked on
and because I'm a nerd I actually look
at the code that they've written I Wasi
but the code is clean but it's modular
that's well commented etc etc etc so
again it comes back to whether or not
you have good experience that you could
show people so certification helps
definitely it helps but experience
Trump's that so there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
