about the Google artificial intelligence
the Google AI built into Android at
least I find that it's getting more and
more sophisticated it's kind of
interesting what I noticed over the last
few weeks is how now the google's AI is
now reading the emails and suggesting
responses to the emails and sometimes
pretty complex responses for example the
Google AI started to figure out whether
or not there is a tech support question
being thrown at me and then it will
suggest a few different generic answers
related to tech support that sort of
stuff it will recognize when there might
be scheduled meetings that will give me
options there as well it's getting
pretty pretty interesting and I can just
imagine what a few years will do in
terms of a eyes capacity to start taking
over more and more tasks as its able to
analyze inputs and generate relevant
outputs it's pretty cool stuff
AI machine learning all this kind of
stuff it is definitely a growing field
and something to get into yes indeed
that's where Python will come in of
course anyhow I just wanted to make
mention of that I found it kind of
interesting when something piques my
curiosity like this I figured it might
be a good of loging topic you've
probably heard of the law of diminishing
returns maybe you haven't a lot of
diminishing returns tells us that at
some point the amount of effort or money
that you invest in something will have a
diminished return meaning you won't see
too much of a difference so for instance
the difference between a $80,000 sports
car and a quarter million dollar sports
car from what I've seen is not a huge
difference if if much of it all it could
be 10% different maybe you know it's not
that difficult it's not it's not so
obvious to me saving with computers you
know between the
super high-end computers in terms of
speed and processing power versus the
middle-of-the-road though the super
high-end computer is much more expensive
you may get an extra 15 percent
performance increase maybe 20 if you're
lucky when you spend all that extra
money on the high-end computer now
what's come to my attention recently and
I suspected it is the same thing with
cameras so I'm using a
middle-of-the-road prosumer I guess
canon a TD so in the US is about but the
kit lens about I guess around 1,500
bucks for this camera so it's really
middle-of-the-road
and it does what I needed to do so I was
comparing footage from my
middle-of-the-road camera with
middle-of-the-road
lenses versus these $10,000 Canon
cameras now either is a difference
there's no question about it but main
it's not huge but to my eyes maybe 10 15
% better in my eye what you're getting
with these very expensive cameras is a
lot more flexibility perhaps no since
I'm just doing this type of vlog style
or in my office in my living room types
of shooting I don't really need the
super expensive camera so let me give
you an idea so I'm using on this camera
a low-end wallow in a middle-of-the-road
none low-end a 24 millimeter lens from a
Canon and it's a super thin lens like
this thick and it shoots at 2.8 if you
don't know anything about camera that's
the size of the hole in the in the lens
the bigger to hold a more light bigger a
hole the more expensive lens it's the
way it is
yeah so the lens is the most important
part of camera in terms of the quality
of the picture right because everything
goes through that glass and the lens but
anyhow so I got this lens and up here in
Canada it's about $220 lens
and it is a $220 lens at 24 millimeter
2.8 so to point a is all size as a whole
so this lens here let me show you the
lat lens here is a another canon lens
and it too is a 2.8 24 millimeter now it
has one extra capability has image
stabilization so if you shake it around
it removes some of the shakes but beyond
that and I've tested it extensively
versus the lens I have on now this lens
pretty much has the same quality image
in my from my 4 month from what I can
tell now this lens though has the image
stabilization so it's stable the one on
the camera doesn't but who cares
you only need image stabilization if
you're doing this you have it handheld
right and you're gonna have jitters but
on this lens since I just have it on my
tripod doesn't matter to me
this lens over the focus is here me hmm
makes noise and the lens I have on a
camera right now because it's a newer
Lance doesn't make any noise this lens
is $700 on sale the lens I have on the
camera is $200 on sale 700 versus 200
and depending on what you're looking for
these lenses don't really have a clear
advantages over the other so here is the
example of the law of diminishing
returns so the cost you extra seven 1s
extra check extra $500 more than triple
to price to get this lens here which for
all intents purposes is pretty much like
this lens in terms of the picture
quality except this this lens here has
is on there image stabilization you know
I just thought I'd throw that out there
is food for thought
consider the law of diminishing returns
whenever you are approaching anything
