importance of fonts and how following a
couple basic font rules can really
improve the look of your web pages
the first thing I want to look at is
this very basic page here now this is
just in a word document and what I want
to illustrate here was when you have a
mix of text and you're using text
improperly you have a pretty
ugly-looking page now what I mean by a
mix of text well let's look at we have
different font our text types here right
so here we're using brandish up here and
here we're using chapparal display
that's a weird fought name anyway and
here we set we get another font name of
the font name we if you notice we have
different font sizes that was 18 here
and this is 16 point this is all it's
all mixed up here and what you can see
is that this page is really kind of ugly
it's hard to read like this is hard to
read it makes no sense so what you can
take away from this is that you want to
keep your fonts consistent in your page
so if you have headlines here and there
at fourteen point here they should be
our 14 pixels rather they should be 14
here not 1814 and then you know back to
14 is this is crazy another thing other
rule is that you should keep your font
types to minimum so here we're using
arial unicode an aerial and then here we
have font and dora and here we have yet
another johnson door again then we're
here back to Arial here we gotcha para
el display again brandish you get the
idea the old rule of thumb that goes
back to back sweetie print days way
before the web is that you should have
no more than two font faces on a page so
a font face is like brandishes a font
face right up here brandish ariel is a
font face
what's down here adobe and dora is a fun
face so if let's say you decide you want
to create a page say okay all the
headlines are going to be Ariel and
maybe your body text could be another
font face so no more than two one is
fine as well so that's the first rule
you gotta pick up when it comes to fonts
on your pages there are a few other
rules and we'll jump into that
here's an old archive page from a news
letter I wrote back in wow I wrote back
in 2003 and we have a lot of pages on
killer sites and so once in a while I go
through it and I check to see how things
are looking because we have a lot of
legacy stuff old stuff that was done the
old school way and so I have to go back
and see if some some bad design hasn't
crept into the pages any help so on this
page here are playing standard layout
you know does it have to be flashy
because this is an archive page you see
a problem with some of the fonts now
we're only using two font types here I
believe maybe even one this looks like
for diner tahoma the problem though is
with the headings now you see this
heading it's pretty large and if you
look down here this heading as much
smaller now overall that could be okay
because if this is the heading for the
entire page I can just select this
properly it's no big deal that this is
slightly larger and I kind of makes
sense but if you look down here you
notice how I've used basically a
sentence case here right how to create
flash movies a sentence case right as we
would normally write a sentence over
here though I don't use a sentence case
I don't capitalize Adobe which should
have been capitalized so somebody made a
mistake there and reskinning this page
but anyway and then over here another
heading that we have you know it's all
uppercase right here we have mixed case
here we have all uppercase okay all
uppercase that's consistent but down
here again it's mixed our sentence case
again sentence case this is mixed again
so this inconsistency and the way the
fonts were used makes the page less
attractive harder to follow than it
would otherwise so what we're going to
do is we're going to just quickly clean
up some of these fonts and some of these
headlines rather
and we'll take a look at how the page
looks with the fonts fixed up
I've popped open the page in dreamweaver
cs4 now you can use any text editor you
one or web design program you want and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
back to this page here well I'm going to
go to this page and I'm going to clean
all this up I'm going to make them all
the selection things really pissing me
off I'm going to make them all uppercase
as we have with the adobe flex and we'll
go see and compare how the page looks
when everything is consistent that way
so through the magic of video I'm going
to spare you having to wait for me make
these changes so I'm going to pause the
video of course for user is going to be
a split second and we're going to make
the changes so I'll see you soon
ok I'm back I made the changes took it
just took about a minute to do so here
is the original page without the changes
so I'm going to scroll through so you
can take a look at it and get a feel for
how it looks and you can see I'll pay
attention to these headlines here and
you can see the inconsistencies whereas
you know mixed case versus all uppercase
etc so now let's go to the modified
version or I've just changed the cases
you knows now everything is an uppercase
with 3d switch flash flash or flash tags
flash animator the only thing I didn't
switch to uppercase is which one to
choose this headline and the reason I
didn't change is because of the context
what do I mean by that well if you look
at all these other headlines they talk
about a product a particular flash
product swift 3d switch flax etc whereas
this one is just basically a close-up of
the article or I say which one to choose
this difference between the product
names being all uppercase texts were
capital text where this is a sentence
text this gives a little bit more
information to a guy reading the article
right because they can scan see Adobe
flex todo be air Swift 3d switch so it's
pretty clear that anything that's all
upper text like this is a flash based
product which is the key of this
article's how to create flash movies and
I talked about the various pieces of
software that you have available so not
only does a consistent font pattern make
the page just look cleaner if you can
look at this house very clean and when
you see this change here you know
suddenly you're not talking something
different you're not just talking about
different products so not only does the
consistent use of font headings and the
way you use of fonts make the page
nicer to look at more legible it
actually helps convey the message of the
page so if we go back and compare our
original you can see house a little bit
more difficult to read and understand
so what you should take away from this
video is that when you're creating your
pages you want to use your fonts
consistently not just in terms of the
titles but in terms of the paragraphs as
well you want to make sure that you
don't have no more than two font faces
to font styles on a single page and I
actually would extend this to a great
degree across the entire site they look
of the site and the consistency of the
site is greatly affected by the
consistency and the use of fonts in your
page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
