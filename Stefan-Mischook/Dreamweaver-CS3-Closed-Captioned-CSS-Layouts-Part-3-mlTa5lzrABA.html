really important part of web design and
that's why Dreamweaver has all kinds of
different tools and different ways of
adding and using CSS in your own
websites that said it's also probably
the most challenging aspect of basic web
design and so if you're having troubles
with it a lot of things are unclear
again I I just want to encourage you to
say not you're not the only one and just
to give yourself some time and to
actually practice when you see an
opportunity so for instance you see
we've built this basic left-aligned page
here with CSS if you haven't already I
really encourage you to pause the video
and to try and build this yourself it's
really important that you get in some
practical experience along the way
because I can tell you from my own
experience and from teaching thousands
of people if not tens of thousands over
the years that it's practical experience
is at least 10 times more important than
academic experience so what do I mean by
that essentially one hour of actually
web designing building pages with
Dreamweaver is in terms of learning is
worth 10 hours of reading books or 10
hours of watching videos even my videos
again when you see an opportunity to
pause pause the video and try out one of
the things that I've just demonstrated
in front of you
what we're going to do here is take a
closer look at some of the Dreamweaver
tools well Dreamweaver CSS tools and
we're also going to actually take a
better look at the logic and the
structure behind this left dashiell I'm
page that we built using the Dreamweaver
tools or recall to use the layout
abilities here where we were able to
drag our divs and we're also going to
look at another way of building a
similar type of layout well it's
actually a little bit different but
something called the center align dot
HTML page i built and we're going to
take a look at the differences again the
idea here is for you to understand some
of the basic mechanics behind the scenes
so that when you actually get to using
the templates in your own web design
work you'll be able to tweak them but
you knew that already all right enough
enough enough of the nerd theory let's
just jump into it let's select the div
here and I did so by selecting the
square here right and listen if you
haven't opened up your CSS panel open it
up and select all and I've selected the
main content to select that main content
so you see the properties the CSS
properties of this particular div we
know background colors obvious the
height and width that's pretty obvious
height with right let's look at one
thing here you see left to ten what that
means is that this div is 210 pixels to
10 PX right from the left edge of the
browser window so if we preview that
here this was it again this is main
content scuze me so this one here ms div
here from this point right here at the
edge right here to here right the edge
of a browser window that's 210 pixels
so that's what that code does it pushes
this over 210 now we look at the top
attribute an attribute is again
attributes like you know your hair
colors and attribute your eye colors and
attribute this is so what I'm talking
about attributes here i'm talking about
CSS attributes associated with this main
content ID right anyway doesn't sink in
i'm sure we'll come to you soon enough
so the top attribute has to do with this
div being nine pixels from the top of
the page so here's the top of the page
nine pixels down and that's what that is
talking about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
