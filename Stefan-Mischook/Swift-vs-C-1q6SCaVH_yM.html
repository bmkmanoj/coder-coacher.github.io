cover two things number one somebody
asked me what about Swift Apple Swift
versus learning c-sharp and I guess
c-sharp asp.net yeah very quickly with
that it comes down to again number one
what type of work you want to do so if
you're doing Swift basically you're just
going to be doing iOS app development
basically developing apps for iPhone
which could be very viable it could be a
lot of fun and I believe Swift can also
be used to create apps for mac OS
although I think very few people will be
doing that relative to iOS development
and then we'll see sharp most of the
people you're gonna even be doing dotnet
development most of the time web apps
with asp.net or you might be writing
games in frameworks like unity editing
is one of them that uses c-sharp so
again it depends on the type of work
that you want to do the languages in of
themselves are both great languages
although c-sharp is a lower level
language meaning there's more you have
to do in terms of the amount of code
that you write to get things done but as
a result you have more control over how
your app works that's not necessarily a
good thing because a lot of times you
don't really need all this fine-grained
control that these lower level languages
will give you and what are what do I
mean by lower level language I mean
closer to the CPU although both see
c-sharp and Swift are not exactly low
level languages they're highly
abstracted languages if you will anyway
they're details so again when you're
choosing your language these days all
kinds of languages are very very cool
they're very neck-and-neck in terms of
their ability some will be a bit better
than they're in this and some of some
other language languages will be a bit
better at that that's clear but at the
end of the day
which language you to did you choose to
to learn and work with depends on the
type of work you want to do the type of
jobs that are available in your area
so before I would dive into c-sharp or
dive into Swift I would look at what the
job market is like for Swift developers
in your area for c-sharp developers in
your area and then also really
understand the ecosystem around of the
languages understand the ecosystem
around Swift what it means to be a
switch developer and that of course is
iOS and what it means to be a c-sharp
developer that typically means dotnet
development web apps many many times and
perhaps some game development with unity
although I don't see a lot of
opportunity in terms of work with unity
development relative tools will say
writing iOS apps or readying web apps
with net also recall if you see my other
videos that if you're writing dotnet
you're probably going to be working for
larger organizations which implies a
different type of structure than if you
working for a smaller company which is
much more loose much more hipster or
perhaps working as your sole developers
right I don't see people getting a soul
gauge working for small business as a
c-sharp developer I can see that to a
certain extent with Swift development
building small iOS apps for small
businesses out there although if your
ultimate goal again to be a freelance
developer I say that lowest barrier to
entry of course is PHP WordPress
development and I'm not saying because
these are the two greatest technologies
ever invented no because it's just as a
huge amount of opportunity because I'll
say it one last time we're press has
about 30% of the web sites out there
based on WordPress and I would bet you
that small business websites I bet you I
wouldn't be surprised 60 70 percent of
small business websites are based on
WordPress so these small businesses will
there
very likely we'll love to work with
independent developers or WordPress
professionals and they're desperate to
find wordpress professionals to help you
configure create themes a lot of five
beams changed some basic functionality
and WordPress etc etc etc they're
desperate because PHP though it's so
popular and WordPress though it's so
popular they're not sexy so it's kind of
like plumbing in the construction
industry farming is highly highly
valuable plumbers basically print money
because it takes some time to learn
people don't want to learn it because
it's hard and so plumbers when you
become a plumber as a friend of mine
it's just safe they make all kinds of
money without even trying hard and
you're going to see the same thing with
WordPress professionals WordPress
developers because the developers don't
want to do WordPress work because they
don't they don't like it and because web
designers don't want to learn WordPress
buhbuh buhbuh blood and there's a huge
amount of websites small business
websites are right on WordPress there's
a lot of people a lot of demand for bad
supply and demands it's basic economics
anyway yeah so Swift c-sharp both great
great languages depends what you want to
do so little news I was gonna slow down
a day because I was cooking some chicken
and I did a real number or nobody can
see this I burnt the crap out of my hand
and I literally could not sleep all
night you know if you can see the
scarring and this happened just last
night I couldn't sleep because of the
pain it was intense so I had to like
basically keep running my hand under ice
cold water put it ice on it and so I ran
out and I bought myself the best cure
the best cure for burns by far better
than any medication I've ever seen in a
drugstore is the aloe plant you cut it
and you're gonna get this gel and you
just put it right on the wound right on
your burn it has amazing impact in terms
of its medicinal properties all these
and stuff that you see in the garage
stores for burns they all use tons of
aloe but it's all a derivative it's
small percentage go with pure aloe gel
can't beat it and this plant is like
dirt cheap compared to the medication as
well so you get a much better cure than
the gels to get in a drugstore it's
cheaper and it's it's it's a really
amazing stuff I'll let you know how it
goes but last time I burnt myself I put
some of this stuff on it was immediately
me relief from the pain and it helps it
heal so much more quickly so there you
go
not only nur tips from me but home
remedies bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
