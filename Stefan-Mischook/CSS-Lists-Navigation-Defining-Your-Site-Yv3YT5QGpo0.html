going to be doing is opening up
Dreamweaver and if you already don't
have a number of files available you can
look at the files that came with this
particular video tutorial and you can
place the CSS layout folder on your
desktop and what we're going to do is as
we always do at the beginning of any
project inside of Dreamweaver and that's
define a site so what you would do if
you're starting from scratch you've got
your folder on the desktop even if you
don't have that folder that's okay you
can work along with the video as we
progress and you'll be able to follow
along and might take you a little longer
to put things together but you'll should
be able to work with this even if you
don't have the sample files but if you
got the video from killer sites com
it'll come with a few sample files so
after placing those sample files on your
desktop let's go to defining a new site
and at this case what you should really
be doing is just you know call it CSS
links or nav or something like that and
here where it says local site folder
what we're going to be doing is pointing
to your desktop and on your desktop
you'll see CSS layout that's where I
told you to put it a couple files in
there nothing really crazy but let's
just open that up so I'll choose that
and also save and we'll click OK so as
you can see I've got these elements in
place and there's a number of files in
here there's one that says fixed and if
you did follow along with us from the
last time you'll remember that this
particular file I'll just show you what
it looks like this is when we were
exploring CSS layout and I was showing
you what a fixed pixel design looks like
but you'll notice that there are no
navigation elements here in the sidebars
and if I were to return back to
Dreamweaver for a second what I'd show
you now I don't really need this one
open so I'll just close that for a
second and what I'll be showing you now
is the liquid layout and that was
another thing that we
looked at when we were attempting to
work within our CSS layout techniques
and you'll see that this one has more of
a liquid layout that you know can
accommodate your screen size whatever it
was but you'll notice that here we have
a finished version of this liquid layout
and in this particular liquid layout
there are some navigational lengths and
you'll see that they swap colors just as
easily as I'm doing right here so you'll
be learning how to do that and at the
same time we'll also be looking at how
to create a navigational element that
can spend you know a horizontal area
like the header area or something along
those lines if you wish so we'll be
exploring all of these things and now
that you've had a look at what they're
going to look like I will ask you to
open up the just links HTML section now
rather than get into working with links
and list items as you'll see here I will
go to the split screen and we'll explain
exactly what's happening here in just a
second but rather than get confused with
all the other code that's going on
inside of these examples the liquid
layout and the fixed columns and stuff
like that what am I going to ask you to
do instead though is to open up to this
particular file where we can concentrate
solely on working with the list items
and in doing so what we're going to be
seeing is how to create these links and
these list items in a fashion that will
make it very easy for us to work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
