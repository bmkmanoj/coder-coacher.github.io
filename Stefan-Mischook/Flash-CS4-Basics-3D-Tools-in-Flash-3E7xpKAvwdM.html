exploring the three-dimensional tools
inside of flash as you can see I've got
a sunburst which is created inside of
illustrator and what I want to point out
is that the sunburst has been imported
into this particular flash file and it
came in as a graphic symbol as you can
see here so if I would select this and
go to my tools you'll notice that at the
top of the selection tools here that
there is this little 3d rotation tool
and underneath that you'll see 3d
translation tool now there are two
different tools but first and foremost
notice that even though i'm selecting
this i'm not actually doing anything
with it why is that because you can only
use these 3d tools with a movie clip so
what I'm going to do is to select this
graphic symbol that we have here now
i'll just say modify convert to symbol
i'm going to turn it into a movie clip
i'm actually going to call it loop
because eventually what we can do is
animate what's inside of this and it'll
be positioned in a three dimensional
fashion so at this point if I wanted to
let's start with the 3d translation tool
if I click on this you'll notice that
there is an arrow here for why and then
I'll let you move this up and down on
the why there's an arrow here for the X
we don't happen to see the Zed although
if I put my cursor here you can actually
see it and if I select that you'll
notice that that allows you to move on
the third dimension the Zed so just
going up and down allows me to go in and
out in this fashion so that's a great
little tool the 3d translation tool but
probably more interesting or intuitive
here is the 3d rotation tool and what's
nice about this latest version cs4 of
flash is that it allows for the ability
to move movie clips in a
three-dimensional rotation so instead of
just X
why we can also move something on the Z
rotation as well notice the different
colors that i have here there's green
here for why there's red for x and
there's this blue circle for z and the
one on the farthest reaches is all of
them at once and what i want to show you
is just a little bit if we move this on
the X you can see it's doing this now
you might wonder this says X and why is
it doing that well imagine this being a
pole around on the X that this thing is
you know turning on or for example if
you have the Y this is usually the Y but
it's going to be moving this way and why
is that why because it's moving around
the rotation think of it almost like a
pole that it's like rotating around and
on the Z as you can see here you can
also move that object around and you
know flip it in whatever different
dimension you wish it to be so I'm going
to controls that undo these and what I'm
going to do is also take the one on the
outside and you can see that that one is
all three rotations at once and if I
were to use this you can see that there
is my rotation and I can see it just
like that that's great so if i switch
back to my black selection tool you'll
notice that these little lines here is
showing you that this particular object
is in a third-dimensional rotation
that's cool but as you can see I can
double click now to go inside that movie
clip and what we have here is the
graphic symbol remember that sunburst
graphic symbol and we wrapped it into a
movie clip symbol that I called loop so
what am I going to do with this well
let's apply a little bit of motion tween
because it's a graphic symbol already I
can animate it and I'm going to rotate
it well just once nothing too crazy it's
going clockwise so if i press control
enter
remember this is inside the symbol and
the outside the container movieclip
container is in its 3d rotation so while
I'm rotating the object inside instead
of looking at it from a two dimensional
perspective what we're doing here is
looking at it as a third dimensional
perspective which is really kind of
interesting and just shows you one of
the simple possibilities of what you can
do with the 3d rotation tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
