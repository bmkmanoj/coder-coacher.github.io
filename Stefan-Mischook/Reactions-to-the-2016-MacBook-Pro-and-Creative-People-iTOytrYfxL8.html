vlog I want to talk about two things
very quickly number one I am shooting
this I guess about a week or two before
the new macbook pro with these touch bar
at the top goes on sale I think it's
going to be out next week or a week
after something like that so that said
if you seen the buzz on the web
generally speaking people are bummed out
by the price they're bummed out by the
fact that they took out all the ports
and generally they feel that somehow the
sometimes so many internals are kind of
wimpy socially given a price you can get
a lot more computer let me rephrase that
you can get the same specs internally in
many computers for a lot less than what
Apple is charging now this is nothing
new although it seems to be more than
ever anyway that being said you see a
wide spread at least at this point and
negative reviews on the device generally
speaking lots of it even from die hard
Mac fans are saying don't buy a
brand-new one by last year's model
instead you know since you got all the
ports in last year's model you got your
SD card slot you got your USB 3 yayayaya
so I mentioned all that because I'm here
to see how people react a month or so
after it's been released I want to see
once people start using it see how their
accents so keep that in mind because
what I've seen in my existence is that
people really don't like change a lot of
people are afraid of change and it was
just reflexive repulsion to anything too
major most of the time so I'm not saying
that the complaints versus of a Mac new
macbook pros is not warranted it's not
unwarranted I've expressed my concerns
like wat no ports come on now i got a
Mac cinema display and volition
I don't think I'll be able to plug into
macbook pro I know I want to have to get
some sort of dongle so you're looking at
you know 50 bucks for that so anyway
whatever and I remember I said in a
previous video because of software I use
I have to have to get Mac but you know
what given what I saw I'm not sure if
I'm going to actually upgrade I might
just use the old Mac for one key piece
of software they use of databases some
database stuff and it's just use windows
from my video work and have now be done
because I'm pretty happy with my surface
pro 4 it's really good computer anyway
let's close off this vlog about the
creativity of companies you see a
pattern very often where you have a
company if it become successful when the
founders are there but then when the
founders leave or take a backseat and
they let in other people the typical
corporate suits take over venue cv
creativity of the company diminished
quite a bit now he saw it with Microsoft
for instance when Bill Gates left and
bomber took over it was like in this
ten-year rut and it just they just came
out with crap after crap after crap out
the crap and that's because the bomber
was a marketing guy sales guy he was not
a creative person he was not the
technology person now we see Apple since
Steve Joseph's diet has died many apple
fan will say but they really haven't
done anything since then and who they
put in charge steve cook who was a
nuts-and-bolts process guy not a
creative guy not a technologist not an
inventor type not a Steve Jobs CEO and
as a result of that you can see a
similar situation of Microsoft went into
and so that's a problem you have
conformist rice real company and that's
unfortunate situation when you have a
business the creative types typically
don't rise to the top and less the
company goes out of its way to
make these high positions available to
creative types so so we have the cooks
who are not the day came from you know
from the side of Apple where they were
controlling to make sure that the box is
shipped on time this is not exactly a
good person to put in charge of a
company that has to be innovative right
now I'm not taking away from I'm sure
he's really really good at processes Tim
Cook I'm sure is really good at making
sure the boxes arrive at time on time
but in terms of being creative I got a
feeling it's probably not too creative
just a guess based on what we've seen on
the other hand if you look at
microsoft's now when i saw their
presentation last year when i introduced
the surface pro whole surface Pro's for
for instance and other things i saw but
the people presenting were really weird
people strange quirky people and i say
this in the best possible way because in
the strange quickie peoples where you
get all the original ideas is where you
get the creativity so when I saw that
even the CEO is kind of a character and
I see the top product developers kind of
characters they said ah they're going to
come out with some neat stuff and sure
enough you know last year it was really
cool what they've come up this year the
surface studio which is blowing people
away and they're just really doing some
cool stuff hollow lens the augmented
reality product but they're really doing
some cool stuff or Apple after three
years they come up with an oled touch
bar at the top of the laptop that's
because if you watch the main guys at
Apple now they seem to all be they're
nice guys they don't necessarily seem to
be very creative they're not the
creative types you know that's the
impression I get so unfortunately you
see that time and time time time and
time again with companies when to become
big the creative type sir don't make it
to the top because a lot of times the
weird creative guys they're not
necessarily the best snoozers right
you're not this best inside of a
corporate environment unless the
corporation creates an environment
to to make it so that these people can
rise so keep that in mind that's pretty
much my take on that if you meeting
strange people they're probably very
creative and if you want to be creative
my suggestion to you is to expose
yourself to strange things and I would
like read fantasy novels and look at
read wacky stuff to open my mind up to
different ideas and different
possibilities like it's that kind of
like exercising your body if you do the
same exercise over and over again it's
not good for your body so it's good to
expose your budget different types of
exercises you know so you might be run
or you might of course I don't believe
in running run one day and then left
i'll climb a tree another time go biking
do some swimming maybe just some martial
arts but changing it up is very good for
your body and changing up what you
expose your mind to is also very good
for your mind so anyway you pay
attention to see as a comment at
beginning of this vlog after a month or
so that the laptop is out and people
kind of get used to the new porch
structure and that top strip we're going
to see whether or not the negative press
is still consistent you know Apple has
responded already they're reducing the
price of third dongles because I get a
lot of heat right from people saying you
know come on this is a pro tech this is
a pro laptop why don't we have pro
features like an SD card slot and a USB
and all these may get all these devices
right now but depend on these type of
ports so now these maladies poor
professionals gonna have to carry all
these dongles and stuff for me it's not
so much that I use my Mac for some
subservience stuff I also do some video
stuff and I just Park it on my desk and
I just plugged my two displays into it
so the keyboard of keyboards I have a
complaint about the
I've never tried it here people but
people are saving me that's so good i
use a i use a wireless keyboard anyway
so I don't really care but you know
people have legitimate concerns about if
they're running around and they gotta
carry all these dongles in their bag I
gotta plug them in and you're doing work
in the field it's a bag that's a real
pain there's no question about that
anyway that's it we'll talk in the next
