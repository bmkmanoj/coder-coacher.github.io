stories vlog number two in this vlog I'm
going to talk about partners so going
back way back to the 1990s early 1990s I
was I had business unrelated to
technology whatsoever but that business
was the reason I got into coding in the
first place and I'll get into an another
vlog so I had a single business partner
at the time so it was a 50/50 split in
the company we both pretty much started
together although I was sort of getting
it off the ground maybe six months
before he jumped in but he was a
necessary component to the business
because he had contacts in industry I
did not have so it was necessary for him
to be around fast word a couple years
after launch I figured now it could be -
it could be three years later after
launch the company at this point I'm
still small but profitable making money
and we're growing we were approached by
somebody that we knew who was I guess in
their late 50s early 50s it was very
successful had a company worth tens and
tens of millions of dollars so one day I
get a call from him in his from his car
which was a big deal back in those days
cell phones were not common and he says
he said staff come out I got I want to
talk to you about something I said okay
sure
now at this point time we didn't do
really much much business with him
although we're sort of dancing around
the issue about maybe doing some
business with him but nothing
materialized at this point in time so he
come so he comes by my place I get in
there with this there's a big car big
big Mercedes or something and he says to
me stay
I want to do business with you guys so
what I'm proposing to do is buy out half
the company where he would give us a big
cash payout and then we're gonna work
together to build out this business
we've I think it has legs but and you
guys have talent but you guys are young
and with a little bit of cash and some
guidance we can really speed up the
process
so being young and full of piss and
vinegar I was against the whole idea to
begin with because this wall why I got
out the company why am I gonna sell this
guy half only have 25% and then have to
deal with just a third partner who is
gonna fight with us all the time
well maybe it's hard to say so the deal
did not go through it was a bunch of
back and forth and so on so forth but
because I didn't want to lose my I
didn't want to lose my independence
there we go I didn't want to lose my
independence I said forget it the Dinos
logo in retrospect though I think it
would have been a wise deal to make a
couple reasons there are one more you
reasons diversification you see at this
point he was willing to give us a decent
amount of cash so that would have been
interesting to us because then you would
have had a little money off the on the
side traders in the stock market will
tell you that's a good move diversify if
you're I if you have an opportunity to
sell out a portion of an investment and
pocket the money and put it in a safe
place that could be a good thing yeah
you won't get as much upside but if
there's down at least you've made some
money this is number one number two when
you have a far more experienced business
partner somebody's got a lot of money if
there could be an imbalance there or a
gift or nefarious they can push you out
it could be a dangerous thing but it
also could be a very good thing because
a they bring their experience they bring
their contacts and their their ability
to inject cash into a business so there
also is that advantage and number three
by having a third partner you can break
steel as steel
it's stalemates in any decisions that
you may be faced with in the business to
partners with 50/50 ownership to come to
an impasse and a big fight can break out
and it could be a while before you get
resolution where you can go in one
direction or the other but if you have a
third partner then they can break that
he or she can break that stalemate so
that the business can move forward
there's downside and upside to
everything in life and in business so
looking back all these years especially
when I was so young I think to myself
you know what
sure I'll dilute my ownership meeting
sell off a chunk but I get money in my
pocket I'll bring in a highly
experienced and liquid partner liquid
meaning is cash and so we get to
leverage that experience and we also get
to have a tiebreaker vote in the case of
any problems with the business so
looking back hindsight is always 20/20
but this is something looking back I
would have done now the business
continues for a few years until I sold
out my position and I'll get into why I
sold out my position in the business a
couple two three years later for what it
is that doesn't impact on my decision
even if the business would have grown
and continued to grow for many many many
years I still think looking back with
experience dives that would have been
something to consider more seriously as
you remember the businesses you have
today especially your first business
it's probably your learning business and
you probably if you're a serial
entrepreneur you're going to be
definitely involved in other businesses
so yes
you don't got 50 percent or a hundred
percent of your first business that's
fine if you can accelerate your
learnings curve you can inject capital
take some money off the table protect
yourself at such a young age make sense
