this video tutorial I'm going to show
you how to connect to a database and in
this case we're going to use MySQL since
it's the most popular database so it's
used with PHP anyhow we're going to
learn how to connect to a database using
PHP
PHP provides several different ways that
you can use to connect to a database you
have the MySQL package sort of like a
group of functions was it it actually is
a group of functions then you have the
MySQL I extension which is MySQL
improved and then you have PHP p do and
PHP excuse me and pair db.php PDO and
pair DB our object oriented ways of
connecting to mysql whereas mysql and
mysql i have procedural ways although
mysql I which is the improved version of
MySQL does have an object-oriented
package as well or set of functions as
well in this video tutorial my goal is
to get you up and running with regards
to connecting to mysql with PHP so i'm
going to use the mysql method the first
method and this is the first set of
functions that did come with PHP in
terms of being able to connect with
mysql the reason i'm going to use this
package or v set of functions is because
well number one you're going to be sure
that with any host that you happen to be
hosting with will allow you to use mysql
that will be enabled whereas mysql I any
other ones you're never too sure so this
is guaranteed you're going to have
access to this or just about and the
second reason I'm going to use this way
is because this is the oldest way and
it's the easiest way that I know of to
connect to MySQL when you start getting
into PHP programming and you start
getting to perhaps more serious projects
you might find yourself using MySQL I or
PHP p do or something like that although
I think I think that it's going to be
going towards PHP PD
for various reasons I'm not going to get
into now
before we crack open the PHP part of
things first thing we need to do is get
a couple pieces of information about the
database we want to connect to so here i
am in PHP my admin and what i want to do
is connect to the killer database so i
click on that we see at one table called
people i'm going to keep that in mind
later and and we know we're inside a
killer database of course because the
breadcrumbs trail tells us so right here
so what we want to do is we want to go
into privileges we want to see what
users have access to this database as we
can see here we only have one user and
this user is called root and they have
access to the database we know that goes
under grant says yes we know it can do
everything because it says all
privileges let me back up and explain
one thing of privileges and users when
you set up a new database in MySQL so we
have killer over here now but you see as
you can see we have others here I set up
WordPress and so on so when you do set
up a new database you can specify you
can create new users so I could create a
new user and I could tell i could say
okay this user has access to this
particular database here and this user
can do x y&amp;amp;z so i haven't gone into this
before because for a purpose of our
testing i just use this default master
user called root so here's something new
about mysql when you set up a new mysql
system there's a super user called root
that can do just about anything actually
they can do anything although when
you're dealing with a hosting company
you will not have access to the user
called route they'll give you a username
and then that users will be able to do
every
thing you wanted to to any database
which you create yourself anyhow just
understand that to access the database
through PHP you need to know what user
has access to that particular database
and you need to get there so you need to
get their username and in this case
we're going to use root and you get you
get you need to get their password we
did not set up a password for user root
because this is just a local system this
is not a public website it was a public
website that would be just crazy and you
would actually need to set up a password
again your hosting company will probably
set that up for you anyhow so for our
purposes all we need to pick out is that
we want to use the user called root so
keep that in mind and let's now look at
our PHP code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
