at patterns inside a Photoshop and also
how to create your own custom patterns
as you can see here I've got a blank
page which reflects the background in
our layers palette and if we want it to
apply it the pattern to this particular
object I could go to the Edit menu and
say fill the shortcut for it is shift f5
as you can see here the fill will fill
in the area either a selected area or in
this case the entire layer and I can use
the foreground color which would be read
in this particular instance or I could
also choose from any number of this
items down in the drop-down list the
background color any other color and I
can also choose a pattern and as you'll
notice here custom patterns can be
applied as well as some of the default
patterns that you'll see here and
there's not too many to choose from
right at the beginning inside of
Photoshop as you can see but let's just
take an example and choose one of these
matters and say ok and as you can see
it's a repetitive matter and this
pattern once repeated will create a
tiling effect which will tile throughout
the entire document and in this case the
entire layer if you had a selected area
you could do it that way if you had a
vector shape you could also apply a
special effect to that layer which would
be a pattern overlay but we'll see more
about that when we look at the tutorial
on layer styles and effects so in this
case you can see one of these patterns
and how it has been created
but in the next tutorial what I'll be
showing you is how to create your own
custom patterns</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
