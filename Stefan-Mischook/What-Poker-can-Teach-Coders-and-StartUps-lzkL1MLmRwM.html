friends yesterday we've been playing
poker for 15 years maybe twice a month
something like that my up once every
three weeks and don't get me wrong it's
low stakes poker you know if you lose
big you lose thirty dollars a night but
it's just a way for people to get
together have fun we take it easy now
poker ville is a good lesson there's
some good lessons in life to be found in
poker when you play enough hands you can
think of each poker hand each hand that
you play like a new project that you
start our new business that you start
and what you discover in poker that
probability and chance have a huge role
in your success or your failure I've
spoke about this before but I figure it
was take a look at it from a different
point of view so at the end of the day
best laid plans that you can put out
there can all but fail they can crash
and tumble you never know what is really
going to work you can take educated
guesses but you have to understand that
most businesses eighty percent of them
fail for the first couple years and so
with that in mind the strategy is and
it's a good spoke poker strategy at you
you expect to fold eighty percent of
your hands and you talk to or you here
but talk poker players in the world
they'll tell you that they'll say they
fold eighty percent of their hats
because we're not guaranteed to get the
ace of clubs in every hand in fact even
if you do get the ace of clubs it may
not win the hand for you depending what
what other cards pop up on the table so
when you are looking at business you
have to consider that as being one of
the things you can count on what are
those fundamental truths that businesses
have a tendency to fail that's why there
should be tax advantages for small
business because it's such a
ski proposition that said that tells you
what the tactic is the number one thing
you got to do as a business owner is you
have to control your risk you have to
assume that your project may not work so
if the project does not work you don't
want to be in a situation where you're
finished so you want to take risk in
business but you don't want to take
risks that are too heavy risk that will
kill you if you fail and because of that
because you're not sure what's going to
happen you don't know what's going to
happen till you get out there what you
ought to do is you ought to play
conservative with your business and also
play fast meaning you want to get your
ideas out into the marketplace as soon
as possible the sooner the better
because that's how you're going to get
feedback from people and that's where
you're going to learn whether or not
this idea of this project that you have
is worth pursuing that's a huge part of
it I can tell you from experience I've
been in businesses of an 18 I started my
first business with two hundred dollars
to my name not two hundred dollars
invested in the company two hundred
dollars to my name I was a bouncer at a
nightclub and that was I worked four
days a week at the nightclub and then I
would work during the weekdays on my
business slowly slowly building it up I
don't like the idea of loans I don't
like the idea of VC money it's just a
personal thing I'm much more of a
traditional business guy so if you're so
what I like to do is I like to let the
business tell me and dictate the speed
of growth now sometimes you can't you
can't get away with that you might have
to get loans if you're open up a
restaurant or something but I assume
that most of your coders or developers
are looking to be developers and the
great thing about being in the
technology space especially on the code
level is you don't really need much of
an investment at all to get going that's
what's fantastic about it it's really a
democratized market because if you just
willing to put the time in to learn some
coding
then just start coding whether you want
to quote get whether you want to start
your own startup whether you want to
just start building apps as a developer
for other people it's just so accessible
because these days you can get a 45 year
old computer and it will be more of and
powerful enough to do it that said back
to the original premise you never know
when you're going to get that winning
hand you never know when that business
is going to take off so you have two
number one perceive with extreme caution
number to be attentive and aware of what
the market is telling you about your
your product your business what you're
doing and so you can adjust accordingly
and then when you see their success then
you drive home with that particular
product so if you develop three apps the
first appt fails oh well for second app
yeah barely hobbling by you push it push
it's not working okay put it on the side
tribes there when you see the third went
on now it's getting traction now you
have the interest okay pursue that put
your efforts into that but even when
you're a hundred percent right you might
be wrong so one of my old expression is
back going back a long time now I used
to say if you're a hundred percent right
that a particular product or service
that you have is going to be successful
you probably have a ten percent chance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
