I want to speak to you about with
regards to links there are certain times
where you have a lot of information on
one of your pages and you may have even
encountered this situation in an online
environment with someone else's website
they've got tons and tons of content on
the page and you don't want to
continuously be scrolling up and down
back and forth all over the place and
sometimes you can provide links for
people to jump to a different point on a
specific page so for example I provided
you with a sample file if you go to your
dream weaver file open you can browse to
the if you've put it on your desktop the
practice folder for chapter 2 and the
practice folder that came with this
video chapter 2 has a page called
anchors HTML so what I've done here is
I've just got some very basic h2
headlines and some paragraphs that go
with them and they go all the way down
and I've also added these little one
paragraph up at the top which are going
to provide the links to jump to our
different content so how do we go about
doing this first thing I'd like you to
do is to just copy the name of this
first link so let's just press command-c
or ctrl c if you're on a pc then
position your cursor right at the
beginning of where you want to jump to
so right here i'm going to say insert a
named anchor from my common inserts and
if i do that you can just paste in the
name lorem click ok and what you'll see
is this little invisible element called
an anchor if you hit the live view
you'll see that that anchor disappears
when you're in the browser so don't
worry about that icon right now let's
continue we're going to jump from this
link so I'm going to copy it and I want
to jump to this point so i will name
this anchor with the same name as the
link all right then i want to do the
same thing with this so i'll just select
this particular
word i'll scroll down to where we want
to jump to and i'll come here and say
insert an anchor we'll put it right
there notice it's really not doing much
of anything but here you'll see a name
and then ID in that a tag right there
and i'll do the last one just by
inserting my anchor right there okay
well inserting the anchors is only the
first step that's not going to do
anything for us until we create the link
from lorem to the lorem right here now
that's not really much of a jump so we
don't really need that but here's how we
could do it you could just press the
pound symbol and then enter the name or
you could even use the point to file
check it out I want that link to link to
right here and you see that it's the
pound symbol and lorem I select this I
could do the same I want it to jump to
this point let's do it for this one I'll
highlight that scroll down here and
we'll say let's jump to this point and
it does come here and we can say let's
jump to that point so now we've got
links all the way across as it's not
really going to work until you preview
it in your browser so let's do just that
I'm going to save the document and
notice i purposely here have made my
page smaller by taking my browser window
at the bottom here and just dragging it
this way that you'll really get to see
you know the influence of long text if
you have this happening so look if i
press on lorem it jumps to lorem that's
great now i'd have to scroll back to get
to the top if i press on the second link
it jumps to the second headline third
link jumps to the third headline forth
to the fourth and notice it doesn't go
right to it because it can't it's it's
only going to go to the bottom of the
page here right but as you can see
that's a great thing to do now you may
have also seen other websites that have
a back link jumping back to the top just
to show you how you could make that
happen if you wanted to
you have to have like a little letter
here that says top or something like
that and I would select it and I would
have to enter a link or an anchor where
we want it to go so let's make the
anchor first I'll come right over here
just at the top and i'll insert an
anchor called top that's all just like
that and if we want to return to the top
all we got to do is to link to top so
i'm going to copy that now control c
we're going to put it at the bottom
control V of every paragraph let's try
that again ctrl V and I'll even put it
at the bottom of this one so if we were
to save this control s or command s and
preview in our browser now take a look
we've got tops on these things so look
if I jump to the third one we could read
the paragraph go all the way through it
and if we want to jump back to the top
click on that bang takes us right to the
top so that's how you can work within
Dreamweaver and use it to create what's
called anchored links</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
