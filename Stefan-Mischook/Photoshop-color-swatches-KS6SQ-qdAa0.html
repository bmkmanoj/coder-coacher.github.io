palette you'll notice that by default
it's embedded in the same little window
that we saw the color palette just a
second ago but here we can access the
default swatches inside Photoshop and as
you'll notice if I click on any one of
these it'll give me the use of that
color with any of the other tools that
i'll be using with in just a short time
so as you can see here you can pick out
some of these defaulted colors but let's
say you were able to pick something that
you want it that you knew is not within
these defaulted colors and you wanted to
add this particular color to your color
palette you could do so by just clicking
on the create new swatch of foreground
color so if I do that you'll notice here
and when I mouse over these most of them
have names already this one that i just
added said swatch one well if i were to
double click that you'll notice i can
name this whatever i wanted to i could
call this ducky one instead and by doing
so you added this and when we mouse over
it'll have its little name ducky one as
well we can delete swatches just by
dragging them to the trash can and that
deleted it directly also remember that
will be able to access many different
options right here as well and in so
doing you can reset these swatches at
any given time but you can also load
other external swatches that are located
anywhere on your desktop you can save
particular swatches that you've made and
then load them when you want to you can
save swatches for exchange you can
replace swatches but also notice that we
come with a number of default swatches
in here specifically addressing the
print industry and you can see that if
you were to click on any one of these if
you said okay it would replace the
existing color swatches if you say
append as you'll see here it's added
them to the existing color swatches and
now you'll notice I have many many
different swatches available here
for use also if I wanted to for example
i could add some of these Pantone
pastels and notice here there's a few of
them in place now if i wanted to remove
all of these and get back to the
originals i could just say reset
swatches replace current swatches with
the default colors ok instead of a pen
I'm just going to say ok and save the
changes to the current swatches before
replacing them no thank you so now we're
back to the originals that we had to
begin with and we can position that
wherever we want so that's the color
swatches and that's how they work inside
Photoshop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
