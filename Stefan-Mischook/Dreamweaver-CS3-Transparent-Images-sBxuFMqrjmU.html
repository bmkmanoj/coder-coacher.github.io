of things number one I want to take a
look at transparency in images and you
can see how it impacts the page layout
what I'm talking about transparency and
images I'm talking about transparent
gifts with transparent backgrounds or
P&amp;amp;G s anyway once we get into to yo see
what i mean and i also want to go over
the cascade in cascading style sheets
CSS is of course short or cascading
style sheets I'm going to help you
understand the cascading aspect of it
and how this will impact your design
work
so let's start off by looking at our
Center aligned page that we've been
building now we look at a reading man
image here we can see that the white
background here is it's not the best
thing would be kind of neat if the
reading man didn't have this white
background and that's a bit of a hassle
so this is probably a jpay but let me
confirm that let me open up the the
images reading maxi no reading mine is a
PNG but I did not give it a transparent
background because we see this white
here let's swap that out for another
image so we're going to I know that the
video wheel actually does have a
transparent background so all I have to
do is go into the properties panel down
here and the source now that I got no if
I selected this reading man here image
so this SRC this is short for source
field here this basically points to
whatever image you have embedded in the
page so I'm just going to use the point
to file wheel here and I'm going to go
right and select the video wheel see you
would happen so here it is we save that
of course this has a transparency but
not a great transparency because you can
see the white edging here I wonder if I
have a truly transparent image well I
did with the backdrop but this is not
the best so what we're going to do is
I'm going to create an image to fit in
here let me just say this when we
preview this now so it's not the best
right it is transparent because you see
there's no white hole round here but
there's some white here so that's that's
just me being sloppy when I created this
image what I'm going to do now is pop
open an image editor i like to use and
you don't have to use this one this is
an image editor but a lot of people
don't use it's not the most popular but
on windows in my opinion is the best one
out there for simple images
nonetheless it's a great program to demo
what I want to demo so I'm going to do
is I'm just going to create an irregular
shaped like a triangle and i'll give it
a gradient fill let's say we want to go
from local from orange to two black
second adjust it may be that black maybe
want to maybe an off green or something
like this okay it's not it's not the
most beautiful but it's going to give us
an irregular shape so I'm going to save
this as two things first I'm going to
save it export it as a JPEG but also
explore as a gift so i'm going to call
it a triangle gift whatever image editor
you decide to use whether it be
illustrator or a corel photo-paint or
Photoshop the tools although they're
going to look different from this the
principles are the same now when I'm
creating a gif gif export I want to make
sure it's transparent see if you look at
my mouse it says make background
transparent so I'm going to say yes so
now all this area around here is going
to be transparent you'll see what i mean
when i export it so I'm just going to
export that and for demos sake I'm going
to explore it again but I'm going to
export it as a JPEG now reason I'm doing
that is because JPEGs do not that file
format does not allow for or as nervous
would say it does not support
transparent backgrounds so i want you to
see what it looks like without a trans
without a transparent background so you
can see the difference in the image
types so I've explored that as well so
let's take a look at our page now let's
go into Dreamweaver here i'm going to
refresh this so here are new images the
two triangles we created first of all
i'm going to put in the transparent
triangle which is the gif to give flower
GF I'll to pay you're talking to again
I'm going to go down in the properties
panel
i'm gonna select the SRC source wheel
and let's go sleep triangle gift and we
get an error I know why we're getting an
error I'll fix that right now
as you can see i fixed the error had to
do with the way i set up the recording
system here so so anyway here's the
image this is a transparent gif now let
me save the page I'm going to preview
this now as you can see even though the
images regular you see that the
background shows through you don't see
no white block now let me swap that up
with a JPEG remember it's the same exact
image but now i'm going to select the
jpeg here i'll save that and as you can
see with the jpeg the image no longer
has a transparent background as you can
see here right all the white just like
the reading man so that's the reason why
+ select it again transparent triangle
just a gif save that that's why you want
transparent images transparent gifts so
that n p + GS because you would want
this kind of seamless integration of
your images into your pages if you have
a different colored background this only
becomes important if you have an image
that's shaped in an in an irregular
manner and it has a it is not square if
we had a square for instance which one
is a square sunset this is a jpeg
because it's a square image even though
it JPEGs don't support a background a
transparent background you're fine
because as you can see here you don't
need one so keep that in mind that's why
you want transparent images so you can
do the old wall transparent backgrounds
I keep saying transparent image but it's
transparent background so that you can
overlay images and have irregular shapes
in your pages so that the you don't have
that that ugly white border right here
this is a gift because it has a
transparent gif as you recall we created
so we don't have that ugly white block
here but the same exact image saves as a
jpg or jpeg the file
type jpg.jpg ish you know jpg is short
for jpeg jpg is short for jpeg so you
get that now i think it's understood so
I'm just going to I don't know what I'm
going to put it this sunset because it
just looks a little bit better so there
you go we understand the importance of
transparent backgrounds and how they
play a role in things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
