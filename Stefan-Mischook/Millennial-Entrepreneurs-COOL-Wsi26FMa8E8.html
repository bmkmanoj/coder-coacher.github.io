it's about millennial something I've
been observing about that generation a
little younger than me just a little bit
a couple things number one I think
Millennials are likely the most
streetwise generation at least in my
lifetime and the reason I believe that
is is because there's just so much
information out there flowing around of
course you've got different groups again
that people in laughs people in a riot
et cetera cetera and we all have our
bubbles that we live in and that's a
problem but generally speaking I think
Millennials are far more aware of things
we the example for instance a lot of
Millennials are saying that they
question the need to go to college they
question the need to go to university
now questioning traditional traditional
institutions of ways of thinking when I
was growing up it was without a doubt
you went to college she wants you to
foresee like if you didn't go to
university when I was at that age you
were a loser it was like no question now
because of the student loan debt because
the way the job situation has evolved
this too Millennials are getting pretty
wise and they're saying well maybe I
don't need to go to university maybe
it's over it's over stated so that's
something very new something I didn't
see when I was growing up that's for
sure another interesting thing maybe
more interesting to me is that I was
reading about how even younger than
Millennials that I know that generation
they asked them whether or not what are
the professions that they would want to
aspire to as adults now traditionally
it's like actor a sports star and I
don't know musician those are the big
three but for the first time ever since
they've been doing this quiz survey they
said entrepreneur was number one
entrepreneur this blows my mind because
when I started my first business when I
was 18 I started working out over 17 but
I went when I was 18 it was a very
unusual thing these days though
Millennials they're thinking about
becoming entrepreneurs that's like it's
it's at the top of the list this is of
kind of a new thing so I think just for
that reason alone I feel a certain
respect with that because I know I guess
it reminds me a little bit myself but
having that that awareness so look at
hey you know what maybe I should start a
business maybe that might work for me
that's a very interesting point of view
that I've never saw and that is my
generation over a later generation so
it's very cool but Millennials are aware
of this now and I think again it's
because of the free flow of information
shows like sharks tank and Dragons Den
and all the IPOs so people are seeing
all this stuff for the first time in a
big way where it was it was a little bit
black hat a black box if you will this
kind of stuff in the past so that's kind
of a new thing now don't get me wrong
I'm not saying getting a job as bad some
people will do fantastic at jobs and so
people thrive in that situation and you
know all the people that you see on TV
they'll work for somebody else
there they are all employees all those
sports stars on TV you know they are all
employees of course this is the they're
the top of the best of the best of the
employees and they're not examples you
should necessarily aspire to because
they're super rare it's like a lottery
ticket winners something I tell people I
tell people my business course that most
people who become wealthy financially
independent they do it with small
businesses that earn good money year
after year after year and it just builds
and builds and builds and builds if I
think about it if you're making four
five six seven ten times more of an
average person so that's not like sports
star money that's not some rock star
money but it's really good money but
let's say you're making five times what
the average person is begging with in
five years you can earn as much as
somebody else would take twenty five
years so essentially their entire lives
the average person
they have to work what you just made in
five years as just a low-key
entrepreneur think about that in five
years you're basically and if you save
you manage your money properly invested
properly you've probably pretty good for
retirement maybe you do a little bit
better maybe two six seven times the
average person all sudden you can get
into a retirement situation within a
four years right you see what I mean so
it is it's an interesting thing about
the Millennials they're much more aware
because of the amount of informations
out there so they see things that we
didn't see in previous generations if
you are millennial watching this though
don't discount experience and knowledge
because as you are learning as you're
developing yourself some things may not
be obvious to you but that somebody my
age can't see an identifying you can't
see identify yet not because you're dumb
it's just because of experience there's
something that experience reveals to you
over time and I remember it happened to
me a long time ago in martial arts where
I had been doing martial arts for
several years at this point at this
point in a story about nine years but
the mistake I made as I would jump
around different styles I didn't take my
skill set I didn't make it deep enough
because I would I was an intermediate
level guy judo intermediate level in
Japanese Kyoko she an intermediate level
Taekwondo intermediate level catch
Campbell etc etc so one of my coaches
one of my teachers told me sighs this is
stuff you know you've been trained for
nine years and you know all the stuff
but you're still just an intermediate
level guy he said you got to take one
style and focus on that and get really
good and then it will raise your game
and then you become an expert in all the
styles that you've done and it didn't
quite compute for me at that time it
really didn't get it because I didn't
understand how important fundamentals
were at that time anyhow long story
short I decided to take a leap of faith
I decided to to listen to this guy
because I figured this guy has been
training for 25 years he must know what
he's talking about he's a good fighter
too he must know what he's talking about
he has a perception of real
of things but I just don't have yet
because my brain is miss it's not mature
enough yet your brain keeps developing
maturing up until I think you're mid to
late 20s I forget thee I think it's
about 25 or so so keep that in mind so
if you're millennia yes I think that you
guys because of freedom all this
information you know much more aware of
previous generations but you still have
to give yourself a chance for your brain
to mature and be willing to accept that
you know what I may not be right about
this because I'm still a little young
which is a good thing by the way I would
give away all my money if I could be 20
years younger
oh no problema like this it's so many
doctor said yeah it's gonna take all
your money stuff everything you got will
give you a pill and it's going to it's
gonna make you 20 years younger I would
do it without even hesitating I would
write and do it because you can always
make more money anyhow alright that's it
I hope this vlog is useful it's just
something I found personally very
curious interesting to watch and I guess
maybe my psych background that makes it
interesting to me to see how the culture
changes how the people change and I
think it's going to become even more
sophisticated over time because of the
huge changes in technology that are just
around the corner but I'll have to leave
that for another vlog ciao guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
