is stefan miss Chuck with killer sites
calm and in this introduction I just
want to give you an overview of what the
course is about so basically I'm
imagining that you know pretty much
nothing about WordPress and my goal is
that by the end of a course you'll be
comfortable installing configuring and
using WordPress for your typical website
in the course we're going to run through
the whole process of the installation
and configuration and you can understand
all the basic operations of WordPress
including things like how to add new
content making post uploading images
you're going to learn about installing
plugins activating deactivating them
learning about themes which are the
wordpress templates how to install the
themes how to configure of themes
understanding how the whole theme system
works in WordPress beyond that I'm also
going to teach you how to manage
WordPress in terms of managing comments
spam what you can do to help eliminate
your spam and a whole bunch of other
things as well again by the end of the
course you should be fairly comfortable
working with WordPress and using it for
your typical website the course itself
runs about two and a half hours so let's
take a look at a couple of things first
of all here is a look at the video files
that come with this course now you start
with the beginners wordpress install
part 12 so that teaches you how to
install wordpress on your server as a
bonus we have the lamp install in here
which are two new videos that teaches
you how to install the wamp server which
is something that you is free that you
can install on your computer so that you
can actually install and play and learn
wordpress without having to have a web
server this installs the web server and
everything that you need on your local
machine so beyond that once you've done
the WordPress installs you just have to
work your way through the WordPress
configurations from part 1 up to part 13
and that's pretty much it
and along the way you know the videos
are pretty manageable or 15 10 minute
videos 15 minute videos so it's easy to
pause stop and play of em rewind so it
or we jump into one here and here it is
and we can scrub the WordPress videos
I'm playing this in Windows but these
videos oricon mac windows 7 windows 8
windows XP doesn't matter and you see
we're just going through the whole
process on this pop up another one
little head again here we're working
with the template and we're just
configuring things and understanding how
the whole wordpress thing works so there
you go I've included in the package it's
a quick little article I wrote just a
couple pages the difference between
Dreamweaver and WordPress a lot of
people have problems with this so I just
figured I just throw it in and finally
here is actually a few of the basic site
now this is very basic and you get
dressed up to look much nicer but this
is the basic site that we will be
working on thanks for picking up
beginners wordpress and i'll see you in
the videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
