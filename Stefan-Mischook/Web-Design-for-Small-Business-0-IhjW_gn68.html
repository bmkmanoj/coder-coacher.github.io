going to reproduce a very old podcast
series that i put together maybe 10
years ago and it was web design for
small business owners that was the title
web design for small business owners and
the whole point of this podcast was to
help small business owners who are
thinking about putting up a website to
help him get a good understanding of the
big picture all the different options
that are out there and how they should
be considered within the context of
putting up a website so things have
changed since I did that original
podcast what I'm going to do in this
vlog is to go over the main points a 4
2016 2017 at the same time I'm going to
experiment with a new style of video
presentation which we're going to start
soon as this live presentation I'm doing
right now is over so I'm going to jump
right into it where I'm going to be
drawing on screen and let me know if the
drying on screen and my handwritten
annotations if they contribute to the
presentation or if they heard it I am
just trying new ideas and I really
appreciate the audience at YouTube
audience or give me your feedback all
right let's jump into it this is a web
design for small business and we're
going to cover all kinds of subjects the
small business owner should be aware of
when they are looking at looking at
getting a website live on the web or
getting a presence live on the web
thanks for watching i'm going to call it
the small business podcast
this video is actually based on the
small business podcast that I created
over a decade ago essentially it's a
discussion about what you need to know
as a small business owner when you want
to get your a site live on the web or
some presence on the web so I figure
it's been a long time and it makes sense
that I go over a few things so we're
going to start with some basic subjects
we're going to talk about blogs CMS is
and forums let me write that properly if
our ums okay forums so blogs CMS is and
forum so blog I think most people do
what a blog is today a blog is basically
a site where you have regular articles
posted and their date ordered that's a
blog the most popular blogging software
out there something called WordPress and
it's used quite a bit for small and
large companies it's free it's pretty
easy to install and you can be up and
running very quickly building out a
great looking website where you have
articles that you can write and they can
be published by the system it requires a
little bit of setup and if you want to
get into it you're probably going to
need some sort of mini course that's for
sure so with blogs you have a few
options in terms of how you handle a
blog you can do something called self
mmm let me try to write that again you
can write self-hosted now a self-hosted
blog is basically you have to get your
own domain name you're going to rent
server space and then you gotta download
the WordPress files the wordpress app
that you need to run wordpress and then
you upload this to your own server
this is an overview I don't expect you
to understand all the details about this
all you need to know is when you are
creating a blog you have two ways you
got number one you get the self-hosted
option and number two you can go to
wordpress.com where for free they'll
create a blog for you where you don't
have to stop install anything but the
problem with that is that you're going
to be hosting your site on their website
wordpress com so let's say your business
was on tulips not that this is available
you have a domain name called tulip
start wordpress com now the problem with
using a hosted solution on wordpress is
that a lot of the good names are taken
so chances are you won't get tulips
wordpress com and be you don't own the
site when you're hosting with wordpress
they own the site so you might have some
restrictions there so you're you are
exchanging convenience for total control
you lack control when you use a hosting
true wordpress now i just mentioned
wordpress WP is short for wordpress i
just mentioned wordpress because it's
the most popular one out there there are
other options out there like blogger and
stuff when it comes to creating a
website for your business you should
have a dedicated website because besides
hosting on wordpress com you can also
have a presence you can have your pages
on facebook you can have a twitter
account you can have instagram it's all
kinds of different options for you if
you are into videos or you could do
videos for your business you could set
up a YouTube channel or a combination of
all these things again this vlog this
video is here to just give you an
overview ok so we've covered logs our
blogs using WordPress you have three
options by the way for blog
that you get a few options you have to
WordPress is the most popular then you
got joomla that's a jo om la joomla and
then another one was very popular is
called drew pal there are other apps
that allow you to create blogs allow you
to create sites on the web where you
have a management control panel and
allows you to easily upload new pages
and images and video and so forth the
most popular by far is WordPress though
and I think probably number two is
joomla there are pros and cons each one
I'm not going to get into it in this
video but for most people I would just
suggest using WordPress you're probably
going to have the most luck with that
app it's the easiest one to work with
the easiest one to install the most
popular so there's a whole bunch of
resources like templates and prefab
websites and plugins that you can use
with WordPress is pretty powerful
although it does take some work a CMS
CMS is short for content management
system now a content management system
is a blog but much more wordpress joomla
drupal are content management systems as
was being blogs they kind of blurred the
lines between the simple blog and a
content management system these days I
just wanted you to be aware of what this
is most people refer to content
management systems simply as a CMS we
look at our list finally we have forms
now we've all been to farms where you
can post questions get answers as
communities in the old days a lot of
websites would have forums and I've had
forums on killer sites calm and they
were very popular in the earth day but
I've since retired them because now what
I find is that people will tend to want
to interact on the platform of their
choice so for instance so you have your
website whatever your website might be
dog
dog grooming calm or something and you
have dog grooming services so instead of
having a forum on your site you may
interact with your visitors or your
client or your prospective clients on
maybe you have a youtube channel youtube
where you'd put up videos about your how
you groom dogs or something these are
just theoretical examples you may
interact with people on facebook some
people actually prefer to disengage with
you on twitter for instance so there's
different there's other platforms as
well so instead of having a forum on
your own website which you have to
install it and configure it and
management and make it popular a lot of
people would just rather engage with you
on some platform that they tend to go on
for me it's mostly YouTube a little bit
of Twitter I do have a facebook presence
but i don't really do much on facebook
myself that's just me all right let's
talk about the next subject i'm going to
change my ink color because i don't like
this red domain names so what's a domain
name a domain name it's simply a web
address and it's your website address so
for me I have for instance studio
web.com I have other web addresses
another big one my first one while not
my first one but my first one in
technology education was killer sites
com and now some big domain names is
like move maybe I should be typing these
out facebook.com then you got google com
these are all domain names are simply
web addresses so when you want to get
your site on the web you're going to
have to buy a domain name you buy them
from companies that are called
registrar's and there you have to
register your domain name
and the cost could be anywhere from nine
bucks a year too much higher now you got
some people will try to scam you they'll
try to rent your domain names never
rental domain name because they could
take it away from you anytime unless you
really really need some juicy domain
name because you're going to see them
out there people will buy them and then
try to sell them to you for very high
dollar amounts could be thousands tens
of thousands or much more keep in mind
that domain names are really valued
mostly by the traffic they generate and
just because they have a good name just
because you might have a domain name
called her own business calm i don't
know if i spelt that right take away man
doesn't mean that it's any good thing
about this site is that a good name
would you paid would you figure people
with type it in google no Google is a
good name because we know it now because
it's it's a very good sites got a great
service best search engine in the world
now so keep that in mind I wouldn't be
paying huge money for premium
domainnames it's a waste of time waste
of money because some people try to try
to charge you a lot of money for these a
premium domainnames these premium
addresses sometimes they may be worth it
to certain extent but you got to be very
careful about spending thousands because
at the end of the day you have to build
up for domain it's got to have something
on there to give people a reason to
visit your site so I wouldn't be
spending money on on very expensive
domain names that you see out there the
rules of a good domain name number one
short number two easy to spell and
number three easy to remember so long
domain names problematic if you had a
domain name called my super fabulous pet
grooming service com not very good
but pet grooming New York that's a good
domain name short easy to spell words
that are not complex those are the rules
hard to do these days because so many
domain names are taken up next one
database driven websites this is an old
term comes from 90s some of you may have
heard it basically these are websites
where the pages are connected to
databases so the information can change
over time sites like YouTube Facebook
Google your banking site bees are
database driven websites so many
websites these days I think the majority
are database driven every wordpress site
if you remember WordPress is database
driven so you do you create database
driven websites with languages
programming languages like PHP which is
the most popular then you got Python you
got Ruby Java and several others this
requires programming this gets into web
oops this gets into web app development
you're developing apps short for
application citing stuff so now you know
what a dynamic database driven website
is e-commerce what's that that's selling
on the web selling product services add
to cart that kind of stuff think amazon
etc that's all ecommerce you can do that
on your own sites pretty simple there's
many many solutions out there and
essentially you set up shopping cart
systems where people can pick them buy
products and services from you added to
cart and in a process then he hit send
it processes them usually
the cards you got different companies
that allow you to take credit cards and
process them the biggest ones out there
paypal there is a stripe and are many
many many others paypal stripe can very
easy to implement but you do need
programming with stripe but with paypal
you can get by without having to do any
programming they have some tools that
make that easy next subject web
templates these are just prefabricated
prefab websites you buy them again free
wordpress for instance as many prefab
templates on WordPress they call their
prefab web templates they call them WP
is for WordPress they call them teams
and these can be used to instantly
create your site building a website from
scratch is not something a lot of people
have to do these days because you've got
all these great templates you should
leverage templates are very cool
something is something to consider for
sure web hosting what is this this is
basically hosting a website on a web
server a web server simply a computer
that's connected to the web 24-7 if you
want to get your own website up you need
to buy web hosting web hosting is
inexpensive you can be as little as it
could be as little as four to five
dollars a month hosting it could be
thousands of dollars a month but for
most companies are starting out four to
five dollars a month for a web hosting
is reasonable and this will get your
site up online so you can have the world
see what you do finally was close with
the website work full web design
workflow web design
workflow what is that that's the process
of building site I'm going to go over
very quickly so you get an idea first of
all you plan the site in terms of the
subject what's got to be in there then
you diagram it what pages you want so
you might do something like I push this
up you might go every website has a
homepage switch my I penny or so you're
gonna start with the first page you got
your homepage and then from the home
page you might have and about us I'll
say about us we have another page will
be lateral products
under the page might be
I'll just say shopping cart shopping you
get the idea so you design a page design
a flow in terms of the skeleton of your
website right and then once you've done
that then you're going to step number
three is to figure out the content what
do you want in these pages right so
because you need to know your content
terms of the text images and so forth so
you can start building menu items menus
in your home page and all your other
pages and figuring out your content part
of it and then you're going to go you're
going to figure out the page structure
how it's going to look whether it's
going to be a one column or it might be
a four column website who knows there's
all these different options that's where
templates can come in handy you can
start checking those out finally once
you figure that out you start either by
template that's an option
and then if you have some basic HTML and
CSS skills you can start modifying the
template you can hire a web designer and
get a wordpress theme or template and
then once you sort of figure all that
out then you got to start you going to
buy poof and it seems like a lot i'm
getting tired just talking about it buy
a domain name we talked about that
before it'll buy a domain name and that
will cost you as I said anywhere from
nine dollars and up I recommend you go
for a basic domain names between nine
and twenty five bucks and that's pretty
much it once you get your domain name
going and then finally you got you by
hosting
when you buy hosting your hosting
company will give you the necessary
information so you can upload your
website whether you'd be a template or a
custom job and then you'll help you to
get live on the web with the domain name
you just buy so this is an overview of
the whole process it's already 22
minutes I'm gonna stop here I hope you
