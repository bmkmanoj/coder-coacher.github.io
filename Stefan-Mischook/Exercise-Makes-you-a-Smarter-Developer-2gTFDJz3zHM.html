before coding this is a weird title I
know we are terrible let me tell you
something something I've noticed I've
been exercising now last few weeks where
I'm biking around a lot biking up and
down these steep hills and walking more
the some push-ups and chin-ups yeah yeah
yeah yeah so by a means I'm no exercise
not at this point in time I used to be
way back big time but not now
unfortunately but what I discovered
surprises me since I've been exercising
you know what I just described I'm
finding that my cognitive capacity is
increasing I'm finding it much easier
for me to think much easier for me to
write much be easier for me to do these
videos I'm just less spaced out so
that's a very interesting thing so if
you're going to be coding and you're not
exercising our regular basis if you want
to maximize your coding capacity I
strongly suggest that you do two things
well number three things actually number
one do exercise every day do some
exercise consider the exercise as part
of as important part of your daily
activity as anything else really really
it is especially in the long term number
two drink lots and lots of water lots
and lots of water lubricates the body
cleans the body out probably helps you
what you're thinking - I would imagine
and number three get some sleep
you know I find from instruction from
actually my Chinese doctor who helped
cure me of my blood disease he he
advised me that humans are not nocturnal
animals we are you know daylight animals
although the proper term is the opposite
of nocturnal anyway we're not meant to
run around at night you know we're not
bats right we're not bad
Lions were meant to move around during
during the day and he was telling me
that over time my memory is telling me
this over time if you stay up late past
midnight continuously it it weakens your
body weakens your mind over time now
this is a guy who is a Chinese herbalist
also medical doctor as well so take it
for what it is but I have found
especially as a mentor damn it'll age
now and when you get older you're going
to find that you're actually much more
sensitive to your environment food sleep
alcohol if you drink I'm not a big
drinker but you know what I mean so I
find that when I get up early in the
morning now a much more alert the entire
day and and I think it's probably always
the case but when you're younger you're
full piss and vinegar you got a lot more
energy so you can deal with these
deficits if you will you can deal with
the fact much more easily that you
stayed up all night your body can bounce
back because you're young so you're not
as aware of it but you're probably still
being negatively impacted because if
that theory is correct we are not
nocturnal animals we're not bat yeah our
bodies are in tuned to being up during
the day so keep that in mind
it probably messes with your hormonal
balance and stuff like that if you're up
all night and sleeping in the day and I
can tell you now that if I get up late
in the morning
10 11 I'm messed up the entire day I'm
literally it's like my ability to think
is lessened a much weaker unless much
less energy it really impacts me so
that's it anyway whatever you do
exercise drink lots of water and you
probably be be a more effective
developer whether you're actively
developing or learning how to write code
I hope that helps have yourself a great
weekend this is a Friday Friday vlog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
