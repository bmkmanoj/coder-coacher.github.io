sites so in this quick little video blog
I want to talk about web frameworks what
they are gonna give you a couple
examples of some popular web frame or
frameworks that are out there and and
why you should use them so a web
framework is just basically a bunch of
code put together into libraries that
you then can use to drop into your
websites and you really simplify the web
design process so to skip ahead you
should use web frameworks now there are
a lot of them out there and some of them
are complementary some of them compete
some of them overlap in terms of the
functionality that they provide so keep
that in mind so let's actually look at a
couple popular ones that are out there
now and this is what we got here so
probably the most popular one at this
point of time so Nicole bootstrap here
it is and basically this is a framework
made of jobs made up of JavaScript and
CSS and it allows you to create
responsive websites amongst other things
but that's the most important thing
aspect of this framework in my opinion
it allows you to easily create
responsive websites so what's a
responsive website a responsive website
is a website move that resizes itself is
responds to the size of the device and
the screen that happens to be viewing
the website so if you look here on my my
smartphone hope you can see it okay so
this is a very old smartphone you stacy
is what I don't have you guys can see
this or not this is a studio this is
studio web and you see that screen the
whole site has responded and reflow so
it reads pretty nicely inside of this
this phone it's pretty good and if I
flip it over it resizes itself again as
well so it's kind of cool and if you
look at the site I just pull it up hold
on
studi web so you look at the site here
this is how it is in full screen and you
notice that you have no menu here on the
side and oh it just resize it for you so
this is built with bootstrap so you can
see the site will resize based on how
much real estate has you see how this
there's no button here when I watch what
happens this button appears and becomes
a drop-down menu this is all provided to
us for us rather by the bootstrap
framework so everything resizes the
images resize it takes care of all about
all things flow if we watch the to the
pictures of the two guys here they may
get stacked right and that's all
function of a bootstrap so that's just
one framework you have another framework
very popular some people are called this
is jQuery one of the fundamental
frameworks or libraries a lot of people
say you know it's a library and a lot of
other frameworks actually use jQuery for
instance bootstrap uses jQuery in the
background and this is another library
but this is a JavaScript library library
that really simplifies JavaScript and it
provides a whole bunch of UI widgets as
well it's very very powerful that's just
another one here's another one angularjs
this is one that it makes allows you to
create to really enhance this can be a
functionality of your forms or HTML
phone so looks more like something
something like a web form which is a
microsoft done that thing basically
allows you to easily make your web apps
act more like rich client like normal
desktop apps won't get it to hear this
is not a course on angular and are many
more so here's another javascript
library react this is a library for
creating user interfaces again it
competes with i guess bootstrap to a
certain extent i haven't used it my
friend of mine a friend of mine is
showing me this recently anyway i just
want to show here's another foundation
this one's a direct competitor to
bootstrap the most advanced a responsive
front-end framework
III don't know this one's any better or
not you know some people will prefer
this one some people who prefer
bootstrap it's hard to say at this point
but I know that boosts shop is far far
in a way much more popular now here's
another framework but this is a
JavaScript framework but it doesn't work
inside the browsers actually no jazz is
actually a server-side framework it's
actually there to allow you to use
JavaScript to write JavaScript on the
server and it's kind of like a
replacement for PHP although you can use
a beside PHP or ruby any of these other
competitors anyway you got you got the
idea web frameworks again they're there
to simplify the process because they
provide all this boilerplate code all
this structural code that you as a web
developer shouldn't really be writing
you should be reading your app and with
a framework bootstrap any others they
take care of a browser ink about ability
issues so you may have to do something
in IE and something else for chrome and
something else in firefox that make your
layout work but bootstrap takes care of
all that for you and that's the way it
should be so with all these frameworks
and there many more by the way which
ones do you choose which do you have to
learn them all what do you do as a web
developer you don't have to learn them
all and I've seen this before in the
Java world back in the late 90s early
2000s we have the same type of thing
happened we had many many many different
frameworks out there to choose from and
a lot of more competing as well and why
do you have all these competing
frameworks sometimes it's for financial
reasons sometimes one group of nerds
feeling it something should be done one
way and another group of nerds feel that
they should be done the other way it's
kind of like bootstrapping foundation
are very much competing with each other
I can't say which one is better and from
my experience I have to say in most
situations usually usually these
frameworks are pretty much neck-and-neck
meaning that yeah in some ways bootstrap
might be better than foundations and
foundation some ways may be better in
bootstrap so which one should you you
choose generally speaking on this you
have very specialized a very special
case a very special website where you
you know that foundation will be much
better general generally speaking I
would be going with the most popular
ones simply because they they will be
most accepted and the most popular ones
tend to survive although that's not
always the case you know things will
come in out of fashion even major
technologies like flash flash used to be
ubiquitous used to be everywhere
announced it's pretty much a niche
product so I would choose the big ones
so today in 2014 in October late October
it's Busia up in jQuery are my first two
i would first learn bootstrap then learn
a bit of jquery and i'm not saying have
to become an expert but just know your
way around them and maybe a little
angularjs after that you know it's up to
you really if you got these three you're
pretty well set up again you don't have
to be an expert just know your way
around a little bit so you can leverage
them or maybe if a project comes up you
know okay angular could help us here or
jQuery could help us here well I have
found what we're finding is but we're
using bootstrap for everything though
whether it be web meant org or mother be
studio web com we are using bootstrap
because it just really makes web UI
creation creating these flexible
responsive websites very easy to build
so from the perspective of an old-time
web programmer such as myself man it's
so much easier today so yes after you
understand your basic HTML and your CSS
your css3 html5 you should get into
these somebody's web frameworks you'll
have to learn them all but I would
definitely start with bootstrap and then
move into jquery yeah let me just finish
off this video with I'll take a look at
this
this is something has really freaked me
out Bailey something called a
supercluster now each of these little
white spots here represents a galaxy
that solar system but a galaxy now our
galaxies is within this redspot it's
actually much smaller and I babe you
know you look at all these other
galaxies and this is actually a map but
i think was NASA these scientists were
able to actually accurately map out the
super cluster is basically a super
cluster is a cluster of galaxies a whole
bunch of galaxies with each of these
dogs being galaxies look how small the
Milky Way is relative to all these other
galaxies and then you can see the on the
edge of this photo you have all these
other superclusters over here a couple
more here one here here you can see how
trivial earth is our existence is
relative to the rest of the universe I'm
trying to launch as other phones a
bloody thing would do it there we go
just to give you an idea this is
fascinating to me so you got the planet
Earth here and then you can see our Sun
and Earth here relative you know this is
all I think accurate in terms of space
and you can see our solar system here
right here relative to neighboring solar
system and then you see where we are so
you can't even see us the spec here
inside the Milky Way galaxy and here you
see the Milky Way galaxy relative to
other galaxies we zoom out even more
cheese white spots or galaxies there's a
supercluster again we saw it close up
before and this is an observable
universe this to me is fascinating and
yeah so just put some perspective on
things yeah bootstrap is important and
web development is important but you
know just sing it of superclusters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
