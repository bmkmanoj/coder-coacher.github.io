be looking at is working with css3
transitions now there's a wonderful new
feature inside of Dreamweaver that
facilitates the use of css3 transitions
but in order to prepare for our look at
that particular feature I think it's
best if we examine some of our existing
css3 transitions and see how they work
you'll notice that if you're still
working with the same files as last
chapter chapter 9 what I'd like you to
do is to go to manage sites and we're
going to create a new site called
chapter 10 so just give it that name
then I'd like you to point to the local
site folder which is found inside of
your source files and the source files
should point to chapter 10 now since
we're going to be looking at both
transitions and spry elements inside
chapter 10 you can choose the chapter 10
folder as your main site so now that
this is our local site folder we'll save
this click OK and click done now within
the killer app section you'll find a
start and finished folder well the one
that we're going to be working with is
the start file so it's not so much the
index page that I'm concerned with at
this point but rather let's take a look
inside of the pages folder and within
there you'll find a number of files that
we've been working with in the previous
chapter let's double click the contact
page not much going on here pretty much
the same as what we saw before however
let's just take a quick look in live
view and see what this one looks like
simple contact page and simple bits of
information however what we're going to
be targeting are the grey quote boxes
that you see here in the aside section
and we're just going to make a simple
little transition for them but to begin
with let's also examine the fact that up
to this point you probably notice that a
number of your links that we've been
working with do have
bit of a transition between the
foreground first color that we have and
the hover state color that we have
notice that the hover state also says to
underline the link and in here that only
appears and as it appears it seems to
fade into view well in order to get a
better sense of how this is done let's
take a look at our CSS file layout doubt
CSS and if you do take a look at that
you'll see that if we were to scroll all
the way up to our navigation section
you'll see that main nav a link has a
number of simple bits of information now
when we were discussing in the previous
chapter on creating horizontal links we
really just defined all the information
up to this point displaying it as a
block text decoration padding text align
and so on however I've also added this
simple little comment in here and this
should say css3 transitions and you'll
notice that there is the inclusion of
some information that you may not be
familiar with at this particular point
well let's examine it a little bit
closer you'll see here that the a links
inside of main nav are all set to begin
with a css3 transition and what this
means is inside of WebKit browsers or
Mozilla browsers or Microsoft browsers
or even opera browsers there is the
property called transition now all of
these do say pretty much the same thing
but we do need to add the prefixes
before the transition property and
you'll notice also that at the very
bottom there is a transition property
that does not have a prefix and this one
is a little bit of forward thinking that
is saying eventually when these prefixes
are not needed we have the transition
property to fall back on well let's
examine what exactly it is doing within
the transition property the value is
saying all properties this is what I
want to begin
you animate so in other words I'm not
specifically targeting width or height
or background color or any of those
elements I'm basically saying let all
properties have the ability to animate
and transition the next value is 350
milliseconds and this is a value that is
dictating the speed of the animation now
this value can also be set in seconds
but this particular example says 350
milliseconds which would equal about 3.5
seconds the next value here says ease in
out now ease in out is really how the
animation is going to take place in
other words does it just take place as a
normal animation with the same speed the
whole way through or as in this case it
will ease into its animation in other
words slowly enter that animation and it
will also ease out of that animation so
the speed of the animation will slow
down at the end of the 3.5 seconds that
have been defined another way to think
about the ease in out value is by
imagining the USS Enterprise and the
Star Trek TV series is entering into
warp and doing so rather slowly and then
quickly going into warp and eventually
coming out of warp slowing down as it
eventually comes to its resting point
something else that's added here is zero
seconds
now the zero seconds value here is
really just to determine whether or not
there is going to be a delay for this
particular animation and in this case we
don't want to delay we want the
animation to take 3.5 seconds or 350
milliseconds in time and we want that to
happen as soon as we hover over this
value now that's how we get the second
part of this animation transition to
work first of all the css3 transition is
placed as you can see here in
the first state of our link in other
words the a link looks like this and it
has the animation possibility what's
gonna make that actually happen is by
adding the pseudo class of hover to this
a link now it's not unusual for us to
see the pseudo class of hover associated
with links but it may be something new
to you to understand that the hover
pseudo-class can be placed on just about
anything so any definition that you can
define in CSS you'll be able to put a
hover pseudo-class on it and what that
means is the original state looks like
this and is ready for an animation but
the hover state dictates what exactly
the animation will look like in its end
state so a link here with the css3
transition information here is the
beginning state of this transition and
the a hover pseudo-class is the ending
state of the transition so originally
this is the color at the end this will
be the gray color at the beginning there
is no text decoration at the end there
happens to be an underline on the text
decoration so this is what we do to
create css3 transitions and as you've
been seeing up to this point that's how
we got these links to do what they're
doing right here now you might be
wondering does that mean I have to come
and write all this information every
time I want to create some kind of css3
transition as you'll see in the next
video I'll show you how to use
Dreamweaver cs6 is new css3 transition
feature and it's going to make your life
a whole lot easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
