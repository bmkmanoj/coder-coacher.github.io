our last video tutorial was a web page
as we've defined right here with a
number of IDs and as we can see here we
have the universal selector the body the
wrapper inside the wrapper we have the
header nav on the left hand side the
main text in here and finally our little
footer down at the bottom and if you
remember when we preview this in our
browser this is pretty much what we got
and at this point what I've done is I've
got background colors inside here
specifically to show you where the
different areas are defined so this blue
area up on top is my header here's my
nav here's my main here's my footer and
the gray area that we see here is the
background color that we applied to your
wrapper and the wrapper wraps around all
of these things so everything is looking
okay up to this point with regards to
how the layout is concerned but the text
looks and you know pretty lousy so what
we're going to do is we're going to
style some tax and we're going to deal
with some of the issues that will arise
because of that now if you remember one
of the things that we had done with this
flow based designed is to define the
fixed pixel of the wrapper at 900 we
give 200 over here and 700 over here the
rest of what was left over so we got two
and seven so we did this because we
didn't want to have any margins to be
sort of impeding the success of our
website depending on different browsers
so at the very beginning we took the
universal selector and we said margin
and padding zero okay now because we've
done that I am reluctant to take this
box and actually add margin and padding
to it if you remember correctly when we
were discussing the CSS box model and
you can go back and review that
particular video if you don't remember
it anytime we add either margin or
padding to an element for example like
this box that will increase the width of
that particular element so for example
this box is 200 if I actually adds
information to the box with regards to
say padding and we'll put some padding
to put this text against the edges or
away from the edges rather if I did that
then that would change the width of this
box so instead of being 200 if I had 10
and 10 on either side it would be 220
and that would throw off our entire
design now I could go around that and
say well okay instead of 200 since I
know I'm going to have 20 pixels I would
just make it 180 well that would work
but you also have to remember that the
margin and padding may throw things off
depending on which browser you're using
so oftentimes will avoid doing that to
the actual box itself but rather the
content inside the box instead is what
will have the information applied to it
the padding or the margin because of
that then all that's really going to
happen is your design will stay fixed
the way it is margin and padding won't
be affecting it but in different
browsers the text might be a little bit
closer to the edge or a little bit
farther from the edge depending on which
browser you're in that should not have
any adverse effects on your actual
design so that's why what we're going to
be doing now is styling the content
that's inside of your IDs so let's jump
back to Dreamweaver and we'll start
doing that perhaps with the hello world
up here at the top so notice here is the
header now like I said I want to get
that object off the edge of the header
but in order to do that I'm not going to
target the header div what I'm going to
do is target the contents inside of that
header div so for example I know that
this is a h1 inside of header so let's
see how we can apply something to this
that will not affect the other H ones
inside of Maine so check it out this is
the beauty of working with your specific
IDs select header because I want the new
element to appear right underneath it
keeping all of these things together is
useful so I'm going to say new CSS style
but check this out because I put my
cursor inside of the h1 up here and
header it allows me to choose a selector
here it says compound based on your
selection so be written something like
this
side rapper you've got an ID called
header inside header you've got a h1
that's great but we don't need to be
that specific so will be less specific
and really all we need to target is
inside header h1 so all of the H ones in
header okay so what I want to do this is
go to the category call box and we're
going to apply a little bit of padding
on the left hand side of this object now
at this point if I do this great moves
down over that's fantastic but let's
also consider something else here's a
trick how we can put this directly in
the center of our particular div let me
show you what i mean is div if you
remember is set to 150 width height
excuse me so because of that we can go
to the type area here and i could set
the line height for this particular
object to be 150 if I do that notice it
gets bang applied right in the center of
that particular object now that's a
useful trick to remember whatever the
height of the object is you could set
the line height and it would always put
it right in the middle of that
particular object that's something that
you might have to use a little bit later
on with links and other things like that
so you know I'm just going to keep it
simple I'll say okay let's put it in
verdana let's make it actually rather
large as you can see here 32 is pretty
good but hey it's our headline here so
what about 52 can we make that look
pretty interesting that's really quite
big as you can see there so maybe 42
would suffice alright so if you're happy
with that I can make this all uppercase
I can make it white because we got the
white background should be fine hey I'll
even show you that we can make it italic
as well so there we go we've got hello
world affected because not only because
of what it says here with our header but
look what I did by accident I may have
inadvertently created a style and
internal style and if you remember
that's because when you create a new
style sheet here it says this document
only we need to connect it to stop
that's CSS which is what we really
wanted to do let me see if I could take
this and actually drag it and I was able
to notice I took what was written inside
of my let's go to split screen inside of
here my head section and I just dragged
it in here that means it's now written
in style.css you see here next to source
code there's style dot CSS look header
and then header space H 1 which means
any h1 inside of header is going to look
like this so that's exactly what we've
done here fantastic so let's go back to
source code and notice I still have that
extra little bit of code up here well
look if we select the style and just
trash it as I've done there it's
instantly removed from that head section
which is great so now that we've got
that done we're going to come back in
the next video and when we do we'll
style everything that's inside of the
main area in a very similar fashion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
