a very short vlog a couple reasons am I
got a lot of work I gotta do and so
we'll just get to it so first of all I
just want to address a couple of
questions that were put to me on the big
YouTube okay number one what separates
the great coders from the not-so-great
coders the great coders right very
simple very simple code keep that in
mind if you're at that stage or your
intermediate level coder and maybe you
think you're advanced and you're writing
super complex code that's really tricky
to understand it and you're going wow
I'm really smart because well there else
how advanced my code is that's not good
cold good code is simple simple code
that gets the job done that's the
difference between the advanced coder
and the intermediate level coder is that
the advanced coder realizes that they
got a right simple simple code you want
to write code that your cat can
understand so that when the next coder
comes along to work on your project or
you come back to your projects expunged
from now because you're gonna do some
refactoring you're gonna do some updates
the Col won't be so complex that you
have to spend half an hour trying to
figure out what you were trying to
accomplish so keep that in mind I always
strive towards simplicity in your code
always try strive to make your code
fine-grained as in tiny greens as in
code that is very specific in the tasks
they do don't write objects you know so
most of us are going to do our
object-oriented program but let me say
that again I assume most of us will be
doing object-oriented programming and
yeah so in object-oriented programming
you can create your objects or your
classes and try to keep these classes
very specific in terms of the tasks that
they perform don't have monument
monolithic object objects huge objects
that do ten things don't have huge
methods or other words functions that do
many things try to keep everything
fine-grained very specific very
specialized you
if you do that couple that in with
proper naming conventions and you've
gone a long way to producing really good
apps next question
mistakes in cold let me tell you even if
you're the the da Vinci of coders you're
gonna make continuous errors in your
code the coding is a process of making
mistakes it is and you have to expect to
have to go back and revise refactor look
at my video on refactoring I talked all
about that you you have to expect that
as part of the process when I sit there
to write code it's actually exact same
process I use to when I write articles
or when I wrote my book I start from a
and I go to Z as quickly as possible
I again from it from the beginning to
the end so I'm writing code I want to
make sure my I want to write my whole
app and you know some of the parts of
the code along the way is total garbage
throw a coat but the intention is just
to get the whole thing kind of working
get it going and then I go back in the
second iteration and I start fixing
those problem areas and that and then a
third iteration is to polish and then
you release and this is how you have to
look at the coding process you will
never be able to write an entire app
perfectly first time around it's just
not it's just not the way it works
because we're doing very complex things
like when you're writing advanced code
when you're writing an app even a simple
whether it be iPhone app or Android or
whether it be a dynamic website dynamic
website see that's the old 1990s
terminology coming out
we used to call web apps we just calm
dynamic sites or database driven
websites all right that's enough of a
history lesson anyway when you're
writing your web apps or you've seen
your normal apps these are complex
things that were writing here much more
complex work than just about any other
profession
in the world that's why I think you got
a high burnout rate with coders because
they go too hard and then a few years of
burnt out and that happened to me to be
honest with you that happened to me I
just got so tired of coding for a few
years I didn't want anything to do with
it it was like just picking up an
article reading an article about coding
was just like it was like it was
terrible and you know I was like it's it
was kind of like know if you you eats
you eat some food and you get really
sick and then you you barf and then I
for rest of your life maybe or at least
four years as soon as you smell that
food you get sick right that's how
coding was for me for a while because I
overdid it that's why I tell people and
I did a recent video on it too when you
are a coding try to do three to four
hours a day of hardcore coding meaning
really intense working on your your
you're working on your your methods and
working on your objects and debugging
and debugging can be intense and then
the rest of the day spend it on higher
level things like architecture planning
for tomorrow planning for next week take
it easy take it easy
and so you need some downtime also when
you code I recommend coffee because it's
been proven in scientific studies that
when you drink coffee especially with
older people they drink coffee their
cognitive capabilities temporarily I
think there's like one or two hours
we'll shoot up 50 percent or more
so you become smarter essentially you
become smarter
another thing I would recommend that you
do is get in shape when your body is in
shape your brain is in shape it's all
interconnected right so I try now not
that I'm in very good shape and that's
my bad I try now to integrate every day
some light train even if it's 15 minutes
you know walk around for half an hour
walk walk outside take a walk for half
an hour do some light yoga or something
you know and drink lots of water I'm
telling you this may seem like houses
have to do with coding stuff you
be asking yourself has everything to do
with coding because if you're healthy
your back doesn't hurt and you're in
good shape
you're gonna be a much more productive
coder you're gonna get much more out of
your work time so yeah so that's it
don't I some people were expressing
concern that you know I'm making
mistakes my coding and I don't
understand everything that's normal you
know when I first started coding and
especially the first year so there were
a lot of times I'd be putting down code
I wasn't exactly sure how or why that
code worked
oh he knows that it worked when I did it
and I was able to produce good apps
eventually you come to understand all
these things but again what happens
though of course as you get more
experienced you forget things there's a
lot of stuff I knew in the past I forget
now now of course if I go back and I
just review things all it'll come to be
and within an hour - for sure it's not
much quicker but you can't your brain
has a limited capacity in terms of how
much information it can store so that's
why I always emphasize the people cost
and trade on the base six the basic
principles are what is going to carry
you through in your coding in your small
business or your business development in
your diet and health habits I'm telling
you it's always the basics don't let
yourself get caught up and you know and
all these little things Sparkle around
you what's a sparkle now angularjs how
important is is angularjs it can be
important if you want to do a single
page web apps but depending on the type
of work you do it may not be very
important at all so should you be all
concerned about having to learn angular
no well you know if you know your basics
the basic language is HTML CSS
JavaScript so when you're doing web some
server-side language PHP for the
freelancers I recommend PHP then Python
and then Ruby or Java you know for
server-side coding yeah why don't you
got that and you know those those basics
you know how to build will talk about
web apps you know how to build web
you understand the architectures you
know what the header bases are you know
how to talk to database you know crud
operations you know the basics you know
about validation fact occasion security
these are the basics I know it's a lot
it's a lot trust me you know if I were
to sit down and look at authentication
now off talk my head what method I would
use I wouldn't be exactly sure now
because things have changed over the
years well I got a pretty good idea but
again you don't you don't need to be an
expert in this stuff all you need to do
is understand the basics of it and then
if you're doing web apps you would break
out your MVC framework your web app
framework so on PHP probably be using
laravel or Symphony on Ruby of course
you'd be using rails on Java you
probably would be using the spring
framework see I think about Java Java it
is how much of a nerd I am because I did
most of my coding I would say 65% of my
coding in Java it holds a special place
in my heart I actually have an emotional
connection to that language because I
did so much coding in Java in the late
90s early 2000s it's it's kind of silly
it makes me anyway so yeah it you have a
spring with Python Django so whatever
MVC framework that you use they're gonna
have the authentication libraries there
for you so it's gonna be taken care of
so if you know all these basics do you
really have to be so concerned whether
or not you know angular yeah you could
learn angular in about two hours all you
need to know about angular now is what
it does and why you'd want to use it and
maybe play with it for a half an hour an
hour that's it and when a project comes
up you can say to yourself okay I need
to use angular here this makes sense
then you become you spend an extra three
four hours and you learn your angular
but you don't you don't have to as a
developer as a coder have to know all
these things it's impossible you're not
gonna learn all HTML all of html5 and
css3 every nook and cranny of these
languages so what to learn the basics
yeah that's all you need to know now to
learn everything about Python or
PHP not gonna learn bootstrap all jQuery
all angular and all react
no it's not it's not possible you
especially as a freelancer and I really
speak to freelancers those freelancers
have to be a bit they have to be a
little bit jack-of-all-trades so that
when they get into a particular job
they'll be able to make a decision a
coders decision a developer's decision
in terms of what technology to bring
into that particular project so keep
that in mind
but try not to sweat it like I said I
literally had forgotten much more virus
I still remember today and it's a good
thing there's a lot of stuff that I I
forgotten I had to push out of my mind
because I had to I had old techniques in
my head like you know I remember when I
was writing my book last year I had to
admittedly I had to forget all these old
JavaScript routines that we used to use
utilize rather to create dynamic menus
and stuff like that because you could do
it all now on css3 and frankly because I
kind of lost touch a bit I was surprised
at how capable css3 was and with css3
based animation so forth
that's great so you know don't worry
about forgetting things at the end of
the day all these languages all these
frameworks are just tools they're just
tools if you've got a good understanding
of architectures and how to build things
then you can adapt those basic concepts
into any newfangled language any new
framework and use it very effectively
and and at an advanced level as I said
before and I'll close with this
if I had a project that I was doing in
PHP or Python Django or PHP laravel and
if I had a choice if I was doing PHP
laravel if if I had a choice between a
beginner in laravel PHP you have a years
experience versus a super advanced
Python django coder
developer who's been coding while super
advanced advanced guys been coding
Python Django for six seven years I
rather take the guy with pythons Django
6-7 years because I know he's likely he
or she is likely very advanced in terms
of their understanding of the basic
structure of basic methodologies in
terms of how to build apps because you
take this guy with five to seven years
experience in Python Django he or she
will become very advanced quickly with
PHP laravel like within a few weeks
they'll be they'll be super good
advanced or as you take the guy or the
girl who's only been coding in peach be
Maryville for a year so it's gonna take
them a few years to catch up to this guy
who's been coding for six seven years so
the language the framework is not really
important it's a mastery of the basic
concepts the basic techniques alright I
hope you found this useful
and finally if you have any questions I
really look at the questions that you
post may have tried it I can't answer
them all but I really tried to look at
them to you know and I know answer them
in vlog so I can alright thanks very
much
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
