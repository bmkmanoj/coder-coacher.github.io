from code for just a little bit because
what I want to do is I want to look at
JavaScript from 20,000 feeders if you
will I want to look at it from a
distance and help you to understand some
basic aspects about the language don't
worry I'm not going to go into too much
new detail but it's important that you
understand something about JavaScript
its basic structure moving forward
because it's because it's just going to
make it much easier for you to take in
the new stuff and by the way we're just
a hop skip and a jump from getting into
some practical JavaScript like form
validation and stuff like that so let's
just jump into this and I think I think
you'll see how important it is to learn
so what exactly I want to teach you is
well the title says it JavaScript Oh Oh
p oo p is short for object-oriented
programming and what I want to tell you
is that javascript is a object-oriented
language so that's a mouthful and in
about two minutes you can understand
what that means
in front of you is this really basic
diagram that I created to help you
understand why JavaScript is called an
object-oriented language if you think
about that sentence it's telling you the
JavaScript language is oriented to be in
the form of objects oriented meaning you
know it's like it's like sexual
orientation some people are gay some
people are straight javascript is
oriented okay it's not the greatest
analogy but you get the idea javascript
is oriented is designed to be made up of
a series of objects so pretend this gray
box here is the JavaScript engine is
JavaScript and pretend you know again I
got these little objects here what I
created so let me just drag a man so you
get the idea what I'm talking about
cec javascript is actually made up of
all kinds of independent objects and
each of these objects you see the little
gears here have their own set of
functionality and their own jobs the
things that they can do and that's why I
got little gears so an object may have
many different tasks many different
functionalities think functions and it
can already get out just a couple so
javascript is basically laid out this
way it's a the program itself is built
up by having a series of discrete
objects basically independent from each
other and these objects each have their
own set of functionalities or set of
functions
so if I was going to make an analogy of
this let's pretend that JavaScript was a
McDonald's for instance a restaurant
inside the restaurant you have a bunch
of people and what's let's you know
let's call these people objects so okay
I know it's insulting but did you know
for the sake of the analogy so let's say
this object was a cook and this object
was a maintenance guy and this object
was a cashier so like the cook object he
has several or she has several
functionality several jobs that they do
they make Big Macs or they make french
fries or they make I don't know they cut
onions up same thing with the with the
maintenance guy he has or she has a set
of functions for instance they may be
mopped floor or change garbage bags and
of course the cashier is you know you
know they operate the cash so they have
functions like you know sis el Big Macs
or sell fries I don't know you get the
idea if you think of it that way
you think of JavaScript as being a giant
engine and inside that engine you have a
whole bunch of independent little
engines but do all kinds of different
things so in JavaScript we've looked at
the document dot write function we can
pass if your call and document is an
object inside of JavaScript so let's
look at some of the JavaScript objects
so you get an idea of what I'm talking
about
so here's a little diagram that I put
together and you can see the JavaScript
hierarchy here it's it's a hierarchy
like pick up a military hierarchy you
have like you know you got your generals
and you get your Colonels and your
majors and so on saving with JavaScript
you have a whole hierarchy of objects
and some objects contain many other
little objects so for instance if you
look in the window object this box
here's an object inside a window you
also have a frame object history object
location object document object remember
that and inside of the document object
you have a whole bunch of other objects
so you can see the hierarchy as we go
down the go down the tree they call this
a hierarchy tree remember when we use
the function document dot right now
document dot right let's put it let's do
this properly so we put our little
braces now remember we know Wright is a
function because it's got the two braces
in front here two brackets so document
we I just touched on that before but
document is basically a reference to
this object here the document object so
when we type out document in JavaScript
we're telling the JavaScript engine we
want to use the document object and we
want to use its write function we don't
see the write function under document
here because I'm not listing the
functions inside of all of these objects
these are just a set of objects so this
is a document object and I we know
because I told you that there's a write
function inside of document the document
object happens to contain a whole bunch
of other very useful functions and the
reason I've made it bold here is because
it's probably the most important object
in the entire JavaScript hierarchy
video is that javascript is a language
that's made up of all kinds of little
objects in each of these objects you
have all kinds of functionality each
object is responsible for one or many
different functions and I taught you
about this one the document.write
function and you notice the little
period here I'm going to jump ahead you
see this little period here between
document dot and then we have right so
this dot tells JavaScript that we are
looking for something a function inside
of the document object you can think of
this dot as an arrow as a they call them
programmers call them pointers in some
other languages they actually use an
arrow kind of like this so now you know
why there's a dot when we wrote document
dot write you know why there's a dot
because when JavaScript sees the dot it
knows what we're looking for the
function right and in we know what
JavaScript knows we're looking for
function because we put the curly
Britian the braces here rather it knows
we're looking for a function in the
document object I hope that makes sense
really to jump into this a lot more in
future videos so I think this will
clarify this for you if it's a little
hazy
so again just take away that JavaScript
is basically a language made up a whole
bunch of little objects that live inside
the JavaScript engine and each object is
responsible for hit a whole bunch of
jobs a whole bunch of tasks a whole
bunch of functions that it has
