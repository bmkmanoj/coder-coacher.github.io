elements in place and all of our divs
are set up we've got our rapper div on
the index page that's centering our
design and we've tested it a couple of
times inside of different browsers and
seems to work out just great one thing
that we can probably do is to perhaps
take this opportunity to talk about how
things are going to be not only centered
on the page but the fact that you can
add a background image and still have a
different background color and that's
one thing that I want to talk to you
about at this point so let's just move
on over to photoshop for a second and i
did that on the on the macintosh by
pressing command tab if you're working
on a pc alt tab will do the same thing
and as you can see here we're back with
our type 3 sliced layout but one thing
that i do want to make mention of is the
fact that we had our slice up here with
the headline graphics and as you might
remember we did not use the entire 900
pixel canvas however what I want to do
now is to actually go about creating a
slice that we're going to use as a
tiling background image so let's take a
look grab the slice tool now I don't
want to necessarily interfere with the
slice that's up here at the top so we
can still go down on the bottom of our
design and create a slice here as well
now you might be asking well how big is
this slice supposed to be and what are
we going to do with it notice I'm going
to open up my canvas just a little bit
more technically speaking one pixel will
be more than enough I mean it's okay if
you do two or even 10 or 20 pixels it's
really not that big of a deal the issue
is however that technically speaking as
I mentioned we really do only need one
pixel so I'm just going to zoom in on
this and the only reason I'm going to
zoom in at this moment is to choose the
slice tool double click this and rename
this particular slice so I don't
this long name it doesn't tell me
anything about the graphic that I'm
using so we're going to rename this what
are we going to rename it well every
background image that we're I use in any
of my web designs and in this particular
one and remember we're just doing a very
simple one here so we don't have very
many background images in particular but
nevertheless I'm just going to call it
BG underscore body if in future I get
rid of that plus sign because remember
even though this is an image it still
adheres to HTML naming conventions which
means no special characters that plus
sign would not do any good for anybody
so BG body I just want to take the
second to mention that if I did have a
much more complex design we would more
than likely be using a lot of different
background images but this is just the
BG or the background for the body so
that's what I'm going to name this and
as you can see it's pretty easy because
there's really only one color that's
here so if you remember our rules from
before you know joint photographic
expert group is a great thing to do when
you're saving photographs o.jpg
photographs and anything that has simple
amounts of colors easy rule of thumb try
it as a gift first and you're probably
going to get best results so let's go to
file save for web and devices I'm going
to press spacebar and just move my
canvas so that I can select this and
only this slice down at the bottom
you'll notice by default here it's
saying oh yeah let me save you a JPEG
but I don't want a low quality JPEG I
mean it's fine it's not really going to
cause that much problem but what I do
want to see instead is gif and looking
over here at gif you'll notice that even
if the gif is suggesting 256 colors the
maximum number of colors in the color
table notice the color table will only
produce two colors and even though this
default one here is not actually giving
us any color we
have an anti alias on this so it's
really just the one color and you'll
notice even that low quality JPEG if ten
percent did not give us the results that
this gif does 149 bites it's really
nothing in terms of download speeds so
I'm going to press on save and make sure
we're saving to the right spot and
you'll notice on my desktop there's the
type root folder do I have to enter into
the images folder actually not really
because it's going to by default save to
an images folder so let it find this one
because if you're inside that images
folder then and you don't make any
changes here it will just produce an
images folder inside of your images
folder which is not really a good thing
so the slices I will say not all or even
all the user slices I just need the
selected slice in this case so I'll
click Save and now we can return well
actually we'll give it a second there
you go so here we are back in Photoshop
and we'll come back there's some other
things that we're going to be doing with
this you can take the opportunity to
save your file at this moment if you
wish and I'm going to go to Dreamweaver
so here we are in Dreamweaver and let's
see a couple of things well first of all
I'm going to switch back to photoshop
before I do anything else in my swatches
palette i'm going to activate the
darkest color that i happen to have here
and i'm going to click once on my color
picker and copy this color command C or
ctrl C on a PC so switch back to
Dreamweaver now let's try a couple of
different things for example I'm going
to here we are in our site window let's
just take a look inside here and you
look BG body it's saved properly in the
images folder that's fantastic now in my
CSS styles here's the body definition
I'm going to ask you to edit this body
definition and you'll see right now that
it has that light gray default color
well check this out i'm going to come in
here and i'm going to paste in the dark
color and we can apply that and say oh
no look what
into our design it looks terrible
because everything that was showing
through from the body was coloring this
background not to worry because as you
imagine as you remember we do have a
background image which I will find now
in the images folder under BG body gif
will choose it now if I were to repeat
this on both the X and the y what would
end up happening is as you can see here
everything is repeating and it makes the
whole body the same color not exactly
what we want rather we want to repeat
this thing only on the Y meaning only on
the y axis right so not horizontal but
rather vertical and if we apply that
what you can see and you might have a
little bit of difficulty here because
i'm using a 1024 screen is the fact that
there is this little background color
here but there is a tiling background
now why is it only showing the
background color here the dark color
it's because we have not centered this
background image and that's something
else you can do with background images
is define their position so here under
the background position for the X I'm
going to say Center it so horizontally
always have it in the middle of our
design background position why well
we'll give it the default it starts top
down now if we apply this you can see
that not only on this side is there the
background color but you'll also see it
on this side so let's click OK and see
what we've done so far if I preview this
in Firefox it's going to ask me to save
the file and take a look we've got a
little bit of color over here a little
bit of color over there and this tiling
background image is creating sort of the
illusion that we have our wrapped images
inside of this sort of container and as
you can see if I move around the actual
browser window not only does the wrap or
maintain its centered abilities and
capabilities but we also now can notice
that the object is centering the
background in
as well so that's really nice now we've
got something that works a little bit
more in keeping with what we wanted to
see you could test it out in all your
other browsers to it's usually a good
idea to do so and what we see in Safari
is pretty much the same thing that we
saw in Firefox so that takes care of our
tiling background image what we're now
going to do in the next video is to make
the links that are on these buttons
actually linked to individual pages and
we'll go about preparing those pages
inside a Photoshop in just a second when
we return</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
