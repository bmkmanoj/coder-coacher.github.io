able to cut and paste the mail function
in here for you guys to see so as you
can see again it's it's much like string
word count in that you have the name of
the function in this case it's mail and
you got the following you got our
bracket pair that gives you a spot to
actually insert your arguments now with
mail function in that it's a more
complex function it required a few more
arguments as you can see we actually
have three arguments for the mail
function it needs these to operate now
what you should take away from is is
that functions that have multiple
arguments like Mayo each argument is
separated by a comma here so you got
argument number one argument number two
and argument two or three of course the
last argument doesn't need a comma if
you actually put a comma dare it's going
to give you an error so we've learned a
few things in our introduction to
functions we've learned the structure of
a function its name followed by the the
bracket pair and you got to end it off
of a semicolon and we've learned that
functions can return a value so in the
case of word count its value is the
number of words it's counted in your in
the argument that you provided right in
the sentence that you provided sometimes
functions will just return a true or
false value true or false and weather
returns are true or false value depends
on whether or not the function was
successful in doing what it's supposed
to do and this can be very useful on
your PHP scripts now we're going to
demonstrate how this can be useful now
so with the mail function when it
successfully sends a mail it will return
true and if it doesn't successfully send
the mail it will return the false so
what we're going to do is we're going to
watch how we can
use that inside of an if statement
inside of a conditional statement again
this is something we've looked at in a
previous video and we can see how we can
make decisions based on whether or not
the mail function has diets job
so what I've done here is basically
created a variable did underscore sand
and its credit is variable to capture
the result that the mail function sends
back to us once it's tried to complete
its task and in this case in this case
rather to send an email and when I've
done afterwards of course is just a
simple echo to show us what the variable
did send what it was what it captured
from the mail function so let's launch
the browser and see what happens so we
get the value of 11 of course is equal
to true sometimes in PHP when a
functions is going to return true or
false whether or not true yes I was able
to do what I'm supposed to do or false I
wasn't sometimes it will return a true
and false as in the as in the words true
or false and sometimes it will return 1
or 0 1 being true 0 being false it
really depends on the function and you
have to just you'll get to know this on
a function / function basis that's one
of the little inconsistencies in PHP and
it's kind of a wet and wild language PHP
is and that's because it was developed
over the years on a on i like to call it
on a nerd to use basis so there's in
consistencies in the languages in the
language into p and PHP itself and
that's one of the reasons why people
nerds anyway will complain about pH
people from time to time but to me it's
not such a big deal so what I've done
here in this step is to actually use the
did send variable inside a statement and
if this of course is true if it results
in one Nia statement will the PHP will
print out this text here mail sent so
let's just demo it real quickly of
course mail sent so we know that the
mail has been has been sent in the
function has been successful what you
need to take away from this is that
is that you see how I'm able to use
functions and your return values inside
by for instance in two ways I can use
them to populate variables or I could
also use them within the context of
content conditional statements to do
stuff to make decisions sometimes
variables will return excuse me
sometimes functions will return a lot
more advanced information for instance
there are functions that might change
all your texts from lower case into all
caps and then you could use the result
the return in in your pages you can echo
it out you can do all kinds of different
things you can even use text from one
function and insert it into another so
for instance right here string word Cal
basically returns the number 11 so I
could take it involve those number five
since there's five words in this
particular sentence I can do that and
stick it in here in the mail function so
this last argument mail function
remember we have three arguments
argument 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 separated by commas
this last argument i know because i know
the mail function actually writes
whatever's in here to a body of the
email the body being in the main party
email that people see this is the body
of the email this is the the title that
are the subject of the email rather and
this is to whom you'll send the email to
so in here I'm actually grabbing the
result from one function in sticking in
another I can even do it directly like
so and that also works as well so it
really depends on certain functions can
work well with each other depending on
the argument so that one function needs
versus what another function spits out
to you now PHP is very very very very
flexible in that it does its best to try
to sort of Wrangell if you will or
angle functions to work with each other
and to work with whatever scripts you're
writing so this could be a good a good
thing and in some ways because things
work more easily but any other ways it
could lead to kind of strange hard to
find bugs in your code I'm not going to
get into this now because it's a little
bit more advanced but it's something
that just to keep in the back your mind
you may run into things later on and
perhaps we'll cover some examples in
another video anyway so let's take away
I think we've covered the basics here
let's take away from this that we
functions can be used to feed other
functions functions can return values
for instance results like word counts or
it can just return true or false in the
case of functions like male where you
just want to know whether or not it
worked or not for instance like in this
scenario perhaps your script you don't
want your script to move for unless you
know for sure that the email is sent out
to the user that's just once an hour for
instance so I'm sure you can start
coming up with other ones for instance
there's a very important function in PHP
one that launched excuse me to connect
to the MySQL database something we'll
cover soon enough and it's very
important that you you get messages
messages back from the functions whether
or not you've actually connected to the
database if you haven't why see that's
another thing sometimes functions
they're in such a way so that if they
don't work for some reason the return
value will be something intelligent
something intelligible that you can use
the debug to figure out why something
didn't work perhaps with the MySQL
function you didn't give it a proper
username and password something and in
the function will return results saying
in proper username and password so just
something to keep in mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
