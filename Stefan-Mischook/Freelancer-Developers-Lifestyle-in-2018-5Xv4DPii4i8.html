just the first part of this vlog for a
balcony because people are always
curious to see how things look so I'm in
Montreal here this is Mount Royal I live
in a place called ultra mall and it's
pretty cool because the park is right
across the street right around the
corner there are interesting person
lives right near me is an heiress to a
billionaire just a couple blocks away
Leonard Cohen is buried just up the
street so it's kind of a cool area and I
I grew up you know I grew up but I went
to school around here University well
you know 25 minutes away and I figured I
move back here at this point in time in
my life it's kind of cool in this video
I want to talk about the lifestyle of a
freelance developer whether it be web
developer or whatnot and we'll touch on
a little bit about the entrepreneurial
lifestyle I'm going to give you some of
the pros and cons what to expect and the
personality type that you may you have
to have really to get into that for me
it's largely about personal freedom and
choice even where I live I'm in a
situation here where I can get up and
and travel whenever I want to without
too much
planning needed again that's one of the
advantages of being entrepreneur being a
company owner you have that flexibility
to move on to travel whatever you want
to so that's kind of a cool thing so
anyway so here is Montreal is my view
it's kind of cool
okay so let's talk about the lifestyle
of the freelance developer whether it be
a web developer or any type of
programmer really or web designer the
number one thing that you get out of
being a freelancer is personal freedom
you have the choice when to work when
not to work how you want to work what
clients you want to pick up with type of
jobs you want to do now of course in the
beginning when you are first
establishing yourself you're going to be
under a little more stress than you
would be otherwise unless you like that
kind of thing or unless you set it up
properly where you transition into the
freelancer lifestyle I'm going off on a
tangent here so generally speaking let's
assume that you've you've gone through
the initial humps or you've gotten the
proper training and so you move into the
freelancer career path properly so you
don't put unnecessary stress on yourself
and when you do that properly you get up
and running pretty quickly and meaning
that you can shave a lot of time off of
becoming exist a successful freelancer
if you just do it properly anyway I
don't know that makes sense but let's go
on so we're going to talk about the
lifestyle so you have a lot more freedom
but that doesn't necessarily mean you
have a lot more time especially in the
early going when you first get out there
because when you first get out out there
as freelancer I assume that many of you
are going to be junior developers or
budding developer so you're gonna have
to learn your craft you would have to
learn your skill one of the things I
keep hitting on is that as you become
more skilled as a developer you're going
to develop better workflows and better
ways of dealing and managing your
clients this is going to be a big part
of your ability to make your more money
for your time so let me deal with one
thing at a time so let's talk about
communication skills I touched off on
this and in other videos a big part of
managing the project is being able to
manage your clients manage what their
expectations will be and manage the
process in terms of your relationship
with the client so I'll give you one
example so you go and you meet your
client when you sit down and you go over
the project with you they tell you what
they want for the project your job as a
developer is to set up a reasonable time
timeline so that so that they didn't
expect so that they know what to expect
in terms of when you're going to get the
work out so let's say you're developing
a basic web app so I can tell you right
from the start that between the middle
stages of the project where you set up
the basic look and style the site and
the web app you set up the basic
functionality when you have that basic
stuff in place versus having the very
final live production version of the web
app there's gonna be this big gap
typically because that last 10% of the
project will take a lot of time simply
because you're dealing with back and
forth with the clients
there's going to be lag time in in the
communications and they're gonna try and
change a bunch of things a lot of the
times that's where you get this thing
called few feature creep feature creep
where they got something basic there and
then they're like wow maybe we should
have the app do this and maybe we should
have the app do that maybe and a
beginner
freelancer who would make the mistake of
agreeing to these changes so when you go
in there in terms of managing
expectation you have to document pretty
much what it is
you're going to deliver and you have to
make it clear to the client that we we
have to be certain what we have with
some only minor changes are going to be
put into place based on the needs of
project because otherwise that I make a
wild and you have to set this up right
from the get-go you have to say to us we
have to be sure that this is what our
target is the price is based on this
target the timeline is based on its
target and you remind them every time
you add or make changes you're extending
the time you're increasing the cost
potentially so you have to create that
expectations in their mind so that they
are aware of this before the project
begins you don't want to start
addressing these issues in mid-project
because then you can run into some
conflict so the other thing has talked
about and that's just one example I
could go on but just to give you a
little taste another thing I talked
about was workflows now workflows you
can look at it from the point of view
just in terms of how you manage your
clients you know do you go see them the
meetings or you do Skype calls or you do
phone calls or emails a combination of
the two you have to set up a good
workflow in that regard where you're not
always on the phone wasting time with
them you're not in there all the time
talking to them you go in there you set
up the initial meeting you get you you
get their specification from them you
send them a document a nice clear
document lots of bullet points paragraph
bullet point paragraph very simple to
the point with the outline of your
project what the work is going to be and
then when you they agree on it an email
then you you even get a digital
signature or you go in one time and you
get them to sign on that on the paper
they get a copy you get a copy so
everybody knows what the expectation is
that's the main point of a contract is
to set to make sure everybody's clear
and everybody is reminded of what is
expected out of this
temporary partnership you as the
supplier as a developer them as a client
and this is very important because
sometimes memories will get confused and
later on so you have it on paper that
they agreed to x y&amp;amp;z less likely you're
going to have issues so when you're
managing the client you got to be sure
that you set up a relationship where
they're not always pestering you not
always expecting you to come in and see
them for instance have friends of mine
who have a contracting business and when
are the biggest gripes now with their
main clients are always expected to come
in to go see them every week and it's
like every two weeks it's just it takes
a lot of takes up a lot of their time to
set up the meeting to go in to travel
there etc etc so you have to manage that
expectation right from the get-go so you
don't want to waste your time of course
there's a lot more deal detail you get
into here but this is just a vlog so let
me get back to work flow now in terms of
your own internal work flow meaning your
development process as a beginner you're
going to be learning the whole thing so
you're gonna be figuring out the best
way to manage the coding of a project
the actual writing of the software and
the configuring of things and so forth
so in the beginning you're going to be
charging less because you're just gonna
be working much slower but as you get
more advanced you settle on a particular
framework that you're going to use so
for instance I'll just use PHP as an
example you decide you're gonna be a PHP
developer you can develop web apps for
small businesses you say on PHP I'm
gonna go what laravel cuz laravel is the
best to date so once you really know
your way around laravel and how its set
up and how it works you'll get pretty
good with one or two projects then when
you set up the next project it'll be
like because you won't have to figure
out how it's done
and I'll give you an example to help
when I was actively developed in
development as a freelancer in the late
90s well have 90s in the early 2000s I
had my own MVC base for him
in Java I didn't like the frameworks but
existed at the time and so I just wrote
my own it was something it was service
JSP and poggio base servlets is the I'm
trying to avoid the jargon as the part
of Java that allows you to do all the
web app stuff
JSP works with servlets JSP allows you
to more easily create the visual aspect
of your web apps and then pojos is an
acronym for plain old java beans so
where the community was going to these
very complex java objects called ejbs I
didn't like that architecture at all
this is during EJB one or two just an
issue later Java fans I said forget it
my architecture is gonna be Pocho play
no java beans combined with JSP and
servlets i won't go beyond that in the
technical details anyway so I had my own
framework and after several projects I
had written this thing up
so I had my my database layer all done
the generic might my UI layer all done I
had my the basic structure that I would
apply to just about every app done so I
used the 8020 rule when developing my MZ
MVC framework 8020 rules but 80% of the
work will be from of your time will be
wasted will be on 20% of the app so I
wrote my MVC I designed many of the
scene to not try to do everything but
rather just to solve that back that key
20% of it took up 80% of the time I
don't that makes any sense anyway so I
created my MVC framework once that was
in place and I had the workflow in place
I knew how to you know I could send a
boom bang bang get it going and I would
even there's a little trick I would even
subtly direct my client to want to have
their app work in such a way that was
compatible with my MVC framework or more
compatible which saved me a lot of time
so I would tell them that I would say ok
you want to do it like this but I would
said you suggest you go this route do it
like this this section of their app
and it will save you time it works well
I've done it for several of clients
it'll save me time and development so
it's gonna save you money and it's gonna
work amazingly and nine times out of ten
leaves okay that's cool so I would
direct them that way
and then be workflow to develop their
app was so much easier and so much
quicker you know just a couple of
examples of how you can you know develop
your skills as a developer employee
better workflows and I'm talking and and
client management to just make yourself
more profitable and yeah so that's how
how it works so this is this is what I
this is an example small taste of what
I'm talking about what I'm saying but
becoming a good coder is not just about
it's not just about writing code it's
there's much more to it than that
there's that developing your workflows
knowing with what IDE is to use what
your deployment environments are with
server configs you're going to use all
these type of things how you manage your
clients how you manage expectations how
you write out your contract so that it's
makes sense at the end of the day if I
was going to give a piece of advice in
this vlog you want to keep it simple so
let's go back to the original subject
regional subject before I went off in a
tangent was the entrepreneur lifestyle
as the as the freelance developer so by
implementing strong workflows and
whether it be your own internal
workflows in terms of coding or how you
manage your clients this is gonna allow
you to free up more and more time and
become much more profitable in the type
of work that you do and communication
skills goes in to visit a big way in
terms of managing a client so that yeah
you have to learn to speak in a language
with the client understand so here's a
big tip if you go in to see for instance
a client who owns a butcher shop or a
coffee shop or maybe they sell tires
pick a business before you go in to see
them you should do a little reading
about their business man 20 minutes half
an hour just try to understand what
their business is so when you go in
there and you talk to them about their
app at least you can ask them some
fairly intelligent questions about their
business and this is going to give them
your client or the prospective client
more confident more confidence in the
work that you do because they'll see
they just this guy knows a little bit
about my business and it will also help
you to better figure out how to best
apply your coding skills to their
particular job at hand so that's a
little trick that's one trick what you
could use figure out know the business a
little bit study it a bit especially if
it's an own business figure out if it's
a pretty let's say it's a popular
restaurant in your town you know check
out the reviews look at the food they
serve look at their menu look at their
the ambiance and you can discern a lot
about a business by by understanding
what they do also understanding their
industry and that will help you again to
be more profitable to have better
relationships with your clients save you
a lot of time at the end of the day I
hope you're picking up on this the
freelance developer has to have a
broader range of skills than somebody
just works at a company and their job is
just to build a UI or their job is just
to use react native to build the front
end or if their job is just a the right
the middle layer in PHP or in Python or
in Java you see it's a broader skill set
you have to be curious for me it's much
more interesting because it's you're not
just doing code you're doing out a bunch
of different things related to it and
you're learning to manage the whole
thing which could lead to a lot of great
things down the road because once you've
done a few client projects and you built
their web apps or their websites
you have a much better idea about maybe
setting up your own business down the
road because you you will have touched
off and all these different things
whereas if you just work for a company
you're gonna have a very myopic a very
narrow point of view about things and
you will not be aware of all these other
considerations all these other processes
all these other skills that you have to
have as an entrepreneur as a freelancer
again communication skills becomes even
more important in the freelancing world
because it will literally effect
immediately it would literally affect
how much money you make so you see that
in my coding courses by the way where I
get into the real world perspective in
terms of what I teach if you look at any
given programming language their vast
right if you look at JavaScript or
Python or Java or C sharp PHP Ruby what
whatnot they're huge and the good
developer and a good developer course
really teaches you two key fundamentals
the core fundamentals but you're gonna
be using on a daily basis rather than
going down these obscure pass that's why
I can my Python course I was tempted to
put in to teach you how to build a
shooter would you be kind of cool I
suppose will be kind of fun
don't the shooter but what you're gonna
learn is that the type of programming to
build a shooter you rarely ever gonna
use in Python programming because people
don't use Python to build shooters
anyhow so the lifestyle of the
freelancer is more freedom more variety
in the type of work that you do so it's
kind of interesting that way
it gives you a lot of choice in terms of
the type of jobs you do when you work
how you work but at the same time it
takes more work to establish yourself
because you can establish these
processes whether do your processes of
dealing with clients processes in terms
of how you develop your projects and
your code bases I hope this is useful
it's a bit of a Saturday afternoon
rambling but I figure yeah you know I am
again trying to bring more of real-world
experience into the coding world because
out there in YouTube land and elsewhere
it's a lot of noobs or a lot of people
who've only worked for somebody for a
couple years so I'm bringing the two
decades in generally speaking to get two
decades of experience at Jerez speaking
well not generally I've never worked for
anybody as a coder I've always been
either a contract or freelancer or
develop my own app
my own sass and the current one of
course is studio web it's an interactive
trading sass and so you can see how I
design my stuff there it's for instance
if you do good UI and UX user interface
and user experience work they stand the
test of time now so studio webs UI UX
it's pretty much where it was six years
ago and it's been modified and tweaked
and polished but it still works
fantastically and even though it's like
six seven years old but it's kind of
like iOS iOS is pretty much what it's
been for the last five six years but
because it's pretty refined same with
Android it hasn't changed to two
radically and that's a good sign because
that means you got some sauce solid base
there right same with Mac OS right Mac
OS since OS 10 it's pretty solid yes
there's been some changes but it's
pretty much the same what's nice
polishes and nice refinements over time
whereas like Windows Vista which was
like a total disaster they had to a boot
dad put that in the trash and they've
come out you know then add Windows 8 and
then they had to trash that because I
was garbage because total radical change
now they have Windows 10 and I think
they're gonna they've done a decent job
with out of all I have my problems with
it but you notice how Mac OS has been
pretty consistent for many years now or
Windows that kept having a trash can
have in your trash so when you have a a
code base or ui/ux that's consistent
over time you know you got something
good there all right a bit of a rambling
video but it's Saturday afternoon what
do you expect as usual if you have
questions you want me to expand in any
of the little areas I touched off on
this video just let me know buddy let me
know in the comments below and I'll do
my best to respond all right thanks a
lot bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
