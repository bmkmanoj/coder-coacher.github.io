somebody posted in the killer sites calm
form a question about whether somebody
who offers one service I guess a
contractor whether or not they're really
entrepreneurs well an entrepreneur is
just somebody who starts a new business
and selling your time as a contractor
whether you're developer a lawyer a
dentist it's you're not renewing a sense
there's no question about it in terms of
starting your own businesses the first
level of business is to sell your time
now essentially you are an employee for
hire your freelance contractor and
that's great because a lot of Vantage's
to freelancing and of the businesses out
there it's as simple as one to get going
it's a good way to to get your feet wet
in terms of the whole entrepreneur or
the business world I suppose but
ultimately when you are a contractor
which would be very lucrative you have
to understand that your time your time
will be eaten away as you become more
and more successful what you want to end
up doing as a developer contractor any
type of contractor first level is to
implement systems processes within your
business to streamline the whole whole
job your whole work environment so that
it becomes quicker faster and more
efficient so in programming you have for
example on the web stack you have the
MVC frameworks like PHP laravel Java
spring Ruby on Rails Python jangle these
frameworks are effectively ways to save
you a lot of time to maximize your time
in back in the 90s when I was an active
developer in my java days I had
developed my own framework my own MVC
framework because they didn't like what
was out there
now today I would say use one of the
frameworks if you're a web stack
developer but generally in business
selling your time is kind of like I
would consider the first level of
business
because you're limited by the amount of
time you have and as you get more
successful use up more of your time so
it becomes problematic over time that's
the time there anyhow the next level is
to put in processes automation whether
it be software and just just processes
that allow you to better use your time
then the next level on top of us start
hiring people under you to take care of
jobs that you don't want to do and so
there are a few other levels as well in
this so these are some of the subjects
I've been going to be discussing going
forward as I get into the more business
entrepreneurial and of my experience
stack if you will I've been developer
since the 90s but I've actually been an
entrepreneur and having had many
different types of businesses not just
tech businesses import/export dry goods
livestock even so I have a varied
background so I'll going to start
talking more about this as we go forward
all right so I'm gonna let you go
because my phone is about to run out of
space I didn't buy a Google pixel with
enough enough hard drive space
unfortunately I'll up anyway we'll see
you in the next vlog
