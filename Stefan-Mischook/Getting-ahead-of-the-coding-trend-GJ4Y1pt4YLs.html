studio Web killer sites and other sites
in this video I told blog is getting
ahead of the coding trend so what is
this about well I'll get to the point
when you are looking at your coding
career whether as a freelancer or
looking to get a job somewhere what you
should do is not look at what
necessarily is hot now or what was hot
five years ago or two years ago you
should try to look ahead maybe year from
now a year and a half from how depending
on what your timeline is what do I mean
by that if you're just starting to learn
how to code so it'd take you a few
months at least to get some basic skill
sets so you can start taking on little
jobs now little jobs means little jobs
for small businesses and you little
things here and there and in in another
video I can get into that whole process
or you can look it up house wares lots
of videos on that so what I mean by
getting ahead of the trend you got to
look at what's coming up right now 2016
is late June 2016 June 27th what's
really the hot language especially for
2017 is server-side JavaScript
programming so I'm talking about node J
s may be expressed yes but definitely no
js' now I'm not saying with JavaScript
server-side coding is the best ever no
no no I will not use node.js and
server-side JavaScript for big projects
in terms of the whole framework I would
use it for for micro services or
services within a larger project if you
don't know what I'm talking about just
check out some previous videos I talked
about it the point you want to take away
from this vblog and i've seen it over
and over again since the 90s when i
started to write code is that you want
to get slightly ahead of the market you
don't want to get too far ahead you
don't that you want to go to the
bleeding edge because a lot of times
bleeding edge technologies whether they
be frameworks
whether they be languages though they
won't make it anywhere a lot of times
bleeding edge technologies this crash
and burn but you want to get something
that you see if it's growing its popular
or a hype and it's and you see that
there's definitely a lot of demand
building for it
and right now that's Jas so again what
I'm talking about
languages and frameworks in general a
lot of little nerds not leaders a lot of
nerds young intermediate level nerds in
terms of the business and people three
four years of experience they they
assumed wrongly but I'm criticizing the
technology itself so when I say that for
instance in a recent video I said I
would not learn Ruby on Rails today I'm
not saying Ruby on Rails is a bad
technology in fact it's a very good
technology but it represents an older
style of web app development that's
slowly fading now sure I would imagine
Ruby guys the rails guys are gonna be
updating it accordingly but nonetheless
it seems to be losing its mojo and all
the young nerds are going eh it's all
about JavaScript now and no that's where
the popularity is and though no it still
has some problems a little immature in
some areas it'll mixed up which is
normal for new technologies some huge
players are using node to great effect
that's the biggest one I know of is
Netflix they use nodejs they use
server-side JavaScript for some of their
your apps so that's that's something to
be said about that nonetheless the main
point of this is to always think a
little bit ahead not too far ahead so
you know you don't get find yourself in
a dead-end but just a little bit ahead
and that's where you're gonna find all
the action all the activities now I know
this from experience so let me go way
back way back when many of you were
still young kids dreaming of your first
date although some of you might be
dreaming of your first date now but
anyway yeah this is back in the 90s
nineteen
in 96 where I got a Giga job to take in
an app and to update it so they came to
me the client came to me and said we
want to update this app and the app was
written in which was at the time the
most used technology to create database
driven websites that's in those days
that's what we would call web apps
database driven websites why because any
web app is well not any but just about
all of them have a database hooked up to
them to store all the information about
your users and so on anyway so in the
day everybody was using pearls CGI pearl
CGI don't have to worry about the
technology it's still out there but I
want them use it don't use it of course
now I'm gonna get all kinds of hate mail
for Anna pearl people anyway so pearls
cool for its time but so when I looked
at this project I was aware of something
that was cutting edge kind of new at the
time but it was not cutting edge whereas
bleeding edge it was cutting edge
bleeding edges you don't want to touch
you want to look at it poke around it
that's bleeding edge cutting edge you
can use it so what's this new technology
was called ASP active server pages again
don't use it's very old this is now we
call it classic ASP and it came out of
96 and it was the first technology that
I'm aware of that did this page type of
dynamic coding and any won't get into
specifics bottom line was is that this
technology was far more productive far
more productive and Perl CGI you did you
just did things so much more quickly and
so for this particular project I said to
the guy well listen we could try to
update this app that you spent a year
you hired a team to do for a year or we
could just do from scratch from the
brand-new technology which is much much
better and there's a normally I would
not do that by the way
normally you you want a baby an app and
keep refactoring it which means you know
you know processing and streamlining the
code especially these days but back in
those days the technology was moving so
quickly things were getting so quick so
moving so quickly in terms of
improvements but it made sense look at
new technology reasonably often so
anyway this was a situation so I did it
from scratch using classic ASP and
something that took a year before with
Perl CGI I was able to do on my own in
30 days with classic ASP and it had more
features and it was better of course I
didn't have to work out a lot of details
in terms of how it was functioning
because I saw it wasn't exactly working
very well but I saw basically what they
wanted to see and that's a big part of
development processes is figuring out
for yourself or for the client exactly
how you want the app to be it's a lot
easier to reproduce an APIs and build
event to build and come up with a
concept from scratch so there you go
that's just one example how using a
cutting-edge technology
gave me a huge advantage in the
marketplace so I was able to get this
job it took a year - previously -
previously do I was able to do in 30
days and the client was impressed with
me and then I got contracts or all their
companies they had several companies
because I was able to do good work so
there are times you always going to keep
your eye out rather for newer
technologies you got to be careful about
pulling the trigger on investing your
time into something but you also
especially as new beginners of assuming
you're beginner watching this or a new
newish person you also have to be
mindful of of not getting caught up with
an old technology because you love it
you got to be aware of market forces so
for instance with myself I spent most of
my career as a coder really reading Java
code real more Java code than any other
language but when I got pretty mature my
coding skills you know seven six seven
eight years of coding it got to a point
where I would look at a project look at
what it needed to do what needed to be
done and then I would choose a language
accordingly and sometimes it wasn't a
language I liked or I was very fond of
but it was the best language for that
particular job so don't get married to
your life
which your technology you know find the
best technology for the job and that
takes experience that takes judgment so
uh there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
