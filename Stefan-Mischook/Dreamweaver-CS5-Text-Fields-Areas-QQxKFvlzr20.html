main area that we happen to have right
here contains nothing except the contact
us h1 headline in fact if you find it
easier you can separate these things and
don't forget to add a very simple
comment in there if you wish just saying
this ends the main div so now that we
have that sort of taken care of and here
we can see that it is in fact empty void
nothing in there so what I want to do is
to enter some form information and form
elements and then we'll go about styling
those elements so in order to do that
you'll find that at the very top where
you have your common inserts you'll
notice that there are layout and there's
also form elements that you can insert
as well so to begin with the first thing
we're going to add any time you work
with the form is the form tag itself
open and close form tag so if we were to
click right there what you should see is
a red little form element that is inside
here and if you were to look at this in
our code view quite simply you can see
that it's just got this open forum close
form information we open that up which
will be absolutely fine to do and the
reason we do that is because we are
going to be entering information inside
of this form so there's a lot of
different things that we can do with
this and if you remember i'm using the
same CSS code that i was using in the
previous examples so main already has
some information pertaining to what we
want to do to the inside information so
you know main the box itself the div the
h 1 h 2 s in paragraphs well we don't
really have any h2s although we can put
some in and as you can see and hear our
paragraphs are going to be styled a
certain way as well and what we
shouldn't remember about all of these
things the content has padding on the
left and the right hand side you'll
notice that I could have also included
the form itself to have padding on the
an outside as well so h1 h2 paragraph
and I could have also said form just to
indent some of the elements inside there
we could do that we could also just
specifically put some of these elements
inside of paragraphs and if we have them
inside of paragraphs we could then be
able to adhere to what the paragraphs
are doing inside of these elements as
well so let's take a look I'm going to
position my cursor inside here in fact
even if I wanted to press return you'll
see that now I've got two paragraphs and
you can see that the paragraphs see here
my code and here my design view are
already implemented with the sort of
padding that we had taken a look at over
here so that's okay we can embed inside
of these paragraphs now some form
elements like for example here we've got
something called the text field and if
we click on the text field by the way if
you didn't see this window it's probably
because your code or your cursor was
inside this code but here i'll just
select this and remove it and just to
make sure i'm putting my cursor here in
the design view and you'll notice what
i'm going to enter first is the text
field so first of all we can give it an
ID like f name which would be
representing first name and then we can
actually give it a label as well so i'll
say first name label is what we're going
to be seeing on the HTML side the ID is
used for well either CSS or any of the
programming languages that you would
need to implement and make this form
work with for example a database or
something like that so we're going to
wrap with the label tag so the label is
going to be around this name but also
the object as well why because we're
positioning the form item before the
form item the label that is so I'm also
going to put in a colon for that label
name as well first name and we'll click
OK and check out what you've got you've
got first name here and you've got this
new text area right
next to it if we were to open up in our
code view we could see exactly what just
happened the label tag wrapped around
everything the first name that was here
as well as the input tag which provided
us with that little box so this is all
great works perfectly fine and now we
have one element what I'm going to do
now is to go into the second paragraph
see the paragraph here second paragraph
I'm we're going to do the same thing
except this time we're going to call it
L name for last name and here we're
going to actually spell out last name
put in a colon now you'll also notice
that you know much like all the other
paragraphs that we've been using and if
i go to my code view i'll show you why
and that's because we actually have
these elements not only in the form but
look there's a paragraph here which has
the label and a paragraph here which has
a label and the input tag so that works
out ok for us now there's a couple of
things that we can do with regards to
how this looks if i wanted to for
example have first name on the top and
this underneath it well what we could do
as you'll see later on when we style
this is to make this text area here as
you can see that's what it's called
input type right it's that text type we
can make this input tag actually be
block level and as you remember when we
were looking at links they won't be next
to each other they'll always be
underneath now if we wanted to in the
temporary short-term I could just shift
return and put a br tag their simple
little line break but I'm going to
remove that and show you that will
probably do something a little bit
better with CSS so let's add some other
things and we'll do that quite simply by
putting our cursor right here next to it
there and you'll notice what I'm going
to do is just press return creating a
new paragraph as you can see so i have a
new paragraph wrapped around everything
why am i doing that well remember
paragraphs are indenting our elements 20
on each side now I could do that with
styling in a different way later but
we'll see how to do that in a much later
video so as you can see at this point
what I want to introduce is the actual
text area now text areas can be kind of
interesting because as you'll see here I
can give it an ideal call it like
comments and why not put a label will
put a label and we'll say let's see
enter your comments here should be fine
with a little colon rap with the label
tag sure why not before the item sure i
want that before the element and as you
can see I've got these two things
separated like this well that's not
going to do for me as this one does so I
will position my cursor right between
the two elements and press shift return
entering a br tag break tag right so
what you see now is something called a
text area this text area and as you can
see it's got character width and number
lines number lines is providing it with
a height value and the width and
characters is determining how large it
is but as you'll see later on what we
can also do with this is to actually
provide some CSS that will sort of style
it we can give it a width we can give it
an actual height as well as background
color stuff like that notice in here
when you do select the object as you can
see I've selected that object you can
apply classes a little bit later on just
quite simply by working in this fashion
if you put your cursor right inside of
it you'll be able to see ya it's
multi-line as it should be it's going to
be multi-line we could also as you can
see it's got its ID name in here you can
even enter an initial value enter your
comments here could have been written
directly inside of the object itself but
I don't want to do that in this case so
when we come back I'm going to talk to
you about 20
elements that we can enter into our code
and that is working with radio buttons
and check buttons as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
