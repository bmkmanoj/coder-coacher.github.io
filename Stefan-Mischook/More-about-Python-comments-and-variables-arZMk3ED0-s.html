more when it comes to comments now we
have our comment up here remember
comment you put the pound symbol here
and anything as that will be ignored by
the Python interpreter or the Python app
so what is the point of comments the
most important thing about comments and
we can have multiple lines is that with
comments you can leave messages behind
so that the next coder will know what
the code is about so you don't want to
write big long essays big long stories
but it's kind of cool to use comments to
just give an idea to the coder what you
are trying to do in this code now this
could be another coder because when
you're working in app development when
you are a programmer it's very common
that you would be working with other
programmers so it's kind of cool is that
you leave notes behind about what you
were trying to do with your code
another reason to leave comments behind
is leave comments for you because when
you work on your app you're into it
you're all into the code you know
exactly what you want to do but what
happened six months from now when you
have to go back to your Python code to
your py file and you're going to have to
make some updates I can tell you from
experience you're probably going to
forget exactly what you are doing so by
putting some nice comments in your py
files at the right spots right spots
could be at the top of the page it could
be right beside a big chunk of code
that's kind of complex when you put
comments behind it will make it a lot
easier for you to go back and pick up
what it is you were doing how you were
thinking about your code at the time so
remember we created variables before we
create name variable give a variable any
name of while and call it B name
do whatever you want now there are
special words in Python and these
special words are called reserved words
and either words you can't use in your
variable names and other code and we're
going to get into that later on but
generally speaking in Python you can
name your variables what you want simple
rules you want to use use letters could
be uppercase lowercase you can use
numbers but to be best if you you name a
variable name cake that is a good
variable in terms of it won't break
Python but generally speaking when
you're creating your variables you want
to make sure that your variables tell
people Hotel coders what the variables
are about so if you're going to be
collecting people's names in your app
you want to call your variables names is
to collect if you're collecting people's
last names and forget that equals you
want to collect people's last names then
you might have name last for example I'm
just putting blank spaces for now just
so I can teach you this stuff if you're
going to keep track of people's ages
you're going to put age you might have a
variable called age right you might have
also somebody's birthday you might have
call it birthday so you can see the
variables names make sense they make
logical sense they tell you something
about what the code is doing so that's
kind of cool so let's try something
let's say we get a name say it's equal
to Michael Michael that's the name let's
say name name last equals Corleone I
don't even know if I'm spelling that
right now when you are creating
variables it's good to be consistent so
if you're going to do what I just did
where I put a dash in between a variable
words in a variable name you can have a
space like that that's not going to work
that's going to break it has to even be
a - si an underscore it could be it
could be a number it could be a dash
whatever it is you want whatever is more
readable some people will do this we
will do this called camel case I tend to
do this would be name underscore last or
name - last now you want to be
consistent in your naming of your
variables so if you're going to use
dashes underscores rather or dashes
whatever in between words and variables
of Meiko price on the score product that
makes sense to you and then you say 24
words point 5 24:56 for a sake of our
example here you wouldn't want to use an
underscore up here just between variable
words and then use maybe a dash here or
maybe not use a space at all or maybe do
this you want to be consistent so you
have to decide at the very beginning
what you want to do so I'm going to just
do underscores I just like on the scores
so we've got our three variables here
most pretty good so let me just save
this document I'm going to function f5
nothing happens because all we did in
our code is we just created three
variables so let's print out some
variables we're going to print and then
it'll say you put the name and I'm going
to save that then we function 5 again
Michael comes out now let's print out
price underscore product and hit save 5
we get the price of the product okay
that's enough for now so we'll jump into
some quizzing and in the next video
we'll take up from where we left off
