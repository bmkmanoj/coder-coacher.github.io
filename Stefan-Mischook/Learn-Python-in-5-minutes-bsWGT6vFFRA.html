show you how to get up and running in
Python in less than five minutes very
easy so you open up your web browser and
you want to go to Python org when you
get there you want to go to downloads
and you want to select the latest
version of Python now I'm on Maxell
shows me the Mac OS version if you're on
Windows it will show you the Windows
version if you're on Linux will show you
a Linux version you want to get the
latest version at this time in 2017 2.7
is the Oh Virgin and 3.6 is the latest
version we want to get to 3.6
because it's the latest version so you
click down you're gonna have your little
download appear here and you just
install this app like you would any
other app once you've installed Python
you want to go into your applications on
Mac and you want to look for Python 3.6
or whatever the latest version of python
is for you on windows you're gonna go to
your Start menu just look for Python
which you want to look for is this here
the IDL e this is the integrated
development environment in python ide le
short for integrated development
environment it is an app it's a program
that allows you to write your python
code you may be confused python is a
programming language but it's also an
app and the app the Python app is used
to process all your Python code this
works this way for many other
programming languages including
JavaScript Java c-sharp Swift Ruby PHP
and others so you when you open up the
Python shell you want to hit enter until
you get these three arrows here that's
called the prompt where you can actually
start typing in code so I'm gonna type
in the very first bit of Python code and
this is the print command the print
command just tells python to print
something to screen so right now I'm
using quotes and I'm printing a string
of text like a bunch of letters strung
together and I'm saying print the names
to fans so Stephan pretty good so prints
so let's do something different we can
store information in Python and we store
them in containers and they're called
variables think of them as little bags
you put information into so I say create
this bag called name
and put the text a fan into it I hit
enter now it's sort how do we know if
it's stored in there we go print and say
print whatever is in the bag or the
container the variable called name
heylook name is in there let's change
that what's a name is equal to what's a
name is now Nick hit enter and we go
print and go Nick uh-oh we got a problem
why is that a problem because there's no
Nick Nick is not defined uh-huh well
learn about that in the main course but
we're just gonna fix that we go print
name ah inside of name we have Nick
right cuz we did it here it was change
it again one more time say name we're
gonna say
now I will say name has a number in
there name is equal to 6 and have a go
print name there we go 6 pretty good so
let's change name again we say name is
equal to our own Marty notice I got
quotes around the text he knows how to
Texas turning all kinds of different
colors if it's an error it gets in red
if we're writing a built-in capability
built into Python the print command it's
in purple when we're writing out text is
highlighted in green text can be created
in Python with double quotes as we see
up here and single quotes Marty so we
hit enter a pretty name so now we said
name is equal to Marty so let's say
print name we'll see what Python tells
us yeah it says Marty's in there pretty
good well you know what because we're in
the IDE the Python shell this window
here and says right here Python shell we
don't even have to print to know what's
inside of the name variable and how do
we do that we just type in name there we
go
well as what we want to have print Marty
many times in the school name star just
above the eight key on your keyboard was
$8.99 it prints out Martine 99 so there
you go we've installed Python we've
learned about the print command we've
learned about containers that hold
information we call these variables and
we learned that if we want to store
information that is text you have to use
single quotes around the text or you
have to use double quotes well excuse me
double and single there you go you're up
and running with Python three point six
in a very short period of time hey hey
if you like this video and you want to
get up and running quickly with core
Python professional coding skills check
out my course anybody who's done my
course will tell you there's no quicker
way and no easier way to learn Python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
