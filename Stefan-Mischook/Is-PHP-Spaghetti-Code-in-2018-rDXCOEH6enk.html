myth is PHP spaghetti code no home 10
years ago it was 10 years ago was but
comparing PHP coding 10 years ago versus
today is like comparing iPhone 10 years
ago to today's iPhone you can't look at
10 years ago with the iPhone was like
and gold that's how the iPhone is no the
iPhone is very different today is not
the same beast PHP is very very
different today than it was 10 years ago
10 years ago yes you had a lot of
unsophisticated spaghetti PHP code not
because of the language because the
programmers were not very sophisticated
PHP was one of those hacking languages
and since about if you wanted to put up
a quick dynamic website dynamic meaning
database-driven website meaning a
website that became a web app people
would hack them together with PHP PHP
was designed to be just a hacked
language you got to look at its history
but over the last decade PHP has become
every bit as sophisticated as any other
web stack that you see out there whether
it be no JavaScript whether it be Java
whether it be Ruby and rails and Python
and Django PHP with these several
frameworks that you have to choose from
will be laravel or cake or symphony
these days I think well not I think
laravel is the king a very sophisticated
very capable web framework just as
sophisticated as any other ones this
whole idea that PHP is spaghetti called
first of all if you knew how to code
even back in the old days of PHP for if
you wrote spaghetti code with PHP had
nothing to do with the language had
everything to do with you as a bad
programmer reading spaghetti code you
could write modular well-organized code
even with non-oil PHP just had to know
what you were doing keep that in mind
second of all but second of all modern
day PHP is extremely it's got areas that
the namespace is it's fully
object-oriented
it has all the capabilities as arms it
has MVC frameworks are sophisticated etc
etc etc so this whole idea the PHP code
is somehow garbage and ode is ridiculous
it's ridiculous
trust me I've written software nine
commercial software in nine different
languages it's not it's not it's
actually quite capable
in fact studio for which we're writing
now the beta should be out fairly soon I
figure we're gonna start deploying a
couple classrooms to it within the next
month or so my new lead developer who
took over I don't know five six months
ago maybe longer anyhow he had never
worked with laravel before and he was
blown away he continues to be blown away
at how how capable the database
interaction tools the arm tools or math
short for object relational mapping it's
basically a layer of code that talks to
your relational database it makes it
easy for you to hit it and he's very
very impressed by how sophisticated it
is and you see the guy who runs laravel
who started up these parodies apparently
he's a very arrogant nerd and a bit of a
douche bag nerd but that's so I'm told I
don't know don't know him personally but
I was at the same time he's actually one
of these guys who really knows what he's
doing and he's you would look he looked
at rails he looked at what they were
doing and he looked at other frameworks
and he just continued to implement that
and to create a very sophisticated MVC
framework Wolf's Lair eval
so don't pooh-pooh or PHP because that's
just kind of silly especially given how
big the market share is and how performs
it is PHP code at runtime will run
circles around Ruby and rails or run
circles around Python and Django is
extremely performant it's extremely
performance so don't put it down
Facebook is
in PHP old-school PHP well of course
it's gotten more sophisticated over the
years but point is if it's good enough
for Facebook it's probably good enough
for your web app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
