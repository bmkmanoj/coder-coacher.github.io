I'm using my quick little webcam here
just to make it easy I don't want to
pull out the bigger better quality
camera anyway so in this little video
blog want to talk about app creation
whether it be a business app mobile app
or some sort of game and something I've
been discussing with some coder friends
of mine things have changed in the last
ten years when it comes to app creation
in the old days the big hurdle was in
the engines was in the infrastructure of
an app that was a challenge how do you
build this thing is the technology there
is there something available let me give
me an example way back in the 90s to
create a chat app a simple chat and
messaging app was a huge challenge well
not huge but it was a big challenge to
do it in side of a website or a web app
it's simply the infrastructure with a
narrative technology wasn't there doing
simple things like processing forms and
validating the form input and this sort
of thing authentication you know it
wasn't insurmountable wasn't like
impossible but it was a lot more work
than better news than it is today
today it's so much easier and these are
just cheap you know simple examples the
point that I want to make in this
particular vblog is that today the
challenge when creating apps whether it
be business apps mobile apps games is
not so much in the programming really
the engines are really mature now the
infrastructure is there you can just
grab frameworks you can grab modules and
you can start putting things together
and that combined with the fact that
computer servers are just much more
powerful today the challenge today is in
the actual content itself that the app
is exposing so let me give you example
what makes a web app or a website
successful really
is what it is you're presenting on the
website and how well you are presenting
it that's a UI user interface and UX
user experience user experience is
something has been around for a long
time now but it's hard to find people
are really good at doing that and UX UI
rather is also is the look and feel the
sights its how the site looks its
general aesthetic appeal if you will so
you have UI the aesthetics that looks
the style you have UX how well
everything how simply things are placed
on the page or on the screen and those
two elements combined with content
whatever it is you're exposing whether
it be a game whether it be a a series of
articles or a training lesson or so
forth this is what separates the
successful site successful apps from the
unsuccessful so let me give you example
YouTube aesthetically in terms of UI
very simple it's extremely simple but
it's UX it's user experience it's very
very very well done and that's one of
the main reasons why it's successful
initially YouTube became successful
because they used a bunch of commercial
content and they just let it on there I
mean basically pirating a bunch of stuff
people would upload fights and TV shows
and there's you know Comcast famously
was suing YouTube and yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah but now of course YouTube you
know the most interesting content of
course is the creators of YouTube
content the people who are you know this
is the average Joe who's actually able
to put out some really interesting stuff
I personally when I watch YouTube videos
I don't watch so much you know the
mainstream stuff from the network's I
actually watch a lot of YouTube creators
themselves I find out much more
interesting whether it be stupid videos
or
or some vlog series or something anyway
back to being web developers and
developers in general you need to
understand that the story the UI the UX
the content of your app of your games
are much are pretty much the challenge
at your face so if you're looking to
build an app I wouldn't be so worried
about the technical hurdles because
again they're much much much lower today
than they used to be it's so easy to do
just about anything today in terms of
the technology it's all about those
those three other elements UI UX and
content so keep that in mind when you're
planning your sites and you're planning
your apps you're planning your games all
right that's it for now ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
