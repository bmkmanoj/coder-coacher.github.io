bit of a break from code and I want to
show you the four basic layout types or
design types in CSS and what I'm talking
about I'm talking about page layout so
we're looking at the four which are
static design liquid design adaptive
design and responsive design don't worry
we're gonna break these down and in this
course we're actually gonna learn how to
build at least a couple of these
different styles so let me show you what
I'm talking about
so here is an example of a static design
or some people might call it a fixed
pixel design or a fixed width design
alright it's a lot of information to
take in so what does it mean a static
design static is another word for it
doesn't change it's stable a static it
doesn't change it's set at a particular
size so here is one of my older sites
killer sites calm and this is a site
that I haven't had a time to get updated
yet to update and it is using the
slightly older static based or fixed
pixel design you know fixed pixel static
different words that mean the same thing
so what does that mean well let's look
at it you see how no matter what size
the web browser is the width of the page
from left to right across does not
change right shrink the browser doesn't
change increase the browser size it
doesn't change this is a fixed pixel we
set the width in pixels now if you
remember when we were looking at images
we're looking at setting image size and
pixels same thing with the layout of
this page so this is a fixed pixel
design now watch what happens so if I
bring the browser or it's actually quite
narrow like an iPhone or something you
see how the pager gets cut off right
this is the downside this is the bad
thing about fixed pixel design in that
it's not very
well in terms of the screen that people
are using to view your webpage with it's
not ideal in most situations now there's
still place for fixed pixels design I'll
teach you about that later on but just
understand what this is it's a
unflexible set with in terms of your
webpage let's look at another type of
design this is called a responsive
design because it flows it responds
based on the size of the window watch
how the text shrinks even the images
shrink as I shrink the size in a window
see how things are flowing and flexing
and changing
so even on a phone the sale looked
pretty good
right we flex it out you see how it
expands everything expands even the
images whereas on this fixed pixel
design nothing changes sighs everything
is fixed it's static it doesn't change
so there's two basic design types that
we have in modern day web design now
there are two others and that's the
liquid design and the adaptive design
when again into that soon but for now we
have our responsive design which is the
most flexible changes reflows based on
the size of the screen or the device
that people are using what do I mean by
a device they could be surfing the web
with a desktop computer a laptop an
iPhone and iPad Android device the
responsive design which we see here
where it responds and flexes and flows
this design is ideal for maximum
flexibility so it looks good on any
device whereas the fixed pixel or the
static design really it gives you
maximum control but the problem is it is
not very flexible so people with smaller
screens or really big screens you see
all this wasted space on sides right so
let me go into a little bit more detail
here so here is a browser tool inside of
Chrome and this is inside the developer
tool so you click on the three the menu
item and you go more tools and you go to
developer tools or control shift I on
Windows so what you can do is you can
tell Chrome to view a web page as any of
these devices so for instance here
here's killer sites being viewed as it
would look like on an iPhone 6 now it
fits but you see you would have to pinch
the zoom to see what's what the text is
to really read this properly very
difficult to read right whereas we look
at another site I have web as I start
here see how this site here is actually
very clear this is on iphone 6 and so
look you can read it no problem you have
to
to pinch this site here is designed in a
responsive way it uses responsive web
design techniques let's take a look at
the site this is the site in a full view
as you can see it stretches across
there's no blank space for the most part
and watch the size of the images watch
the size of a book
alright so shrink up coming gets pushed
down a shrink seat hearing gets squished
down see everything is pushed down to
fit the book just got smaller the top
banner here shrank accordingly the text
refloat even a menu claps you see we got
this menu here now watch what happens
when we expand
there's a little bit of a bug here there
we go see see our big menu watch the
menu across the top here are tabs watch
what happens
she disappears into this menu here so
that's that's pretty cool that's is a
responsive design so we can see it here
in the emulator and we can actually
check out a whole bunch of other devices
iPhone 4 sees how it looks an iPhone 4
but if we look at the old site the fixed
pixel or the fixed with design or the
other word is the static design you can
see how an iPhone 4 it just I have to
refresh this there we go it just it just
doesn't look very good at all so it's uh
it has its limitations that said fixed
pixel or static design does have its use
depending on certain circumstances</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
