the comments in a screen gaseous to make
it a little bit easier Steph I'm an
old-time student of your wonderful
course to do web HTML CSS GS PHP and PHP
MySQL where how can I access the Python
section
well the Python section is actually a
different Python course we have a studio
web version and we have a download
version so if you go to the killer video
store here you can get the download
version and including the modules the
career paths and so forth now if you get
this version and if you want the
interactive training by a studio web
just send me an email take care of that
it has everything in the download
version except the download version has
these two modules here Python career
paths and the specialization which a lot
of people like Nicolas Cage of Google so
that's my C++ video I get that people
say I look like Nicolas Cage sometimes
sometimes Al Pacino sometimes others it
says it's weird what about gold as
investment well first of all when it
comes to investing for legal reasons I
have to say you shouldn't take your
advice from from some guy on the web
even though I know my code and I've done
investing I'm not an accredited
counselor and I can't really give you
advice gold my whatever look at the
chart I made good money and gold back in
the day but I believe tons of people who
were once in gold are now into the
cryptocurrencies
I love these type of comments from
hardcore nerds so what you are saying is
after 20 years you still don't
understand any of the code you have
written in these 20 years oh yeah this
is his reasoning behind it if you don't
understand machine code you don't
understand code at all well I beg to
differ and all my apps would say
otherwise
well it's James Franco same video I look
according to him I'm James Franco I've
been selling my coins this weekend made
a nice profit kind of wish I'd bought
more earlier this year let me tell you I
thought what you mean so here's this guy
both C and C++ suck everybody's got
different opinions but it's right
this most C++ jobs require you being an
office true it's almost impossible for
you get a C++ project as freelancer I
would tend to agree
my advice for young programmers weren't
a code of the web if you want a
freelance freelancing school working for
people - is cool depends on your
personality type you sound like Donald
Trump except you speak sensibly I'll let
that go I like this guy's comment about
cryptocurrencies before people get
seriously involved in cryptocurrencies
they need to focus on the fundamentals
where have I heard that before of being
able to store their crypto holding
safely and securely literally billions
of dollars have been lost because people
no longer remember where their private
keys were stored or even what wallet
they used that is funny but it's true
staff write a book on business I buy it
in a heartbeat by the way excellent
content cheers from the Caribbean well
thanks that's one of the thing I like
about the web going back to my days on
killer sites killer PHP and the other
sites I would deal with people from all
over the world it's fascinating it's
good stuff
hey Stef I recently got an internship
working at a company using rails
throughout your videos I've always heard
you mention but these days you pick many
different frameworks before you'd use
rails I was just wondering what your
reasoning behind this was I'm planning
on becoming a freelancer for my career
in the future should I invest my spare
time in furthering my knowledge of rails
or should I diversify my knowledge and
learn other frameworks so let's see what
this guy said here that's awesome you
got an internship if you don't mind me
chiming in Steph has expressed
preference for other languages
technologies because of other
established technologies updated to be
as fast and as useful as rails actually
PHP runs much faster than rails Python
and PHP communities are an example of
technologies who possibly inspired by
Rubin to a certain extent provides their
weak points true a lot of people
companies invested in building their
platform on Ruby and we rather continue
to update what they have
then incur the expense of switching to
something else this is also true but is
also true for
vast majority of websites online that
are built on a PHP based infrastructure
therefore your Ruby experience might
have niche appeal which is good from
what I've heard it might be a tad more
difficult to break into the industry
with Ruby because the boom slash mania
slowdown and the demand for new
developers fell off a couple of boot
camps flooding the job market with
junior Ruby devs however developers move
on and new jobs open up sometimes so
your internship experience will
definitely be an asset you might want to
pick up some other web stack knowledge
to increase your chances of landing
slash keeping positions but there
definitely still are Ruby opportunities
out there the competition might be a bit
higher for those positions though I
can't disagree with this busy round what
he said pretty much makes sense look in
your local area see where the jobs are
and you're probably gonna see a lot of
PHP jobs if you're going into
freelancing as a young developer PHP and
the web stack is the king by far and so
check into that you may want to look at
maybe specializations in WordPress as
well lost work there so that said you
know when you learn your Ruby now that
you know your Ruby and rails you're
getting a lot of experience there if you
really into it they started looking at
PHP on the side maybe laravel just to
expand your abilities and you're gonna
see it's all going to contribute you
looking at PHP in laravel which is their
framework which is similar to rails it's
just gonna make you a better programmer
overall so that's what I would do okay
I'm six months into Java now a twenty
year old without a college or university
diploma and I have no plan on spending
time to obtain one however for what it's
worth I am a Oracle certified associate
although I don't rate that certification
highly Oracle certified professional is
what I'm aiming for if I had to gauge my
level I would say I'm somewhat of a
junior or perhaps even lower because I
don't have
Java work experience any Java work
experience I'm planning to start
searching for a job as soon as I get all
my Oracle certification so my question
is is about the wrong decision should I
start searching for a job or perhaps an
internship in Java with knowledge I
currently have or should I give it some
time as I'm doing now until I'm fully
certified a bit more confident using the
language I think that you should start
looking for a job or a internship right
away
why not because anybody will tell you
who's professional just about any field
where you really learn the profession is
in the field doing actual work nothing
beats work experience style terms of
your degree you have to look at the type
of job you should know that if you don't
get a university degree that will block
you from certain types of jobs working
for big companies just because of HR
departments human resources they have
certain artificial requirements that you
need XY is that degree if you told me on
the other hand the type of work you're
going into this a required degree
freelancing small business that kind of
stuff and who cares now in terms of
Oracle's certified associate an Oracle
certified professional I'm not sure I
haven't looked into that because not my
thing whether or not companies that are
hiring Oracle certified professionals
whether they expect a university degree
as well so you should look into that
before you make your decision whether or
not to drop out of school that said be
very wary of student debt student debt
you can never let go so that's my two
cents there now here's John de poele
again I'm fairly new into Java can you
please elaborate as why it's it isn't
good if you want to do freelance because
Java is generally used in very large
organizations very large organizations
tend to not hire freelancers you can
come in as a contractor but with very
large organizations they're going to
probably expect some sort of university
degree or college degree at least that's
the deal with that here's a good thing
small small medium-sized businesses
don't care about that thing is small
medium-sized businesses will likely not
be using Java the statistics show that
there
much more likely to be using PHP so you
to 4:49 prefers barbra streisand
and Led Zepplin this guy's at the cover
to great Black Sabbath album paranoid
and he like Led Zeppelin that would make
sense if you like Black Sabbath there's
a ninety-nine point eight percent chance
you like Led Zeppelin little factoid
Robert Plant doesn't like Black Sabbath
for some reason anyway I think the first
for Black Sabbath albums are fantastic
Stefan I would be most grateful if you
could speak about data Sciences in your
vlogs I'm just beginning to get into
coding so I'm very much a newbie I am
thinking Python R or maybe octave also I
wish you a happy Christmas from Ireland
keep up the great work
I find your advice very helpful so if
you're going to get into Data Sciences
there's an assumption there that you
have a scientific background what
imagine so that you can you can look at
the sign the data which are processing
in a way that's knowledgeable that said
I would choose Python over other
languages like R for for the data
science is simply because python is
flexible python could be used all kinds
of different things they support you
could argue about with other of the
languages but these more specialized
languages yeah I would go with Python
because if you decide you're not going
to do data scientists you got a language
here Python that could be used in all
kinds of different areas including AI
machine learning web app creation server
automation and so forth
you
