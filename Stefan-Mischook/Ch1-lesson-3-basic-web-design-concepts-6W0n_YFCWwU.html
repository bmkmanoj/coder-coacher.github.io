looks like in a web browser and then
we'll take it from there
open your browser it is there's a text
you are slowly becoming a nerd so if you
look at that compare what we see in the
web browser versus what we see in the
code here so I am using the Google
Chrome web browser a web browser by the
way just in case you don't know is any
app backing few web pages and websites
so chrome is a very popular web browser
today it's by Google Firefox another
very popular web browser those are the
two big dominant ones then you have
Internet Explorer which is by Microsoft
and you have Safari which is on Mac only
which is also another very popular web
browser so there you go we've seen what
basic HTML looks like and we've seen
what the HTML code produces in a and a
web page now this looks really simple of
course let's load up a little bit more
complex web page and here is here's once
called studio web this whole page is
created with HTML with the help of two
other computer languages CSS and
JavaScript we mentioned that before in
this course don't worry we're just
learning HTML but you can see that this
is a much more complex page than this
thing of course and let's take a quick
look at this code in the next video the
code behind this page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
