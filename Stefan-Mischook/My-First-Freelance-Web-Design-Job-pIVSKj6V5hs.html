I'm gonna talk about how I got my very
first paid web design job I think people
who are getting into the game the web
design web development game are gonna
find this video super interesting
because as I tell the story you're gonna
learn about the things that I countered
you gonna learn a few little tips along
the way as well so yeah well before I
get into it I'm gonna head off go over
the mountain get my coffee because I
need a little brain stimulation for you
it's gonna be a split second for me it's
gonna be I don't know maybe an hour so I
like that she lacks in my car - all
right we'll see you soon hey guys I'm
back from my coffee it's actually been a
day I just got caught up with other work
so before I get into the story about my
very first paint web design job way back
in the 90s I'm just gonna give you two
bullet points of some of the lessons
that you can get from this experience
and several other experiences I had in
terms of dealing with my first clients
so first of all when you're starting off
your web design jobs will not be steady
I'm talking about freelance here it's
going to be spotty at first this is
normal so you just have to structure
your life accordingly I'll get into that
in other videos at first you're gonna
get cheap clients this is normal getting
into the game you're gonna get cheap
clients at first that's okay because
you're just starting out you have to
learn the ropes in terms of how to
manage projects how to manage clients
it's okay it only makes sense don't
worry as you progress you'll start
making more and more money as I just
mentioned managing clients is a very
important part of becoming a successful
freelance developer and it's actually a
very good business skill to begin with
all together and a big part of managing
clients in the freelance game is
managing client expectations so that
they know and you know exactly what
you're going to deliver so everybody
knows what they expect out of the
contract and that means you should have
a nice simple contract I call it a line
item contract where you have intro
paragraph the bullet points of what it
is you're going to be building what's
expected I'm not going to get in all the
details here but again what you want to
take away is that you want to establish
proper expectation with your clients so
they know what they're getting you know
what they they think they're getting and
you use a contract to define that more
clearly when you're starting off new
don't chase after big clients it's never
going to work out and this you're
connected you got some nepotism going
there generally speaking when you're
starting off as a freelancer you're
gonna get small contracts and that's
cool because you should practice on
small contracts and don't waste your
time with big contracts you may have a
few big fish will come around snooping
but they're just going to waste your
time in the end because big contracts
become please don't want to take risk
with small unknown players unknown
developer so keep that in mind and
here's a final tip when you're
contracting you always want to get some
payment upfront whether it be 50 percent
when you start a 50 percent completion
or my favorite 33 percent when you start
a 33 percent on a first draft when you
deliver the first draft and 33 percent
when you complete anyway so let's get
into the story so we're going way back
into the 1990s and my personal situation
at the time is I was in the middle of a
legal battle with my soon-to-be passed a
business partner in a business totally
unrelated to technology this is an
import-export business and I want to go
into the weeds of the situation but
essentially I had made a mistake where I
was a young guy but I made a mistake
where most of my money was in the
business so when I got into a battle
with the business business partner my
money was locked up so I had to find
alternatives to source of income while
everything settled through the legal
process so fortunately for me I had
learned how to code to build a website
for my business now you got out of staff
this is in the early 90s when this is
all super new as it is today
back then the first thing you got to do
as a freelancer is put up a website so I
put up a website to show that I can do
to work and I just put up my contact
information and then I just hit the road
I hit the bricks meaning I started
talking to people reaching out to people
see who might need websites and so on
and like any business there's always as
like time there's always this time where
it may be a few weeks maybe a few months
before you start finally getting things
going so you just have to persist while
you're persisting you make sure your
site looks pretty good a really good and
you just keep reaching out to people
maybe working on some new things
learning a little bit here and there one
of the things you have to understand as
a developer it's a continuous learning
process so issue in the first few years
you're always going to be learning new
things as you get into new projects this
is just normal as you get more
experienced you have to learn less and
less and less because you you have
learned more but that's why you have to
emphasize the core to fundamentals
that's why you have to know these
fundamentals I'm going forward it's so
important because if you know your corn
your fundamentals you're properly
trained that way then when you're out
there in the real world as a developer
whether you're working for somebody or
you're freelancer you're gonna always
have to learn something new so you have
the core your master that core venue new
learning new things that's super easy
that's the keys learning new things are
super easy one of the problems out there
when I see with so many of the courses
they're really just tutorials and
tutorials are fine but tutorials should
be what you use after you've learned
your core basics your fundamentals it's
so key so the vast majority of what you
see out there 99% is just tutorials a
problem tutorials are saying learn to
build these 10 things learn to build
this learn to build that learn to build
this without the foundation training
you're gonna be very limited and this is
what students tell me once they've tried
those and they come they do this to me
web stuff then everything changes so
think of it this way if you wanted to
learn to be a musician what do you think
it's better to learn how to play ten
songs or you learn some basic stuff but
you're really just memorizing ten songs
or is it better to learn how to play
music learning chords and notes and if
you know ABCDE the notes in there the
scales and timing and reading music what
would be better would it be better to
learn ten songs were you limited to
those ten songs essentially or is it
better to learn the foundations of music
and Allison you can play every song ever
written
same thing with coding same thing but
development you have that choice to make
so I say do the foundation you got that
super solid foundation then you learn as
you go and that will be the career as a
developer but don't worry once you have
your foundation to learn something new
to learn a new framework to learn a
whole new programming language is not
that hard actually anyway so I put up a
site to track Clyde's I have to have
something to show right and this is a
long time ago this is before the search
engines and search engines were actually
useful and in those days in the early
nineties you you go to a search engine
and you type in anything you were going
to get porn so search engines were used
useless in terms of clients so I would I
did what you did in those days I went to
the classified hats and after a certain
amount of time I forget now it's been a
long time could have been a week it'd
have been a month I forget now I found
an ad where a guy was looking for small
company was looking for a web designer
so I said okay sure alright sorry I sent
an email with my website so that you can
see what it is I can do this they can
judge by the quality of site and I got a
call and I set up a meeting so I met him
at a coffee shop now here's the first
rule freelance developers don't need
offices don't even back then when it was
kind of a new thing and people were kind
of not sure I could still get away with
not having an office you don't wanna get
an office was a huge headache too big
expense you don't want to do that it's a
business tip you get it off as only if
you absol
we have to so I go meet him at a coffee
shop and you sit down see the guy and
when you first meet a new client there's
always a few out period they want to
judge and you want to judge whether or
not these people are rats or not whether
or not you can trust them and that's why
I sighs after coding skills you have to
have great communication skills because
oftentimes that's going to be the
difference between you being successful
whether you've got to want to get a job
it would be freelancer or you want to
start your own business you have to have
good communication skills so I sat down
talked to the guy a little bit of banter
a little chitchat in there we got along
so then we started getting into the
specifics of the project after he gave
it as specifics of the project he then
asked me the two inevitable questions
number one how much do you charge for
our and number two what do you think
this project is going to cost overall
you see they're gonna ask you how much
you charge for our even though just
about 99 percent of clients especially
the first job they're gonna be saying I
want to fix costs on this I don't want
you to say it's going to be X dollars
per hour and then you could just tell me
how many hours you've done very few
people will do that only after they know
you and trust you will they let you go
by the hour what they're gonna do is
gonna ask you how much by the hour just
the judge of price and they're gonna say
okay how much further for the actual
total cost of the project so they asked
me my price the client did and I gave
them a price a little higher than I
wanted because usually they're gonna try
to bargain you down that's just the way
it is so it's a little humming and
hawing there and then he said okay how
much it's this is going to be to do this
project now at that time my abilities to
evaluate the value of a job what was it
as mature because I was just starting
out as a freelancer I'd only done my
site and some other one other sites so
it wasn't really super experienced so I
said to him I'll get back to you I want
to look at the details make sure
everything's cool and I'll get back to
you at a price I went back and I did my
best estimator here's another tip when
you're building your
demo site when you're building your own
site to demo to people as a freelance
already you need to get a job
take meticulous notes about how long it
takes you to do things why because this
is going to help you become a better
judge of how long it takes to build a
site so you can better quote people that
make sense so I gave the guy a call a
couple days later it's ok I got a price
for you and then we imagined a price and
there was negotiation and as usual
because I was new and because he knew I
was new because I didn't have any
credits on my site was just my site and
have a list of clients my price was
pushed down but I took the job because
AI needed the money and B I needed to
get a client I needed to get my first
client the first client is the hardest
client to get in any business regardless
so you got to be a little bit more
flexible with the first client in your
first client might be a free climb my
very first client it was not really paid
I did a legal firm where they they did
all my incorporations
for my business he has all the
incorporation I was worth a couple grand
at the time and then they were going to
expand in all kinds of other areas I'll
get into that for now but so it wasn't
really the same as I kill City they said
you build the site will give you will
create your corporation for it I said ok
cool done it was a sideline for me at
the time anyways I didn't care but this
new client would have talking about now
it was actually dollars so I agreed to
the price we'd meet again I got a check
for the first I don't know if was 33% or
half I forget now it's so long ago and
where we go and then we build the site
you know I had a basic contract I knew
about contracts was my previous business
we stipulated what I have to do by what
dates whether this is what it was they
expected in the payment schedule when
you create a contract with a client you
get a copy they got a copy both copies
are signed by both parties meaning you
get a signed copy with his signature and
your signature he gets a signed copy
from you with your signature in your
signature the whole point of contract is
to clarify what the relationships about
what are you doing for what and it
avoids it helps anyway to avoid conflict
down a road because it's clear it's on
paper so always get a written contract
and always make sure you have a sign
copy so I delivered that contract it
delivered the site he was happy and what
happened is what typically happens they
become a long-standing client and so I
forget the detest but so long with this
guy but a few months later it came back
and he'd this and he'd this Don and heat
this and that done so you get he's
starting to get a stream of income from
this client as a freelancer and what
you're gonna learn is that entrepreneurs
hang out and no other business owners
they know entrepreneurs so if you do a
good job you have a great relationship
with them communication skills are huge
to establish that then he'll start
talking to his friends his entrepreneur
friends and then you finally start
slowly slowly getting more contracts now
what you do is when you finish the site
you take a screenshot of the site you
featured on the home page of your site
and so you have your first paid client
and when you've got three or four of
those paints where you can double them
on your home page you start directing
people to your home page all of a sudden
it's like book reviews on Amazon all
sudden you become much more credible and
the opportunities in terms of the amount
number of new clients you're gonna get
are just going to start increasing quite
a bit so how do you maximize that into
making big money well as you slowly
develop your skills as a web developer
where you become a better coder for to
begin with and you start working out
works those workflows are such an
important part of any type of business
and a part of the value of the business
that they've worked out the workflow the
workflow is just a way in which you get
the job done so when you develop your
skills as a developer at first your
workflow is going to be no good they're
not gonna have any and also your junior
programmers are you're going to be
learning the ropes you're going to be
learning all the hassles and the
problems that developers have to deal
with as they work with clients and so
forth and over time you're going to
continuously develop more and more
workflows so that you can minimize the
amount of time it takes you to complete
a job and thus your value per
your time your time is gonna become more
and more valuable
that's why junior developers make less
than experienced developers but then
once you become that experienced
developer here comes the money and our
strategies you can implement of course
where you can really maximize the amount
of money you can make as a developer but
I won't get into here talk about that in
other videos so there you go that was
how I got my very first web development
job I put up a cheap site lolz and cheap
I put up a simple site I went out there
I started knocking on doors talking to
people or eventually of all places I got
it through will classify that I had to I
had to cut my price for the first client
because you know we're new and I was new
but eventually that turned into a
lucrative contract because as they
become as they turn to trust me more to
become more dependent on me and as I get
more and more clients you start making
more and more money so it is a process
and last point I have mentioned previous
about just a few minutes ago when you
are a developer it is a continuous
process of learning as you become more
experienced the amount you have to learn
will decrease of course but you're
always learning something new so that's
why I emphasize you have to learn the
core you have to learn your fundamentals
really well so that it becomes easy to
learn new things again going back to
that whether you want to learn 10 songs
or you want to learn how to play music
better learn how to play music so you
can play every song in the world that's
the key you learn the core you learn the
fundamentals of any discipline
music martial arts coding programming
you learn the fundamentals also and you
open up the whole world the whole world
of that particular discipline whether it
be a discipline whether it be martial
arts career or what not and that's what
happened with me in the latter stages of
my freelance career I would just walk
into a project walking to see a client
do to do to do and I would say ok what
do you need to do and then based on the
needs of the job I would choose the
technology would choose a language that
was required and more often than not I
would have to learn at least something
new and sometimes I will learn an
entirely new language didn't matter to
me because I was pretty comfortable for
my fundament
and so I was able to get up and running
with a new tech super quickly
unfortunately for me it took me a couple
years to figure out that strategy I
should have known it right away cuz I
that's that's how it is in martial arts
and but fortunately for you you're
watching this video now you know so you
can save yourself years years and and
speed up your development process of
becoming a highly paid or a highly
earning freelance developer alright
that's it for this video my instant
message is pinged and when the phone
pings you gotta go bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
