killer PHP other sites so in this quick
little video blog I'm going to talk
about Windows XP somebody mentioned that
the XP people were getting a little
flustered because Microsoft is no longer
supporting XP so in terms of I guess it
affects you in terms of security updates
and so forth I think my only comment on
that is from my own experience I was
pushed out of XP about a year year and a
half ago something like that I forget
now at the exact time anyway so what to
windows 7 reluctantly because XP was
pretty cool but I was pleasantly
surprised to find out that windows seven
in fact is I find it to be far better
than XP so when you do make that move
which I I recommend that you do do
you're going to I think you will enjoy
windows 7 much more than you do XP a
windows 7 has a lot of stuff that's
built into it it's that XP you would
have to download as separate apps to do
things like unzipping files and so on
and I find that the interface is just
easier it's easier to use and there's a
lot of little nice subtleties to windows
seven that makes it superior to XP yeah
and it has better auto updating and all
kinds of different capabilities I just
found it to be a more elegant operating
system yeah which you would expect since
its you know k many years after XP that
said you may want to actually consider
moving to mac OS i use both mac OS and
windows seven there's some things about
windows 7 but I enjoy more of an mac OS
but the major thing that has to be
really considered is that with mac OS
your chances of getting viruses are
ninety-nine percent
less in fact I've never gotten a virus
with my cholesterol designed for windows
so I could surf around the web and not
worry about anything of that nature
whereas with Windows even windows seven
have norton and i got windows defender
on on there I still get nervous and I
still get occasionally adware and things
like that and I don't serve too much
with my windows 7 machine my windows 7
box is more or less there to create
videos for Windows users that's about it
so yeah so if you're a general purpose
computer user user email surfing the web
that kind of stuff you don't have any
specialized pieces of software that you
use on Windows and you're an XP user you
may want to consider if it's in the
budget Mac OS and I'm not a Mac pumper
like I said are some things about
windows 7i finds pure to Mac OS but it's
a for general purpose computing I tend
to use my window my mac OS machine
ninety-eight percent at a time and just
because I have to worry about viruses
and so on and that's about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
