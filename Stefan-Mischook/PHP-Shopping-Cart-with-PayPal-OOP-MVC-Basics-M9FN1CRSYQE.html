introduction I'm primarily aiming this
course at intermediate level web
developers those who have at least a
basic familiarity with PHP and concepts
like object-oriented programming and MVC
while I won't be focusing on absolute
basics like how to create an object or
what the this variable is my aim is to
demonstrate through code how an Opie and
MVC based system might be put together
my goal is to show a real-world Opie and
MVC example something that you can
create as you follow along with this
course and potentially extend in the
future based on the concepts that you
learned in these videos one of my
biggest challenges when I first started
learning about object-oriented
programming
wasn't the basics like how to create an
object but how an object might be used
within the scope of an entire web app
and how individual objects work together
all that said let me give you a brief
reminder regarding what these terms are
why I like using Opie and MVC and why
you might consider using them in your
own projects if you aren't already let's
start with oo p oo p or object oriented
programming is a design philosophy that
recommends you a code would be built the
series of individual objects so P is all
about modular code code that takes
advantage of things like encapsulation
polymorphism and inheritance to increase
code reuse and decrease code maintenance
o P revolves around a concept called a
class which are the templates that are
used to create objects objects are used
to represent the data in your
application and what types of operations
functions can be performed on that data
programmers can use opie to form
relationships between objects for
example in this course we're going to be
creating a variety of objects to help us
build our e-commerce system these
include things like database object
which we've created in an earlier video
which connects to our database and
allows us to retrieve data there's also
going to be a template object which is
used within the MVC system to display
views in the past data and alert
messages from our controllers to our
views
we're going to create categories object
which will be used to handle anything
related to product categories
we'll also be creating a products object
which will be used to handle retrieving
and displaying product information and
finally we'll also be creating a card
object which is used to create a
shopping cart and perform functions like
adding removing or editing items in the
cart not everyone uses oo P in exactly
the same way in my case I like Oh P
because it gives me a simple way to
group related functionality gives me a
way to place related code together also
called encapsulation so it's easier for
me to find easier for me to modify and
easier for me to reuse in future
projects I also find that it makes my
code cleaner and easier to scan
hopefully you'll see what I mean as we
proceed next MVC MVC stands for Model
View controller it's a common design
pattern that can be used to structure
your web application separating the
business logic from the presentation
it breaks down web application into
three main components first the model
models represent your data and the
functions that can be performed on that
data and we have the view these are
files that are displayed to the user
they contain the user interface and
finally the controller the controller is
the brain of your application they
retrieve input from the user access
models as necessary to get the data they
need pass the models data to the view
and then choose one and how to display
the view to the user
basically they control the logic and
flow of your application this is a
pattern that you may already be familiar
with you just don't know it yet for a
simple example say your user loads a web
page in a web browser the web browser
the controller gets the URL from the
user which is the input it uses that URL
to decide what HTML data it needs to get
the model and then displays that data to
the user using CSS for styling the view
the MVC design pattern is quite popular
and is used extensively by a large
number of program
languages if you intend to continue
increasing your programming knowledge
and look into other languages you'll
find that almost all modern languages
support Opie and can use the MVC design
pattern I've recently begun learning
about Objective C development so I can
create iPhone iPad and iPod applications
and it uses Opie and MVC extensively
I like the MVC model because it helps me
organize my files especially if I know
that I'll be working on a medium to
large web application like Opie it
helped me group related functionality
together and makes it easier to find and
edit my files say I need to change how a
page displays I know to either look in
the view if it's HTML data that gets
displayed to the user or in my CSS file
if it's CSS styling if I need to change
the logic of the application I most
likely need to edit the controller if I
need to modify data or how a certain
piece of data is retrieved then I'll
probably need to go modify the model MVC
helps me reduce complexity increase the
flexibility and maintainability of my
web applications as a final note like
Opie people interpret MVC in different
ways I'm not going to claim that one
approach is better than any other I'm
simply going to show you how I use it
and as you gain experience working with
design patterns and improve your PHP
knowledge I'm sure you will find what
works best for you so that's a brief
overview of Opie and MVC I know these
can be complicated concepts to learn and
I hope these concepts will become
clearer as you watch this video of
course and see them in action
by the end of this course I hope you'll
be able to apply what you've learned to
extend this e-commerce system or add
Opie and MVC to your own applications if
you have any questions regarding MVC or
Opie feel free to contact me at Ben at
Kelly sites comm we're on the killer
sites forums at killer sites calm slash
community I've also included a couple
resources on Opie and MVC within the
resources txt file that's included with
the source code so make sure to check
that out in case it's helpful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
