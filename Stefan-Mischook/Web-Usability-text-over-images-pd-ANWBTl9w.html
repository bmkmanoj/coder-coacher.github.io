killer PHP calm and killer sighs calm
etc in this quick little video on
usability we're going to learn the
importance of simplicity over aesthetics
so what do I mean by that well let me
let me just show you so this is our
webpage homepage for killer sites calm
and we just launched this one about a
month ago meaning the the redesign and
one of the goals of the redesign was to
promote our new subscription service our
video subscription service and so we
could be graphic on the homepage to to
emphasize it so let's scroll down so
it's right up here just in case you
don't know it's killer sites university
big banner here's our logo click here
button you know here it is again this is
the actual University page you know see
all the videos and stuff any help so you
figure that this big green banner that
has the same color scheme as the rest of
the page etc you figure it would stand
out and we get a lot of people clicking
through well it's been over a month now
and to my surprise at first and then
upon further reflection it made sense we
had practically nobody clicking on the
click here so your first instinct is to
think that maybe people are just not
interested in the video tutorial
subscription service well that would be
wrong because we have new subscribers
every day and it's growing and there is
actually a lot of positive reaction to
it in fact i would get emails from
people recalls asking questions about my
videos and i would mention the
university subscription service and they
may get all excited about it and they
would sign up and they hadn't heard
about it even though they had come to
this homepage I helped understand we get
between 75 and a hundred thousand people
just hitting this homepage you know we
have
to hundreds of thousands hitting the
site every month so I was pretty
surprised that again at first you know
but no one is clicking through and as it
turns out it it makes sense if you look
at usability rules and what are the
usability rules that I I had to do some
research on but I was reminded of that
is that if you have a banner like this
or like this over here people tend to
ignore it in fact they call it banner
blindness in the usability circles if
you're not familiar with usability it's
sort of like a a sub profession within
web design usability professionals are
you know their job is to make sure that
the site is usable meaning people will
be inclined to pick up the information
you want to present to them and one of
the things that they've learned through
lots of study is our banners and
perceptions of banners and this is
unfortunately perceived as being an ad
or in a banner doesn't help in fact
people ignore these batters almost
subconsciously and they look elsewhere
so this is a big mistake besides the
fact that it looks kind of like a banner
you get the green background and you got
the image text here one of the main
problems here is that this logo it's the
actual University logo if I click
through you can see right here it
doesn't really convey a message or a
meaning about the service to be honest
when we put this together it was I
approved it and I said hey looks great
you know I got this great little
internet globe and books University
it looks great but back to the matter is
this is really a video tutorial library
and what's really missing here is an
image representing video there should be
a video camera or something like this
perhaps you know that's a big problem
when you're using icons or images on
your page the icons or the images should
convey some sort of message about what
you're doing here but it's very clear if
it this is kind of cryptic this is kind
of unclear about the fact that the
university is in fact a video tutorial
collection I've popped open a screenshot
of the old layout that replaces that we
replace rather with what we currently
have and you notice here in the spot
where the university is we have the
google ads and the fact of the matter is
a lot more people paid attention to
these simple text ads over this fancy
University banner had thing here so what
we have to do is we have to find a way
to combine the simplicity of this google
ad and still have the attractiveness the
aesthetic value that this will call it a
banner for now gives us all to the page
so in the follow up video i'm going to
show you what we've done and also give
you some idea about how much the change
has affected performance of that
particular ad once we get it in place
while it's not gonna be an ad it's going
to be you know notifying people telling
people about our subscription service</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
