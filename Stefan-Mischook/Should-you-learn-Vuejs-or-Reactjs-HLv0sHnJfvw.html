vue.js or react yes like I said a point
quickly if I had to choose one or the
other and that had and I had no specific
job in line something where I needed to
learn react or I need to learn the view
just in of themselves in terms of which
technology I would learn I would go with
view jsy because it's both number one
reason it's very popular and number two
it's easier to learn then react and then
the reason I emphasize that the easiness
the ease of learning it and using it is
is a big thing to consider because in my
experience when you have two
technologies and one is easier to use
and significantly easier to use and
apparently view is that's the one that's
gonna win in the end now I'm not saying
that react is going away not at all but
I think given the fact that view is
easier to learn and it's extremely
capable you can see more and more people
using view Jas
so if I were you and you weren't again
you didn't have any particular project
in mind or coming down the pipeline that
required react yes I would definitely be
going towards view Jas this brings me to
another one of my basic core principles
when it comes to programming in software
development there is a tendency amongst
the Nerds over time to add extra
complexity to things and in an honest
attempt to doing this adding this
complexity they're doing this in an
honest attempt to try to make software
development easier the problem is when
you have really complex systems we have
more and more complex libraries more and
more complex code obviously you're doing
the opposite of that and I've seen that
before on several occasions the biggest
for me was Java back in the 1990s early
2000s
Java got extremely complex the
specification was tremendous tremendous
tremendous tremendous tremendously
complex and there's a big revolt and it
shifted away from the official
specification towards something that the
community developed which was much
easier in comparison
that being said Java still in many ways
unnecessarily complex for most jobs out
there not all jobs but most jobs that
people have moved into more later
nimbler languages like javascript like
PHP like Python etc now here's a thing
JavaScript now and I think I'll I'll get
into the meat of this in another vlog
it's getting in it's getting into that
territory where they're starting to add
more complexity and perhaps
unnecessarily so I'm hearing that react
based apps can become really complex now
what I think might end up happening with
react it's that's going to be used in
larger projects only for small medium
sized projects which are 99% of projects
people that start looking at simpler
libraries simpler frameworks vue.js
comes to mind and I'll leave you with
this last tip when you're evaluating
technologies always look at the core
tech not the libraries typically not
typically always it's the core languages
that will survive over time and
libraries will be will disappear this is
common happens all the time I'll give
you some examples
back in the 90s early 2000s we had all
kinds of Java frameworks MVC frameworks
a whole bunch of them have now died away
struts velocity web objects tapestry
these are all frameworks at one time or
another we're very big or pretty big in
a Java community and the people who were
behind these frameworks of course and
people who use these frameworks for
saying Oh
greatest ever their graves ever there by
God you'll see them anymore
of course Java is still round right so
when you're investing your time into
developing your coding skills again
always I always emphasize the core the
foundation the foundations because they
these skills this technology is ever
great meaning it will last for a longest
time javascript has been around for 25
years 2025 years it's still round it's
still wear out well in 1995 so you do
the math it's still round today but a
lot of Java to a lot Java is still round
today a lot of those frameworks are
disappeared so you're gonna see the same
thing in the JavaScript world
concentrate on the core of the
JavaScript they call it vanilla
JavaScript these days that's what you
want to concentrate on the library
should be secondary in terms of your
considerations because libraries will
come and go look at jQuery jQuery a few
years ago was was the king Jake where
everybody did jQuery everybody a lot of
people were just doing jQuery not even
learning JavaScript and look what jQuery
now bye-bye bye-bye
it's still used but for new projects
people will not really use jQuery
they're gonna look at newer libraries
like like vue.js like react angular for
me I think given what I'm hearing and
using my old nerd experience I think if
you got to learn any JavaScript
framework use if you learn view in terms
of client-side frameworks and but again
emphasis is on core programming
techniques the fundamentals those are
the things you should concentrate on
because what's gonna make you a great
developer is not if you know this
framework of that framework if you know
10 frameworks what's good or libraries
what's gonna make you a great
programmers that you have a really good
understanding of programming you've
really good understanding of those
fundamentals so take it from me I've
been at this game since 1994 I seen this
thing these patterns play out over and
over again so back to react versus of
view I would stress view now because
it's simpler and from my experience
simple technology that's effective will
always beat complex technology that's it
I hope this is useful bye-bye well
before I close this out you probably
notice I'm doing a little bit more
entrepreneur specific vlogs why because
I think that if you are a developer
whether you work for a company or
especially if you're freelancing it's
good to understand the business end of
things so you can understand how clients
think about projects and products and so
forth this watch would make you a better
developer because you can understand
what the client actually wants the
business owner actually wants and of
course if you're going into freelancing
or if you want to start your own product
based on technology or not of course
those type of entrepreneur business
related discussions are going to be
useful to you let me know what you think
about that I'm actually thinking of
coming out with a new vlogging and
podcast series if you will where I'm
gonna talk about business and business
tech news that comes out I don't know if
I'll do it twice a week or three times a
week I'm not sure short videos and
podcasts where I look at the latest news
about a particular technology and or or
just in the business world in general
related to technology and I'll give you
my take on it based on my experience you
know or last two decades of software
development and almost three decades can
you I can imagine believable twenty nine
years since I started my first business
let me know what you're thinking about
that idea a tech news vlog podcast quick
commentary I don't know ten minutes each
I just look at the day's news and I give
you my two cents all right we'll talk
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
