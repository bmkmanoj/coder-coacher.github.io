com so this is a blog on the day before
some holiday I forget what it is
September fifth I even forget the name
it a holiday anyway so this blog is
about me getting on TV yeah i got on TV
well i'm getting on TV just a local show
i think it's going to be broadcast
across Quebec Ontario might be in other
provinces in Canada just in case you
guys in states province in canada is
equivalent to a state in the US how did
i get on TV well it has to do with
studio web and of course like so many
other things in this life and in this
world it's luck and contacts luck and
contacts so a good friend of mine works
at a local university he was in a
meeting talking to a bunch of people
about some unrelated subject and I came
up and Studio web came up and they were
very interested in the subject because
they're University it's all about
education yeti-yeti-yeti-yeti so one of
the people on this in this meeting
rather well somebody actually works at a
local TV station is somewhat of a
producer I guess part-time producer I
don't know all the details again pure
luck she really liked the idea if she
contacts me says hey would you like to
be on TV I said well why not so I'm
going to be on TV this coming I guess
it's Tuesday and it's going to be like a
super quick spot or be objects for five
minutes to talk about code and in
schools and modernizing education
through technologies like Stu your web
and that's about it so I'm going to have
four to five minutes to go sort of go
over everything I'm going to have to
actually wear a clean shirt and a dress
shirt rather and I have to be there at
7am in the studio they're going to do
makeup good luck with that they're going
to have but they won't do my hair that's
that's too bad and then i'm i'm on at
750 a.m. and normally i wouldn't talk
about these type of things because i'm
not comfortable with that believe it or
not other things have come up i haven't
spoken about but i'm going to talk about
it because
part of a deal I have to tweet and tell
people that I'm going to be on the show
it's some morning breakfast show up here
in Montreal and to be totally honest
with you I've never seen it why because
I don't have TV I had two huge tvs i
have a huge by today's standards or
substandard sighs I got big do big
plasmas pioneers and bottom wall a while
back and I swear to God I may put them
on once every 3-4 weeks maybe I'm a guy
watches all his video on the computer or
on my tablet even though I got these
huge plasma TVs I couldn't be bothered
to put them on it's just a strange thing
yeah tell life goals I suppose so anyway
I'm going to be on TV on that day I
guess that's the seventh this is the
sixth I guess it's the six and right
before apple launches its new iphone
their new iphone 7 i'm hoping the apple
iphone will be pretty good because for
my vlogs i'm thinking of dumping the
lumix here simply because it's it's a
bit of a pain to set up because the
autofocus is and then i have to use a
phone app here and that takes to make
sure you know 20 30 seconds a minute to
set up and with the iphone i would just
hold it up in a way i would go and of
course because when this thing autofocus
is which i have shut off now because it
makes a lot of noise when autofocus is
so you hear it in the mics it's just a
pain even though the quality of the
image is really really amazing like the
price to image quality would you get
with this little lumix panasonic 2lx 100
just case you're worried and just in
case you're interested is incredible
it's like you got the equality in this
tiny little camera cost you about 900 us
the lens alone of this quality will cost
you 1,200 bucks just a standard SLR lens
detachable lens so such a great deal the
problem is like so many things in this
life it just doesn't do everything that
you need so there's always compromises
in this camera i bought because quality
and i was going to deal with this phone
app and so on and having you know i
didn't know about the noise and the
autofocus that's the problem i didn't
know about the noise and the autofocus
another problem at the auto focus on
this camera it bounces all over the
place hey so there's nothing ever that
is perfect so what are you gonna do so
yeah i'm gonna be on TV hopefully your
friendly vlogger here won't choke I
don't know if I've ever been on TV
before I don't think I have but you know
I'm a Phi may have forgotten I've been
known to forget things like that how
important is this TV appearance going to
be for my business now some of you might
be going oh my it's going to be super
important well I don't think so i think
it's just part of many pieces that could
contribute to pushing the company
forward so what do I mean by that well
there's an old advertising rule called
the rule of seven the rule of seven hold
on it's going to make sure i got my
micron yeah i got my mic on i'm using
this thing I got my fuzzy thing here so
don't pop it and this is the h1 zoo well
it's probably that was probably blurry
because i don't have the auto focus on
so by apologies again see i have to have
the mic separate because otherwise
you're going to hear all the camera
noise it's a bit of a hassle anyway
whatever so how important the rule 7
there we go so we'll one television
appearance to it probably not on a local
TV show no get me wrong it's good to be
on a local TV show and I'm very happy
and appreciate them having me on so I
can talk about what I'm doing but at the
end of the day this is not like it's
huge TV show where I'm going to get tons
of exposure nonetheless it's it's it's
one of many contributing factors could
help the company move forward rule of
seven is an old marketing thing it takes
seven exposures before somebody remember
something something to that effect and
so if I was to appear on seven local TV
shows where they see me seven times that
would be kind of cool or they saw me on
TV and then solving your newspaper on
the web and maybe on the TV again that
would be cool but
appearing once met I don't think it's
going to be too much for me but I'm
happy to do it very happy to do it that
four minutes of fame four minutes not
even 15 minutes four minutes of fame
nonetheless I'll take it and I'll see
think I should be able to get a clip of
that video and put it out there now I
may look terrible you never know I
sometimes I screw up on these type of
things and now that I've been on TV
before but I've given presentations and
so forth and see what happens when I was
a kid I was picked in the school to
represent our school to do a comedy bit
believe it or not I know I guess we were
weak on comedic talent back in
elementary school and I choked I
remember I got to the big competition
and I just choked H I couldn't I don't
understand it's weird it wasn't normal
for me and ever since that time i had
this phobia we're going to I'm going to
choke I haven't choked as far as I know
other times in my adult life and so on
but it's weird how your childhood
experiences way back way back a long
time ago you know make 30 years ago or
so and more than that and it's still I
still remember choking on that stage so
I'm not going to choke this time because
I'm just talking about studio app
talking about the code how we teach cold
better than anybody else out there and
how important it is to have a cold
curriculum in a modern curriculum in the
classroom that's my pitch we'll talk
soon bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
