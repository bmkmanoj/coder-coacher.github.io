simplicity I've spoken about simplicity
in the past how important it was to keep
your code simple simplicity is one of
those universal principles that I don't
know I guess people take it for granted
but let me give you a quick few examples
about where I've seen simplicity in
systems play itself to be true so the
first place I observed it was in martial
arts I did martial arts for nearly 30
years maybe a little bit more than 30
years depending how you want to look at
it and what I discovered in martial arts
is that you have simple systems and you
have complex systems and the simple
systems tend to stick to the basics more
they tend to work on basic things that
make people good fighters that actually
make people good fighters then you have
the more complex systems more academic
systems where they cost she ate a lot on
theory and tons of techniques intensive
principles they don't get down to
fighting too much you know these are
martial arts but they get caught up in
all these drills and all these forms and
sets and yet they can become very
elaborate and I can tell you from my
three decades or so of training and I've
done a lot of ring fighting and I was a
bouncer I can tell you from my
experience in fact that the people who
do best in reality in fighting are the
people who are in the simpler systems
the simpler systems always work better
complexity the complex systems kind of
entertains your mind but then you
realize that a lot of these complex
martial art systems they lose sight of
what makes a good fighter and they go
down these weird paths and tangents take
him nowhere and they're convinced that
they're great fighters trust me but then
they actually get into a fight and they
take a beating and then you're wondering
why they took a beating then they come
up with all kinds of excuses and then it
still think they have the best system so
it's craziness I remember had a friend
of mine who I was in one of these
complex systems they told me said well
in the beginning first 5-10 years we're
not new as good as the other guys but
because of our system
so good and after 20 years we are the
best so that's kind of like you know
yeah I think anybody who's not
brainwashed in the circumstance realizes
how silly that sounds so let's look at
simplicity again versus complexity I was
my first business I started in the 90s
was not technology and when we
discovered we had centralized filtration
systems I won't get into details but
basically tanks connected together
through plumbing and what we discovered
it was that again simple system simple
plumbing systems work the best we tried
a few times putting together a very
elaborate system huge systems we figured
huge is better right bigger is better
it's more centralized that's the
argument doesn't work out that way it is
far more complex far more difficult to
maintain a complex system to build a
complex system and it's just not worth
it you're much better off with simple or
best medium complex system same thing
with businesses you look at business you
hardly ever see innovation from a huge
business the exception is occasionally
with apples when a Steve Jobs would pull
out the small team of people away from
the rest of the company so that they
could work freely essentially they could
work like a small business all the
innovations come from the small
businesses most of the time so the big
businesses by up to small businesses
there's a reason for that because big
huge monolithic systems are slow to
change slow to adapt and of course when
you got people who are working in big
systems they don't like too much change
that's why they're in large
organizations that's why they're in you
know mo the sweater in large
organizations that's why government is
the last as the last group to actually
change and realize the change of things
it takes people to change government
government doesn't make changes
typically and this is not a political
position this is just an observation on
my part so let's bring this all back to
code same thing with code the most
nimble apps are the smallest apps the
simplest code the simplest space basic
code
less programmers on there the better I
discovered when I had when studio web
was actually back in the 90s was a web
development studio studio web and we I
discovered you had more than three
people on a particular project the
overhead increased quite a bit in terms
of managing the group and you just saw
efficiency drop so the optimum number of
people working on a particular project
to me well from my experience was about
three so keep that in mind anyhow so
there's a few examples of simplicity I
hope you find this useful and we'll talk
soon Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
