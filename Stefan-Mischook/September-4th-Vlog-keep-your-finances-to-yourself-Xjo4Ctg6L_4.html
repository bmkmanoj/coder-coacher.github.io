going to answer a couple questions that
were put to me in the private messaging
in YouTube so I figured I'd do a video
somebody asked me about the lifestyle of
the developer they wanted to know you
know what do I earned that kind of thing
so first of all I don't mind the
question but I'm not gonna answer that
question because that's something you
shouldn't do you should never answer any
financial questions here's first tip tip
first tip from somebody who knows when
you start making money don't tell
anybody
toe tell anybody you got to stay low-key
because if people around you start
detecting that you're making more money
than them and heaven forbid a lot more
money than them they will start coming
at you they'll start coming at you
you're gonna get jealousy you're gonna
get resentment and it's gonna be it's
going to be not direct most of the time
it's going to be subtle aggressions if
you will so I can tell you from personal
experience do to tell people you're
making money stay very quiet be low-key
and just fly below the radar because
there is no advantage let me say this
again there is no advantage to letting
even family members know specially
family members don't let him know that
you're making money if they ask me I am
ok you know and stay low-key that's my
first huge bit of advice you know
besides the fu money I talked about in a
previous video
staying low key and not letting anybody
know it is important to give you an idea
when I bought my my convertible out II I
didn't tell people for months a lot of
people didn't know I had it for many
many months and the only reason they
found out was because you know they
eventually find out these things and
then you downplay it and you sort of
undercut what it's worth and yeah I know
I got the base model even though it did
Yetta Yetta Yetta all these kind of
things because I'm telling you you
people are not gonna be happy for you
most people are not gonna be happy for
you if you're making a lot of money so
there's no point to talk about it don't
ever talk about you keep yourself you be
low-key the only time that you should
feel comfortable about it is when you're
around other successful business people
entrepreneurs then you can reveal a
little bit more because they're they're
in that mindset as well what are things
that I discovered a long time ago that
they're I used to say there are two
types of people in this world people who
are employees and people who are
employers and it's not an insult to
employees it's just a question of
mindset you'll find that if you are a
business owner and you have that mindset
it's a totally different world view in
many respects from people who work for
others it really is and it's a totally
different lifestyle and you have to be
suited towards that lifestyle if you're
going to be a business owner and
entrepreneur and that's something you
have to consider so with regards to
coding in my life I've always looked at
my technical skills my coding skills my
programming skills my graphic design
skills I've looked at all these skill
sets as tools in my toolbox I did not
become a developer a coder for the sake
of becoming a developer a coder I became
a developer in 90s because I wanted to
be able to build certain types of web
apps for my own business purposes and
then eventually morphed into other
things as well where I did a lot of
freelance work etc etc etc but the
coding and the programming again for me
was a means to an end on the other hand
I have friends who are very successful
developers and that was their goal their
goal was to be developers and they're
still developers and have done very very
well by it
so it depends on what your focus is so
to answer that person's question again
you're I don't even mention the question
beginning of the vlog you know turns of
lifestyle well with my particular
endeavors the coding played a large part
in me being able to retire at 32 years
old I came out of retirement eight years
later or so because I decided that I
wanted to develop a new type of
educational app I come from a family of
teachers and I follows a teacher my
aunts and uncles and many of my cousins
are teachers so it's kind of in my blood
and I studied learning and so forth in
university at the time I was there and
so I decided to just come out of it and
to to pursue this more out of personal
interests in the anything else because
let me tell you the educational business
is much more difficult in many respects
than other types of businesses and
finally another person asked me about
their career they're learning they're
learning Python and they're learning
Flass for what development but do you
notice around them everybody's doing PHP
MySQL as a freelancers and and so he's
asking should I stick to Python she
should do PHP as I've been saying for
years now off of YouTube now on YouTube
PHP in terms of freelance development is
still the king because of the WordPress
infrastructure out there because PHP is
so widely used if you want to be a
freelancer the money's in PHP MySQL I
know it's not the hot language like like
Java Script is today but doesn't matter
it doesn't matter the demand is PHP
MySQL in most places as far as I can see
for freelancers now again I'm not
talking about PHP vs. Python flies
Python Django or PHP verses Ruby or PHP
versus Java spring etc etc I'm not
talking about this in terms of technical
I'm not evaluating them technically I'm
not evaluating the languages in terms of
their productivity and so on no no the
reason I keep saying PHP MySQL is a
choice for freelancers because that's
where the market is that's where the
demand is that's what you're gonna find
out there when you get out there how are
you gonna make your money again
emphasize for me coding languages and
tools are just a means to an end they're
tools and just like a plumber they may
have a Freight favorite wrench but they
don't get into political wars about
which wrench is better you know
everybody's got their tastes and depends
what your goals are as well
so again if you want to do freelance
work you know chances are because I
don't know every region of the world but
chances are PHP MySQL is where the money
is that's all
finally with my own work I am getting
into a stage where I'm going a lot more
marketing work now where the main
infrastructure development if you will
of my product is done it's very solid so
now I want to shift my focus from 89%
infrastructure to 8090 percent marketing
and a big part about its going to be
doing videos now not just vlogs but
actually videos that promote the product
and so forth so I am considering
investing in a much higher and camera
gear so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to put links below to some video
from a high-end camera the Canon just
put out and I want to see what you guys
saw in terms of the video koalas to see
if you actually see a difference in the
video quality I'm not going to give a
comment because I don't want it to
I don't want to suggest anything but I
would appreciate if you take a look at
those links and tell me whether or not
you feel the video quality in those
videos are significant ly superior to
the video quality what you see here
again my goal is to put out the best I
could possibly put out and so I would
appreciate your feedback in that regard
so let me know down below I don't want
to spend money on gadgets and equipment
that are not needed but I would like to
get your opinion about whether or not
you feel that the video quality of this
other camera is significant that's
pretty much it but I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
