killer sites calm in this video I want
to introduce you to this new trend of
gaming and e-learning or web learning
basically what we see happening now is
while people are companies are producing
distance learning systems stuff for the
web and they're injecting gaming ideas
and gaming principles into the systems
the idea is to make learning more like a
game and it will allow people to learn
more more easily and that is the case
actually so we've done this ourselves
with killer sites University where we're
combining ideas that I actually picked
up from popular video games like Halo
and Call of Duty things that you see on
the Xbox and the ps3 and we've
implemented these ideas and combine them
with our part of our collection of video
training tutorials on PHP JavaScript
basic web design so on so I'm going to
give you a walk through what I'm of what
i mean by the gaming principles and so
we'll take a look so first of all we
have our list of courses here and so
pretty cool so what's good sis go to how
to KSU works so essentially after the
user signs up the create account etc and
the way the system works you create the
account and then you subscribe to a
course like psych enrolling in a course
and you watch videos and in between the
videos you have a certain number of
questions that you're asked by the
system they could be multiple choice
questions they can be cold completion
questions as I have pictured here and
the thing is is as you go through the
system the system is tracking your
progress much like if you were playing a
video game this isn't the video game
would be tracking your progress and has
depending on how well you answer the
questions etc use you accumulate points
so like for instance this particular
question
in the PHP tag cloud course it's worth a
base of a hundred points and if you get
it right away you submit the solution
for this particular question right away
you get the 400 points but if you submit
solutions and here you have to actually
type out cold you're asked a question to
open in connection to a database using
MySQL hi and so you type out the code
and if you get it right you get the
hundred points so you don't get it right
you lose five points and it works in
that way it even has a help system
hinting system where you can get hints
as to what the answer is but again the
hints cost you points in this case cost
you 25 point per hint so the idea is
that we with the gaming scoring idea
excuse me with the scoring idea
implemented in the system it encourages
the user to to think about what they're
doing and to try to really you know get
the answer right right away but at the
same time I've incorporated some basic
ideas but I believe in and one of them
one of them is that you know in real
life people don't succeed the first time
in fact they fail many times and the
difference between people who were
successful and people are not as much
more to do with people who are
successful keep they keep trying over
and over again whereas those are
unsuccessful try once and they fail or
they never try so we're always
encouraging in our system for people to
keep trying so that's why when you
try to answer and you get it wrong you I
lose five points but if you go for a
handout you lose 25 points in addition
to the points we have something called
the badges now here we are here's a
here's a sample profile you notice these
badges here and badges are currently
think about Cub Scout badges or Scout
badges and in video games like Halo or
Call of Duty or something they there I
figured that color under cult badges or
rewards and as you do task and you know
you're exceptional if you will within
the system you can unlock these badges
and there's a lot of them so if I go to
our badges page points and badges here
we go so far we have these are courses
and even reach courts that you complete
you can think of it as a level in a
video game for each course that you
complete you get a badge and then we
also have activity badges you know
basically off first lesson completed
first chapter if you complete an entire
chapter without hints you get the no
hints badge and etc etc we're going to
be developing more badges as a system
matures so there you go by integrating
the whole gaming experience within the
context of learning a technology or
anything really we encourage the user to
to engage with the system more you know
to pay more attention to what they're
doing and hopefully they'll learn more
quickly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
