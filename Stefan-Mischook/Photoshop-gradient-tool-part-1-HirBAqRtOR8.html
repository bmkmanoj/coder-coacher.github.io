with the gradient tool in Photoshop as
you'll see the Photoshop default is the
paint bucket tool but if you press and
hold on that tool as you would with any
other that have a small triangle at the
base of them you'll notice that there is
another tool nested within that tool bar
and this time what we're going to be
choosing is the gradient tool as you can
see here the gradient tool creates a
gradient from one color to another color
and gradually increases between the two
so in this case where we're using black
and white we will see a number of
different shades of gray between those
two darker and lighter as you can see up
here of course as with any other tool we
have options for those particular tools
and in this case the gradient tool shows
a number of different options including
the different types of gradients that
you can be using linear radial or
otherwise and the different blend modes
that you could be using more on that a
little bit later especially when you see
the tutorial on layers and blend modes
as well you can also affect capacity but
as we'll see i'll be showing you how to
create opacity specific to each color we
can also reverse the gradient you can
have dinner checked or unchecked and as
you can see what it does is reduce the
banding which means the amount of lines
between are less noticeable transparency
of course whether or not it's permitted
so let's begin with the gradient tool
and notice that by default I'm using the
black and white colors here and that has
given me a gradient of black and white
let's see how we can apply these
gradients you'll notice that the toolbar
is this cursor
and what I'm going to be doing with this
object at the moment is to drag it in
any particular direction I've chosen in
this case a linear gradient and as
you'll see the lines that are created in
this gradient go in a linear fashion
horizontal vertical whatever the case
may be if you want a perfectly straight
gradient you can press shift to hold
things in a straight line and as you can
see we can also do that diagonally
among other things
notice that you can also apply a radial
gradient in this case you'll notice that
the black area is centered on this
object and wherever I stretch this out
too you'll notice that if I make a
longer line the gradient increases
between black and white if I make a
shorter line it is a very small gradient
as we see in this case
also note that if I were to reverse the
linear gradient we'd have a decidedly
different effect now white is leading
the black and white is our center point
there's also other kinds of gradients as
you can see here one is an angled
gradient and this one's a little bit
more unusual but still can be come in
handy depending on what exactly you are
doing with it some filters can be
applied to this effect to create some
interesting files there is also another
one which is referred to as the
reflected gradient and this one usually
shows on not just merely one color going
to another but it reflects the gradient
so it gives sort of like a mirror image
above this this is wonderful for
creating different interface elements
that will work with gradients in
particular and shadow and light to
create a vari-angle three-dimensional
look as you can see here the last one is
the diamond gradient and that one might
be useful for creating space star
escapes but I really haven't used it all
that much nevertheless you'll probably
get the most use out of your linear
gradients and your radial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
