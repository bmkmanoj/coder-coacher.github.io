and other sites so in this video I want
to remind you of the importance of
mastering the basics if you you know my
videos you see a lot of times I
emphasize that I emphasize that the
basics are the most important aspect of
any programming language or any of the
languages really so when you are first
learning to code of course you're
concentrating on the basics and the
inclination is to think that as you
become a more advanced coder you'll have
more advanced techniques this is true
but actually what separates the good
coders from the not-so-good coders is
that the good coders have a having an
advanced understanding of the basics
knowing not just how to use objects and
functions and arrays properly but
knowing how to use them in sophisticated
ways to understand what it makes sense
to use a particular type of array when
it makes sense to design your object
hierarchy in a particular way and so on
so forth if this is kind of confusing to
you because you're a beginner all you
need to take away from this is that to
really become a great coder you have to
really get a good understanding a deep
understanding of the basics so it's not
about learning every single framework
out there it's about having a deep
understanding of the basics because when
you have that when you really really
internalize to understand the basic
concepts and the basic techniques and
the basic good practices of coding all
these frameworks whether it be PHP
frameworks or or JavaScript frameworks
whatever all these frameworks become
pretty easy to understand because all
framework is is just a bunch of basic
code layered on top of each other so
that you don't have to write all these
layers yourself again so there you go as
you're developing your coding skills I
suggest that you spend time a little bit
of time to always go back and really
dig deeper into things that you think
you know already so for example in the
PHP world if you think you really
understand how functions work that's
cool then start looking at more advanced
use of functions you know in terms of
default arguments different return types
maybe when you're looking at arrays look
at the different types of race why would
you want to use one type array or versus
another look at performance issues in a
race you find that different languages
for instance certain ray types might be
more performant given a certain
circumstance so there you go so that's
the point of this video
concentrate on your basics when you're
beginning and then as you continue to
progress and slowly learn new things
which you know you know I'm not saying
you don't learn you new frameworks and
new techniques but always spend a little
bit of time to come back and read study
go deeper into some of the basic
subjects and you'll see that really
separates the difference between you and
the average coder and the reason I talk
about this because I was speaking to a
friend of mine who now is a co-founder
of a startup and he was one of my
mentees somebody who trained under me
for several years and he was talking
about that now that he's hiring many
coders and when he finds again is if the
coders who have a better grasp of the
basics are much better coders than those
who may have superficial understanding
of a whole bunch of different libraries
and so on and that's what it comes down
to master your basics as you continue to
learn revisit the basics go back to them
dig a little bit deeper into subjects
that may seem boring because IRA know
what array is I don't know what function
sorry I already know basic objects go
back into those those basics and it will
do you good
in in the long run in the short run -
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
