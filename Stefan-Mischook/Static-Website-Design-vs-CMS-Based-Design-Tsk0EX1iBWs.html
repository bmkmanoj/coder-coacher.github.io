and other sites so in this vlog would
answer a question that was put to me
recently do you build static sites or
sites based on a CMS a content
management system so it just in case you
don't know a content management system
is an app like WordPress Drupal Joomla
these are pieces of software that you
install on a web server and they help
with content management you could post
articles and upload the images and do
all kinds of stuff set categories etc
except centers that are Sara so to give
you some context CMS's are used quite a
bit in websites today it's as much as
thirty thirty five percent of the
world's websites are powered by some
sort of CMS and that's that's a rough
figure could be a bit more actually so
the big king of it all of course is
WordPress WordPress power something like
twenty seven percent twenty five percent
of the world's websites just WordPress
so that's significant to consider so the
larger question is well I'm just gonna
read the question when you build for a
client to use a specific CMS or do you
build static sites he goes on this guy
to say I've been trying to gather a
consensus a consensus on the best
approach for designing sites for clients
and well everyone seems to have a
different opinion on the subject I'm
interested to know your opinion so what
I said was that long as I just opened up
so many sites are based on Joomla Drupal
and especially WordPress and there's a
reason for because they bring a lot to
the table to bring a lot of bonus
functionality a lot of free
functionality to a website now I believe
the days of static websites what I mean
by static web sites web sites that are
just HTML CSS may be a little bit of
JavaScript here and there and they're
not connected to any database you're not
part of a content management system just
the traditional type of web site I think
that business of building traditional
website
is going to become more and more
difficult in terms of making and living
as a freelancer and there's a couple
reasons for that
number one a lot of small business
owners which are 80% of businesses are
if they just want a static website
because they're not designed training
about majority of them because they
don't have the eyes to see the
difference between a great-looking
design from scratch versus some template
or versus a website builder like a Wix
or something if you come to a client
with just the ability to build static
websites you're going to be severely
limiting your job prospects your gig
prospects so I would strongly suggest
that you do pick a particular content
management system and you learn it and
you learn to skin them basically add the
template and modify them and work with
them there was a big business in that
and many years ago I don't know what it
was maybe 2008 something like this 2006
I'm not sure when I coined the term haha
I don't know maybe somebody else came up
with this term before me but I wrote I
came up with the idea of the WordPress
web designer and this whole idea back
then I said there's gonna be a huge
business opportunity for for web
developers what designers who just work
with WordPress and in fact that is the
case and some people who made a lot of
money doing that you know custom
wordpress templates building wordpress
plugins and providing that expertise you
would be surprised how many small
businesses are driven on WordPress so I
know a lot of developer types of all
designer type subway I don't know we're
pressed and I'm one to complain about
WordPress but it's the reality of the
situation so to work with WordPress of
course you need to know your HTML html5
your css3 and a little bit of JavaScript
but it's also good to know a little bit
of PHP because WordPress is created with
PHP so if you want to go a little deeper
in terms of your WordPress skills in
terms of the
the services that you provide for
WordPress you know PHP is just gonna
make your life that much easier on top
of that I want to bring up a wider issue
the idea of the web designer versus the
web developer now web designer to me is
a is a throwback the term it's a
profession that has reference to the 90s
early 2000s maybe I know a lot of people
so think about web design they talk
about web design I think a better way of
describing the modern-day web designer
if you will is you would describe him as
a front-end developer versus the
back-end developer so the back-end
developer is the person right in the PHP
or the Django Python Java Ruby the
person building the apps behind the
scenes the engine of dynamic websites
now the front-end web developer is a
person who's building the user interface
the UI the visual components of a
website of a web app and so yeah so
that's what I would really call the
modern-day web designer I would really
call them front-end web front-end
developers or front-end web developers
because they're really much more there's
much more about code with modern-day web
design much more is much more about user
experience UX than there was in the past
you see back in the day if you built a
nice-looking site you know maybe add
some search engine friendliness to it
and they used to call this we call this
se-ho basically making sure that your
code is optimized for searches of course
these days if you do proper web
development you write your code properly
for your websites you don't need to you
don't need to make your code compatible
with the search engines it's already
compatible with the search engines for
two reasons a the code is better be
everybody codes better rather and
the search engines are better at what
they do
so in the old days it was much more
about aesthetics how good looked these
days if you're developing websites
you really are front end web developer
because you have to not only understand
how but it looks good you have to make
it look good you have to make it work
good so that's where user experience
come comes in UX and then you're
probably gonna have to have some sort of
knowledge about how to structure your
code so it works with back-end coders so
you need to really understand code and
to even make use full use of html5 and
css3 these days you have to know a
little bit of JavaScript programming
because a lot of the power in html5 and
css3 not all of it but a lot of it comes
unlocked when you understand a little
bit of JavaScript if you want to get it
you're gonna need to learn a little bit
of jQuery as well you have to be a
master at it but jQuery you know you
could you could fledged through without
knowing JavaScript but if you know just
the basics of JavaScript your ability to
use jQuery will be you know you'll be
ten times more productive so yeah
there's other frameworks bootstrap and
so on so you know these days modern day
web design has much more to do with
front and front and web development
rather than design so I think the days
of the peer designer somebody who
develops the user interface for a
website or a web app just so that it
looks good I think those jobs are fading
simply because the web is much more
sophisticated web sites are much more
sophisticated so you as a developer have
to be much more sophisticated let me
give you context and a story back in the
90s what we had to do in terms of coding
and a web site was a totally different
event today the average web designer in
the mid-90s a lot of them didn't know
anything about code a lot of them were
graphic designers who moonlighted as web
designers and they would use a product
like go live or Dreamweaver or something
or front page and they would just cut up
slice up their Photoshop
images where they would lay out their
sites in Photoshop and that was it you
know it's all those web design has
really changed quite a bit it got much
more sophisticated and so in year 2000
2001 when the web standards movement
took place where everybody started
thinking smart about Cole about writing
good code good HTML CSS code a lot the
time in the late 90s early 2000s all
about XHTML which is just that anyway
forget about XHTML we don't do that
anymore but point is is that the game
changed the game of what a web designer
did change it went from being what was
mid-90s to when it became in early 2000
so now we're in you know 2016
unbelievable hot time flies the game has
changed again in the last five years or
so so you know give or take a year so
yes
bottom line should you just do static
sites well if you're really good
designer you might be able to scrape
together living but Tanja the business
and the action is with using some sort
of content management system and these
days because of its popularity WordPress
is probably your best bet
I'm not saying WordPress is the best on
a technical level I'm just saying it's
probably it is the most popular and
there's so many companies use it it's
well worth your time and your money to
learn WordPress and to work with it and
yes it can be a pain trust me I know all
right I hope you found this useful
