killer sites calm so this is a video
blog about something totally unrelated
to web programming and design but
related to anyway whatever so you see in
the screen in front of you happy 40th
birthday Dungeons and Dragons if you've
not heard of a game it's a nerds
role-playing game it came out in the
early 70s I got into it as a kid in the
80s and a super fun great game and
actually Dungeons and Dragons did help
me to some extent with my programming
skills because I played the role in
Dungeons and Dragons a lot of times as
with a role that's called the dungeon
master and that's that's basically the
person who sets up and runs the game and
when you're structuring an adventure in
Dungeons and Dragons it requires a lot
of organization lot of research to
create a balanced game to allow the
story to unfold and you also get into a
lot of details of terms of lots of books
you're going to read and and it I
actually leaned on some of my dungeon
mastering experience in Dungeons and
Dragons when i started writing software
and even when i started leading small
teams of web developers and web
designers my ability to lead and
structure systems part of it anyway came
from my experience in setting up
adventures in dungeons and dragons and
it was a heck of a lot of fun and I just
wanted to pay homage to dungeons and
dragons is a great game it's still
running apparently I have been played in
many many years and it's still popular I
have still friends but I used to play
with back when I was a teenager they
still play today amazingly and they
quite enjoy it I recommend it if
if you you may want to take a look at
the game or maybe if you have kids 8 12
years of 12 12 years old and older I
think you'll find that they'll really
enjoy the game it's really addictive but
the great thing about it teaches kids to
on a research and read and especially if
they become the dungeon master which is
the game controller it will help them
with organization and I help them with
structuring and leading a team managing
a team so it's a lot of fun it's a great
thing it's a very different experience
than playing a video game and as they
mentioned in this article that just came
on on yahoo here a lot of big video
games are really they find their source
that our inspiration of your if you will
is from D&amp;amp;D and a lot of the creators of
these big games you used to play D&amp;amp;D D&amp;amp;D
a short for Dungeons and Dragons of
course and that's my little video blog
there we go job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
