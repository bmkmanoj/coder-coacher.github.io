what we're going to be doing is taking
these images here which are not linking
anything they're just dummy links at
this moment and we're going to go about
creating the secondary elements on this
page and in this site in other words
we're going to make page two three and
four so let's go about doing that what
I'm going to ask you to do is to open up
your files window or as you can see here
you can click on this icon and what I
would ask you to do is to keep our root
folder nice and neat in other words I
would like us to actually go about right
clicking on this element and saying new
folder so I'm not going to put the other
pages right next to the index page we're
just going to put them inside this
folder here and this folder i will just
name web it's not necessarily an
industry standard or anything like that
but it just indicates to me as you know
I'm trying to be as intuitive as
possible and our naming convention here
says look all the other web pages are
inside this folder called web so I'm
going to right click on that and ask you
to create a new file in this new file I
want you to name as we can see here
we've decided for about gallery contact
so let's just add those about dot HTML
right click again new file i'm going to
call this one gallery dot HTML and one
more time new file and we're going to
call this one not gallery not about but
contact so now we've got these three
pages inside of web which I can collapse
and expand I'm going to ask you to keep
it expanded now if you were to open up
any one of these pages just like before
these are blank pages now don't worry
about that so much because we will
populate those pages with information
soon enough and in fact we will not have
to rebuild things since we've got the
index page here built already and I'm
happy with the way it looks what we're
just going to do is just copy paste it
and
create the about gallery and contact
page based on what we have here now you
might remember I promised that in those
other pages we are going to create a two
column design instead of a three column
design well that'll all work itself out
in just a second when we get to that
point but before we do anything else why
don't we fix these links and make sure
that they actually work so one of the
things that I can do is to actually show
you a little trick here I'm going to
just open up the files window i'm going
to place it over here on the side and
the reason I'm doing that is so that I
could show you this little trick there's
a lot of ways of creating links that is
no longer the link that I want so one of
the ways I could do that is to just say
browse for file down here in the
properties window select your element
you know whether that be text or whether
that be the image as this one is and
once that image is selected then to
apply link to it we can come here we can
browse for the file right so just click
on this and point to the file that you
want that's a great way to do it not
really a problem but here's another way
you can actually click down on the point
to file icon don't let go keep dragging
it over to the file you want to point to
in this case the about HTML page when
you let go there you go you got your
link in place and it basically says go
to the folder called web find me about
HTML exactly what happened now i'm going
to select this particular piece of text
and we're going to get rid of that link
i'll point to the file remember this is
supposed to go to the gallery section so
here i am i'm going to let go when I'm
on top of the gallery section and look
at the link nice easy way of creating
that so I'm going to do the same thing
for contact and as you can see that's
all done nicely in place so save that
file command s you can even preview this
if you wish for example if i go to
firefox and i click on this page did it
work I don't know it's got a blank page
well as you can see up here
what are we pointing to we're pointing
to on the desktop type route in a folder
called web the about HTML page all right
fantastic so in other words we know that
things are working this is going to
gallery I'll hit the back this is going
to contact so that's all fine and dandy
now what we're going to do is to talk
about creating the graphics that we're
going to be using for the second third
and fourth pages and we will switch to a
from a three-column layout and switch to
a two column layout basically what we're
going to be going for is having this
element here having a larger image over
here with some text underneath it and
that might incur scrollbar but should be
fine and in this section I also want a
place you know two or three other links
because we don't have these ones up at
the top anymore either so that's what
we're going to be doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
