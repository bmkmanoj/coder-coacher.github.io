killer side to kill PHP calm in this new
low res video blog the new video blog
format that I'm using that makes it easy
for me to create video blogs that
quality of video is not as high as it
used to be the sound quality may not be
as good as it used to be but I think it
will make it a lot easier for me to put
out blogs anyway so in this video blog I
want to talk about something called
refactoring code now refactoring is
basically just the process of taking
very messy code and making it less messy
and it's something that you do as you're
building out your app some people think
you build your application right out of
code and then you go back and you start
cleaning it up and start you know taking
huge big messy functions and turning
them to small neater functions no the
best way to handle refactoring is to
actually continuously refactor your code
as you're going through your code not
six months later not two weeks later the
reason you want to do that is because as
you're writing code as you're doing
things it's fresh in your head you know
what's going on and it's going to be
much easier for you as a programmer to
refactor code at that moment so let me
give you a quick example of one type of
refactoring that you can do there's many
different strategies now a lot of these
refactoring strategies are visually
derived from a very from a very famous
mom not famous I guess I'm sure total
Java nerd they're the seminal book on
refactoring is something called
refactoring by Fowler so this is the
book famous book and for PHP people
though this may not be super useful well
it can be because code is called
it's all written in Java for Java but
everything applies 100% regardless of
the language PHP JavaScript Ruby etc
they basically look at me factoring and
you give you different refactoring
strategies kind of like design patterns
you know this way so what I want to
demonstrate in this video to close off
this video is a very basic refactoring
something called extract method as
defined in this book if you're in PHP it
would be called extract function so let
me just give you an idea what we're
looking at so here's a snippet from a
site I forget what saying is so I
apologize so here's a basic PHP function
that prints an order now of course this
example is designed to teach an idea
it's not you know I don't know any
function to be echoing out all these
different things to page but nonetheless
so what you do what you have years you
know it's a smallish func it's pretty
small function but you see it has two
main purposes one purpose is to print
out or description time and then and
then there's another purpose I'm just
reading off to off the screen here is to
to get the store order status so as
there's basically two different logical
things going on in this function so
that's a good candidate for a
refactoring where you can extract a
method to separate out these two logical
tasks so for instance I look at this and
say okay you got the one where you're
printing out the order and it's your
description creation time and then one
where you're actually outputting an
order status so the refactoring this was
provided by this author really I wish I
knew who was I forget he's separated
like so so you turn into two functions
where first function print order calls
the print order status function so he
takes all this print order status code
let me just grab it from here he takes
all his print order status code and he
puts it into its own function and you
look now if you look at these two sets
of code and it's easier
this there we go
if you look at it this is a much easier
block of code to me than this see it's a
lot simpler right and that's the whole
point of your factoring now this is a
very simple example but you can see
these huge God methods these huge mega
methods with tons of his statements and
in the function if this and then Allison
that to do this order coffee these type
of huge methods they're prime candidates
for this extract method refactoring so
Bash is one of many it was all kinds do
whole books have been written on this if
you're into Java this is the book for
you for sure if you're into PHP there
are peach pea with factoring books and
I'm sure there's plenty tutorials online
but just take advantage of so very go so
what to take away from this video is
what refactoring is it's the process of
cleaning up code when should you
refactor while you're writing the codes
no point in going back six months later
although that may come up best time of
the factors as you're writing yes it
will slow it down a bit but in the end
you're gonna find yourself with a much
more robust code base see another
candidate for a track function you're
factoring the first one I mentions and
you have two logical things going on in
a function another one is I mentioned
you have lots of if statements lots of
conditionals if you have more than three
condition was the chances already you
could do a little extract function in
there and you can call it another
function call and the final one it was
in my head I'm trying to remember what
it was also that comes it comes to me
the final one is when you have a
functionality within a function that
could possibly be reused elsewhere
something that you know
for instance with print or perhaps the
rest your application couldn't really
use this because it's all kinds of
specific information here but perhaps
print order status could be that
functionality could be used by many
other functions within your app so that
might be a good candidate to create a
smaller finer fine grain function rather
than what you have in this big messy
thing to begin with
so there you go that's as refactoring
I'm demonstrating with PHP here you get
the general idea and I hope you found
