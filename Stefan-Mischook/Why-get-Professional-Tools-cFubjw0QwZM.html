new camera setup they've noticed the I
guess the difference in the image
quality and you know what I think that
maybe 10 20 % of people might see the
difference in image quality on YouTube
with this high-end camera but I just
bought and well let me show you what it
is
you
so that is a canon cinema camera c200
just came out and the significance of
this camera is that it's able to shoot
super high quality video not nearly as
expensive as cameras that preceded it
now it's still pretty expensive like in
US dollars at seventy five hundred bucks
and I didn't put on a nice lens that
cost me about a grand that I put on a
nice high-end lavalier mic that cost me
another grand so you're looking at like
thirty five eighty five ninety five
hundred dollars or for tax to get this
thing going
so you're asking how would you do that
stuff well because I shoot video every
day and though only maybe twenty percent
of you might consciously see the quality
difference one of the big reasons that
did is that it gives me a lot of
flexibility with professional tools
whether it be a camera whether it be ID
ease whatever what professional tools
one of the things that you get out of it
is fault tolerance meaning but the
equipment is much more capable so that
there's much less chance that's gonna
you can have problems so the workflow is
improved quite a bit when you're using
professional gear so I'm able to put out
videos much more easily with this gear I
have a lot more flexibility in terms of
when I can shoot video how I shoot video
the different lighting and so on so I'm
not just paying for image quality I'm
paying for flexibility and power and
reliability it's extremely reliable and
so far so good I have no complaints with
it a lot of my work these days a
shooting video YouTube is part of it but
I'm shooting other stuff as well outside
of YouTube so just having that very
dependable camera and having another
camera in fact it's just very cool so if
you're doing vlogs and you're beginner
don't even think about getting a $7,500
the video camera but at some point if
it's justifiable meaning you're doing a
lot of work then in video then you would
get it and that goes with any tool how
do you judge whether or not to get a
professional level tool well if you're
doing professional work you're making
money because if a professional tool can
save you just twenty
Center your time improve the quality by
20% it's worth getting it's definitely
worth getting in the grand scheme of
things for me I'm fairly
well-established you know it's not a big
deal but in the grand scheme of things
7,500 bucks for camera to improve my
video quality and to prove improve my
workflow is well worth the money for me
so I'll keep that in mind and think
about that in terms of all of your
professional gear right think about that
as well now this is not the same as
buying yourself a fancy new couch or
something that you don't really need or
you know or a super high-end monitor you
may or may not need you may need it
depending on the type of work you do you
see that you just got to consider the
productivity increases that it gives you
and other workflow benefits that
professional gear will give you besides
the quality difference and that's pretty
much it bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
