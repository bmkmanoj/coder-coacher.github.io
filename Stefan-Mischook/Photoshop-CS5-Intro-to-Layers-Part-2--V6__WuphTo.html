and we will do so by now talking about
how to organize our layers just a little
bit better and work with things in an
easier fashion so in the last one if you
remember we did talk about how to select
and auto select those particular layers
that we had available but you'll notice
when you create new layers what's going
to happen is by default they're just
going to be called layer 0 layer 1 layer
2 and if you already envision that that
would be rather confusing you're
absolutely correct when you have you
know over you know 500 different layers
or something like that that's a little
overzealous I must admit but even if you
had 50 layers to deal with well that's
really going to be problematic should
you choose to continue with this
simplistic naming convention so the best
thing for you to do is to actually
rename those layers for example layer 0
is fine because you know it's the base
layer you don't really have to rename
that but if you wanted to you just have
to double click on the actual layer
itself and I could call this the BG or
background layer and then this you know
I could just double click this and say
black brush perhaps would be good and I
could call this the red brush just by
doing this and you'll notice that
there's some other things that we can do
with these particular layers as we go
around creating them and doing different
things with them up to this point I've
been able to show you yes you just have
to click and move around one of these
layers in that fashion but notice with
this ever versatile black arrow tool the
move tool I could also click and drag
but let's see what happened here when I
click the end dragged it actually
selected the background layer and moved
it commands EDD will bring it back so
there's often times when there are
certain layers that you would like to
lock so in this case I could come up
here with this layer selected and click
on the little padlock icon right there
notice now that this layer will not be
able to be selected
however that allows me to now mark key
in this area so if i wanted to with the
move tool i could click and drag and
notice as you click and drag take a look
at what's happening over here notice
only the red is selected as soon as I
come in to the black the black is
selected you don't have to select the
whole thing notice I'm just coming in
here and just including in my marquee
selection just a little bit of both but
that selects both of them and now I can
move both of them together so that's one
way that you could select things
together you could also click on one and
then shift-click on another and that
allow you to select or if you wanted to
you know select more than one here let
me create another layer here which I'll
call green brush and then I will click
on my colors over here and I'll just
grab something green maybe something a
little bit more noticeable and with my
brush tool just going to come in here
and squiggle around some green lines so
that's on the green brush layer now
let's just say I wanted to select more
than one at a time well we certainly saw
that we could just Marky and all three
will be selected at the same time
however what if I only wanted to select
one and another well you could click on
one here the black one is selected and I
could shift click on yet another so
notice even though the red is in between
those two I was able to select just the
two that I wanted and the red stays put
just by moving around like that which is
great and again an easy thing to do over
here as well what if I want to select
all well we said shift click ok I'm just
going to come back and click on the
green what if I want just the green and
the black press command and you'll click
just those two and notice you'll be able
to move just those two and that's really
fantastic easy enough to work with now
what if I wanted to move around the
particular stacking order of this little
layer palette here for example what if I
wanted the red brush on top of the
green brush so I'll just drag it and
place it on top notice now the red is on
top of the green what about putting the
black on top of the red there you go so
it's really easy to move around these
brushes and move them around and do
different things with them and select
them and move them either individually
or as a group just by doing things like
that so it really makes it quite easy
for you to work and keep things together
in track but as you'll see in the next
video tutorial there's a few more things
that we're going to have to discuss when
it comes to layers and what we can do
with them so we'll come back and do that
in just a second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
