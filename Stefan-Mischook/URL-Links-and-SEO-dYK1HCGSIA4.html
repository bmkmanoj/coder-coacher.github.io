killer sites calm just in case you want
to know this is me in this screencast I
want to talk about URL paths and and
links and how they affect SEO search
engine optimization and the usability of
your website I'm going to teach you how
you should construct your links so that
they tell users and search engine's
immediately about the various subjects
on various pages on your sites so let's
first look at a couple of basic URLs
like killer sites com or je koi kaam etc
so and cute video store of course so
let's go back to kill the sites calm and
well let's talk about killer size killer
sites is an old URL and it gives people
only a vague idea of what it's about
people often are confused about what's
killer sites about so it's a pretty good
URL in that it's short and pretty easy
to spell but it's not as good as other
URLs simply because it doesn't tell the
people viewing it what the site might be
about so let's compare and contrast that
to killer PHP now this is a sister site
that I developed and teaches PHP basics
and object oriented PHP killer PHP i
think is a more obvious name it has the
advantage of being short and catchy
killer easy to remember that word PHP if
you're in the web design world even a
little bit into it you know what PHP is
about so you got a pretty good idea of
what this site is going to be belt
killer if you're not from North America
or Europe if you're from other parts of
world killer is a
it has a positive connotation in certain
contexts meaning it means something
really good it's it's positive it's not
killer as in killing just just for those
international viewers out there let's
look at another domain name so let's see
an old site we put together well I put
together how to build websites calm now
in one sense this is a horrible domain
because you get all these little dashes
here right you imagine somebody you know
you're giving this domain out to
somebody and you have to you know spell
it out for them on a piece of you know
how dash to dash build a you get
the idea it's kind of silly but on the
other in the other hand it's actually a
pretty good domain name in terms of you
know better it's really clear what the
website is about now since most people
actually will do a search on the web so
I searched google as they all right web
design tutorial and look at how to build
websites number one on Google so you see
I didn't really have to type out how to
build websites com I just had to write
it in here I just did click through
rather and I got to the site so there's
a certain disadvantage of having a very
long-winded domain name like this in
that it's hard to type out but there's
also a tremendous advantage in that it
can be used to describe the nature of
the site so it's not necessarily great
for branding but it's good for the user
because they don't know what it's about
without even having to read anything and
your search engines will know what the
site is about without having to do much
and you know nobody knows how much
Google and the other search engines put
weight in terms of the basic URL that
you have your basic domain name in
weight meaning you know how much they
value it in terms of the search rankings
but I suspect it's still pretty high
because if I have a cycle how to build
websites com Google's probably willing
to say figure about it's not
about fishing you know they probably you
know their person is at the end you know
Google's algorithm chopstick putting a
lot of ways okay the site is probably
about this particular subject since this
is the base domain or url url is short
for a universe resource locator this in
case you're not up to speed on that yet
it's a nurse way of saying links I
suppose so we've looked at a few
different types of domains the short
easy ones like killer PHP and it tells
you something about the site oval
doesn't really save and it's a tutorial
site video site but it tells you it's
about PHP whereas killer sites is even
more ambiguous because it's you know it
basically you know it doesn't say killer
you know maybe if it was killer websites
be better of all it's not our domain so
don't go there what's the next thing we
see we have Q a JavaScript of course
let's look at CSS tutorial now CSS
tutorial I would argue is amongst the
best of the domain names because it's
very short and concise and it tells you
a lot about the site right so if we type
in just curious we go CSS tutorial my
suit you're searching Google here and as
you can see the w3schools beats me out
but these are the guys who actually
handle all the web standards these are
the main honchos but we're number three
so that's uh that's pretty good actually
so we're the second sight on as far as
Google in terms of importance and again
we have our tutorial eight parts or
whatever you know three parts and that's
it so there you go you've learned a
little bit about you are elves the
importance of URLs having
self-describing domain names are kind of
cool and shorter is better but sometimes
there's a trade-off where you might use
a long winded one like how to build
websites to get out the meaning of the
site let's look at something a little
bit deeper when you get into URL so if
we go into let's say we go into a sigh
like so I'm in my blog here and I'm
going to show you how let's go into this
one okay so let's what's this is
actually the killer video store and
we're in a sub section we're in the
Dreamweaver subsection where we list the
various Dreamweaver videos that we have
video courses that we have now if you
look at the URL up here it says videos
dash Dreamweaver you know dot PHP this
is a pretty good URL because it tells
the web browsers as web search engines
rather but this is a page about
Dreamweaver videos you know as we use a
dash and we didn't have we don't we
could have have videos and then
Dreamweaver what a dash the reason we
put in dashes because it makes it easier
for the search engines to decipher the
meaning of the page so if I had videos
Dreamweaver dot PHP it would be a little
bit more difficult for Google and the
other engines to decipher the meaning of
the page but by having a dash the search
engines are smart enough to know that
you know these are two separate words
and thus attribute meaning to this
particular page we show you an example
let me show you an example now of a
crappy walnut crappy but not necessarily
the best URL because it gets just a
little bit too long maybe and this is
right here now this is in our magazine
which is really just a wordpress blog
and it's dated by year we don't go by
month we date by year and this is the
title of the particular post now this
again it's kind of cool in the sense
that it tells people what's going on on
this page but it's also really verbose
and in fact this URL is kind of disguise
its too much there's too much here
because there's some information on in
this URL string listen
when I say string a string of text it
goes back to programmers talk there's
too much text here and the text that's
too much is this stuff disk to see this
is a video off of this two of our
dreamweaver cs5 course of course but
this too is really not very important
for most people visiting the site when
better if it have been dreamer cs5 dash
video tutorial text fields dash arias
now this is long to begin with even if I
took this out but and thats the beta mo
maybe could have dreamweaver phi cs5
dodge text fields dash area so it could
have took it out maybe all this and you
have a much shorter URL i would have at
least remove this yeah that we've been
better not that again I don't think
anybody is going to actually be trying
to type out one of these URLs by hand
they'll just click through from some
other site or from within our blog
itself so there you go so I think you've
picked up a few things terms of SEO tips
usability tips and structure tips you
can also learn from URL structures in
terms of how to organize the site so the
site is logical from the users
perspective I'll have to give it to that
