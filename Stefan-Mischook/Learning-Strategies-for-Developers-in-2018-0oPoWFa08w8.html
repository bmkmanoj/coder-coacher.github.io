we're going to talk about how to quickly
learn software development actually this
is how you quickly learn anything now
how do you do that
well you understand the brain how does
your brain work how does your brain
acquire knowledge the key is not how
long you learn necessarily its but how
often you learn it's better to spend 20
minutes a day coding than to spend every
day than to spend 2 hours 3 times a week
and it's not because of how much time
you spend on it it's the frequency that
really plays a role now believe me wrong
you have to spend a certain amount of
time rule number one about learning the
brain can only take in so much
information per day I think the maximum
it can handle in terms of like really
heavy-duty thinking and that includes
learning to program it's about four
hours three to four hours depending on
the individual of course some people
have more capacity to do that some
people have less it's about three to
four hours for the average person so
after three or four hours of intense
mental work I'd say that's pretty much
it and in fact they've done studies
where they track students where they
have three block three hours three-hour
blocks there we go three hour blocks of
learning people tend to remember the
first hour and the last hour and forget
everything in the middle keep that in
mind
so the rule number one no more than
three to four hours out of sitting in
terms of intense mental work because
your productivity will begin to drop
quite a bit experienced developers will
tell you that it comes the same thing to
learning let's talk about frequency
remember I said that it was more
important in terms of the frequency of
your learning if you will or if how many
times you learn per week versus how many
hours you spend why is that because the
way the brain responds is that it
responds to things that it sees often
when you expose it to learning to code
on a daily basis just for even 20
minutes the brain will start going
that must be important I better put some
more energy into learning this stuff so
frequency is more important than the
amount of time that you spend you're
better off to Train 20 minutes a day
learning to code then do two hours every
two days that makes sense you do 20
minutes a day six days a week give
yourself a day off once you know once at
least once a week twice a week you see
you're going to learn much more quickly
because what happens is you're
triggering the brain so after seven
cycles the brain will go hey this guy
Steph he's spending a lot of times these
keeps coming back every day you're
trying to learn how to code I met her I
better put some energy into learning how
to code you're something you have to
understand about the brain the brain
roughly this is very rough there's
there's two parts of your brain there's
a higher thinking brain the conscious
brain but were aware of the brain that
adds does math the brain that
understands logic and then you have the
lizard brain the brain we actually share
with lizards and monkeys and this is the
powerful brain the lizard brain is a
super powerful brain it actually
controls everything controls our hearts
beat it controls all the information
coming in through the five senses in
fact the lizard brain the lower brain
processes about 10 million pieces of
information per second 10 million pieces
of information per second compare that
to our conscious brain to brain what
we're up the thinking brain it processes
about 40 not 40,000 or 44 million 40
pieces of information so in a nutshell
the higher brain our conscious brain the
brain that's used to do logical thinking
it is a wimpy brain it's like a
single-core wimpy CPU made in the 80s
now our lizard brain there's like a
10,000 core make a computer it is super
powerful it controls everything now the
super brain when it decides to pay
attention to something it can process
learn and do things super quickly much
more performant than the higher brain
I'm pointing here but it's all over the
place anyway so the trick is is to
trigger of a lower brain the lizard
brain to activate its 10,000 cores
I don't normally horse it as but has a
lot of course well just say it's 10,000
cores for this video so it you want to
trigger it to activate its 10,000 cores
so it starts remembering things
remembering how to code and how do you
treat her it frequency of exposure 7
times rule 7 old marketing marketers
figured it out a long time ago
so by triggering it by exposing coding
every day
the powerful brain part of your brain
the 10,000 core brain it goes a we
better we better start remembering this
stuff it must be important as we keep
seeing it every day but if you only see
it every so often once it went say
before days the lizard brain is like me
camping out and poorer we're not seeing
it too often so that's the trick
frequency is more important than
duration right and how long how often is
more important how long and you want to
devote a little more than three hours to
any intense maybe before maybe have a
cup of coffee you can push a little
heart a little harder but you don't want
to put too much effort and particular
sit down or too much time with intense
meant to work because your productivity
would just plummet this is all proven
through the data so there you go and
that knowledge but I have and there's
many other things in terms of psychology
and so forth that's actually built into
my studio web training program it's
designed for that type of thing so that
when you log in and you start with the
html5 and you finish the first three
chapters and then when you log off
because you're going to take your break
and then you log in the next day it
remembers exactly where you were and
takes you right there so it's designed
actually around the way our brains
actually assimilate knowledge so when
you see if people put out 30 minute and
40 minute videos you know they don't
know anything about teaching because any
decent teacher knows that's not gonna
work too well all right I hope this is
