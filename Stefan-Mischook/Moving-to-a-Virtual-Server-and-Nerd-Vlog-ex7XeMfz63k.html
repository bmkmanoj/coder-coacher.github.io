going to be an impromptu blog format hmm
so I've been talking about my big server
move where I'm moving off of my physical
dedicated server to EVPs a virtual
private server why because we have a
physical dedicated server although you
have a lot of power you have a single
point of failure meaning a hard drive
could go CPU could go power supply could
go we get the idea if that happens
you're down the advantage of the VPS a
virtual private server you're basically
the your server installation is
basically just a virtual machine and
it's in the cloud meaning there's many
pieces of hardware many computers under
it supporting it so one computer goes
down for the reasons there's a whole
bunch of other computers that will take
up the slack so your sites your app will
go down and I think that the whole idea
of getting a physical dedicated server
is antiquated old schools like
typewriter stuff you're silly to do it
you still need to have an old dedicated
server I wouldn't do it it's pain in the
butt and it's just too much risk for no
good reason yes
so I remember a friend of mine who works
for very very large mining corporation
one of the largest in the world and he
was telling me about maybe ten years ago
where they were going into their server
rooms were made in like 50 boxes 5050
servers and they were virtualizing
everything putting putting all these
servers using VMware I believe was it
was being wearable and virtualizing each
box essentially turning each server box
into its own clone of it and then they
would deploy this to a virtualized
environment so they would have five
computers instead of 50 and because
VMware was so efficient in terms of the
in terms of how it managed resources
resources being CPU RAM utilization disk
utilization that most of the time
servers are very idle so it was able to
broker all these virtualized computers
used to be 50 down to five and
actually much safer so one of the boxes
went down they would have hop swappable
drives and everything would keep going
no problems no single point of failure
so that's why I was moving over I am
moving over to this virtual private
server now I've already started the move
where I put my videos on the cloud and I
put my means to do web app on the cloud
a while back a year or so ago so this is
just the final move I'm moving over
more-or-less branding sites killer sites
calm killer PHP calm had a big website
so these are all my information sites
and some apps too and I'm throwing them
on to theirs VPS so that whoo in theory
no problem so I started with the
transfer of just two domains over to the
new VPS last week and I just want to
make sure you know see how it went
see how the tech support web with the
people the new company was dealing with
and this new company is supposed to
provide turnkey white-glove fully
service situation where I just send them
a chat or call it a we've got a problem
here fix that fix this fix that and
they're supposed to do it and generally
speaking do a pretty good job we had of
course a little hiccup partly my fault
partly their fault
but we were able to resolve it pretty
quickly and you know when you're moving
into a new system you're working with a
new company even a new divisions
actually new division in the same
company you gotta be cautious I was
cautious and what I did was to just move
over a couple of sites make sure it was
cool everything is cool so on Monday
morning I think was Monday morning
eccentric sent a request I said with
detailed specs detailed guidance is okay
transfer the rest of the accounts for
the old virtualizer the old server the
old physical server transfer over
so about 4:00 in the morning later that
day well I guess in Tuesday morning at
4:00 a.m. I got an email saying we're
just writing to confirm that you want to
transfer these things some thing it was
a I just sent you a mail confirming
I just sent you an email with
instructions and why for a morning
because they don't do server migrations
moving your app or your websites from
one server to next they do it in the
middle of the night to minimize the
traffic etc etc Tara I show how viable
that is to be totally honest of you can
string you have traffic from over the
world but that's another story
so I write back I go yeah do it so then
I get an email back again saying well
you know you got a lot of data on these
looks like you got a lot of data so it
will take four days there right back
when we wait a second
they admit they misread stuff I know
what it was but basically I pointed out
that most of the accounts had less than
a gig of data per account I was like you
fifteen of them or something and then
they write back well that'd be great so
I will do tomorrow morning so now we are
today I've been waiting two days now you
know I guess recording this Tuesday
night if again lose track so I'm hoping
by tomorrow Wednesday healthy to
complete moved over to the VPS and
that's what slowly got everything
because I want to make sure everything
is cool before we do the last changes to
the video store and so on on a new
server of course I'm expecting some
small hiccups not major but I'm
expecting one or two small hiccups
hopefully the major and then from there
it's like in theory it should be smooth
sailing going forward because everything
will be now in cloud format which means
automatic backup automatic patching full
turnkey full fully managed servers and
so I have no headaches and I get to
basically close the book close the book
on the last of my physical servers
that's several over the years and that's
pretty much it so that's why I stand now
it's a round Center o'clock Tuesday
night and having my coffee well what I
do now is I mix I say one part coffee
two parts tea or orange pekoe Tia finds
a nice soft Miguel to coffee in the
morning I'll have a full coffee straight
up but at night a comic doll with a bit
of tea I just think
it says it's better for me so I'm going
to end this vlog with I got the
suggestions I think what I'm going to be
doing is I'm going to be concentrating
on business I realized that though I'm
encoder for very long time you know was
25 years but actually been in business
running in developing small businesses
for longer since I was 18 so going on 28
years you can manage that hope so
I am going to be concentrating a little
bit more but I will be mixing it in on
entrepreneurialism and starting
businesses running businesses but it's
going to be related to my own
experiences or experience of friends of
mine who have had businesses and I think
will be interesting sort of interesting
series for you guys I started a little
bit in the past I decided to put it to
bed the views weren't great but I think
I'm going to develop at this time
another thing I think of do I don't know
I might keep this channel here pure code
where you're going to see me do much
more a Python I put up my basic Python
course and this way for manager to
complete their work and waiting for the
server to get transferred so we can
deploy that probably the new Python
course the powerful Python 3 the
beginners course and then I think I'm
going to start putting out mini Python
courses and videos on YouTube and so
forth going into deeper subjects it's
easier to teach people already have the
basics down so I can go over to
animation
and maybe basic AI with Python so on so
yes so there's going to be a mixture of
things like that now with the big server
moves done almost done and some other
things we just we're going to be
releasing the studio at 3 1 which is
about
we're basic basically closing out the 3x
branches to do ab that's if that's all
what does that mean that means we will
not be developing that codebase any
further and in fact the writing for city
web 4 has already begun and it's a
totally it's totally built from scratch
brand new architectures I don't know
when that will be able to take months
and but 3.1 is super solid wide are we
no longer developing the 3.1 branch the
same reason that Apple decided to stop
developing OS 9 because it was based on
an old language and it just had a
limitation so as far as this 2d web the
app is concerned it looks great it's
pretty much bug free and yeah but
nonetheless it what it doesn't allow me
to expand into the areas of Onyx take
the app into so it requires a brand new
infrastructure the brand new
architecture you know taking advantage
of newer MVC frameworks newer arms and a
few other things but I won't get into in
this video so there you go that's it for
like tonight's vlog Channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
