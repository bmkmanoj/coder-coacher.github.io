be talking about now is a second example
of a html5 css3 and jquery based website
and this one happens to be an example of
a one-page slider now the one-page
slider is something that a lot of my
students have requested from me in
tutorial form and I thought I'd share it
with you so what's the deal with one
page slider example well as you can see
here happens to be one that you will
have in your source files and if you
notice just got a navigational system
over here it's a two column web so it
doesn't really look like anything too
fancy but instead of the normal type of
web site where you'd be jumping to
different pages in this particular
example the entire website is contained
in one long scrollable page in order to
make that a little bit more manageable
and a little bit more appetizing here
you'll notice that there is a jquery
slider in place and this one is sliding
the content and the different types of
content that we have on this page as you
can see here and if i were to jump back
to the top zoom it takes us all the way
back to the top here's another nice
thing about this example that I'm going
to be showing you is that when we just
normally scroll through this as people
are reading it you will recognize that
one of the other things that seems to be
happening is as we get our section into
focus you'll notice that the appropriate
button becomes highlighted so the
current page or the current section of
this website I should say rather is
going to be highlighted now that doesn't
mean that you can't use the sort of
slide buttons here you absolutely can as
we're showing you right now but its more
common that somebody might just be
scrolling through this and what's really
nice is that you'll be highlighting the
elements that they are sort of focusing
on now in order to achieve this we're
going to be needing a number of jQuery
plugins and the ones that I'm going to
bring to your attention are these two
right here one is called the jQuery
scroll to plug-in actually i'll show you
the basic page for it and it's something
here that was created by ariel flesh ler
and as you can see there's a good amount
of information on what to do with it and
how it actually works however the
elements that are in place in this
particular example are sort of a little
bit well i don't want to say that
they're not really well done it's
absolutely well done but i think that
there are a number of additions to this
that can actually help it to be a little
bit more concise and to actually work
and i'll point you to this particular
page page by trevor davis and in it he's
got jquery one page navigation plugin
which is pretty much what we want to be
doing and this is where i will send you
to get the information however i'm
providing you with the information that
you will need so there's no real need
for you to download any additional
information i'll provide everything for
you but what you can see in this section
and in these information it's a little
bit of a cleaner code than the original
ariel fleshly code so the ones that
we're going to be using are really not
going to need a lot of an additional
information in fact all we're going to
need are the script sort of information
that we have here which is referencing
the actual Java scripts for the scroll
to and the additional one that was
created by Trevor Davis and the only
other thing that we're going to need is
this little document dot ready function
here which is going to turn it on and
make it work for us the nice thing about
this one as opposed to the simple scroll
to is that it will also highlight the
particular current buttons that we're
going to be using as I described when we
slide through these things and these
areas here we'll just sort of highlight
for us so this is a good one but do
remember that the aerial flesser one is
really quite nice as well and
Trevor Davis is just built upon that
scroll to one but here is the original
Ariel flesh ler examples and they're
kind of nice I'm just doing something
that's really quite simple in terms of a
one page layout but you can see that
there's really a whole bunch of these
that are possible and here just let me
show you you can even slide in this type
of direction if you wish and if you go
back see that it just slides back into
place so this is something that you
could do as well and that's why I'm
pointing you to it but for our purposes
and we're just doing a quick and easy
little example we're going to stick to
the Trevor Davis example and I've
provided you with all of that
information so when we come back in the
next video we're going to open up our
editor and I'm going to deconstruct this
particular website the one that you're
looking at right now and I'm going to
kind of show you what's going on and how
it all works in the particular example
that I'll be giving you I do also want
you to recognize that there happens to
be one set of backgrounds here and we're
going in the next section you'll notice
that it's changed ever so slightly it's
a very subtle change I didn't make it
anything that's you know I'm going to
hit you over the head but if you wanted
to you can make some very drastic
differences in your backgrounds as
you're sliding through them so notice
seriously now we've got a different
color background and a different sort of
pattern in place and if we go to the
next one I've repeated one that we used
earlier and finally here the last one
that I have here in the background
happens to be the very same one that we
started with up at the top so the
particular example and I'm showing you
is also going to not only indicate how
we can work with the jquery plugin but
it's also going to indicate to you how
we can implement and set up many
different sections as I'm doing right
now so that you can implement different
backgrounds in a one-page slider if you
so chose so come back in the next video
will deconstruct this and get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
