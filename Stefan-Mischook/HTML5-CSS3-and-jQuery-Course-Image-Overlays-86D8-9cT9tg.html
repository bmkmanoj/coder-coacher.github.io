how to work with some very simple tab
rotation as I have in this little slide
tab system that we implement it I'm now
going to show you something that a lot
of my students are often asking me about
and that is how to replicate the overlay
effect that you oftentimes would see
with regards to a gallery or any kind of
picture that you want to be working with
so that you'd have a much more larger
version of that picture available and
you'll notice that in the final files
that I have available for you you'll
notice that on the home page we did
implement this slide tab system here but
if you click on the link called overlay
you'll see that it's really just the
same design as before the only
difference is I've placed three pictures
right here and these three pictures when
we roll over them click on them they
will open up a window that is perfectly
centered in the middle of our screen and
there's really not much going on here
with regards to graphics as well all the
shadow effects are being taken care of
with css3 and you know the boxes just
you know a div a container of sorts the
only graphics that are being used in
here are obviously the picture graphic
that I have here some text will
accompany it and this small little X
graphic which you can customize and make
look however you would like it to look
so when we click on that close it here's
the second one and here's a third one so
what I'm going to be talking to you
about then is showing you how to work
with all of these elements and how to
apply the overlay tool from the jQuery
tools library so what do we do well if
you head on over to the jQuery tools
library and if you're looking at the
demos or even if you're on the home page
and you just click on over lay down here
and you want to see what the overlay
looks like there's a lot of different
types of overlays that you can be using
for eye candy for presentations for
interactions as it says here and you
know very simple usage I'm going to be
talking about that and we're going to be
looking at the basic minimal setup
because that's the one that's going to
pretty much do what we want it to do and
i'll be showing you how exactly to set
that up so there are a number of
graphics available if you did want to
work with those graphics but as i
mentioned to you earlier the only thing
that we're going to be really using is
the little button that comes with it now
I've provided you that button if you're
following along with the downloaded
files and one of the things that you'll
see inside of the either progress or the
finished file in images you'll also
notice that there is a folder called
overlay now I've included all the
different files that you're going to be
wanting to experiment with and you can
take a look at them there's like you
know gray backgrounds and red
backgrounds and these will deal with any
of the variations the Apple effect is
kind of a fun one and there's a lot of
other things multiple overlays on the
same page there's a lot of different
demos that you can look at but I think
just running you through the minimal
setup will allow you to then further
explore some of these more sophisticated
methods but even so the minimal setup is
a pretty nice one and that's why we're
going to be looking at that so the only
graphic I really need even though I've
given you a bunch of graphics the only
one I really need is the close graphic
and that's the close button right here
close PNG so one we're going to be using
now if you wanted to change that just
have to take note of the dimensions 36
by 36 and then just make whatever you
want so it's really customizable there's
a lot of different things that you can
do with it alright so with that in place
all we really need to do is to go back
to our text editor whatever text editor
you're working with and you'll notice
here I've got to open I've got the
finished file and this one is the
progress file so if you look at the
progress file if you open up the
progress file you'll see that I have
just to let you know here in the finder
you'll see the finished and here's the
progress and in the progress we've been
building up the index page so that it
looks like it has the slide tabs the way
I showed you how to implement them but
now I've added an overlay file so let's
open up this overlay HTML file from the
progress and once you're in that area
then we can now start to work on this
particular file now you'll also notice
that I've included on the index page a
link to the overlay and as you'll see if
we return to your text editor here's a
link on the overlay page going back to
the index so you can flip between them
but on the index page itself i have a
link to the overlay so at this point
with overlay HTML open there's really
not much going on inside here it's been
stripped down and it doesn't have any of
the graphics that will need but if you
remember in the final version and here
is the final version you will notice
that right in the article tab we have a
simple lorem ipsum headline and then
three images and then after that I just
have the very same information that we
had on the index page sub-headline with
some text and whatnot so if we return
here you'll notice that I've left a
blank space for you so that you can
insert the information that we're going
to need to make this work alright so
first and foremost let's address some of
the HTML that we're going to need to
make this actually end up working so
right after this little h2 lorem ipsum
headline inside the article first thing
I want to do is to add the simple
graphics the simple thumbnail graphics
that we're going to be using to click on
to open up our overlay effect so we're
going to call these triggers and i'm
going to start just by applying a little
HTML code here and i'll say trigger
elements
okay so in this area we are now going to
create a simple div and this div is
going to be given an ID and that ID is
going to be called actually here I'm
just going to come in here ID and we're
going to call this ID triggers pretty
simple name to remember and works for us
before we do anything else though I'm
going to just come in here and close
that div I don't want to get confused
with which ative belongs to which in
which closing belongs to what so within
these divs is where we're going to be
placing our three images so let's just
put in the first one and then we'll copy
the next one so here is an IMG tag and
the source for that IMG tag and I could
use Dreamweaver to do this but here I'll
just run it through you with you we're
just going to say source equals and
we'll say remember this is the overlay
and right next to the overlay see I
didn't put the overlay inside a folder
or anything like that so right next to
it is the images just as right next to
it is the CSS so all we really need to
do in this case is to write images /em
ember all of the images that we're going
to be needing for the overlay is inside
the images folder but i also have a
folder called overlay and it's in here
that we need these thumbnail pictures so
we're going to say images overlay and
another /and here my names of these
images are frog thumb as in thumbnail 1
dot jpg all right now we don't
necessarily even need to give it a width
and a height or anything like that but
if you wanted to the width is set to 220
and then we could come in here and we
could also say height and the height is
also set to 220 but you'll notice a
couple of things I had to make some
adjustments I think 210 would be
actually more appropriate so that's
something that we can consider as well
now i'm going to remove the width and
the height because as you'll see you
don't really need it in every case and
in this case all i'm going to add is an
attribute called rel and rel is sort of
like a relationship between a certain
image and something else but it's the
rel attribute that we're going to be
using to actually get the javascript to
work for us so i'm going to give it a
rel and in this case I'm just going to
call it frog one you can call it
whatever you want change it do whatever
you need now I'll just put in this
information right there again we don't
need a self containing image the way we
have here so technically speaking if
we're writing in html5 I could just do
it this way and that should be fine now
if I were to just save this briefly and
preview it in our browser you'll see
just simple image and it's already 2 20
x 220 although I kind of fudged up on
some of the on some of the sizes
although because it's perfectly the same
width and height if we make some
adjustments as long as the width and
height are the same we should be fine so
as you can see that's the first one I'm
going to ask you to copy this
information and will just paste it in
here twice all we really need to do is
to change thumb 12 thumb to thumb three
and we'll change the relationship name
from frog 12 frog to and frog three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
