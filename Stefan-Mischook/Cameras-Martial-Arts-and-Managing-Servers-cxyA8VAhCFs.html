as psychology vlog so you might find
this interesting might give you insights
into your own personality so you notice
on youtube there are lots of lockers
around and the vloggers will use some
variation of a DSLR sometimes a cell
phone but but they'll use a lot of times
if they're using a camera like this
whether it be a Canon or Sony or a
Panasonic so what they'll use often is
something like this a Joe be flexible
tripod with these bendy legs and they'll
have the camera up like this and they'll
walk around like this talking about
themselves and making coffee or
something so I have this because I sort
of just got into the whole thing I want
to create films so bla bla bla I guess
I'll get this that's what people do so
might as well I got caught into the
ocean thing myself so now what I just
use this for now is this is a cell phone
mount so I put my cell phone I'll lay
down or sit down I'll just put up my
cell phone and I'll watch the videos
with it but I don't ever use it anymore
or hardly ever for my camera right I
don't I don't even have a mount on the
camera so why don't I use anymore
because I found that this thing doesn't
provide any value so people hold it like
this but I say to myself these cameras
here have plenty of places where you can
just hold on to it so if you're a
vlogger you can go like this
no big deal right you can go like this
all right no big deal because it's a
Canon if the camera I have the screen
facing me so I can go like this and go
blah blah blah I'm so great look at my
life I'm getting groceries now blah blah
blah and this works great right like
this much lighters easier to hold around
as opposed to having to carry around
this big thing which adds weight like
this is maybe half the weight this
tripod is have to
the camera got any extra weight for no
good reason and most vloggers will not
set the camera down very often they'll
just know this hold it like this and
talk and so on so I can go hold it like
this right so I'm just it's something I
had never considered to be honest of you
something I never considered how do I
really need a tripod because this is a
very good group I have here right so
there you go
so why am i mentioning all this on a
techno understand the power of
conformity
understand how that can influence you I
see that a lot in tech I see that a lot
in life in general martial arts I've
seen it now somebody will put forth an
idea we'll say this how we do things and
then the herd just follows along
mindlessly without even considering it
and I can understand that because if
you're new in a sin in a subject I was
new in this whole camera photography
filming thing I just sort of go along
with what the successful people do and
that's a wise approach but once you've
gained a bit of knowledge it might be a
good idea to reconsider what it is
you're going to do so for example in the
whole YouTube video vlogging thing so
this guy Casey nice that he's the King
vlogger I call him he started vlogging
with the Canon 70d which is predecessor
to this one and then he went to the ATD
so then everybody went to ATT then I
went to the Canon as a friend of mine as
our Canon I was also influenced by that
nice that guy but mainly because of its
functionality had this crazy autofocus
capability that saved me houses from
autofocus auto focusing in fact let me
change that I actually used another
camera Panasonic prior to that and the
auto focusing was killing me it didn't
it didn't all focus very low at all so
when I found out that this camera here
these camera canons who are the king of
autofocus when I figured out that they
get autofocus really easily that I said
that
go to that so I went to that now what
happens okay see nice that this big King
vlogger King vlog on the skateboard he
decides he wants 4k so he goes to Sony
but Tony has all kinds of other prized
4k video but it doesn't have this flippy
screen which you're doing solo video
shooting was gonna have a flippy screen
so you can compose the shot anyhow
so he goes King vlogger goes to Sony's
because it's got 4k everybody needs 4k
in fact it matters you're doing vlogs
only 4k so he goes to 4k and there's all
kinds extra work with duck with the
Sony's the colorscience you got to do a
lot more editing and post grading of
your footage it's not as clear as clean
as canon so then he goes off of he kills
off the sony he goes the panasonic gh4
is so again the herd they follow king
vlogger and everybody starts - i'm GH
fires not everybody but a lot of of
logger starts a very go g h5 the g h5
for all its strengths has terrible on a
focus and that's the key when you're
when you're doing solo camera work
whether you're vlogger or like me a tech
comments the guy talked comments about
technology and programming you have to
try to identify the key technology the
thing that really makes a difference now
when you're doing solo shooting the
autofocus is huge it's number one in my
opinion number two is the colorscience
meaning how usable is the footage coming
out of the camera right out of the
camera without having to make all kinds
of big changes to it now the problem
with the sony cameras you got apparently
i've never used them but apparently you
got all kinds of editing you got to do
the colorscience
sucks so for me that that that is like
extra work for nothing
right when I had to the other Panasonic
was a terrible autofocus it was just a
pain in the butt
to just set up a shot because I couldn't
I had to do all kinds of stuff all spare
the details just to get the focus right
with this camera with the Canon a TD and
the cinema camera I don't have to do any
of that it's
works 99% of the time that's one of the
reasons why you buy pro equipment by the
way if you want to get that smooth
workflow the smoother to work flow the
easier to work for workflow the better
quality your output and the more are you
going to be able to do with less effort
so King vlogger goes to Panasonic his
stuff is not a focus half the time then
he switched then another vlogger out of
Canada guy who's a very good with the
camera work he said that he should use
the 60d those 60 mark - now 60 mark -
doesn't have certain 4k and it's not so
the King vlogger goes back to 60 so
because of King vlogger and Canada and
King vlogger in New York say hey we're
gonna go to the 16th mark - now then
everybody said well maybe we should go
to the 16 right - now which is pretty
funny stuff so I love to see how the
herd moves based on a couple of
authority figures who proclaim certain
things I'm not critical of the herd
because that is one of the primary ways
in which our brains will make decisions
it will look to authority figures with
the expectations that authorities in a
particular field will have a depth of
understanding and a level of
understanding that we don't have simply
because they've been doing it longer
there's better school debt cetera etc
etc there's some truth to that but
sometimes not always the case also you
have to also look at your use case you
have to decide whether or not you know
what King vlogger needs to do whether
that applies to you right so I use the
cameras and videos and the vlogging as
an example because it's visual it's
literally visual and you can see it and
it's something I'm sort of getting
involved with because I have been trying
to learn how to do better video better
photography for these logs for my pro
courses
and just for my own hobby if you will
but I can tell you from my experience in
martial arts the same thing you see the
herd get led in certain directions and I
remember when I first started doing
martial arts in the early I think was
late 70s late 70s so I was very young
of course I wasn't aware of the politics
at that time but in the 1980s at one
point ninjas ninjutsu guys were
considered the deadliest martial arts
everything was ninjutsu all the
magazines it was funny to watch that fad
and then it moved into from ninjutsu and
moved into boy toy boy toy they were
they were they were the killers the boy
toy guys can't be every art art they
just get killed by more tight guys and
then it became the jujitsu guys you guys
were the best effort in the 90s as soon
as they killed everybody to guys and
they're the ultimate style and then it
became Mme Mme is the ultimate style
amazed altima stop before they knew it
in ninjutsu it was the cuff you guys
because of Bruce Lee right Bruce Lee
cuff who's the best and then prior to
Bruce Lee in the cuff you guys is the
crowd of guys and their judo guys you
get the idea you see others these fads
in different areas and different
technologies
I consider martial arts fighting
technologies so same thing with
programming languages now now we see the
fad is in javascript javascript is
killer node in JavaScript and it's got a
lot of good things about it as does PHP
as does Java does Python you get the
idea every language has its pros and
it's call it depends on what you want to
do another thing that we see happening
these days is the herd is God and deep
into highly complex DevOps DevOps today
are far more complicated and they used
to be just 10 years ago and there's
something to be said about good DevOps
there's no question but I think it's
gone a little bit overboard now where
they're expecting software developers to
become system administrators in the old
days system mins were system ins and
they made sure that the environment was
stable and everything was
and up-to-date so that the developers
could deploy the code in a stable
environment these days there's an
expectations even with some cloud holds
that you've got to know you got to be
patching your own server or your own
Linux distribution and all this kind of
stuff and I don't believe in that now
this is from a guy who actually had his
own physical servers in his place in the
90s I bought licenses for server
software windows I think it was Windows
2000 or windows NT excuse me when I
first started buying licenses and I
managed although I installed like
building configured I patched this not
yeah
I managed the whole thing and when I got
rid of that those physical servers but I
managed myself and I just co-located and
I paid people to take care of that it
was like a huge amount of headaches and
burden off my back one of the things you
learn as entrepreneurs you if you don't
try to be a master of everything you
don't try to do everything that's what
I'm that's a big mistake the smart
entrepreneurs smart business owner and
the smart coder concentrates on what
they're supposed to do and then hires or
partners with people to do other things
so going back to the herding mentality
going back to the the whole idea that
software developers should become system
developers system and Men Sisson ins and
should be able to totally navigate in
control and manage Linux I just don't
buy it if you can fine but what are you
doing in this lawyer life are you are
you here to write really good software
are you here to maintain servers I don't
believe you should maintain servers I
think it takes away from your time to
make your software even better that
being said you should know at least a
little bit you got to understand the
basics of running a server but you don't
have to know all the details so I have
one host provider digitalocean where I
have to know my stuff I have to we have
to install and configure and patch it's
just a real pain we're having another
host provider foo neo which is turnkey
it's kind of a hybrid where they provide
one of those
control panels and specifically cPanel
and whm sitting in top of a cloud
infrastructure so I can install apps I
can give people who SSH access I can
update choose with install of Ruby or
Python or PHP I'm going to use they can
choose the different databases
it's just click click click click no
command-line needed and it's the best of
both world and if I need to do anything
more advanced I just make a request and
they take care of it assistant min that
people who just all they do all day is
it is managed service the servers they
just take care of the whole thing so I
have to worry about it take care backups
and patching all this kind of stuff
fantastic this way I can concentrate on
making the app that we're producing
better and our my content better I don't
have to worry about managing a server
and all this kind of stuff so do you
need to be a server admin to be a
developer so well some people think you
do I don't think you do should you know
a little bit about DevOps obviously for
sure should you know get you should know
at least the basics of git and github
and how to how to manage a code bases of
course that becomes more important only
really when you have many coders
involved in the project it's just one
person it's not that important you could
use key that just as a nice backup I
suppose so you can roll back any changes
you made but really using a product like
github or some other similar product it
only really shines when you have a team
of developers and you really need to
manage how the app is developed and how
the code is being developed this way you
can roll back and merge code when you
need to et cetera et cetera yeah so so
source code management is more important
of course much more part when you have
multiple developers but a lot of you out
there are freelancers and this type of
stuff is almost useless except for maybe
being able to
back stuff they lure it on the side if
you're going into freelance but don't go
crazy just learned a high level in terms
of using github but you don't have to be
a total master know every single thing
about get every single thing about
server administration you just need to
know your basics anyway there you go
a bit of a meandering vlog but I think I
made the connection between King vlogger
and coders ciao
