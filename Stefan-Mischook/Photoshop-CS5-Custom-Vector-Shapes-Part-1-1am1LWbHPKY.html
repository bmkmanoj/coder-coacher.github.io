we're now going to be discussing is the
custom shape tool it's a vector drawing
tool and we're creating shape layers
with it well let's take a look what
shapes are we going to be making well
that can be done by choosing from this
list if you click down on your arrows
here I'm going to reset the shapes to
their original and what you should see
if you've never opened up this
particular option there are all of these
simple custom shapes that you have here
and there's a good portion of them
there's a lot of them that you can work
with and deal with and you can apply
strokes and effects to them just like
anything else and you can even
manipulate them as well for example if I
have the direct selection tool I can
click and drag on one of these vector
paths see there's a point right there
and notice see I can bring it out like
this I can manipulate those handles so
that it gives me more of an effect like
that and a lot of different things that
you can do again depending on which tool
you're working with and how it's going
to end up helping you in the long run so
nevertheless you can manipulate all of
these things you can work with them but
let me show you this is rather a small
list from the ones that we had before
and I mean it's fine and all but what if
you want more than just what you have
here I mean these are great sure and
notice they look all weird how do you
make them look good press shift as
you're drawing and that will constrain
the proportions so now you can see I've
got this little pin over here which I
can stick to something just by working
in that fashion you can apply a drop
shadow on that if you wanted to a lot of
different things that you could do and
up to this point though we have a very
small list to choose from so I'm going
to click here and I'm going to show you
what else you could do in this little
option where there's an arrow here you
can load in any number of these options
why don't we load
everything so we'll click on all and
it's gonna ask you oh do you want to add
to the existing ones or do you want to
replace the existing ones well let's
leave the existing ones and we'll just
choose append now I have a huge very
huge amount of different drawings that I
could choose from you choose whatever
color you like and you could then go
into your objects and holding shift to
constrain proportions if you wish choose
any number of options
oops sorry I wanted to choose a
different one you can see there's lots
of leaves and different things in here
there's also ornaments for example stuff
that you'd find in pro versions of fonts
and different things like that so as you
can see great great stuff that's
available inside of these particular
elements and a lot of variations a lot
of different sort of things that you can
add in here but upon looking at all of
these things what if I wanted to make my
own vector drawing something that could
reuse over and over again can I do that
is there something that I'd be able to
work with inside of Photoshop that would
let me do that yes absolutely because
there's just about nothing you can't do
without Photoshop so we're gonna get
into that and I'll show you how to do
that but before we do it let me just
show you one last thing one of the nice
things about working with these
particular drawings and these particular
tools is that you can create very simple
and easy logos that you can work with in
no time at all for example here I've got
a very simple shape and remember there
were options here where we could punch
holes out of those shapes so I've got my
circle then I'm going to choose the
custom shape tool and perhaps choose
from this list of different elements
where we can decide upon what sort of
simple shape we would like now for
example there's also some of these
animal shapes here let's say I don't
know it's
something to do with a cat or pet food
store or something like that blue moon
or blue cat productions
well we'll notice what happened here as
I'm drawing this thing I want to choose
to punch a hole in the actual shape and
now when I move this around check it out
you've got a very nice little option
available here that has punched a hole
out of this and you create this nice
negative and positive effect that's
going on what if you don't like the
positioning of that cat remember there's
the black arrow path selection tool so I
could select this path move the cat in a
little bit closer or maybe move it in
over here or maybe after selecting it
pressing command T and making it a
little bit smaller any number of
different things that you could do
double click to finish that and continue
moving if you wish then when you click
on the outside selecting the area over
here you still see the path lines but as
soon as you use your black arrow move
tool V notice all of those elements are
gone and you create this beautiful
negative and positive effect that you
can work with inside of your shape
layers so really great stuff that you
can do with the custom shape tool and
different ways of approaching it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
