the author of web design one web design
one is the foundation course for anyone
who wants to get into building websites
whether you're a small business owner
who wants to learn how to add pages and
edit pages and put in images and so
forth or you're an aspiring web
professional web designer who wants to
learn how to build websites the site
it's the site the video itself is runs
about 34 but four hours and it covers
the key basics in web design so you
learn from from scratch we assume I
assume but you know nothing and so we
learn about web hosting domain names how
to register ha site how to get the site
online we also learn of course about how
to build a website in fact by the end of
the course you will have built a website
it's it's an interactive type of course
where I design it assuming that you are
sitting beside me and we're just going
through the process and we're learning
things specifically you're going to
learn web page design and website design
our website is just a bunch of pages
connected together you're going to learn
how to connect those pages you're going
to learn basic layout strategy in web
design and you're going to learn the key
building blocks of every website and
that's HTML and CSS don't worry if you
haven't heard about these things now
you'll you'll know them very well by the
time you get into web design one the
videos can come to you in a few formats
you can get them on DVD that we mail you
and all the videos are meant to play on
your computer although if you have a
modern flat panel TV the videos can play
on your TV if you're if you're so
inclined you can also buy them for
instant download so you just pay by
credit card or PayPal and you get access
to videos within minutes if you do get
the DVD
you also have access to downloads right
away so that can hold you up while you
wait for the DVD there is no difference
between the DVD content and the download
content there are the exact same videos
it's just some people prefer to have the
hard copy other people's they don't care
the videos work on both mac pc and the
necks of course so if you're a pc user
user or a Mac user PCB and windows of
course they'll play fine if you have any
questions or concerns you can you mail
us directly you can join the forums
several web designers or what
programmers actually hang out on the
forum so if you have a question you can
get an answer usually within an hour if
not sooner if you have any problems
downloading your videos accessing the
videos it happens once in a while people
lose the emails or something there's no
worries we're here for you just give us
an email or give us a call and we'll get
you up and running quickly finally the
videos that you do purchase are you're
free to do whatever you want with them
in a non-commercial way so that means
you can't sell them to other people and
make copies but if you want to make a
copy for yourself back it up on a hard
drive so you have it on two computers
burn a copy on another disk so you have
a backup or you want if you go out a
trip or something that's no problem it's
like buying a DVD a movie at a store you
get to use it and wherever you like it's
it's it's no problem in fact if you do
lose everything on your end let's say
your computer crashes or something by
buying a video from us you in effect how
to count with us and you can just log
back in re download them again and we
have download limits but if you run out
of the download limits we just just send
us email replenish it free of charge and
you can download them so when you do get
a video course from us you'll know that
you basically have access to to them for
life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
