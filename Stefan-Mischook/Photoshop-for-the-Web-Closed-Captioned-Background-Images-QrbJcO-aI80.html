elements in place and all of our divs
are set up we've got our rapper div on
the index page that's centering our
design and we've tested it a couple of
times inside of different browsers and
seems to work out just great one thing
that we can probably do is to perhaps
take this opportunity to talk about how
things are going to be not only centered
on the page but the fact that you can
add a background image and still have a
different background color and that's
one thing that I want to talk to you
about at this point so let's just move
on over to photoshop for a second and i
did that on the on the macintosh by
pressing command tab if you're working
on a pc alt tab will do the same thing
and as you can see here we're back with
our type 3 sliced layout but one thing
that i do want to make mention of is the
fact that we had our slice up here with
the headline graphics and as you might
remember we did not use the entire 900
pixel canvas however what I want to do
now is to actually go about creating a
slice that we're going to use as a
tiling background image so let's take a
look grab the slice tool now I don't
want to necessarily interfere with the
slice that's up here at the top so we
can still go down on the bottom of our
design and create a slice here as well
now you might be asking well how big is
this slice supposed to be and what are
we going to do with it notice I'm going
to open up my canvas just a little bit
more technically speaking one pixel will
be more than enough I mean it's okay if
you do two or even 10 or 20 pixels it's
really not that big of a deal the issue
is however that technically speaking as
I mentioned we really do only need one
pixel so I'm just going to zoom in on
this and the only reason I'm going to
zoom in at this moment is to choose the
slice tool that will click this and
rename this particular slice
I don't like this long name it doesn't
tell me anything about the graphic that
I'm using so we're going to rename this
what are we going to rename it well
every background image that we're I use
in any of my web designs and in this
particular one and remember we're just
doing a very simple one here so we don't
have very many background images in
particular but nevertheless I'm just
going to call it BG underscore body if
in future I get rid of that plus sign
because remember even though this is an
image it still adheres to HTML naming
conventions which means no special
characters that plus sign would not do
any good for anybody so BG body I just
want to take the second to mention that
if I did have a much more complex design
we would more than likely be using a lot
of different background images but this
is just the BG or the background for the
body so that's what I'm going to name
this and as you can see it's pretty easy
because there's really only one color
that's here so if you remember our rules
from before you know joint photographic
expert group is a great thing to do when
you're saving photographs of jpg
photographs and anything that has simple
amounts of colors easy rule of thumb try
it as a gift first and you're probably
going to get best results so let's go to
file save for web and devices I'm going
to press space bar just move my canvas
so that I can select this and only this
slice down at the bottom you'll notice
by default here it's saying oh yeah let
me save you a JPEG but I don't want a
low quality JPEG I mean it's fine it's
not really going to cause that much
problem but what I do want to see
instead is gif and looking over here at
gif you'll notice that even if the gif
is suggesting 256 colors the maximum
number of colors in the color table
notice the color table will only produce
two colors and even though this default
one here is not actually giving us any
color we
have an anti alias on this so it's
really just the one color and you'll
notice even that low quality JPEG if ten
percent did not give us the results that
this gif does 149 bites it's really
nothing in terms of download speeds so
I'm going to press on save and make sure
we're saving to the right spot and
you'll notice on my desktop there's the
type root folder do I have to enter into
the images folder actually not really
because it's going to by default save to
an images folder so let it find this one
because if you're inside that images
folder then and you don't make any
changes here it will just produce an
images folder inside of your images
folder which is not really a good thing
so the slices I will say not all or even
all the user slices I just need the
selected slice in this case so I'll
click Save and now we can return well
actually we'll give it a second there
you go so here we are back in Photoshop
and we'll come back there's some other
things that we're going to be doing with
this you can take the opportunity to
save your file at this moment if you
wish and I'm going to go to Dreamweaver
so here we are in Dreamweaver and let's
see a couple of things well first of all
I'm going to switch back to photoshop
before I do anything else in my swatches
palette i'm going to activate the
darkest color that i happen to have here
and i'm going to click once on my color
picker and copy this color command C or
ctrl C on a PC so switch back to
Dreamweaver now let's try a couple of
different things for example I'm going
to here we are in our site window let's
just take a look inside here and you
look BG body it's saved properly in the
images folder that's fantastic now in my
CSS styles here's the body definition
I'm going to ask you to edit this body
definition and you'll see right now that
it has that light gray default color
well check this out i'm going to come in
here and i'm going to paste in the dark
color and we can apply that and say oh
no look what happened to our design
it looks terrible because everything
that was showing through from the body
was coloring this background not to
worry because as you imagine as you
remember we do have a background image
which I will find now in the images
folder under BG body gif will choose it
now if I were to repeat this on both the
X and the y what would end up happening
is as you can see here everything is
repeating and it makes the whole body
the same color not exactly what we want
rather we want to repeat this thing only
on the Y meaning only on the y axis
right so not horizontal but rather
vertical and if we apply that what you
can see and you might have a little bit
of difficulty here because i'm using a
1024 screen is the fact that there is
this little background color here but
there is a tiling background now why is
it only showing the background color
here the dark color it's because we have
not centered this background image and
that's something else you can do with
background images is define their
position so here under the background
position for the X I'm going to say
Center it so horizontally always have it
in the middle of our design background
position why well we'll give it the
default it starts top down now if we
apply this you can see that not only on
this side is there the background color
but you'll also see it on this side so
let's click OK and see what we've done
so far if I preview this in Firefox
going to ask me to save the file and
take a look we've got a little bit of
color over here a little bit of color
over there and this tiling background
image is creating sort of the illusion
that we have our wrapped images inside
of this sort of container and as you can
see if I move around the actual browser
window not only does the wrapper
maintain its centered abilities and
capabilities but we also now can notice
that the object is centering the
background image as well
that's really nice now we've got
something that works a little bit more
in keeping with what we wanted to see
you could test it out in all your other
browsers to it's usually a good idea to
do so and what we see in Safari is
pretty much the same thing that we saw
in Firefox so that takes care of our
tiling background image what we're now
going to do in the next video is to make
the links that are on these buttons
actually linked to individual pages and
we'll go about preparing those pages
inside a Photoshop in just a second when
we return</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
