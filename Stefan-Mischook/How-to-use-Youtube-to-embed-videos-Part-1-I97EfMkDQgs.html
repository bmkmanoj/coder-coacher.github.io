hi in this video I'm going to show you
how to use YouTube to embed videos into
your webpages and along the way I'm
going to give you a couple tips and
tricks in terms of creating and
optimizing your videos so that they work
best with the YouTube system
for this video tutorial specifically I'm
going to assume that you do have a
youtube account so I'm not going to walk
you through the process of creating a
YouTube account it's if you don't it
takes about two minutes it's free it's
super easy and yeah
before I jump right into the demo of
actually uploading a video and then
embedding it into a web page I just want
to cover a couple quick points first of
all the pros and the cons of using
YouTube to embed video in your pages and
I'm just going to read and write off
here of some extra comments the major
pro for me it's it's easy to do since
YouTube provides all the tools that you
need to to embed the videos it provides
the player etc provides the code they
really make it easy for you one
advantage that a lot of people probably
don't consider is the fact that when you
use videos embedded from YouTube you
don't have to pay for that video
bandwidth this may not be a major issue
for you but you know if you start
getting popular videos it's it can get
pretty expensive and it could really it
could slow down your server so that's
one advantage but you know I thought it
was worth mentioning the cons of using
YouTube to embed videos in your pages
first of all the videos are public so if
you want private videos you won't be
able to use YouTube and one last thing
you're going to notice that when you do
have YouTube fed videos on your site
there's going to be a little bit of
YouTube branding yeah overlaid in the
bottom right hand corner so again if
that's a deal-breaker for you then
you're gonna have to go with a more
custom solution which I'll demo in
another video but if those two little
cons or no big deal for you then yeah
YouTube's a great option
one last thing before I demo the upload
and etc I just want to talk briefly
about the video formats you have to
basically find a video format that
YouTube the YouTube system can accept
and fortunately now YouTube has a wide
array of formats including WMV which is
used by Windows and dot move was just
quicktime and mp4 and there's a whole
bunch of others of course the best
solution minor choice as I like to call
it is that you should use something
called mp4 with h.264 encoding so what
does that mean without going into too
much nerd detail all these different
formats WMV mp4 or h.264 encoding FLV
etc these are all just different ways of
packaging and packaging up videos that's
the best way of putting it
it's an oversimplification but that's
all you really need to know for you know
to use this system I wouldn't worry too
much about it because either way youtube
does a good job processing all these
video types although I do again
recommend mp4
and since we're here so what programs
output mp4 with h.264 there are many out
there I'm just gonna mention a few at
the top of my list is QuickTime 7 Pro
which is made by Apple computers it's
you probably heard a QuickTime where
they have a pro version that allows you
to do very basic video editing and
allows you to help put videos in the
h.264 format and but that cost a few
bucks it's $29 if you have a Mac you can
use iMovie other options if you're doing
a lot of video work you may want to use
something like Adobe Premiere or Apple's
Final Cut Pro or Final Cut Pro Express
if you're on of course on a Mac computer
another option if you happen to be a
flash guy and you have adobe flash they
do have a built-in FL excuse me an H dot
264 encoder so you just drop in your
videos and they'll take care of it for
you if you don't have any of these more
expensive solutions I would recommend
QuickTime 7 pro and if you're on a Mac
though you could use iMovie the video
editing the facilities there are not
great but they're much they're still
better than QuickTime 7 Pro there are
other solutions that's for sure I don't
know them all just do a search on google
for mpeg-4 mp4 h.264 encoder or Video
Editor and most do output in that format
I just want to make a quick note about
Windows Movie Maker it comes built-in
with XP Vista I'm sure Windows 7 up
until now I haven't seen the windows 7
version it only outputs unfortunately
WMV which still works with YouTube but
it's not optimal at least that's what
the YouTube people say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
