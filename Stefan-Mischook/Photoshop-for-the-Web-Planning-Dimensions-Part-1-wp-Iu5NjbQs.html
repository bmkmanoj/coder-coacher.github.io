stages of our design and as you can see
here as I mentioned earlier this is
going to be the first design that we're
going to be addressing now one of the
things I want to bring up first and
foremost is the idea of how our designs
are going to react inside of our browser
windows in other words the very first
type of design that I'm going to be
showing you how to create not only in
Photoshop but then how to assemble
inside of Dreamweaver is this one here
which I would refer to as a fixed pixel
based design and the reason we're
addressing a fixed pistol based design
first is because it's probably the
easiest style of design that we can
build inside of our websites so what a
fixed pixel based design will do is once
it's inside of a browser window if I
move that browser window if I resize
that browser window if I full screen
that browser window the elements inside
of the browser the design that we are
creating right here is going to be fixed
in other words it's fixed to a specific
size and it's never going to move it's
it's always going to be sort of set in
that sort of scenario the other kind of
website that we will also be addressing
in our series here is something called a
liquid based design and liquid based
designs are much more malleable they
stretch out they they move around some
of the text will be resized when we sort
of resize our browser window the text
will wrap and you know get bigger or
smaller there's advantages and
disadvantages to both of these the
advantages to a fixed pixel based design
is number one quite simply it's a lot
easier to sort of build inside of your
web scenario and the other advantage is
is that you always have a sort of
understanding of how big your text is
going to look how big the columns of
your texts are going to look so you
don't end up with if somebody has like
some ridiculously large screen you don't
end up with 70
five words on one line before a new
paragraph or line in that paragraph
begins a liquid based design on the
other hand also has its advantages one
of the things that we want to avoid is
horizontal scrolling on our designs well
if somebody has a screen resolution
that's smaller than this particular
design one of the things that you'll
encounter if you're working with a fixed
pixel is that in order to see the entire
design you might have a horizontal
scrollbar that's generally something you
want to avoid so before we move forward
with our planning of how this is going
to be laid out and what it's going to do
one of the things that you have to sort
of keep in mind is the simple fact that
if we are addressing a fixed pixel based
design we have to know what the average
end user is going to be looking at in
terms of their screen resolution and how
it is going to react with our particular
design so a couple of things about that
where do we get this screen information
where do we get this information about
resolution and how things work in that
case one of the best places you could go
is the w3c which is the World Wide Web
Consortium they're a bunch of people out
of MIT that are working to set the web
standards it's led by a guy by the name
of Tim berners-lee incidentally he
actually invented HTML in the very early
90s and he and his team are responsible
for things like web standards the CSS
revolution all of these different things
which make developing web pages so much
better than it was say ten years ago or
something along those lines so that's
one spot that you can go there's another
place that you can go called net market
share as you can see here and what I'm
showing you in the net market share
website is this the vast majority of
people who are looking at your web sites
have a screen resolution of
minimum 1024 x 768 or higher that's the
vast majority of people so higher than
1024 x 768 probably accounts for like
ninety-four ninety-five percent of your
audience anything smaller than that is a
very small portion of your audience 800
x 600 used to be popular but as
technology improves and as screens get
better and graphic cards get better more
and more people are able to support a
higher screen resolution on their
particular computers so when we are
addressing a fixed pixel based website
and deciding upon our environment and
how we are going to sort of plan for
this 1024 x 768 environment we have to
keep those statistics in mind so even
though twenty percent and higher are on
1024 x 768 what we're saying here is
that if we address that base of 1024 x
768 that will give us something that's
going to work on the vast majority of
people's browsers so if a person has a
browser size that's larger than 1024 no
problem you're just going to have some
extra space on the left and right hand
side of your website if somebody is at
1024 that's great too because that's
exactly how we're optimizing our
Photoshop layout to work inside of their
browsers so you'll only have like you
know less than 1% of the population that
will actually encounter a horizontal
scrollbar when looking at your website
in a full-screen scenario so that's
actually pretty good statistics for us
and because of that we're going to
address our layout and plan for our
layout to be well within the 1024
environment now if you'll notice when
you say file new inside a Photoshop one
of the things that you can address is
that there are preset sizes there are
preset sizes here for the print industry
US paper international
for stuff like that but there are also
web and mobile devices film and video
stuff like that well the web presets are
all set to different screen resolutions
and that's wonderful so you might think
hey Sal just told me 1024 x 768 is the
way to go so that's what I'm going to
choose but let's hold on before we do
that I want to also address something
else to you if I were to just switch
over to Firefox here for a second and
we're looking at this full screen when
we say that the screen resolution is
actually 1024 x 768 what I actually mean
there is the very top of my screen down
to the very bottom of my screen as you
can see here but with this browser being
full size as you very well can see
notice that there's a lot of information
here or rather a lot of real estate
that's being taken up by a number of
things number one the operating system
i'm working on a mac you might be
working on a pc but that operating
system is going to take up a small
portion of your screen but look at this
the browser and here i'm working inside
of firefox the browser is taking up a
good portion of real estate on my screen
as well not only here at the top but
there's some scrollable areas down here
on the side there's also down here at
the bottom the status bar that's taking
up some of my screen so all my website
really has to contend with is this area
in the middle right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
