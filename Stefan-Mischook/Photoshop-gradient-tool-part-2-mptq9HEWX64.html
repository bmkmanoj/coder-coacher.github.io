do with gradients as well you might have
noticed black and white is fun but what
if we wanted to have something that's a
little bit more colorful in order to
customize your gradients what you're
going to have to do is to click on the
Edit gradient button right here and when
you do you'll see a number of gradient
editor and a number of different choices
in the presets so we could choose a
different sort of style for example if i
was to use these and click ok now this
is my choice gradient and that gives us
a decidedly different look depending on
what exactly you want it to do however
you'll also notice that there's one in
particular here which indicates a
transparency that's with this
checkerboard pattern is so it's black
going to white but it's a transparent
white so if we were to choose this for
example and apply it you'll notice that
that original area that was green a
remained green because there's a
transparency on top of what I just did
so even if I was to do this in an
auditor direction right now I'll have
black at the bottom but they'll still be
that green from that transparent element
so transparency as you'll see is also
another useful effect we'll get into
that in due time but let's say we wanted
to create our own color scheme in our
own pattern but one thing that we can do
is to determine what type of gradient
and could save solid that's the most
common smoothness 100 because we
certainly want to have a smooth gradient
and then down here you can see the color
choices color stop as it's indicated
here and the top buttons indicate the
opacity stop in other words what level
of opacity does this particular shade of
black have so the opacity can be reduced
and as you can see that's what brings up
the transparent element here so we can
also create our own custom transparency
as well however i'm just going to change
the color so if i click on one of the
bottom areas here we can change
this color to whatever color we want it
to be and right now we've got a very
nice blue to white gradient and the
white area could be changed as well I
could choose maybe a lighter version of
this blue so instead of going to pure
white it actually goes to a very light
blue and right now we can determine that
both of these have transparency at a
hundred percent you will also notice
that when we are touching one of these
elements as you can see here I want to
make sure that that's the blue that I
wanted it to be it is there we go and
what I'm going to do is to indicate of
course that in between these elements I
could introduce another effect you'll
see here that when we look at the
gradient that there is an area right in
the middle and it's called the midpoint
that determines the the amount of color
that's coming from where so if i wanted
to increase the amount of dark blue
coming in i would just slide this more
to this way or vice versa otherwise it
remains right in the center which is
pretty much standard location can be
also introduced numerically as you can
see here and if we've got that and we in
like what we see right now we have that
gradient in place and that's exactly
what it's looking like for us so that
custom gradient can also be saved we can
introduce a new gradient and as you can
see you can have its name and to be
whatever you want now that it's here
it's saved and every time we want to use
that gradient tool I can just come back
here and choose that particular gradient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
