at working with masks inside of flash a
max are really a lot of fun and can be
used in any number of different ways but
animated masks are really quite
interesting the basics of working with
masks and as you as you can see here
what I've done is I've brought in an
image and this is just a picture taken
off of Google an old wood cut of Jacques
Cartier and as you can see our French
explorer here has been placed on to this
layer now if you remember to bring in an
image you just have to go to file import
and you could import it directly to the
stage or directly to your library so now
that I've imported this image and I'm
going to come in here and I'll just give
this JC for Jacques Cartier and as you
can see this JC layer is placed right
here and what I'm going to do is to
create a new layer on top of it called
the mask layer and as you can see the
mask works in this fashion if I have a
mask anything I produce on that layer is
not going to be visible when we actually
do implement this mask but as you can
see here it's got a shape and anything
inside that shape will actually show up
anything outside of that shape will be
hidden by the mask so how do we turn
this simple shape into a mask well if
you right click on this layer you can
turn that layer into a mask and let's
see what happens well first and foremost
what you'll notice is that both layers
are locked and if you unlock one of the
layers then you'll be able to you know
work with either the mask shape or work
with the picture layer but in order to
see the mask in action you have to have
both layers locked just as I do right
here you'll notice that the head of JC
was placed inside of the shape or
underneath the shape I should say so
that's why the head shows up but the
rest of his body everything else is
missing so that shows you how the basics
of the mask fork you'll notice that the
mask layer has a specific icon the
layers that are indeed masked past tense
are indented and they show a different
icon but that's not usually enough as I
can show you right now I'm going to
select this object and we're going to
create a motion tween with it now if you
remember part of what you can do with a
motion tween or how to create a motion
tween is to number one select the object
that you want to motion tween and
convert that object into a symbol I'm
just going to give it em for mask it's a
movie clip its registration is right in
the middle so now i have a movie clip in
place well let's see 30 frames per
second if i wanted one second of
animation i'm going to go to the JC
layer and I'm going to stretch that out
by inserting frames you'll notice it's
all one keyframe I don't need more than
one keyframe here I don't need two
keyframes or anything like that the
picture layer is staying the same the
whole way through however on the mask
layer we've got one movie clip right
here so what I'm going to do is well
first and foremost I think I'll make it
a little bit smaller I'll hold shift and
alt just to create something that looks
a little bit smaller there you go and
now that it is in fact a little bit
smaller actually maybe even a little bit
more there you go and what I'm going to
do with this is to right click on this
layer and say create a motion tween this
is a new tween if you remember and in
order to create the new tween all we
really need to do is to now scale the
object now look what I've done I've
scaled it in here I'll put it in outline
mode so you can see I've scaled it so
that it shows up larger than the actual
shape that we had there to begin with so
what is going to happen in this case
here i'll double-click it actually i'll
just single click it and i'll move it
into position something more like this
you'll notice that's going to move grow
from that center point so as we can see
we don't really see that mask doing much
of anything but if we lock both of those
now you can see the mask in action and
you've got this nice little radial wipe
just like that so if i press control
enter you can kind of see that we have
masks and in fact we have a gradient
mask excuse me a circular mass that's
growing out from the center and it's
giving you an example of an animated
mask in flash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
