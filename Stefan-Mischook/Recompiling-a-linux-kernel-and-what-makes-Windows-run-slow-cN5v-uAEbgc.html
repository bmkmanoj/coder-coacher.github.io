talk about recompiling a Linux kernel so
the kernel is basically a heart of the
Linux operating system it's where all
the device drivers are loaded up device
drivers like your drivers for your sound
card your video cards and so on
now what are the reasons Windows and Mac
OS to a lesser extent are slow is
because they're loading up tons and tons
of device drivers because they got to
account for all kinds of different video
cards all kinds of different sound cards
and so on and so forth and so on so this
slows down the whole system now of
course these days
CPUs are so fast it's hard to see much
of a difference but let's roll back the
clock a few years where I had a computer
where it was just too slow for Windows a
new version of Windows had come out and
the processor just couldn't handle it it
was just too slow it became pretty much
unusable so a good friend of mine knows
that a Linux expert gives me a college
today let's go come over and we'll
recompile a dish a dish new a
distribution and will breathe new life
back into your computer so anyway so I
was copilot piloting the situation and
what we essentially did was to recompile
from scratch the Linux distribution that
particular version of Linux I forget
what it was now I figured I forget which
distribution was anyway so we recompile
it from scratch it's only loading the
drivers for the particular pieces of
hardware in that computer so we're able
to throw out all kinds of excess of all
these drivers that were not needed so
the CPU didn't have to load them etc and
so we did this it was a bit of a job was
kind of a nerd project one afternoon and
as a result once we had this done we
compiled a compartment Accardo
reinstalled the Linux this new machine
while this machine rabbit which could
not really be used as a computer with
Windows was just too slow it became
super
a stylist and to make things just boom
boom boom boom boom boom
super fast windows opening and closing
apps launching was crazy it's like it's
like it's like I put in CPU it was five
times faster now I did a test
interestingly enough I did math test
before after I would calculate how fast
we could run certain processes in Java
on this machine and it stayed the same
speed in that regards right you could
see the speed at which it was doing its
calculations but in terms of the
windowing and the day-to-day use of the
operating system because we recompiled
and because it was so thin and light it
really moves so much more quickly now I
can't say whether or not this type of
recompiling the kernel and hyper
configuration of our hyper precise
configuration would have much of an
impact these days because CPUs are so
bloody fast now but it's an interesting
story
it's it helps you to understand why
operating systems become so big and why
things slow down that's why you need
faster and faster machines it's because
the software because developers are are
having operating systems load in
libraries that it may need because a lot
of people have to plug in something the
driver is not there does lor it's like
ah you know I don't want have to
download drivers so that's the cost of
having these computers that are plug and
play and everything works just fine
because there everything is pre-loaded
if you will and I think that's why mmm
Apple computer Mac computers and Mac OS
is a little zippier overall and more
refined because apple since they don't
allow any OEM to produce computers that
run Mac OS Mac OS can be much more
tightly configured if you will to the
limited hardware that Apple uses
basically Apple knows what video cards
are they reuse what handful of video
cards are going to be use
what handful of whatever you know
display drivers this kind of stuff it
knows exactly what's going to be there
so it is able to provide a much more
efficient operating system as a result
that's the challenge that Windows has
because it's got to adapt to all kinds
of different types of computers that's
pretty much it a little nerd vlog for
you guys ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
