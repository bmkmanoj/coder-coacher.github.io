we had this error here name error names
deaths is not defined that's because we
just typed in the text staff without
quotes now we know that if you are
creating a string data type you have to
put your text or your numbers inside of
quotes like I just did here and
everything will be fine
and we also know if we want to create
numbers we just type out a number and
everything is cool
so let's now jump into the next concept
concept of a variable so I'm going to
use a comment here a variable there we
go so I'm using the Python shell here to
do our quick demos see the whole point
it applies on shell it allows you to
type in code real quickly and then you
hit enter and then python process is it
it's a little bit quicker than typing in
code inside a py file and then saying it
to the Python processor to process the
code so for our demos I'll be jumping
into Python shell every now and then but
when you're doing real coding you're
going to be typing your code into py
files all the time so let's create a
variable I'm going to start with
something simple name equals quotes
stephane so hit enter and a little print
name so you see no errors now what just
happened here well when you do something
like this you're creating a variable in
Python now how variable is just a
container it's a place inside your
computer to hold information so in the
case of name equals stephane we've held
we're holding our we placed both texts
defined inside the variable name so that
only asked python to print out whatever
is in the variable name is called defend
so why is it called a very
we called the variable because what you
hold in the variable name can be changed
it can vary so I'll give you example
ugly name equals and say now it's going
to be either now you'll print name Ivan
so you see the value the information
that we held inside a name has just
changed it's varied
you can put all kinds of information
into variables let's create another
variables we're going to call it called
price and little equals and watch this
25 dollars in 67 no problem there we go
print place 25 and 6 7 now by the way
when you have another would have period
in here like this so you can use it to
creep prices and so on this is another
data type and this data type
is called a float they call it a
floating-point number
floats are not int and they're not
strings of course I just want you to
know that's the third datatype we've
learned now we'll go back here datatypes
we got in string now you just learn
float pretty good it pretty good now you
can see how I'm using the Python shell
to really quickly write out code and get
a response from Python the app rather
than having to save this file and reload
it saves its reload it's just quicker
and you as a coder you might once in
awhile jump into the Python shell just
to check out some code to see if it
works or not really quickly sometimes
people do that kind of thing alright
that's enough for now let's let's move
on to the quiz questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
