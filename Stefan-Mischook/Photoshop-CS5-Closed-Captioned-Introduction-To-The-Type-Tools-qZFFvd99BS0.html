tutorials we're going to be talking
about working with the type tool inside
a photoshop now the type tool for do all
kind of possibilities inside of the
Photoshop environment and there's many
different things that you can do with it
as you probably already know type is a
clear and very important element to any
design work that you're going to be
doing for the most part though you'll
probably be reserving your type work to
any screen based output if you're
working with print and for example if
you're laying out a whole novel of
information then you're more than likely
going to be working with other Adobe
applications like for example in design
or you might be doing some sophisticated
work in something like illustrator
however that doesn't mean that the type
tool inside a Photoshop is something
that you couldn't use for just about any
different project and it's something
that you would be able to do for any
number of different ideas so what I want
to be bringing to your attention here is
how the type tool can help you out
inside of any of the work that you're
choosing to do in Photoshop and we can
start that by just going to the file
menu and choosing a new document and
again for the purposes of this recording
I'm at at 1024 resolution so I'm just
going to choose a web preset of 800 x
600 here you certainly could choose
something that's a lot larger than that
if you wish up to this point though it's
suited me just fine so here is the type
tool it's the last inside of the vector
based shapes as you can see here the
shape drawing tools and that's because
the type tool is something that is
working with a vector-based scenario now
I'm going to just go back to my original
type as you can see here clicking on the
options up at the type here up at the
top excuse me of the type tool allows
you to do a number of things you can
click on this area here and you can
choose from any different type of font
that you might have installed on your
system just as I can
choose one here and for example let's
choose Adobe caslon pro and here you can
choose from regular italic semibold
whatever you have available for that
particular font you also have the
ability of increasing the size or
decreasing size by choosing something
from this little picker down here or as
you can see whenever you put your mouse
on top of somebody something and you get
the left and right arrows you can slide
to increase the size of your particular
font we're going to get into what this
sharp thing does here and it's really
just for setting the anti alias method
of your particular block of text here
you have three very simple and standard
options which are the left alignment
Center alignment and the right alignment
here's where you can get a color and
just clicking on it will allow you to
choose black red whatever color you want
notice there is this little D selected
element right here it's sort of grayed
out because we can't choose it until we
actually have some type on this stage we
won't be able to choose it but when we
do have some type will be able to warp
our text as i'll be showing you how to
do and this little option here toggles
the character and paragraph panels if i
click on it you'll notice that here are
my character and paragraph panels the
shortcut for this panel is command T or
ctrl T on your pc and mac so if you just
come in here should be able to get that
so nevertheless if you're having any
kind of difficulties you can always come
back up here or go to the window menu
and you'll be able to see character and
these characters can then be dragged
into your elements down here as you can
see that's the icon for the character
and this one for the paragraph and
they're easily accessible just through
this option right here so let's just go
through some of the basics of working
with this first and foremost if you are
setting up your type inside of a
document what you can do is create one
of two different types of
typography one is called a point type
which basically allows you to type
something out and if you click here
you'll notice I'm just going to click
and let go now depending on the size
that you've chosen and here look I'll
just take 36 for example it will have a
blinking cursor this cursor then allows
you to write out some type so i'll just
type something out and you'll notice
here in Adobe caslon pro I've got the
phrase type something here now you'll
notice you've got your blinking flashing
element working right there if I wanted
this to wrap for example like have
something underneath this well notice
just by typing along there is no word
wrap here and that's because we just
created some simple point type so if you
want to have something that is going to
be wrapping around I'll show you a
different way of doing that in the next
video tutorial but in the meantime if
you're just creating point type as I did
click and let go what you end up with is
something that looks like this and if
you wanted to have something on another
line you would have to actually hit the
return key to do that but there's easier
ways of putting things on different
lines and separating them in that sense
we'll get to that in the next video as
well now here we are what if I wanted to
type a different line up type so notice
i still have my cursor blinking inside
here if i select type i would have to
click and drag to select all of this
type right here however if i want to
exit this type there's a couple of ways
you can do that you can just click on
the black arrow tool which allows you to
select that type and move it around and
then you would have to go to the type
tool again and start clicking something
over here now i'm going to go around
that and show you another way i'll just
delete this one if i want to select this
type you could just click on it but if
you double click on it well nothing's
really going to happen you still have to
go to the type tool which is T your type
tool shortcut and here we are blinking
inside of the
specific area well if I want it to exit
this here is a great shortcut you can
press the command key I'll actually just
get rid of that so here we are inside
the type and as I mentioned if I wanted
to exit this type this line of type and
then start typing on another line
completely separate independent press
the return key and that will still be
inside of the same block but if you
press command return that now allows me
to as you can see I've got the type tool
here to click and create a separate line
of text
if I want to scale that separate line of
text I would never use the free
transform tool to do that in order to
select something you select the entire
element and then you would change its
size just by sliding in something over
here as you can see now I've got a
separate line of text and type something
on here is independent of that separate
line of text if I wanted to affect
what's happening in this particular
element well then we can scale it up or
down depending on what we want to be
doing with this so now I have two
different types and if you look at your
layer palette let's take a look at what
we've created you've got type something
here on one layer and separate line of
text on another layer so that just shows
you that whenever you start with the
type tool and you start typing out
something new what ends up happening is
it'll create a new layer notice before I
exit this it just says layer 1 but as
soon as I exit this you can press
command return to do that then the name
of whatever is written in here will be
named for your particular layer I don't
want that it's just junk so there you go
and it shows you how you can work with
something along those lines come back in
the next video and I'll show you even
more of what you can do with the type
tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
