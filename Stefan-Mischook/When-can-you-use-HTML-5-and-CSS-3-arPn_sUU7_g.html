sights calm and killer PHP calm in this
video blog I wanted to talk about html5
and css3 now I'm recording this blog in
late May 2010 just in case you're
watching this a few years later right
now html5 and css3 is starting to get a
lot of buzz and the reason is getting a
lot of buzz is because it's extremely
powerful you can do some really cool
stuff with html5 and css3 and you
starting to see tutorials pop up and so
on and that's okay now the thing I
wanted to point out was number one
because of the browsers that are being
used out there today widely on the world
wide web by most people we're talking IE
8 the 7 firefox 3.5 these browsers as of
today do not support do not run html5 or
css3 for the most part so what does that
mean that means you can't really build
public websites today with html5 or css3
and as you start doing some you know
browser sniffing you start jumping
through some hoops some browsers the
iPhone iPad Google Chrome and Safari do
support html5 today but the problem is
it's still a minority of the people out
there on the web so again you're stuck
if you build for html5 if you build with
html5 rather you will be cutting out the
majority of the web surfers today so
what are we looking at when I say you
know it's over 60% use IE some variation
of IE and today as of today II's you
know it's it's it doesn't support any
html5 so even firefox 3.5 has very
limited support so you're kind of stuck
you can expect I would imagine to be
able to use html5 on the public web
probably within three years maybe four
years depending on how quickly people
move from Internet Explorer 7 and 8 to
the latest browsers would support html5
some people may be thinking well that's
quite a long time well not really
because if you think about it
IE 6 which is really old it's a very old
browser if I 10 years old at this point
still people use that you know on killer
sites we're looking at 5% of the
audience which is amazing to me because
killer sites you know it's about web
design and web programming and still 5%
of the are and still use a really old
browser like ie6
a real pain in the neck so I would
imagine that the latest version of ie ie
8 today being that it does not support
any html5 and won't even talking about
IE 7 I don't think these things are
going to be out of wide circulation for
at least a few years unless something
really strange happens so when it comes
down to it when you're thinking about
html5 you can't think about it in terms
of the public web you can think about in
terms of your developing web
applications or websites for let's say
an intranet so it's a company only web
site and you can control what browser
people use so you can tell people you
know you have to use Safari or you have
to use Chrome etc then in that case you
can use html5 of course and the other
option is is if you're designing
specifically for iPad or iPhone or
Android users Android is if you don't
know Google's operating system so any
Android based device will have chrome
enabled browsers which will be th T ml5
fully so there you have it html5 is cool
in fact we're going to be coming out
with a set of videos introduced
some of the really cool aspects of it
but it's not a technology that's ready
for the public web unfortunately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
