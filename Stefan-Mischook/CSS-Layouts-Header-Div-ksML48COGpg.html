created our container div or our div
with the ID called container and we've
separated inside of our code view notice
it's there at the top it's hard to see
because there's no text inside of it so
it's also hard to select so what I want
you to do is to make sure that in your
code view if you're following along in
Dreamweaver you can even tab that in if
you prefer I want you to have your
cursor and make sure that it's inside of
the div called container remember we
also added a little bit of a code at the
end here so that our comment will tell
us where that container div ends so now
that we're right here we're going to
insert another div and this particular
div tag we're going to give another ID
to and we're going to call it header and
the header will define a CSS rule for as
well so here we are with our header div
it's going to be defined in style dot
CSS that's excellent come in here and
say ok and what I want to do is we don't
have to worry about positioning or
anything like that with regards to
absolute fixed or relative or anything
like that but we will define its width
and the width is going to be 960 exactly
the same width as the container itself
and I didn't even have to do that
because as a block level element it
would have stretched out for the actual
width of the container itself and that's
fine but while we're here there's really
no reason why you can't introduce this
particular width now normally I don't
really give a height value however I
will in fact give a height value this
time just so that we can actually expand
what's inside there and I can give you
guys the opportunity to see how big we
can make the header area be however we
want it to be so you know I could come
in here and I could say just give me
like a hundred 100 pixels you can change
that based on your design
or whatever else you want to be doing
and at the same time we're also going to
go into the background area here and I'm
just going to give it you know simple
background color you don't have to be
very fancy at this point I'll just
choose a very simple color and proceed
from that point so what you can see here
is some very basic information I haven't
really defined anything else so I'm just
gonna click OK don't really need to
define anything else at this point
because the header is doing some very
simple stuff for us so we're just gonna
click OK now what you'll see is we have
content for ID header goes here and
that's fine there's nothing wrong with
that we can have that information in
there as we go along it's perfectly
great to do so but do notice that we
have our content and what I'm gonna do
is to just go into my code view and just
clean things up a little bit more so we
can see what things look like remember
you could put as much spacing as you
want in here it's not really a problem
everything will be a little easier to
sort of look at if you know what's going
on inside of it so I'll also at this
point just follow my own advice and at
the end of there I will say end of
header alright so with that information
in place you can hit the Refresh go to
Safari and preview this and again we'll
have to save the index page and notice
the CSS is not saved so we'll save that
as well now we can see our header inside
of this window and notice because the
header is inside of the container the
container is as we saw always centering
that information so that's great now
that we've got the header in place all
we need to do is to define the three
columns that are gonna go underneath the
header and we'll do that in just a
second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
