calm and kill sites calm in this quick
little video I'm going to answer a
question that was recently put to me why
did you choose the Zen fretwork why
don't you choose CakePHP or codeigniter
and there's a whole slew of other ones
out there as well there's two basic
reasons why I chose the Zen framework
this is in 2007 and when it was still in
beta there's two basic reasons why I
decided to go with the Zen framework
versus the other PHP frameworks that are
out there
the first reason was a nerd nerd
technical reason and essentially no let
me back up a couple steps whether I look
forward any web application framework
Weatherbys and/or cake or whatnot I'm
looking for an MVC a model view
controller based framework first and
foremost if you don't know what MVC is
you can look it up on the web or killer
PHP I talked about it there essentially
that's the number one thing the other
thing that I look for is a flexibility
in the framework and what do we mean by
flexibility but I'll put this in the
context of the Zen framework what I
liked about the Zen framework versus
other frameworks out there and maybe
they've changed from from what I recall
back in oh seven but the thing that I
liked about the same framework was that
it was very flexible it was modular you
did not have to use the entire framework
to take advantage of it at all so if I
wanted to I could just dive into some of
these end libraries and use them in even
single simple PHP pages whereas contrast
to that the other frameworks I was
looking at at the time they seem to be
much more of an all-or-nothing deal you
have to use the entire MVC structure or
you couldn't really use the framework
Zend gave us that flexibility and
therefore
work and that was one of the main
technical reasons why I decided to go
with Zend versus other frameworks the
other big reason why I went with the Zen
framework is because of who was backing
the same framework and that of course is
the same company and was significant
about that is that moms end is the
company behind PHP they basically manage
PHP and they're partnered with IBM and
other big companies so you know that Xen
puts out something it's likely going to
be adopted by the general community so
back in 2007 give or take is 2007 when
Xen was still in beta I had faith that
the present' framework would slowly rise
and become the predominant framework in
the PHP community and now in 2009 and
that seems to be the case so what's the
advantage of that why do you care about
the community around the technology why
do you care about the viability of the
community around a technology whether it
be a web application framework or any
piece of software comes out - a few
things number one you want to be sure
that if you invest time and effort and
you deploy applications in a particular
framework or you invest time in a
particular software package you want to
make sure that you know you know you
want to maximize your chance any way
that this particular you know framework
will continue to be developed over time
so I knew that with the zen and the Zen
community that the Zen framework would
continue to evolve and be polished and
added to and perfected more likely than
any of the other frameworks I'm sure
that cake and CodeIgniter they got
strong communities but you never know so
what you should take away from this is
that you always got to look to the
community so that you can ensure afford
development of the platform or framework
that you happen to choose
the other reason I chose the Zen
framework over others is because again a
pragmatic reason is what I felt that it
would probably become the standard and
because of who was behind it and I felt
that it would hasten the development of
the framework I felt that there would be
more innovations in the Zen framework
versus others because of the stronger
community so this besides having
technological advantages where you're
going to get the latest and the greatest
more quickly it's also very good for you
as a developer as a PHP developer
because you're more likely to have
people looking for Zen developers than
Symphony developers or cake developers
perhaps and again this has much less to
do with the technical capabilities of
the frameworks and it has much more to
do with the fact that the Zen framework
is backed by the Zen company which is
essentially PHP let me outline what can
happen when a technology is no longer
supported a downside back in 2000
Microsoft dropped their original page
based web application framework if we're
going to call it that ASP now it's
called ASP classic active server pages
and it was a capable technology people
have done a lot of good stuff with it
but Microsoft decided okay we're going
to we're going to shut that down and
we're going to go to asp.net and
asp.net is so different from classic ASP
that many classic ASP people did not
transition to asp.net because it's a
totally different paradigm asp.net is
much closer and much more similar to JSP
javaserver pages that was the classic
ASP so a lot of ASP people they stuck to
classic ASP because they didn't want to
jump over to make speed on that and over
time they find themselves being left
behind because there's no future
development in classic ASP I think I
went to a SP 3 from HP 2.0 to ASB 3 but
it's it's a very hobbled web page
technology now it's it's kind of Hubble
2 right word but it's very very limited
and they're basically left out now
they're hung out to dry sort of speak
it's a that's it you know that's what
happens when you find yourself in a
dead-end technology the world quickly
goes by and you're left nowhere and so
these people actually was interesting
enough a lot of them moved over to PHP
because that PHP was a lot easier to
pick up and learn than asp.net but
that's another story and finally I just
want to point out that what one of my
assistants who was working with me on
the project from 207 when we when we
were using Zen beta was n framework in
beta rather just recently actually it
turned out to be a good move because he
was contacted by a large corporation who
want to incorporate Zen in in their
back-end operations so having that Zen
knowledge paid off for him in terms of
getting a pretty good gig
