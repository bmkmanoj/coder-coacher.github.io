vlog I'm gonna talk about
aetherium miners very soon but I just
want to make a point so I'm on in my
city of Montreal there's a mountain and
I'm right on the edge of the mountain
where I live so I like to drive up to
the top of the mountain and there's this
big parking lot here to a public park
but I come to it just to relax taking
some Sun on a good day I have my coffee
is just relaxing for me so I'm in this
huge parking lot huge and it's pretty
empty I'd say about 80% empty dozens and
dozens of spots all over the place so I
go Park in an area away well away from
the next car which is like 10 cars over
20 cars over 20 cars over but humans
have this very powerful herding instinct
it's amazing to observe I will park my
car like 20 cars over alone and there's
space everywhere in a parking lot so
what do I get I get this guy come it
happens all the time they'd come up and
they'd park right beside me right beside
me now normally I wouldn't care but I'm
coming up here to relax and to blog and
vlog and of course the guy parks right
be side me I told my friend that I would
go into a mall parking Scott mall and
again I would park far away from
everybody I tell my friend I said bitch
can we come back out something's gonna
park right beside me and sure enough it
happens I'd say about 80% at a time
some herder some cheapo decides he's
gonna park right beside me even though
there's tons of space is far far away
and I'm not saying like two cars over I
mean like right here make there's like
all the space like this right so we you
know every bacon driven no no right
right beside me sorry it's one of my pet
peeves I it's amazing to observe and I
know it's just a herd instinct you see
it in a highway on the highway as well
you drive on the highway and when you do
long you know when you're driving on the
highway everybody tends to cluster
together right instead of like you know
giving a little space they all cluster
together it's amazing and it's it's
silly because when you're driving
whatever 100 kilometers an hour or 65
miles an hour 75 miles an hour
and you got people you know not
bumper-to-bumper pretty close when they
don't need to be the amount of effort
you have to put mental energy to drive
is it's considerably more because you're
gonna slow down and speed up and turn
lanes cuz people are passing and there's
no need for that you herders you don't
need to do that what I do is I
discovered that if I if I if if the
speed limit is say 65 everybody's going
70 or 75 whatever it is what I will do
is I will slow down to about you know 10
miles an hour slower than than the
average person and what happens is that
their herd will come by me every so
often so I'll be alone on the highway
I'll talk about I'm in Canada so it's
always in kilometers an hour so
everybody does like on the highway you
know there are speed limits are 100
kilometers an hour and everybody's doing
maybe 110 115 so what I do I do 100 and
even though I got a you know I got a
pretty fast car I do 100 why do I do 100
cuz everybody is doing 115 so they all
herd together and when you do 100 you
will get the herds the flocks of cars
will herd past you every 10 minutes or
so and then you be alone on the highway
and what happens is your mental
awareness doesn't have to be so you know
so raised up so it's a lot easier to
drive that way because the herders will
herd it's unbelievable anyway so I was
sorry for that rats it's just one of my
pet peeves I don't understand it well I
understand it but it is annoying
so yeah a theory of mining so a friend
of mine decided to put together in
theory a mining machine from scratch so
he built it up and he bought a home I
think it's 12 12 GPUs 12 graphics cards
he rigged up this thing from scratch he
bought the motherboard he bought the
graphics cards and all the rest of it
it's just fascinating and he's got this
machine so you put it in a shed and it's
up here in Canada the winters get pretty
cold but you go in a shed even on a cold
day it's like it's very toasty warm in
that shed so he's got the etherium miner
going and he's pumping out the etherium
I think that all these individual
cryptocurrencies in of themselves are is
just a giant tulipmania
there's no intrinsic value in these
things I know the crypto currency guys
will argue with me
no give me the same arguments but the
gold and the silver guys will give as
well you're all be us okay I gotta let
the Windell down because I got a wasp
trying to get in your head buddy
anyway so all these guys they'll give
you all these reasons why they say that
these coins are worth they're not worth
anything because they're just there's
nothing behind them until the market you
know a little de menthe what's behind
him is the belief that they're worth
something and then when that belief goes
away it hopefully it's gonna crash that
said this mania could go on for four
years four years so that's why my friend
decided to build a miner and he's making
these coins the ROI - return on
investment for the miners at this point
is about 12 months so if you create a
dedicated miner to recover your money on
that miner is going to take you about
twelve months of mining the cerium coin
I don't know what it is with Bitcoin I
imagine it's probably about twelve
months as well anyhow two things I think
you can make money mining aetherium
buying and selling buying and you know
and gambling with the stuff will go up
it will probably go up for a little
while at least because that's the nature
of psychological of our psychologies of
our speculation and until something
happens and so yeah you know is it a
great is it investment I don't consider
it an investment I consider it a
gambling a bet if you will but chances
are and don't take the advice of a nerd
in terms of these type of speculations
chances are will continue to go up for a
while so that's why my buddy of mine is
investing in these things and into two
minors rather and you'll probably do
well by it you know so but understand
that the market could drop out at any
moment so it's it's a bit of a risk it's
a bit of a risk so the safe thing to do
is if you decide to start mining the
fourth theory in Bitcoin or like coin or
whoever it is that you might want to
mine for you want to pull out your
profits at least 50% on a regular basis
this way you're hedging your bets you're
protecting yourself on the way up the
big mistake the big mistake would be to
hoard all your coins coins
perpetually cuz it's not like buying
stock in a solid company like Apple or
something it's it's very speculative so
if you have this strategy where you you
as you press say you're producing I
don't know ten coins a month sell out
five every month sell out file keep five
cell font keep five sell five
so yeah at least you're getting back
some of your investment pretty quickly
or smarter strategy safer strategy it
would be to produce coins until you've
produced enough to pay back your machine
the cell always until you get you back
to mount your money back then you just
play with the houses money meaning then
you can start just saving up your big
your your etherium coins or your
bitcoins or whatnot
anyway I've rambled too long ciao
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
