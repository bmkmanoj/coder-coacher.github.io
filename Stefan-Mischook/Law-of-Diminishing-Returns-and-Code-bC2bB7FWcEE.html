of diminishing returns so what is that
the law of diminishing returns is a
universal principle which tells you that
at some point the more you invest in
something it could be a technology it
could be a gadget it could be a process
there's at some point where the amount
of money you have to put into something
to get any extra benefit becomes
exponentially more expensive so let me
give me an example let's talk about I
don't know computers do you know that
the price difference between the top of
a lion computer with the fastest
processors the fastest RAM the fastest
memory and fastest hard disk you may
spend are destroyed or number $3,000 on
the fastest and the second fastest which
would be maybe a thousand dollars
cheaper for 2-grand
may only be 10% or 15% slower so you
have to span 50% more money to go from 2
to you have to go from $2,000 to $3,000
to get that squeezed out that extra 10
or 15% speed that is a classic example
of the law of diminishing returns the
return that you get on your investment
diminishes as it gets higher and higher
and higher the performance gets higher
and higher and higher in the computer
same thing with fancy cars for example
fancy cars the difference between a
$100,000 car in terms of how luxurious
it is how fast it is and some of these
million-dollar cars or half-million our
cars is like this there is a difference
but it's it's really not huge and yeah
so that's another example of the law of
diminishing returns you can go on and on
and on same with coding by the way you
can go in there and refactor and polish
and
your codebase to make it better to make
it faster to make it easier make it
simpler rather simpler is easier but at
some point you can only it only goes so
far in terms of your return on
investment your investment of course
when you're coding is your time so you
may spend 20 hours to clean up a couple
of libraries as you created several
classes of code regardless of the
language but you may in cleaning that
code up and spending that 20 hours of
work trying to clean it up it's hard to
say depending on the circumstances you
may improve the speed of your code by a
huge amount or you may only speed it up
just a little bit you know might you
might make a go temperature faster now
this comes down to judgment and
experience but I've done both where I've
come to situations where I say okay we
got a bottleneck in the code a
bottleneck means that place where you
know the data of throughput is squeezed
like a bottle that's a little expression
so when you look at apps I'm just going
to digress for a little bit when you
look at apps I always look at apps as
being flows of data I think of it as
rivers of data or maybe flows of data
like going through the pipes the pipes
of course is your app is your code right
and when you're moving data from one one
place to the next place whether it be in
a web app when somebody logs in sends a
username and password and then you
process that and then spit back a result
this is flowing data and most apps
especially Web Apps most of the work is
just moving data from a database to a
web page or an app and then back into
the database again
think of it as a river flowing river of
information that's how I look at it and
then you write the code to facilitate
the flow of this information so once in
a while and some of you code you're
gonna have you're gonna have one of
these bottlenecks where the information
is flowing really nicely really nice and
it's gonna go squeeze there's a little
hole so it slows the whole thing down
just like traffic
on a busy highway at rush hour so you as
a coder you have to learn wolf
experience and with training it's more
experience to be honest with you you're
gonna learn where you can discover the
bottlenecks are and then you can clean
up those bottlenecks open them up in the
code so you got a better flow of data
now if your talk properly had a code
they're gonna you're gonna learn some
basic principles that show you where a
lot of the bottlenecks are a lot of
times is with the database it's always
with the database so you got to learn to
build smart database structures so that
when you're pulling information and
you're writing information to the
database it's it's more efficient but
that's another story anyway so the law
of diminishing returns again to recap to
get to my point now is that your
investment in anything fast cars coding
exercise whatever you know whatever hat
whatever you phenomen you want to look
at there's a point where the amount of
investment you put into it will return
less and less and less result so you as
a developer and in your life you have to
try to figure out where you start
hitting you know at that point in your
investments cycle where the investment
further investment is not really worth
it so for instance I was talking about
in recent vlog how to speed up an app
instead of going in there and spending
tens of hours trying to refine the code
the easier solution and a much faster
solution a much better payoff was in a
migrating from an earlier version of PHP
to a newer version because from PHP 5 to
PHP 7 or is a big leap in performance
and B was to go from an older server
which had older traditional spinning
drives to SSD drives which are so much
more father but so much quicker so we
got much better result so instead of
spent 20 30 hours and the equivalent
money and doing back
we spent a fraction of time migrating to
more modern servers with more modern PHP
and doing a huge great results as a
reason as a result of that so that was
it
again we spent a lot of time don't get
me wrong in optimizing the code but it
came to a point where say you know it's
gonna be a huge job to gut this this one
section that says it stinks
admit it you know code that gets old
stinks a lot so you know what Microsoft
does and I used to make fun of the
strategy but actually it's a good
strategy if you got a code base that
stinks but it works well you got no bugs
but it's kind of messy what I mean it
stinks I mean it's kind of messy and you
kind of worried to get in there because
it could be pretty messy you'll want to
break anything that's when you use
something but software developers will
call the facade pattern you basically
create a layer of code that sits on top
so you don't touch and disturb this
other code be create a layer on top of
it that adds your new functionality or
repair certain things without messing
with their code underneath because messy
was decoder underneath could be
extremely extremely a dangerous thing to
do you could disrupt your whole app
anyway so there you go law of
diminishing returns it applies to coding
it applies to exercise don't everybody
over exercises by the way my
physiotherapist worked with our
professional football team up here in
Canada Canadian football is you know
whatever but nonetheless she was telling
me that most people over train and so
they train like crazy and actually hurt
their bodies and that's section that's
worse than hitting the law at that point
of diminishing returns as far war
actually you're actually hurting
yourself so moderation is actually a a
good thing as I'm going off on a tangent
here but again learning to identify when
you're hitting that point of diminishing
returns and knowing when to stop and
consider another strategy like Intel
they were working on their processors to
get them faster and faster and faster
and faster and then they discovered it
could only get so fast because we're
getting too hot there's all kinds of
problems super fast processors to say it
better solution is to create more cores
norco
so ya said of a once super fast Cory
have four moderately fast cores and
Alison you get a much more performance
system but of course when you have
multiple cores the software has to be
written to take advantage - of all these
cores ahead the software has to be
multi-core enabled and of course most
apps these days are so anyway when all
over the place I hope you found this
vlog useful when it user what are the
universal principles the law of
diminishing returns
learn to identify it and when you hit it
learn to take another strategy to get to
where you wherever you want to go and
code in life and exercise and so on
