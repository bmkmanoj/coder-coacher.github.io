coffee hmm so I decided to take a little
drive up to my my favorite spot in the
cemetery here and the reason being is
that I'm running into something I call
analysis paralysis so what that is I
have a ton of things I gotta do a lot of
them are little tiny little things I got
some big things I got to do nothing is
super pressing but some things are
clearly more important another so here's
the thing I got a bunch of small things
that have to be done that could be done
pretty quickly but they're not that
important on the other hand has some big
things I got to do which will take time
but they're important much more
important but again not pressing so I'm
sort of like humming and hawing between
doing the important things versus and
not important thing so I'm sort of in
this analysis paralysis what I do in
that situation is I just come up here
anyway go for run go for a walk well I
don't run anymore but anyway do some
exercise do something to get my mind off
of my work so that I can try to figure
out and prioritize what it is i'm going
to do you see when you're doing a bunch
of little things that are unimportant
they are little but they add up to a lot
of things and they could drain a lot of
your energy especially when you're doing
things that are creative like coding or
writing content etc so my inclination is
to head over to do the big important
things because the little things are not
that important at the same time and you
think wow I can just knock off these
little things and get them done very
quickly and then they're done so you
know sort of running around in circles
analysis paralysis normal for me at
times so that's pretty much it so one
way to solve that is to come up into the
country and country whatever into the
park here and enjoy the the fall the
beginning of fall the leaves are
starting to turn on the trees
and hopefully you will get some clarity
well at least I will get some clarity in
terms of what I have to do next but
again i'm probably going to be heading
off to do the big projects the important
projects so that I approach them with a
cleaner or fresher mind you don't want
to jump around between different
projects because then you got that
startup time so let's say you're coding
two projects and you sort of get you
know halfway through one and then you
decide you're going to do another you
know you're gonna stop it and then jump
into another one then you decide to come
back to the first one the problem with
that there's going to be this you know
good 20 minutes or so just sort of
getting back into the frame of mind so
you understand where you left off with
the previous project and what you're
going to do with that it's a waste of
time so you're better to just finish
something get it done that's it so
that's pretty much it so you tell me
what you think this is actually a pure
vlog I'm not really giving it nice as
opposed so tell me what you think if you
were me would you do the big project and
get that done or would you take care of
all those little things are not so
important just to wipe the table clean
of that so you sort of approach the big
projects I have two big projects that so
you approach those two big projects with
a clean mind that's pretty much it I'm
now using my little portable camera here
just because brand new camera which is
fantastic it's really heavy though my
arms are not strong enough to hold it up
for a total vlog so I figured I'll just
use this camera it's good enough for now
we'll talk soon ciao ciao
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
