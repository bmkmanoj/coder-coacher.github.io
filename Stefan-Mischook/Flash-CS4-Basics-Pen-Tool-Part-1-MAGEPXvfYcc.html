taking a look at some of the drawing
tools inside a flash and we'll begin by
looking at the pen tool so as you can
see if you select the pen tool keyboard
shortcut you'll notice is P for pen it
allows you to work with this particular
tool that we have here do note that if
anybody is familiar with other drawing
applications like illustrator or even
photoshop you will be familiar with this
pen tool and it's one of the most
versatile of all the drawing tools and
you should really get used to working
with it if you plan to be doing any kind
of visual illustration so as you can see
here we are in flash and in order to
utilize pen tool what I'll do is just
click and let go and as you can see by
doing that that creates what's called an
anchor point this anchor point will be
used to connect different line drawings
as you continue if you just click again
you'll end up with fairly straight lines
as you can see here they are not curved
they are straight and what that allows
us to do is to click and just go around
click click click click and if you want
to at this point you'll notice this is
just a line drawing but in order to
complete this as a particular shape
drawing what you'll need to do is to
come to the original starting point of
your drawing and just click on that
original anchor and you'll notice it's
your original anchor of course because
it's got a little circle next to it
meaning we've completed the circle we're
coming around full circle that close up
this particular shape so if I click here
you'll notice that this is in fact a
finished shape it doesn't really look
like much but as you can see if I switch
to my black arrow selection tool I will
now be able to double click to select
all of the stroke or do any number of
different things and if I want to fill
it in with color as you can see here
I've got blue I can choose my paint
bucket tool and just fill it in just
like that
and that is how you make some straight
lines i'm going to say control a to
select all and backspace to delete it
and if we switch back to this again i
point out that at this point if you
wanted to make perfectly straight lines
hold shift and as you can see here
holding shift allows you to come around
and do that if you did want to have a
line drawn on a diagonal holding shift
gives you a nice 45 degree angle and
then you could come back here and close
up your path and once that path is
closed you can fill it in with a color
and make it look however you like so now
the next step in the pen drawing tool
will be to learn how to make curved
lines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
