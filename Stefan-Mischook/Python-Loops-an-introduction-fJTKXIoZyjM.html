in programming there's something called
loops as in looping over and over and
over and over and over again and that's
one of the powers really of computers is
that computers are able to do certain
repetitive tasks over and over and over
again and super quickly saves us a lot
of time so in all programming languages
you have something called the loop and a
loop allows you basically to loop over
information to loop over variables data
there as you know is a fancy word for
information so in Python like so many
other programming languages we have
something called a for loop we have a
while loop anyway another word for loop
is iterate or it iterates over something
over and over again so for example let's
say you're like me and you have a code
so you have a code and you have medicine
for your code here's the medicine right
here so if you wanted to count how many
pills you have in this trailed front I
guess these are tylenol you would go one
two three four five six and pretend your
buddy
Iggy is not paid attention you go step
how many pills do you have they go Iggy
I just counted them so you can you do it
again can you iterate over again my god
Iggy pay attention one two three four
five six six bills
that's an iteration right I'm iterating
over it and I'm just to be sure I'm
going to count them again i'ma iterate
loop through it one more time one two
three four five six that's an example of
an iteration a loop
I'm counting information I'm counting
how many kills are in this pack here so
in programming when you're building
video games drawing shapes
maybe a poem records from Facebook
database or instagrams database you know
a whole bunch of records for instance
you may have an Instagram and you may
have 10,000 photos in your Instagram how
will the Instagram app know how many
photos you have well it's going to use a
loop it's going to use a while loop
probably maybe a four loop later on in
the course we're going to look at the
differences between four and a while
loop and why would you want to use them
and so on
but now that we understand at least the
basic ideas about what it look does
let's actually write some Python looping
code and we're going to write the for
loop alright let's get into it
alright now that we got the basics
covered let's actually write some code
and we're going to take a first look at
the for loop you know when you're
learning out of code you've got to write
code as much as you possibly can it's
kind of like boxing but I was boxing one
of my coaches you say if you got a box
you get a box you gotta get in the ring
you got a box you might get your nose
broken but that's how you gonna learn
how to box with coding you gotta get in
there you got to write code fortunately
though when you're writing code you
can't get your nose broken you might get
a little sore finger or something from
clicking on the mouse but you won't get
your nose broken anyway so I'm going to
option space book launch I del I del as
you know is the Python code editor so
I'm on Mac again but you could use
Windows doesn't matter so first thing I
want to do is create a variable so I'm
gonna create a variable if I'm not just
about okay so now we have a variable
it's ready to go so what we're going to
do is we're going to write our for loop
so we know for now we know that's a
keyword in Python a special word because
it's highlighted in orange t to orange
so for X in and then we're going to type
in the name so I'm going to explain what
this all is in a second but let's just
run through it so now I'm going to hit
enter once
let's say print looping alright then hit
enter again and then I hit enter again
there we go
so you notice the road out looping how
many times that one two three four five
six wonder why I wrote it out six times
that's interesting notice how the text
to fan one two three four five six let's
look at some of this code for instance
this X here is a variable when you are
creating a for loop you start with the
keyword for then you put in your
variable and I'll explain what this
variable does here this variable here is
pretty much like this variable here
except when you create a variable in a
for loop like this what's happening well
explain seventy-second so for X in
that's another keyword you know the key
word because it's highlighted in orange
in name name is of course this variable
name so what's going on with this
particular for loop code here what's
going on is that Python knows that we're
writing a for loop because we're using
the for keyword and in keyword so what
we're saying is that we're going to loop
through the contents of the name
variable remember a variable is just a
container and holds information and for
each thing that our for loop finds in
that variable in this case reach letter
stick it in X so what happens with the
for loop is Python reads within the name
variable and for each letter it prints
out the text looking at the same time
it's inserting each letter in X so it
goes one loop and then it prints looping
for each dog s for s then it goes the T
you got I got a T it does another loop
prints out looping it goes to e bubble
boom printer loopy again okay
so let's make it a little bit more
interesting so I'm going to when you go
for each exit name notice that I have to
have this
here so I'm going to do this I'm going
to print and I'm going to say X now
what's X remember when the for loop runs
every time it runs into a letter it will
stick that letter in X and then in this
case we're going to print out whatever
letter happens to be an X and then it'll
start over again
so those as it goes it was blonde twice
and I got our salt-free for each letter
in the variable name siliceous get it
again hit enter there you go so so what
we want to do now let me smooth this up
and we're going to say print and put
some text the letter in is a variable X
variable X is space plus X hit enter
enter again the loop runs it starts and
again it's looking inside the variable
name right we declared the variable name
up here and it just first time it goes
into x equals s the little test noodles
e and add blablabla this is just a basic
introduction to the way variables work
in Python but it's a start</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
