vlog I just want to mention that for the
first time ever and this YouTube channel
has been up for several years I actually
turned on monetization now I don't think
it's gonna make me too much but I figure
what why not why not if it takes me an
hour or so a day to put out these vlogs
depending on you know how many I put out
so I figure why not try it out and if
makes me any money I'll buy some extra
coffee or something so let me know if
the ads are intrusive or not I'm just I
don't think they are because i watch
youtube guys and girls and I don't I'm
not pretty I'm not particularly bothered
by the ads myself so hopefully you guys
won't be bothered as well and that's
pretty much it i just want to let you
guys know what the probably saw above
anyway so the ads are coming up but of
course on the flip side if the ads
actually produce some reasonable
reasonable revenue to fund this whole
process where it's worth my time to take
away from my main business which is
studio web then i'll put a little bit
more effort into it which means better
content for you guys anyway that's
pretty much it thanks for watching and
if you have any strong opinions about
the ads or not just loving a hole in the
comment below of course that's it bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
