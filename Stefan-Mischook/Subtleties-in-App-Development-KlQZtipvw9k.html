subtleties of app development so here we
are we're looking at the development
version of studio web where we are
currently working on a bunch of elements
in the app to improve its functionality
to make it more user-friendly now I'm
not going to go into all kinds of
details but the main point of this vlog
is to say that one of the huge things
that separate the great apps and are not
so great apps is the subtleties in how
the app works and looks a lot of little
things that make things really nice so
let me just in case you don't know this
is a training system so the way it works
you watch a video and watch a video and
you can go full screen etc etc anyway so
you finish watching a video and you get
a quiz question here's a basic quiz view
so there's a lot of subtleties let me
give you a couple things that we have
first of all we have localized dialog
boxes so I submit I don't add an answer
so you see right away right here right
in front of your face we show you a
response we give you an instant response
and another thing that we do is we now
give instant responses well we've been
doing since day one in terms of right
and wrong answer so I'm going to put in
this answer here which i think is wrong
and you see we get instant response
localized dialog boxes now I'm going to
give a right answer I don't know if you
hear have a nice sound effect in there
if you heard that you notice it's a bit
of a delay in the sound effect so
because of that delay we're tweaking
that just that little subtle teen in the
delay in my opinion negatively impacts
the quality of the app so it's too slow
it needs to kick in maybe a second
earlier and so we're going to have to
we're going to play with that timing so
that's just a quick example of when you
are building an app how little
subtleties in details
this will have a huge impact in terms of
how well the app runs as far as a user
is concerned alright that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
