object working at least the basics and
we had the load function working next
thing that I want to do is I want to
create some sort of system that allow us
to save and retrieve variables inside
this template object so we can display
them within our views and I did this
previously with the other login video
series that I did using just a standard
PHP based array however since we have a
template object I want to make sure that
anything related to the template stays
within the template so I'm gonna create
setter and getter functions within this
object to set any data that's going to
be used by our views so now that we have
the slowed function in place let me go
ahead and start by including another
function and I'll preface this with get
slash set data comment just so I keep
things organized and I'm going to create
a function that I'm going to call set
data and we're going to give this
function two variables or two arguments
so we're going to pass in the name of
the variable that we want to set and the
value
and in order to save data within this
object we need some sort of variable to
save it in so up at the top
beneath class template I'm going to
include a variable I'm gonna call it
private data like this whoopsie data
like that and I will save this and the
private as I believe Stephan talked
about in the beginners object-oriented
series was the private indicates that
this variable is only going to be
accessible within this particular class
so I can't access this data variable
outside of the class for example here so
what I'm going to do within my set data
function is I'm going to set this data
and I'm going to make data be an array
the array key will be the name that we
provide and that's going to equal the
HTML entities and in this case I'm maybe
using the set data function to grab
information from our view for example
input from forms and similar so I'm
using the HTML entities function to
clean our data so HTML entities and
we're going to provide it the HTML
entities function with the value and end
quotes like so and this is pretty
standard so let's save this and now that
our data is set and let me show you an
example we could do
template set data and we provide it to
strings one is the name of the variable
and the value so this is what our set
data function will look like when we
call it and this set data function isn't
very useful unless we have some way of
accessing this data so I'm going to
follow that with another function and
it's gonna be function get data and all
we're going to do with this function the
only argument it's going to have is the
name of the variable that we're trying
to get so in this case I'm going to do
if is set so this makes sure that the
variable we are trying to access excuse
me is accessible we're going to use this
data and we're going to provide it the
key within our data array so name so if
that's set we want to return
the value otherwise let's return a blank
string like so let's get data and set
data in place let's go ahead and modify
our code a little bit to test this
functionality so I'm gonna go back to
login dot PHP and I'm gonna move this
set data function up above the loading
of our view like so so I'm gonna save
that and now I'm gonna go to our view
and the convenient thing about the way
the template object works is because
this view is loaded within this template
object that means we can use the this
let me show you you can use the this
variable to call functions within that
template object so what we can do is we
can do echo this get data and you pass
in the variable that we want to display
in this case I want to display name
because that's what we set here within
the set data function and let me remove
the test save this and preview and see
what it looks like
so you'll notice now the h1 holds our
value which we set using the set data
function so that's working perfectly
let's also check let's change name I'll
just change it to name too and let's
preview this and it looks like we get a
blank string like we should you could
potentially change this to return an
error message of some sort
you know variable not set or something
similar it's up to you I'm just gonna
leave it with a blank string for the
moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
