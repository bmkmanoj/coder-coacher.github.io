is to open up a new file and just choose
a very simple web preset doesn't really
matter what the size is and what we're
going to be exploring right now is
working with the vector drawing tools
and the options that you have available
from this little list over here inside
your tools if you double click on this
you can see that it'll be a two column
layout and you'll notice that there are
divisions inside of Photoshop as I
mentioned earlier and what we're going
to be exploring now are the areas right
here where we see a number of vector
drawing tools and these are really
useful tools that will allow you a lot
of help inside of Photoshop when it
comes to creating all kinds of very
interesting effects now first and
foremost let me explain the difference
well number one if I were to create a
new layer and let's say I wanted to
create a very simple circle and if I
then wanted to fill it in with some
color I could take my paint bucket tool
and just drop a color in there command D
or control D on your PC and as you can
see this is a pixel-based shape just as
you can see here it's just layer one now
I'm going to call it circle or actually
more appropriately I'll call it pixel
circle so there's my pixel circle
however you'll notice if I wanted to
create an ellipse using the ellipse tool
here a vector-based circle well let's
see what the difference will be they're
roughly about the same size you know
well number one you'll notice it's got
this black line around it almost like a
stroke well don't worry that's just
something that I'll explain later that's
the actual path when you select
something it's going to show you what
the path shape looks like but if I click
it over here you'll notice that well
doesn't have that shape anymore and they
both pretty much look the same however
there are some major differences here
for example if I wanted to increase the
size of this object here is the pixel
one well if I press ctrl T
and holding shift I increase the size of
this object whoa look at that edge not
really the nicest that I would ever say
you could create in Photoshop command T
I'll do it to the vector base shape
instead and let's see the difference
significant difference dramatic amount
of difference here notice the edge on
this and notice the edge on the vector
the vector base shape is calculated
mathematically as opposed to the pixel
base which are created by you know
putting a number of squares together
let's also see something else what if I
select this pixel circle and I want to
change its color to some other color for
example I'm going to choose I don't know
something like red well if I drop in my
pink bucket blah that's terrible look at
that pixelization it's really nasty it
looks horrible
however let's make this shape red how do
we do it do we paint on it no not at all
in fact that's what this little icon is
here for double-clicking it allows you
to pick a color and look how beautifully
that is being effected as opposed to
what we had to work with when we didn't
have vector styles or vector drawing
capability inside a Photoshop so as you
can see very simple shapes and contours
and stuff that in the past used to
always be done with the selection tool
can now be done with vector shapes and
allow you for a lot of really
interesting possibilities so that's just
an overview when you come back I'm going
to go through each one of these tools in
greater detail and you'll be able to see
some of the advantages of working with
these vector shapes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
