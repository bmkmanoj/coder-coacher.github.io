this video I'm gonna get off a code just
for a minute because I want to talk
about crazy audio file nerds now an
audio file is somebody who's really into
sound and music and so what they
typically do well what they always do
they spend a lot of money on speakers
amps they'll get turntables go into reel
to reel tapes sometimes HD audio and
spend all kinds of crazy money on cables
that connect the turntables or the CD
player or the amps of speakers and all
kinds of weird stuff so here's my
general comment number one these guys
are highly susceptible in my opinion to
suggestion because they will be
presented some product by a vendor who
will suggest that the sound would be
better because this survive the other
thing and they sit there and some of
them actually believe it although you
know I personal hear a difference now
let me just say something I do have some
audiophile speakers but and I have an
audiophile amp but I have like on the
lower end of it because what I found
there is definitely a difference between
$500 speakers in the $2000 speakers in
terms of sound quality in terms of the
amps I don't find much of a difference
between the ABS each amp has its own
little signature if you will its own
little sound it's not necessarily one
sounds better than the other just a
little bit different but the speaker's
do make a difference so when you're
looking at audio if you're concerned
about audio and audio sounds that's
interesting to you it's not you can just
you know pause the video or leave the
video wait for one of my code videos if
you're looking at sound quality the two
most important things by far counts for
95% of the sound it's the source meaning
the quality of the digital file that's
an HD file and the quality of the needle
on the turntable if you're doing vinyl
and of course the quality of the vinyl
itself there's some differences well the
quality of aisle of twenty percent and
of course the original record
if the original recording was well done
then this is going to translate pretty
well and the other major component and
by probably the most important component
is the speakers the speakers have a huge
impact again if you go from $500
speakers to $2000 speakers you're going
to see a big difference in the sound
quality there's no question well you're
gonna hear a big difference in the sound
quality and that's pretty much it I've
done tests on cables and tests on
different amps and other gadgets that
they won't try to sell you and it's in
my opinions a load of BS and you'll see
that with a lot of these audio file guys
they'll come up with these weird terms
to to try to describe how a particular
component in their stereo will make the
sound better they'll say it has better
it's more musical or it's it's more
present these these weird turns that
don't really mean anything in particular
they have a vague meaning as opposed
that's a sure sign by the way when you
deal with somebody who's lation less and
genuine in my opinion if they can't be
specific about what they are trying to
sell you what they are describing that
means they either don't know or they are
biessing you so there you go I've seen
these crazy audiophile guys out there on
the web on YouTube and I have to admit
one of my entertainments like well I
like watching these guys because they
will review like 50,000 dollar
turntables or $80,000 speakers and
claimed it's worth it's a bargain these
speakers or thousand-dollar cables or CD
players are these huge CD players of all
kinds of gadgets and tubes in them and
all kinds of weird stuff and they're
very expensive CD players I don't know
the price they could be ten thousand
dollars for a CD player and you know I
know think that somehow the sounds gonna
be much better again this said yes there
is some differences in sound quality
when it comes to the quality of the
cartridge you put on a turntable if
you're into turntable
there is some difference
and sound quality when you have HD
digital file a 24-bit digital file there
is also difference when you have a real
good speaker but all those other jazz
and it's just I just don't hear it I
think it's a bunch of suggestion meaning
psychological suggestion people like you
know if you go to a hip hypnotist
a hypnotist show 40% of people are
susceptible to suggestion so you tell
them you're their chicken 40 percent
will think there are chicken you tell
these people that this this special wire
is going to open up the sound 40 percent
of people will believe that because you
just suggested in they're susceptible to
it again this might get some audiophile
people crazy but I'm putting this out
there sort of like a friendly warning to
people don't get caught up with this
craziness spending tens of thousands of
dollars on components I remember a
friend of mine came over and he had
spent forty five thousand dollars on a
stereo which is actually quite modest
for audio files and I had spent about
three thousand bucks on my turntable
with pair of speakers in an app I have
four thousand dollars and closed his
eyes he listens he listens he silent he
listens and then he goes it sounds
pretty much like mine and of course my
stereo costs one tenth of his and so I
should tell you something so be careful
with the audiophile stuff it's the laws
of diminishing returns really kicks in
you know speakers do make a difference
but you know after like three four
thousand dollar speakers I could not
hear the difference personally between
the $3,000 speaker and the $50,000
speaker to my ears there's no difference
so that's all you got to say ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
