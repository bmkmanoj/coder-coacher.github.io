about the very first time my real code
way back in 1994 I wrote my very first
web page in 1994 because my brother came
up to me and said you know you should
set up a website and I said to him
what's a website you understand in 1994
the web was really new to most people
compared to today there was a very small
number of websites and in fact when I
put up my first website I had one of the
very first web sites in the world
and I had one of the very first websites
with images back in those days most of
the websites websites put out by
universities text only for academic
communications so it was a brand new
field and nobody knew what to make of it
famously at that time the CEO of
Microsoft bought a there's web thing is
just a fad that's Bill Gates even Bill
Gates thought it was just a fad and I
remember talking to a good friend of
mine about six months eight months later
we're thinking to ourselves you know
this Web thing it might turn into
something a board it might turn into
something important anyway so I'm
walking in to the whole new world of
coding I was not in ered in my
background in fact I studied design
photolithography layout and then I was
in the import-export business of water
purification products and rare fish for
public exuse aquariums and collectors so
I wasn't exactly a tech oriented type of
dude but I saw the value in learning to
code even in those days even when people
weren't sure what was going to happen I
just knew in my gut that this web thing
was going to be important so I started
to learn the basics of writing code in
those days there wasn't such a thing as
a Dreamweaver a front page' wasn't a web
design software
there was no pad that was it you just
wrote code so I bought a book on web
design while HTML and I just started to
learn the basics now back in those days
a shell was very very simple compared to
today but the same basic rules are in
place CSS was a dream there's no such
thing as CSS so in terms of styling we
had to rely heavily on images we used to
like gifts in JPEGs in those days
well I'm speeding up a little bit in the
early days we didn't even use too many
gifts and JPEGs because gif and JPEG I
don't think was a support until mosaic -
I think that browser was any out it was
this text layout so back in those days
to make a website look good you would
just use basic typographic rules and
stir in terms of heading was in
paragraphs and having good sentence
structure
by the way these rules still apply to
today right if you don't have well laid
out texts good alignment it's not gonna
look good despite how fancy your images
are anyway I digress
so what I want to do in this video I
just want to go over the feelings that I
had at that time I remember first thing
because of such a new thing coding so
new and alien to me
that a lot of uncertainty you hit there
you hit the ground and you're starting
to write code even simple HTML code and
of course back in those days you didn't
have the resources that you have today
to make learning this stuff easy so I
had to learn from pure geeks which is
always problematic because geeks don't
know how to teach typically and there
was nobody quite a teaching background
who was really teaching code at that
time so I had to learn from the from
books or the white papers and the docs
and and I put it together you know I put
it together but there's always a lot of
uncertainty when you're learning
anything new especially something that's
so foreign to you that coding was so
foreign to me
but what you got to do in those
situations you just got to remember to
go remember to go remember that things
do take time fortunately for me I had
decent business experience at that time
a few years and lots of martial arts
experience I remember with martial arts
that there were certain movements and
certain techniques certain concepts are
very very difficult for me
understand in grasp at first in fact
some of these concepts took time before
I really understood them and knowing
that I apply that experience to my
coding when I was learning to code for a
first time it was very alien to me and I
just knew that with iterations going
back working on it on a consistent basis
I knew that in a short period of time
things will clear up and I would begin
to understand the broader concepts now
again fortunately because my business
and martial arts background I knew the
key to the whole thing was to get to the
basics understand the basic concepts
well an understanding the framework
around the code that I was writing in
those days was HTML and a bit of
JavaScript so it's a while Jeff school
didn't come until I think 1995 anyway
you did so when you're approaching code
for the first time whether it be a
programming language like JavaScript
Python PHP Java whatnot or whether it be
just a simple markup language like HTML
or styling language like CSS you gotta
have to just be patient with yourself
and give yourself time to learn it
because you're gonna have these
anxieties there's going to be resistant
but the brain is resistant to change
especially as you get older and so how
you make it less resistant is that you
give your brain daily exposure to
whatever it is you want to learn so
whether it be martial arts HTML CSS
JavaScript Python PHP Java C sharp
doesn't matter Swift what you want to do
is you want to explode expose your brain
expose yourself to this stuff on a daily
basis in fact that's how and why I
designed my learning sass by learning
software's to do web by design
understanding that so that the idea is
you come in you do a quick lesson in
five six minutes you answer some quiz
questions that drive it in and then you
may do want one or two others if you
want you may do many if you want or you
just do one or two and you leave and you
come back the next day you do maybe just
one and what happens and then the next
day you do another two they etc okay
what happens is that as you continue to
expose yourself to the coding you're
you're getting your brain used to the
idea hey this stuff we're seeing this
every day we better learn this so
literally what happens is your brain
physically starts changing - to rewire
itself to make itself more capable of
learning how to code and to coding it
literally happens that way so as I said
in a recent video the key to learning
this stuff is frequency of exposure
meaning a little bit every day goes a
long way better to learn ten minutes
every day than to spend one day and
working on it for an hour
so keep that in mind so what happens
once you start learning how to code
what's the next step what's the next
feeling well you start feeling
excitement because you start realizing
that by putting a little bit of effort
you're unlocking this whole world this
whole different way of thinking because
what you'll see as you become more
coding savant more programmer aware if
you will you're going to start seeing
how software is developed you're going
to start understanding a different way
of thinking and it really opens up
different possibilities and this very
structured and logical way of thinking
will improve your problem-solving skills
your organizational skills it will just
give you a different perspective on
things that's what I found personally
and in fact what I learned from martial
arts I applied to coding when I learned
from coding I applied to my business did
I apply to martial arts maybe not so
much it's but there was a lot of things
a lot of lessons a lot of the lessons
and a lot of the way of thinking that I
learned as I learned how to code you
found it really helped me in other
aspects of my life as well so what's
exciting when you first learn how to
code number one as you see that a
different way of looking at things
number two you see you have a very
powerful skill set that you're you you
are developing it's like getting a new
superpower to by putting in your toolbox
that you can leverage in life and
business and Cody
software etc I say number one you need
you know good communication skills
written in verbal you need good
interpersonal skills as well so you know
how to speak to people in a way that
they don't mind speaking to you number
two of course you need good technical
skills good coding skills they sort of
go hand in hand and in fact I was
talking to a business suit teacher who
teaches at college he teaches business
and he's teaches his students what they
should learn at least the basics of the
web stack the basics of coding because
he realizes that modern-day
entrepreneurs have to learn how to code
and I've spoken about this how important
coding is in modern business and anybody
any entrepreneur who knows at least the
basics of coding is gonna have a
tremendous advantage when they go out
there and try to compete with other
people who don't understand the tech
don't hide from the tech it's a small
hurdle to get over it quickly and you
get over it quickly and they know it's
going to open up this huge world and
then you're gonna be pretty excited
because you're gonna see a lot more
opportunities that you wouldn't see
otherwise so think of it this way I'm
gonna use a bad analogy here if you were
blind you couldn't see you can only
perceive the world through you know
you're hearing any other senses but soon
as you open up your eyes also and you
see the word a whole different light and
same thing with coding when you open up
your coding nerd eyes also needing to
start seeing things through a whole
different perspective you're gonna say
you know there's a situation here where
maybe if I write a web app here or maybe
if I write a mobile app here or maybe if
I apply some AI here with Python maybe
we can solve a business problem there
you see I'm going with this but if you
don't understand what you can do with
code in the first place it's gonna be
hard for you to identify these
opportunities out there so even if
you're not the one writing the code just
having that understanding is going to
open up your eyes to a whole bunch of
possibilities so it was for me back in
94 very exciting to see what coding can
do so I wrote my first website and
I started getting traffic on the site
even at an even at that early stages of
the web and as a result of the website
is a direct result I was able to open up
markets in Europe and in Asia Singapore
Hong Kong and other places because the
website gave me a platform to the rest
of the world and that's where it's
really exciting about this technology
where I talked about how coding is gonna
is it's going to give you a lot of
opportunities it's a super tool and this
is just one example even back in those
days when the whole business application
of the web and internet was still quite
young it opened up a few opportunities
for me just a quick and adult quick
story to give you some perspective so
back in those days the challenges were
different that websites were simpler in
terms of what you've got and you had to
do a lot more hacking because the
technology wasn't as mature as it is
today thing you'll learn in business
every technology every business sector
if you will will go through stages of
rapid development and then finally it
will sort of level off where you don't
see too many technological innovations
in the business so back in the early 90s
that's when the web was just starting so
for several years you just saw this huge
a change things are changing so quickly
that's why books that were three years
old or terribly out-of-date this has
changed since I would say about I say
about 2012 the web stack has really
stabilized with html5 and css3 and for
the most part JavaScript it's very
stable and that's just normal in every
industry I don't think you're gonna see
major major changes in the web stack in
the web space in these programming
languages for a while simply because
we've reached a level of productivity
maturity it's kind of like smartphones
right what's the difference between a
smartphone from two years ago or three
years ago versus the latest one today
it's not huge anymore in the early days
it would be leaping balance every year
but these days it's very very like
iPhone 8 vs iPhone 10 iPhone 7 iPhone
iPhone 10 not a big difference same
thing Samsung S 8 vs s7 and it's night
minor incremental improvements at best
same thing with the programming
languages by the way same thing with the
frameworks bright by the way we've
reached the level of plateau anyway
going back to my original story back in
those days we really had to had to hack
things out and now there's all kinds of
Kluge's and it's like like killer sites
calm is the I've been managing that site
running that site twice 1819 years now
but it was originally founded by a guy
who wrote a book called creating killer
websites which was the best-selling book
of his time on web design was actually
the second best-selling book on Amazon I
think in 97 and he got famous because in
that book he taught people how to use
transparent one pixel gif images to be
able to move fonts around and to just
fine finely tuned images now these days
thank thank thank the Lords thank the
nerds we can do this with CSS of course
very easily with padding margins but
with in those days we didn't have any of
those tools so there's always hacks I
just mentioned the one pixel gift so all
that said my claim to fame while wasn't
a claim to fame but I got a lot of
accolades back in those days again was
95 because I had one of the very first
websites that had a photo and I put up a
photo of a fish very colorful fish and
because I could optimize that photo so
it wouldn't doubt it wouldn't take two
hours to download in those days nobody
had a high speed internet it was like it
was very slow I was like the King I was
the king of the I was king of code
because I could put up a nice fish photo
anyway just a little perspective
they were hectic days in the 90s and
early 2000s in terms of how things were
evolving and changing fortunately for
you guys the technology has stabilized
it's much easier now to get things done
a little bit of code takes you a long
way
and the possibilities in terms of
building websites writing code writing
JavaScript writing Python writing PHP
any language not anything most languages
anyway are huge now and I think we have
a lot more to go in terms of the
innovations that can come out and in the
future of logs I'm going to be talking
about that with some people I know who
have companies that are AI based AI and
they're doing some interesting things
three different sectors meaning three
different industries they're all
applying AI one guys playing AI combined
with Ruby rails one guy's applying AI
with PHP laravel the AI is all done with
Python by the way in all three cases and
then the third guy is doing AI with PHP
and I think a custom a custom framework
which is interesting anyway three
different people applying AI all written
in Python the AI is but they work with
other languages and frameworks so one
guys rails Ruby when two other guys are
PHP anyway
Wow long-winded tangent filled vlog I
hope you found it interesting though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
