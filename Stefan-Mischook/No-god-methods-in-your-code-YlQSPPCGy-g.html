God methods God methods assume I assume
for this video that you know a little
bit about programming doesn't matter
what language so you know what a method
is a method is just a function and a God
method is a god-awful long long method I
was about to swear there and I stopped
myself
I got a practice not cursing anyhow so a
god method is a giant method with ten
thousand ifs in it or maybe not ten
thousand maybe four or five or maybe you
got nested if so you got an if statement
and then inside the if statement of
course an if statement the fancy nerd
way of coloring if is to call it a
conditional statement and so we're gonna
use the nerd terms now because we're
nerds so when you have a god method a
god method is a god-awful long long long
long method and inside there you got so
much coal it's so confusing it's it's a
nightmare
now an example of that is you may have
conditionals and if conditionals and
inside your conditionals you may have
two other three other conditionals so
becomes this this big tree four kinds of
branches of conditionals and it's just a
night meter nightmare to figure out what
what what's going on in there and that's
called a God method and it's just it's
just a monster and if you start writing
code and you're writing a method or
writing a function you see it's really
complex where you got multiple nested
ifs and or it's just really big like you
know I don't know hundred lines or two
hundred lines or something or whatever
like that it's time to do some immediate
refactoring and there's a video on my
channel on refactoring what it is and
basically it's a extracting code out of
this huge method this huge function
function is a method a method is a
function right and you extract a code
out of your method and you create
another function another method and you
call you have you
the first method calls a second man you
can watch the video on refactoring so
that's a god method of God method it's
not not a good thing you shouldn't have
it so why am I talking about this
because I'm gonna give you one of my
stories one of my stories so about five
six years ago I decided that I wanted to
experiment with a type of app but I was
too lazy to do any of the coding myself
so I took what I got one of my guys one
of my assistants who was intermediate
level coder at the time and I said okay
this is what I want to do and I'm gonna
have you do the backend and it was just
a prototype so if you know if you know
me you know I love quick and dirty
prototypes the puck the proof-of-concept
app where I don't really care about
rock-solid code I just want the app out
and in the hands of people as soon as
possible so I can see whether or not it
works right so I got this guy who was a
junior and I was exceptionally lazy at
that point in time and it cost me and so
we started designing it and and he would
ask me questions how should I do a
database should I do ideas yeah what
does he or whatever you know the I would
I was just flipping cuz I was working on
other things and and so they built the
app and was working where I spent my
time was working on the UX and UI
because these days when it comes to app
development whether it be mobile apps
for iOS or Android whether it be a web
app you know any type of app really the
key to success in the apps these days
are really in the UX and UI the UX and
you are how usable it is how it looks
how it feels how things are positioned
the challenge is the technical
challenges of the past are no longer you
see back in the 90s a lot of the
challenges as a developer were truly
technical challenges how can we do this
right there that we don't we didn't have
the infrastructure we did not have the
frameworks that we have today like a
classic and silly example iMac is like
the date
of html5 you just go input type tape and
then you got your date picker no problem
well in 90s there was no such thing so
you know I remember a friend of mine he
spent like two three weeks creating a
date picker for an HTML form it sounds
nuts today but that's the way it was
right so we still have we saw always
have these technical challenges today
it's not there the technical challenge
if any is just in designing good
architecture so as your apps are easy to
update and then designing good
architecture so that you can scale
quickly if you need to now that may not
apply if you're developing an app for
iPhone or something for the most part
but nonetheless so these days a problem
that the challenge with apps is it's
having a good a good content or a good
structure and good UX so I didn't pay
attention all that to say is I didn't
pay attention to the backend too much I
said yeah that's right whatever you know
what's this get out see what happens so
we got an album and over time it slowly
it slowly became more and more
successful this app we've had to do a
lot of changes to it of course to
accommodate what the market was telling
us so well how does this all relate back
to God methods well we have a problem
now this many years later one of the key
methods one of the key classes in this
app today utilizes has this huge
god-awful God method huge and it's been
a bane of ours for last two three years
because nobody wants to touch it because
we're very scared for to break anything
and so we've been basically working
around it you know we've been working
around it by using I've talked about
this in other videos we use like
microservices to avoid things so it's
you got this big like having a giant zit
right
you don't want to touch it you don't
know what happened so we've sort of been
working around this thing and it's just
like it's all my fault
because as a manager I should have at
least went in there and said you know
before we you know you know I weekly
just go do a little quick cold review
say whoa whoa whoa whoa that's a god
method there you got to clean that up
now problem is were five years six years
later and I got method is like legacy
stuff so not good so yeah if you find in
your code you got a god Method Foreman
put the brakes on do some refactoring
and break it down and you'll thank
yourself for spending that extra time
doing that trust me you'll thank
yourself for doing that so no God
methods please don't have multiple
nested conditional statements otherwise
known as if statements and I'll stop
right there but that's pretty much it
simplicity underlying theme of all my
videos whether it be your business your
diet your life your code your
relationships trying to keep it simple
ciao now if you write a book one of the
things you're supposed to do is promote
it so I've been negligent on that and
pitches my book on my website and I
mention it once in a while that was the
book I wrote in last year 2015 but
strangely enough the sales are actually
increasing as far as I can tell so
stands done pretty decently I no
complaining so I'm going to shamelessly
pump my book if you're a beginner to web
design you want the big picture you want
to learn html5 css3 a bit of JavaScript
a bit of bootstrap just tiny bit tiny
bit of jQuery no I and you want to learn
how to all fits together and you want to
written up in an easy non nerd language
and have pretty pictures and charts and
all kinds of stuff like that pick up my
book and get it on Amazon you can get it
at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble you can get it in
bookstores in North America and in
Europe and it's getting very good
reviews getting very very good reviews
so if you liked the vlog you just watch
because I'm just gonna stick this
on the vlog it's back end in the vlog
then you're probably gonna like my book</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
