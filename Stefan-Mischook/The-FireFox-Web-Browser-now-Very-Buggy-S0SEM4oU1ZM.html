YouTube and this box that you here to
select upload files public blah blah
blah this stuff here was blank and I
kept refreshing restarting refreshing it
restarted the system I'm on a Mac
research the browser many times force
quit didn't work this just didn't show
up so I started searching around and I
found this
you got to reset your firefox once in a
while firefox fire garbage that's the
new name for it we'll call it fire fire
garbage once a great browser no more it
gets it just gets bugged up so you have
to go in to click on the menu button
which is actually the Help button you
click on the Help button and you're
gonna get this troubleshooting
information page you load that up and
you get a refresh Firefox and this will
basically cause it to flush itself out
refresh it blah blah blah so yeah you
got to do that and once you refresh your
Firefox it will restart itself and then
it's gonna save its old Firefox data on
a desk on your folder on your desktop
just in case you need this stuff and
also today I can upload to YouTube once
again
get off fire garbage anyway just letting
you know just in case you run into the
frustration with Firefox Google Chrome
is a much better browser and I'm not
sure why I still use Firefox on occasion
most of Tommy's Chrome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
