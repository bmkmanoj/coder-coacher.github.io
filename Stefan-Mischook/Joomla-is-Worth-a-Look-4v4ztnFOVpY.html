killer sites calm and killer PHP calm in
this video I want to talk about very
briefly joomla now Juma is a content
management system as similar many
respects to wordpress or drupal i am
just mentioning this and the point of
this blog is to say that it's something
you may want to look at and consider and
i haven't used it so this may be
premature but i've been reading about it
reading a book for review and it's it
looks very interesting me for a couple
of reasons number one it's very robust
it has a lot of capabilities in terms of
a CMS number two you see a lot of
material out there if you go to
bookstores not that many of us by tech
books these days but if you go to a book
store you'll see actually more joomla
books at least I've noticed in it any of
the other major CMS's Drupal WordPress
so that's interesting although i haven't
done to check on non on amazon and
another thing i've been getting calls
from people asking about joomla so there
seems to be a bit of buzz about the CMS
but that's just one reason the other
reason I'm interested in it is because
it's been actually branched off into you
have the CMS which is your content
management system and you also have a
development platform more like a zend
framework or a code igniter symphony etc
of course joomla written in PHP so it's
interesting is that they've sort of
branched this out you have to co
independent projects and
it may be an interesting thing to look
at and for PHP developers because you
know content management systems and
content management based websites are
very popular visa is very very useful
I've been advocating the use of
WordPress for many years as the basis of
just about every website and joomla may
be an alternative or even any
replacement because when you have an
architecture that is designed in a way
that joomla is designed to be a
framework rather than just the CMS that
to me is interesting what's also
interesting is that according to the
book I've been reading the author of the
book was saying that because they're
Java people behind the joomla community
and and the significance of that is a
java people tend to be very
sophisticated so this would indicate to
me that the code architecture in jail
and joomla might be pretty sophisticated
in that mean well so what does that
sophistication means it means that the
cold will be reusable you know we could
code that might make your life a lot
easier as a web designer and web
developer again these are assumptions on
my part based on what i've been reading
but i'm about a fourth of the way
through this book and i just wanted to
mention is right quickly in this video
blog so joomla is something to look at
you may find it will make your web
design work in your web program and
we're far more productive that's it for
now we have a killer sites well that's
it for the jeweler the joomla discussion
a killer sites we have a whole slew of
new videos that are coming out very very
soon basic stuffing is for people listen
to his blog on the new Dreamweaver cs6
on you know new Photoshop cs6 and a
whole bunch of more stuff jquery
projects
and even an SEO course I believe I
believe I Britain doubt I just haven't
sat down to produce it anyhow that's it
i hope you found this video useful
joomla is something that might be worth
looking into bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
