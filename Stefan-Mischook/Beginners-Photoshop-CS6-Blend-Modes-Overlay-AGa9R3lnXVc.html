looking a little bit closer at working
with some blend modes and also taking a
look at some pattern inside of Photoshop
cs6 let's take a look at our logo over
here now we did discuss in the previous
chapter many different ways of creating
the effects that we can see in our layer
styles however sometimes you want to
come in here and actually add something
that's a little bit difficult to achieve
with the layer styles or maybe you just
want a little bit more control over the
way your item looks if you go to killer
sites you for PSD you can see that in
our logo that I've created right up here
there are a number of different elements
that we don't have in the one that we
created in killer sites one let's take a
look first of all there is this
highlight or sheen that we have at the
top of our icon this is something that
will create together in just a second
another element is the little bit of
shadow that we see down at the bottom
right here now this is something that
will reproduce in all the ones up on top
as well as the ones down at the bottom
in these larger icons so if we return
back to kilo sites one remember this is
the file that we've been creating and
working on ourselves if you haven't
saved it already command s or ctrl s on
a PC just to make sure that it is saved
let's select that logo one more time I'm
going to zoom in a little bit closer on
it as well so the first thing I want to
do is to create that little bit of a
highlight effect at the top of this item
now there's many different ways of doing
so but what I'm going to be doing is
just working with a simple little
elliptical marquee tool to create a
selection now all I really want to be
doing is growing a selection from the
top of this area right here so as I
start creating my selection press alt to
make it grow from the center and also
press shift to make it constrain its
proportions now if you don't like it
being so round you can take
drift off and you could just turn it
into something that's a little bit more
oval shaped like the one we have here
don't worry if it's getting larger than
the actual original shape will mask it
out later if we need to can make it as
big or as small as you would like I
think I'll do something along these
lines got a little bit smaller so I'm
going to control Z or command Z to undo
that and I'll just try it again but try
to make it a little bit larger okay now
we've got this position in place what I
want to do is fill it with a gradient
color now the gradient that I'm going to
be using as you can see here if we click
on gradient I want to be using a linear
gradient and I'm going to choose so I
clicked on it to edit the gradient I'm
going to choose to make it white going
too well white again that doesn't seem
to make much sense but what I'm going to
be doing is selecting the top portion
here and setting the opacity 20 so it's
white in the middle and it goes to
opaque now what I'm going to do is to
choose to create that gradient now you
might be wondering why is it giving me
the no symbol that we have right here
and that's because we're going to need
to create a layer upon which we can put
our gradient will name that in a second
so I'll come down here and i'll just
create my gradient so that it goes out
like this now as you can see it didn't
seem to necessarily constrain to my
selection so i'm going to ctrl z undo
that for a minute and we'll try it again
if i come down this way you can see that
i had the gradient reversed and because
it was reversed it sort of created
something that I didn't really want so
I'm going to ctrl z undo that again or
command Z on a mac and I'll uncheck the
reverse and now if I were to come down
here and create something like this
still did the wrong thing so I'm going
to undo that i'm going to start from
this way we start at the bottom and
we'll just move it up like that now i
can also sort of move that around and
do many different things with it I can
also start on the outside and move in
like this or I can move it down this way
and create many many different types of
gradient effects so it's really up to
you to determine exactly how you want to
do that so i just undid that again a
couple of times and even if you want it
to reverse it and try it again like this
or if I undo that and try it again like
this let me undo that maybe I'll just
start it over here and create less of
the effect as we go out so we've got
this little line in place if you press
ctrl D to deselect really all we see is
this highlight of white but notice as
soon as we come in here and we set the
blend mode notice where we're doing that
we select the layer and under normal I'm
going to say something like overlay and
take a look we've got a much lighter
version of that green it still doesn't
give me the hard edge line that I want
it to so I'm going to undo that one more
time let's try it again create another
new layer and this time I'm going to
come in here with a rounded rectangle or
rather just the ellipse so I'll come
right around this point again I'm going
to press alt sort of drag that out this
way now what I want to be doing is
filling this with a gradient so if I
come in here I can choose the gradient
and when we have a gradient like this
one a linear gradient as you can see I
can also do the same thing we did before
I can change this to white I can come in
here and I could change its opacity to
zero so shape layers can have some
really interesting opacity amounts that
we can come in and give it so notice
that it's kind of a hard edge going to
transparency so now that we've got that
in place I'm going to just make sure
just double click make sure if we select
that I have it in the right area and I
think what I'll do is just switch this
around maybe going this way
and I think what we need to do is really
just switch the opacities if I want it
to get something like that happening and
notice there we go I've got this going
in that direction as well so check it
out by creating it in this fashion what
I've done is I've created a much more
harder edge so to this as well if I
double click it and I say shine let's
make the shine layer be in overlay and
that gives us a much brighter version
and still when I click out you can see
that we've got this hard edge right
there so that's a really nice way of
sort of applying white element and when
you're working with white overlays soft
lights will give you very distinctive
and interesting effects so that's a key
common element that we can work with so
overlay and white always works really
well now the last thing I want to be
doing before we go to our next movie is
just making sure that none of this
circular element will show up outside of
our particular icon you can even move it
down if you wish and sort of reposition
it depending on what you need exactly
you can nudge it with your arrow keys if
that helps now if I want to create a
little mass that will hide anything on
the outside all i gotta do is to click
on the logo but first i'm going to press
ctrl on a PC or command on a Mac then if
I click on it it creates an outline of
my shape I'll select the shine layer and
then I'll come down here and just choose
add layer mask so now we've got a very
small and simple mask doesn't really
look like there's anything happening
because when you have white on white the
overlay effect doesn't really show up
but if I were to change this for example
to just normal you can see that the
effect is only inside of the shapes not
on the outside so that's a really nice
way of doing that you can experiment
with things like vivid light but it's
not really what I want overlay white is
great because what it
does is it highlights the color that's
underneath it and that gives us a nice
little green effect right here so come
back in the next movie and I'm going to
show you how we can go about creating a
custom drop shadow and it's one that
will use with some filters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
