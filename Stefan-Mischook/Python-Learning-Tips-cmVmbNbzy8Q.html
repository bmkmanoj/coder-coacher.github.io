you about writing Python code that would
be kind of boring on top of teaching you
how to code I'm going to teach you not
just the help and I teach you the why
but you're going to see in programming
that many times there's many different
ways to do the same thing so you may
have three four five ways to do the same
exact thing and I'm going to show you
not every way because I don't want to
put you to sleep most programmers will
use one or two ways and then move on so
I'm going to teach you not just the code
I'm going to teach you the practical use
of the code I'm going to show you how
Python is use in different areas I'm
going to give you examples of different
things and so you're going to get a much
better feel for how python is used in
the real world versus just learning the
code itself when you're learning to code
let me give you three cold learning tips
I've been programming since 1994 been
teaching clothes since 2003 so I got a
couple I got some experience with this
so here a couple of tips for you
actually three tips number one when
you're going through the video lessons I
strongly suggest that you take notes you
should get a notebook and you should
take notes in that notebook pen and
paper is what I'm talking about so let
me give you an idea with me so here's a
little book yeah a notebook like this I
get this for a dollar and in there you
got papers and you get a pen now you're
saying to yourself why are we taking
notes on pen and paper in a programming
class that makes no sense that actually
it makes a lot of sense because the act
of writing on paper feeling a pen
writing on paper taking notes is going
to speed up the process of learning how
to code through you're not them you take
notes your mind your brain is going to
be able to more quickly remember what it
is you're learning so I strongly suggest
if you want to learn Python more quickly
take notes as you go so you're going to
write
you know powerful Python chapter one the
site notes now what you're going to see
in the course videos little pop-ups like
this one right here and these pop-ups
give you hints from me it's from me to
you about what you might want to take
down as a note now just don't just
follow the pop-ups because sometimes
they'll be too lazy to add pop-ups and
so you should be paying attention if you
see a piece of information that you hear
or see in one of the videos take a note
because it's going to help you to learn
Python tip number two write code as much
as possible writing code is a big part
of learning how to code now you may be
tempted to sit back and watch videos and
if you do the interactive version of
this quote of this course answering your
questions well you'll be you will be
writing code in the interactive
component but you should apart from that
use the code editor which I'm going to
show you how to install in the next
video write the actual code that you see
positive you write code positive read
code you I write code as much as you can
because more code you write more quickly
you're going to learn the stuff so write
code write code write code as quickly as
possible and that will lead me to tip
number three tip number three is that
you're going to make lots of mistakes
writing code is a process that is
error-prone
that means it's full of errors it means
you have to expect to make mistakes
that's why we have windows not one not
two not three we have Windows 10 well
one of the reasons we have Windows 10 is
because there's a lot of errors in
writing code so they come up with new
versions of Windows to fix old problems
another reason to have new versions of
course is because they want to introduce
some features same thing with iOS I
think we're at version 9 or version 10
now now i OS I think it's version 9 and
again new versions is because of new
features and because of bunch Python
itself we're at version 3.5 point two at
this time I'm recording this in late
2016 why do we have a version three why
don't we just have version one again new
features and wanting to fix problems
with previous versions of Python
especially when you see the point so you
got three point five point two when you
have a point to that point two version
that means there were bugs we were
fixing so bring it all back when you are
writing code when you are learning
Python try to not get too frustrated you
may not get something on Monday may only
get it on Tuesday or Wednesday if
there's air Friday
it doesn't matter once you get it you'll
never lose it and do expect to make
errors do expect to make errors that's
normal with coding so don't be a shy I'm
thinking about learning tip number two
of writing code medical records you're
going to make air is no big deal it
happens all the time
we're humans we're not AI so that's it
so those are my three tips I think in
the next video I'm going to show you how
to install Python on Windows and on Mac
and yeah we'll take it from there don't
worry I'm sure there's a lot of
questions in your head right now we're
coming back answering things so we'll be
diving into code coming back out looking
at the big picture coming back into code
pulling back out looking at industry how
python is used it's much more of a
practical course here not just writing
code that's kind of boring alright we're
going to install Python in the next
