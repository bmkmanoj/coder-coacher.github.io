web mentor org here we go just going to
do it my little plug yeah yeah if you
want to learn what development web
design check us out all right the
decline in Apple software both Mac os10
and iOS 8 i recently tried to upgrade to
the latest version of Mac OS 10 and it
just created a disaster for my laptop
and it's not a terribly old laptops
about two years old and still I actually
had to roll back to previous version of
Mac OS unfortunately I was able to do
that because I have a time machine and
time capsule backups so I was able to go
back to the previous operating system to
fix things and even the previous
operating system it's called Darwin even
that over the last year so it crashes
quite often what's quite often maybe
once a month it never used to crash
before Mac OS for many many years was
super solid but as I've been saying for
last couple years Mac OS is slowly
becoming windows unfortunately this
cycle of decline is not uncommon in tech
companies in fact it's happened to apple
before when they got rid of steve jobs
when they kicked them out in the past it
really started to tank in terms of the
quality and i almost went bankrupt now i
don't know if decline began when Steve
Jobs was still alive or it started
because he passed away it's hard to say
but i can tell you i'm not the only one
you're seeing a decline in the quality
and consistency in the software i have
several friends who upgraded to iOS 8
even with the new iphone 6 and they're
seeing all kinds of problems they can't
connect to their apple tvs anymore
they're having network issues etc etc
etc so that's it that's the state of
things with mac and unfortunately what
are you going to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
