Xcode 6 in beta I'm recording this in
jun 2014 so one of the things that makes
the playground app if you will with an
Xcode interesting is that it gives you
an interactive response to your code so
this is some very simple stuff because
I'm just going over this language for
the first time giving that it came out a
couple days ago so I've created here a
constant so this is basically just an
array and it's got a few values and what
i'm doing here is looping through things
and what you want to look at is what's
going on on this panel here is
interactive thingamajigger so for
instance when I said VAR team score
equals zero you see it gives me an
instant response of zero when I declared
this array and show and then it just
shows me to raid it's nothing too
exciting here but let's look at this for
instance so so I have my array which is
as has the values of 75 56 and 45 so I
go if the score and if the score in
scores so basically if I'm saying if the
array has a value that is greater than
10 then we add three to this variable
when I create here team score and you
can see down here team score at we run
through this and at the end you see team
score has a value of nine right because
all three are greater than 10 right so
now if i change it to let's say 50 you
see this values going to see I'd even
have to press ENTER nothing it
interactively responds to my input
another thing that we see here is kind
of interesting it tells us how many
times within this loop how many times
something returns true so what do I mean
by that so you're saying if the score is
greater than 50 then do this otherwise
do that so if it's greater than 50 this
is going to happen right here and of
course
well not of course but so in this case
the playground tells me this actually
happened two times so that's kind of
interesting so let's say greater than 60
and you see what happens is it's an
interesting behavior here it tells me
the value but here it tells me that okay
this else statement happened two times
because you know in this particular
circumstance only one item in our array
was over or greater than 60 so that
means the second Clause the else
statement else statement rather got
fired off two times it's kind of
interesting so you can see in real time
and of course our score of course change
right because since this is the score
was only greater than 60 once this is
three and since the other two were less
than 60 this far and off twice so we
added you know to x 1 + 1 times 3 is 5
so that's the interesting thing about
the swift playground this is part of the
X Xcode 6 is that you get this
interactive component here so you can
see in real time the results of your
code this I believe will come in very
very handy when you actually into some
real coding this of course is an
extremely simple example but you have to
bear with me I'm just jumping into this
language so there you go I hope you
found this interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
