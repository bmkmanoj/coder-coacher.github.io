of coding should you do every day what's
the optimum well from my experience it's
about four yep four now I'm talking
hardcore serious coding I find if you do
more than four a day your productivity
just drops like a stone so my suggestion
to you is that you spend four hours a
day and pure coding where you're deep
into it and then the rest of your time
planning lightweight work answering
emails and light lightweight planning
for the next day maybe long term
planning you know stuff like that this
is a rule actually in terms of not a
rule this is something that we just that
psychologists or psychology or science
has discovered years and years ago I
remember back when I was in university
my major was psychology and I remember
that I remember when I was looking at
optimum study times and I remember is
like three to four hours because they
found that after that the brain just
doesn't have the capacity to in terms of
retention terms of remembering things
and it kind of makes sense i remember
when i got into coding the same thing I
find my optimum coding time was about
four hours a day and you're very
productive you do more than that you
start making mistake - slowdowns no
point to it and in fact in fact I was
talking to a coder friend of mine who's
a CTO of a company that is backed by VCS
a start-up and he was he was reading
article from highly experienced coder
who said the same thing this is this is
something you learn with time so my
recommendation to you is when you are
coding I you know don't try not to do
much more than three four hours a day of
hardcore stuff and the rest do some
light planning and stuff for maybe the
next day or take care of emails or
something that you need to do this is
this will allow your mind enough time to
rest and relax so you can be more
productive again highly productive again
the following day since this was such a
short video I'm going to jump in
something else there's this whole not
this whole
when you're developing an app it's
inevitable that the code gets messed up
and sometimes the code gets so messed up
because you want to make deadlines
you're moving quick you're going to get
the app out which is good which is good
and then you've got a bit of a messy
code base so the inclination at this
point is the trashy old code base and to
rebuild from scratch and it just feels
good now this code base is terrible but
you know what I found over the years I
found that this is never works very well
because you're going to just replacing
one set of bugs with another set of bugs
then people will argue well yeah but you
know the old app is so badly written it
takes ten hours to make any changes yeah
that could be the case so the key to
this is refactoring refactoring is the
process of cleaning up your code so you
start slowly refactoring your code you
start seeing the problem areas you
identify it you start cleaning up those
problem areas one by one one by one so
we recently had an issue with an older
app five years old and we've had to
constantly change its core functionality
based on user response and that's how
app development really works in the real
world nobody ever comes out with the
perfect app upfront and then has to
change nothing there's always major
changes then and so what we did we just
you know built on top refactored so it's
just just cleaning it up cleaning up
we've cleaned up quite a bit there's
still more to do but one of the ways you
clean it up and I talked about this in
another video is you use micro services
you see most apps are just writing to
the database and reading from from the
database and you massage the code or you
massage the input the data rather in
between those processes writing to the
database massage the code polar cold out
massage the code generator chart sound
out on email who knows so what you can
do is you can create micro services to
bypass some really garbage code and then
and then you know just do it that way so
you start calling micro services from
your old crappy app using the unite sign
a new micro service instead and it's
slowly slowly you can retire
replace components of your old applets
crappy with nice shiny micros
microservices this way you you can still
keep what's good about the old app
without having to reintroduce introduce
rather new bugs if you decide to do it
from scratch because I've tried that by
the way I've tried rewriting from
scratch and it's always that it's always
replacing old bugs for you it's just the
way it is yeah might be a little bit
better but you better off take a working
app and just slowly replace components
of your working app you know place
replace something okay it works cool
that's good alright then replace the
next day at school that's alright and
that's how you I would recommend from my
experience you should build your apps
don't rewrite from scratch as this
doesn't work out the way you think it
will all right that's it for today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
