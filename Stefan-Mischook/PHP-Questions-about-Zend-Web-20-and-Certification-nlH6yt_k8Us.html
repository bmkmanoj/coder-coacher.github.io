killer PHP calm and killer sights calm
in this little video I want to answer a
couple questions that are put to me by
somebody with regards to PHP and the
business of PHP and so this is going to
be a new format I used to answer all
these by email but I figure you know
video was kind of fun so we'll see how
it goes so this is a question put to me
by a guy named Darren what are three
questions so first question what is the
best forum to learn just PHP or Zen or
PHP or what so he wants to know whether
or not you should learn PHP and or PHP
Zend or something else so let me just
start by saying that PHP is the
foundation language and Zend Zen PHP the
same framework I think he's referring to
why no he's referring to send framework
is something that sits on top of PHP so
here's PHP and here's a Zen framework
the Zen framework is basically a library
of PHP code that's designed to speed up
the whole process of creating PHP
applications or PHP based programs so do
you need to learn Zen not necessarily is
it useful to learn Zen big-time because
once you understand basic PHP a learning
Zen is going to take your level of
understanding of PHP to a much higher
level and it's going to make writing
more sophisticated programs much much
easier at the same time you're going to
learn the fundamentals and the basics of
advanced software architecture so what
does that mean that means that you're
gonna learn skillsets when you learn to
then that are going to be applicable to
any programming language out there
Zen focuses on
holding structures if you will and
architecture that's applied in Ruby and
the Java world a c-sharp well to a
certain extent well to lesser extent so
point is by learning Zen you're just
going to make yourself a much better
programmer overall so the first thing to
do is you learn your PHP and you can do
that at killer PHP comm once you get the
basics of PHP under your belt then you
can slowly start diving into Zen Zen
it's pretty complex but there's also a
lot of useful libraries they can just
pull out right out of the box and use it
right away so I highly recommend PHP
then move on to Zen if you want to do
more hardcore PHP programming the second
question is is it worth becoming
certified in a language if so what is
the best way to go about it I addressed
this in a previous video so there's
going to be brief about this
certification helps if you're looking to
work for a larger company if you're if
you're looking to be a freelancer from
my experience over last several years
since since the mid 90s nobody asks you
whether or not you're certified that
said certification will also help you
polish your skill sets because they'll
force you to learn things you might not
have always learned and finally when it
go for certification personally I don't
know everybody that's out there but I
probably go with the Zen people Zed e
and d why because they're two people
sort of managed PHP they run PHP they
release a new versions so you get
certified from then you're getting
certified from the source and from what
I hear they got very good learning
materials
next question what does the future of
PHP look like in the web 2.0 world
I think PHP for the foreseeable future
is going to be the server-side
programming language pretty much you
know ColdFusion and Ruby and the dotnet
stuff and the Java stuff that's always
gonna have their place but when it comes
to general web development web 2.0 stuff
I think PHP is gonna be the standard
just because it's it's proven it's
reliable it's powerful it's very capable
and this is not an opinion based on you
know my personal life's are dislikes for
PHP I've written software and eight or
nine languages over the years you know
I'll jump around depending on whatever I
feel is best
for a given project that said the proof
is in you know and what's being used
today if you look out there many of the
major products and projects out there
are all written in PHP that includes a
face book that included YouTube if I
recall that include popular blogs like
WordPress CMS is like Drupal many of the
forms that are out there they're all
written in PHP because of all the
reasons I just mentioned so yes when it
comes to 2.0 PHP is going to be the
language of powers the webpages from
behind the scenes and the final question
is how long does it take for somebody to
become proficient enough in PHP to start
providing services
that depends on were you you know where
you're starting from if you're somebody
who has a better programming ability
from another language another
server-side language like Java or you
know of course you know if you know Java
you won't be asking this question but
you get to it if you have a background
in another language you could probably
get up and running doing PHP within a
couple of days if you're learning PHP
fresh you've never done programming
before you can probably see yourself
starting to offer basic PHP programming
after about 10 to 20 hours of training
you know you know basic stuff you know
there's a lot of stuff out there it's
not hard to learn how to do in PHP
that's one of the beauties of the
language so yeah you can start providing
sellable PHP services very very quickly
for instance shopping carts implementing
shopping carts with PHP is pretty simple
and you don't have to build from scratch
there are open source shopping cart
projects out there meaning free to use
or nearly free to use but you could take
modify you don't need isn't much skill
and modify them as opposed to building
from scratch and implement them use them
in your site's in your clients projects
for instance they I mentioned WordPress
recently you know WordPress is based on
PHP a lot of people will come to you
wanting some blogging type capabilities
or some content management type of
capabilities so what you do is you take
a WordPress or Drupal which are Bofur in
PHP and having that PHP knowledge will
make it easy for you to go in there
makes little changes to it to tweak its
functionality the way it works or the
way it looks is so that you can then
offer this to your clients so yeah PHP
in terms of a marketable skill set it
it comes back to you real quickly in
terms of you know being able to offer
what you sell to to your prospective
clients that's its covers these four
questions I hope you guys find it useful
this is the very first of a new format
that I'm trying out where you get to see
me for better or for worse and I answer
questions that are put to me by there's
people on whether it be PHP web design
etc I hope you liked it
my name is Steph miss Chuck with killer
sites calm and killer PHP calm and I
hope to see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
