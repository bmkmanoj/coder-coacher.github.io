post and it's also going to have an ID
and instead of there being a name with a
VAR char of 300 characters there's going
to be a title of our chart 300 but
there's also going to be a content
column which will be of type text which
means that it can be any length if
you're coming from an oracle world this
is the this is the equivalent of a club
a large character blob basically a place
where you can put as much content as you
want as much text content as you want
and then I'm going to have a category ID
also of type int and we'll talk about
that in just a second because that's how
we're going to build our relationships
so in order for this to be nice and easy
to work with I'm going to create some
drop statements and the drop statement
basically deletes or gets rid of a table
so i'm going to say drop table pose a
category and drop table post so if i
take my drop table category and paste it
in it will if i go show tables i won't
see anything anymore now i'm going to
take all of this all these SQL
statements and i'm just going to paste
them in one by one and if i say show
tables I should have category and post
and if I do a select star from category
I'm going to have my six categories and
everything looks pretty peachy and if I
describe my post it looks also pretty
good so there we have it now let's start
adding some content to our posts and do
some very simple joints so the first
thing I'm going to do is I'm insert into
post this time we are going to specify
that we want the title and a category ID
and the values are going to be I don't
know let's say there's a political
posting and it will have a category ID
of one right because we know that
politics is one up here and just going
to create a couple more of these and
then I'm going to create another one and
this is going to be more politics so
it's also going to have a category of
one and you're going to see what I mean
when I say one too many and then there's
going to be some kind of international
news which will of course be category
two and then we're going to have
something related to technology new
iphone apps could you need any more
iphone apps I don't think so but anyways
uh then we also want to have something
about entertainment I don't know Academy
award-winning movies let's try that for
and let's just put something in about
sports Olympics 2010 and that should be
good we won't put anything in the other
category so at the top I did a drop
table now if I do drop table category
it'll say fine but then if i run it
again then it's going to say error you
know 1051 annum table category so in
order to get around this in order to be
able to easily paste in our SQL script
as we're building it i'm going to add if
exists to this wonderful call so it'll
say drop table if exists category and
drop table if exists post so now when i
select all this and paste it into the
mysql command line and I do a la select
star on post I'm going to have the
various posts notice that the content
right now is null and it's going to stay
null until we start looking at the MySQL
search engine at the end of the series
but you could basically put anything you
want in there so we have the title we
have the content we have the category ID
and then we have select star from
category and we have our six categories
now let's start looking at how we can
join the two pieces of data together and
this is where the one too many thing
becomes a little more interesting so
let's say I wanted to get all of the
politics postings right then I could do
something like I could do a select star
from let's see how we could do this
actually let's just start with just a
simple join so if i wanted to just join
the posts to the categories then it
would be as simple as saying select star
from post p left join category c on p
category ID equals cid now let me just
explain this for a second so the light
select star from post p i think we can I
think you've seen this before basically
what we're doing is we're just saying
select every column from the table post
now this little p here means that I want
to actually start referring to the post
table as just p it's an alias it's a
shortcut so that select star from post p
the left join is what we're going to be
doing where we're basically just taking
one table and then gluing it to another
table and we're going to be left joining
with the category table and it's going
to have a shortcut of c and we're going
to glue the two together using p
category ID which is the post category
ID when the post category ID is equal to
the category ID so it's very important
that the to line up so if i hit enter
then i'm going to get essentially the
join that i was talking about where we
have the political postings and
categoryname and we have international
news and it's got the international
category and we've got the new iPhone
apps and they're in the technology
section and the Academy award-winning
movies and so on and so forth so that's
a just a quick introduction into left
joins we're going to be looking at how
they compare to outer joins and or what
what's called a right join a left join
has also called an inner join in the
next video and then we're going to start
looking at constraints I'm John leben
