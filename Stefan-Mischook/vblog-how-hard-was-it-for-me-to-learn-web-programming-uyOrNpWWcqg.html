killer sights calm
don't try a new video I know justice
spice it up a little in this big blog
I'm gonna ask a question those recently
put to me through email and basically
the question is or was was it difficult
for you to grasp programming concepts
when you first started to learn how to
program one and to build websites and or
they'll just click fairly easily
short answer it was actually pretty
difficult for me at first I came from a
background of graphic design that
marketing I was bored design centric and
also management so when I first started
to learn how to program and build sites
in the early 90s mid-90s it was very
difficult for me so oftentimes have to
keep redoing and redoing and redoing it
and that's one of the reasons why I
decided to build start building
tutorials to write tutorials on web
design web programming because I saw
long the holes in the way that it was
taught in all the books the videos I had
seen at that time and I still see to
today where you know you know those two
have a subject of a video or a book were
to introduce software development
programming for instance and they'll say
you know this is a variable this is how
you create a variable in JavaScript and
you can do this in this in this to a
variable and so on but they never
explain what a variable really is and
why you create a variable what's the
whole point of creating a variable for
me it was important for me to understand
why we did certain things as opposed to
you just do this and I believe that
understanding that why whether it be
variable creation or whether it be
structuring a cold properly or site etc
I believe understanding the why
make you a much better web designer and
web programmer down the road so that's
why I concentrate on that a lot
what's the basics and that's why I do a
person with a lot of the basics videos
because they're hardest teach and then
because of time I have other people do
some other stuff as well so a more
advanced stuff and because once you have
somebody who has a base of knowledge
it's much easier to teach them anything
whether it be programming design or
blocks it and there you go so I hope
that answers the question if you're
having a bit of a frustrating time
learning this stuff don't worry about it
as part of the process for many of us
and it's actually a good thing because
when you find yourself challenged by
something mentally or physically that
means you're introducing something new
to yourself new to your body new to your
mind which in the end will strengthen
your but your mind is strengthen your
body and will make you much more capable
later on so yeah if you're hitting
resistance that's like finding a diamond
in the sand it's like finding some spots
you can work on and that's cool so it's
always an issue for me when if
everything is coming easy and it's kind
of fun in a way but you also know in the
back of your of your mind you're not
actually progressing anywhere so it's
always good to hit some challenges
because you know you're proving that
you're improving on things anyway I said
I hope you found the video useful there
should be more video blogs coming out on
a regular basis because I have more free
time ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
