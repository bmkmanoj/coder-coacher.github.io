take a step back from writing actual
JavaScript code and we're gonna do just
a little bit of theory don't worry we're
not going to get into some micro nerd
details that's gonna put everybody to
sleep here but I want to cover some
basic things that I think will help you
as you explore further into JavaScript
two points I want to cover again I'm not
gonna take too long here just enough to
get us forward so let's let's just jump
into it and yeah the pain will be over
soon so number one what it is a
programming language that's the question
and of course some of you may be
thinking to yourself well this is pretty
obvious we know what a programming
language is hmm maybe but let's just
jump into it so number one it is a
written language it uses normal Western
characters like you see in English or
French but it has special keywords that
have a special meaning in the language
so for example in our last video we
learned about the alert function
you know remember those pop-up alert
boxes that's just one example of a
keyword built into JavaScript that has a
special meaning and gives us a special
functionality in fact the word function
is a keyword in JavaScript as well there
are several of them and as we explore
JavaScript we're going to look more
closely at some of these special
keywords
in a nutshell a programming language
provides a way to send commands or in
other words instructions to computer a
programming language is actually created
by programmers this is an important
distinction about JavaScript for
instance is one it's just one example of
a programming language that was written
created by programmers and there's a
reason I mentioned that that's in the
next point there are many different
programming languages because each one
has its own speciality so that's a
question that I'm sure some of you are
beginners to programming you're asking
yourself why do you have something
programming languages why do you have
JavaScript why do you have a c-sharp why
do you have ColdFusion etc etc etc and
the reason is because each language has
its own thing that it does really well
JavaScript for example was designed to
allow web designers to control web
browsers
here's an important point the key of
this particular video so put on your
thinking caps in there and pay attention
to at least this part here if anything
the written language in this case
JavaScript is actually processed or read
by the JavaScript engine or in other
words the JavaScript interpreter so you
can see JavaScript as being both a human
readable written language as well as
being an engine software or software
that processes of the language and
execute the code so the JavaScript
engine piece of software is actually
installed into all modern web browsers
so I hope that little part sinks in you
can think of the JavaScript engine as
being a separate program that's
installed inside a web browser that
lives in the web browser and the
JavaScript language is the written
language that has special commands and
keywords but allows us to tell the
engine how to manipulate the web browser
one last point quick point JavaScript
and Java are not the same programming
language and they in fact serve totally
different purposes I mentioned that
because a lot of people think that
they're the same thing so JavaScript and
Java are not the same language
javascript is the programming language
for the web browser and Java is a what
they call an enterprise level language
used basically for creating database
driven websites this is all server stuff
so anyway if you don't know about
database driven websites go to killer
PHP com you learn all about it there
and the final point I want to cover this
is an interesting one
why aren't CSS and HTML programming
languages in a nutshell because you
cannot make decisions and change things
on the fly with CSS or HTML javascript
allows you to add control bolt behavior
to a webpage that's the key point it
allows you to add controllable behavior
to a webpage so for instance you could
use JavaScript to check what time of day
it is and to change the web browsers
background color there's a web page
background color on the flock or you can
have JavaScript time how much time
person's been on the page and then have
something appear these are things you
cannot do with CSS and HTML so the
subtle difference between a markup
language or a written written language
like CSS or HTML there are not
programming languages simply because
they do not provide the ability to add
behavior to a web page
so that's it for the near theory in this
video I promised it would be short and
learn about six minutes is pretty short
in the next video we're gonna jump back
into some more JavaScript code just keep
in mind what we've covered here as we're
working along and you're gonna see how
understanding the fact that you have an
engine running back there will make
learning JavaScript just a little bit
easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
