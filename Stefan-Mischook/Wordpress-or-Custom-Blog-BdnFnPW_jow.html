killer sites calm and other sites so
should you use WordPress or should you
create your own custom blog engine from
scratch well if you're not a programmer
then you're going to be using WordPress
or some other CMS / blog engine there's
WordPress or Joomla or Drupal but if
your developer then it might be a good
idea to create your own custom engine if
you have simple needs if you're just
putting up a simple blog like here on
Studio web we have a simple blog it's
just custom and because we're just
putting a post and that's pretty much it
but on the other hand if you want to
take advantage of advanced naming
advanced plugins like plugging ecommerce
capabilities or pulling and all kinds of
gadgets and doodads then WordPress is
definitely an option to consider the
only downside with using wordpress or
any other CMS product CMS ashore for
content management system there's
competitors WordPress is number one then
you got droop out dr you PA el and
joomla a.m la the downside with using
these tools especially wordpress is that
they are target's for hackers and
especially wordpress can get hacked and
now i'm recording this in 2015 and we
were actually hack via wordpress i think
it was 2013 maybe to 12 we got hacked
and it caused us a lot of headaches so
that's something you have to be
concerned about and because of our last
hack I started developing I said to
myself that you know we're going to
start yeah we're developers here so we
create our own blog engine and it's much
simpler in WordPress but to create a
simple engine we're posting and creates
post and you can add images and ice gets
not that difficult if you know what
you're doing so we decided to create our
own because that's all we really need to
do and when you create your own blog
engine is much less hackable simply
because it's your own
structure hackers are not aware of it
they don't understand it so it's much
more difficult to hacked the problem
we're press is because it's open source
that means that anybody can look at the
source code and they can look through it
and they can find any holes in it so
it's much easier to hack and because
WordPress is so popular I believe
something like twenty twenty four
percent of websites in the entire world
run on wordpress it's a juicy target for
hackers so that's the downside of using
it of course now in 2015 WordPress has
auto update which you can turn on and
with auto update turned on the chances
of you being hacked are much much much
less so again as I learned from a
security firm that handles security for
servers and so and they said the biggest
problems people don't keep their word
press up to date or other types of CMS
tools or any tools that's if you keep
you don't keep them up to date I mean
you're opening yourself up for hacks
because manufacturers of WordPress and
so on they keep they keep up to date you
know with the with any hacks are aware
of them and they may apply patches so if
you got the auto-update done set up on
wordpress well set up you just got to
click a button really then you you
should be safe although if you want to
be ultra say for instance on studio web
com which is our site and our system
that schools use to help teach kids
development we we have our own blog
because we want to make sure that the
site is totally safe there you go that's
