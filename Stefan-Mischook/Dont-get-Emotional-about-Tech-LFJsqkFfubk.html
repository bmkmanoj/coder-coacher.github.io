one still sick just got back from my
trip from California I spoke about this
before and I figure it was do an update
essentially headlight is don't get
emotional about technology whether it be
a programming language whether it be a
type of computer Mac or Windows Android
or iOS whatever try not to become
emotionally attached to these things
like a plumber getting emotionally
attached to a reg sounds ridiculous like
being emotionally attached to what
platform you use Windows or Mac or Linux
is kind of silly as well everybody has
got their precious or personal
preferences or business or personal use
case for you for what you do the Mac may
be better for what you do windows may be
better for what you do when X may be
better
there is nothing in my experience which
is typically universally better than the
other there's always compromises when it
comes to technologies and that some
areas of Technology be strong in some
areas and technology will be weak so i
would suggest as a professional as a
business owner small business owner
aspiring this especially if you're in
business freelance are starting on
startup whatnot you have to work hard to
be very objective unemotional about the
choices that you make don't just buy iOS
because you don't like Android or you
think android sucks the vice versa you
have to try to look at these things and
be willing to jump from one platform to
the next depending on the circumstances
ok some point I have built apps
commercial apps in eight or nine
languages that you get how many now
exactly over the years and what I would
do in the last few years of my
professional career as a freelancer I
will come into the client and I would
look at what the job was and then I
would choose the appropriate language or
framework depending on the job that
needed to be done so even though at that
time especially in the last four few
months three four years I was my
favorite language was Java big time but
i would do projects in PHP I've done
projects in c-sharp I've done projects
and crazy or known languages like lingo
yeah the area but because I thought that
these other languages were better they
were better for the job so again try not
to get married to a tech if you find
yourself getting emotional about
technology I would suggest you circle
will take it easy these are just tools
because my areas let your wife or your
husband here it's
kids it's just tools try to relax so you
can be objective about your choices so
you can make proper business decisions
proper professional decisions in terms
of the technology that you use at the
moment in time alright that's about it
