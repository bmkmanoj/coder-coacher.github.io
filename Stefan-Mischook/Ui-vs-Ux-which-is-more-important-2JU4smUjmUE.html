talk about the difference between UI
user interface versus ux user experience
UI is just the visual appearance of an
app or site the clout the colors that
you choose the aesthetics of it how good
it looks how peeling it is UX is short
for user experience and it's about how
the user interface functions and how
easy it is to use hence experience user
experience you know so we look at things
like buttons what happens when you click
on a button or how the menus are
positioned and how the menus will react
to users when the user for instance
Mouse's over a particular menu item does
it pop open does it pop down as a pop-up
does it hold when you hold your mouse
over it etc etc etc now user experience
is by far more important than user
interface so UX is much more important
than you I because UI user interface
design again it's just about the
aesthetics the look of it and for many
many many apps out there UI is really
not very important at all so think of
sites like Google it isn't exactly the
most exciting user interface it's very
plain Jane look at things like reddit
again very very plain it's it's almost a
throwback to the 1990s web in terms of
its user interface look at craigslist
another hugely successful site again
these are sites that proved that the UI
the user interface in terms of its
aesthetics and visual appeal are not
terribly important because all these
hugely successful sites are not visually
compelling now it can only help if you
have something that looks kind of good
but then again you look at a site like
dig which was something that was
the big at one point and they just lost
that they went very corporate looking in
her layout and who cares about dig
everybody is on reddit now so even
though dig has a much more visually
appealing a much better UI in terms of
its its aesthetics much more polished
looking then reddit reddit is still by
far much much more popular much more
successful now it's read it more popular
because it has better use UX user
experience that's a debate it could be a
content and the combination of UX hard
to say so what's ux again to reiterate
UX is the user experience it has to do
about where you place things on the
screen not necessarily how they look but
where and how they react when when users
interact with your user interface
components so where you put your menus
where you put your buttons where you put
your links how the buttons react when
people click on them how links react
when you people click on them and this
applies to both web apps and mobile apps
as well and let me just say you x is far
more important in terms of an app's
success than you I no question I just
gave you a few examples reddit google
craigslist hugely successful hardly any
UI really to speak out it's just very
plain but the UX and the users thus thus
the usability of the site is extremely
extremely high level it's very very
capable so there you go that is the
difference when I look at any apps
myself I pay very very very close
attention to UX personally you I I kind
of art direct UI and I sort of give a
basic idea of what I'm looking for but
when it comes to you x I'm right in
there big time because I really feel
well actually
know how important it is in 2016-17 and
going forward the challenge for
developers is is UX the challenges UX I
was talking to a friend of mine works
for a huge corporation and they see that
to every developer can now develop an
app that does X Y or Z you know the
technical challenges are not very many
when it comes to developing apps because
software development environments the
language is the frameworks that we see
out there are so sophisticated now and
refined that you can get a lot done with
very little code and there's no
technical hurdles back in the 90s
there's a lot of technical hurdles not
anymore so the differentiator between a
successful app and a non successful app
comes down to UX it comes down to
functionality what it actually does and
how easily it does it so UX is a big
part of that of course so there you go
to conclude I you should know that in
the software space there is the rise now
of UX experts that's what they do their
job is to make apps and sites very very
very usable it's a it's a science it's
also an art and that's a profession that
you might want to get into it if you're
interested in working for large
corporations because they're looking for
experience UX people people who can make
apps easy to use because again that's
what separates the successful apps
that's one of the main elements that
separates a successful successful apps
from the hustle successful apps I hope
