video store calm and killer PHP calm in
this quick little video blog I want to
comment on something I recently read in
a local publication put out by the
Canadian universities and I'm just going
to put the camera on to the magazine now
there it is it's a career options I
believe it's published by Canadian
universities and you know so it's by the
university's targeting University
students now here's the interesting
piece I want you to read this headline
about 75% of Canadian students are
enrolled in programs and schools that
only about ten percent of employers will
consider hiring from now this is like
one of the worst sentences I've ever
read but essentially when kids are
enrolled in 75% of the programs they
have a very small chance a ten percent
chance at best of getting a job now this
is a very interesting piece of data if
you think about it you know this applies
to the US or I would imagine Europe as
well in various parts of world so
remember this is a university
publication so this is not exactly you
know this is from the horse's mouth if
you will think about that seventy-five
percent of students are in programs that
are you know essentially worthless you
got a ten percent chance of finding a
job if any and I think those are
optimistic numbers and again this this
applies to North America Europe as law
I'm very very certain of that the larger
point is is that before you get yourself
into the student loan debt and so on you
really want to consider your chances of
securing work and way other options Tech
is pretty good Texas you know there's a
future in that and your chances
the chances of securing work are much
better in the tech world than it would
be otherwise but you still want to you
know consider your cost of a technical
diploma and degree versus its value and
I've discussed this another video so I'm
not going to repeat that but i just want
to show that an actual magazine
published by the university's they're
confirming what I've been talking about
for a while so if you're somebody who's
thinking about getting into web
programming or web design or you may be
thinking of going to a business
administration or psychology or one of
these things you know don't think about
that you know you don't want to get into
these things like seiken and I was a
psych major university so I nom nom yeah
I'm speaking from experience you don't
want to find yourself and these uses to
Greece and have a mountain student loan
debt you know personally you know I
didn't I quit psychology well for two
reasons number one because my business
started taking it off i had
import/export business at the time and
secondly is because you know i got a gig
working in a cinema while as a psych
major and i found that i met the the
popcorn chicks behind the counter and
turned out at all three of the popcorn
chicks all had masters degrees in
psychology not the time was that i was
undergraduate and i said to myself well
you know I could pop popcorn now I don't
need no psych degree to pop popcorn and
that was the end of my my you know my
university career in psychology and
they'll get me wrong there's a lot to be
gained in terms of the knowledge even
many of these programs but they have no
application in terms of getting a job
they're not going to help you there and
you can learn this stuff on your own i
talked about kindle college if you want
to learn site philosophy history art
history business administration all this
because just by kindle and buy books on
the subject and you're going to learn a
lot more quickly because you're not
going to get a job with it so forget it
that's about it I know quick little bee
blog I haven't been putting out too much
content on on YouTube lately because
we've been working on a project but I
think it's kind of cool and once that
project is up and running then you'll
see a lot more content hitting YouTube
that's it so much more to come take care
and we'll talk to you about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
