through the process of installing lamp
on your Windows machine
I've already
the wamp 1.64 installer it's simply an
exe and installing program like you
would see any other program so let's
double-click and start installing
the standard setup screen i accept the
terms next I'm installed the wamp files
in the sea wamp folder so it's just easy
to access hit next it's asking me here
whether or not I want to install the web
in this holder anyway I'll just say yes
set up automatically watchful eye upon
know this option here essentially ask
you whenever you start up your computer
whether or not you want to start the
wamp server when your computer starts up
I'm going to leave it off because I
don't necessarily do PHP programming
every time i said i turn on my computer
and the reason I'm leaving it off is
because it will take up resources memory
and so forth when it's running so
there's no point in doing that unless
you have to I'll show you how to
manually start the web server once we
have it installed anyway so I'm just
going to hit next at this point in the
install the program is basically asking
us where do we want to put our lamp root
folder or rent our web document one
folder essentially this is the folder
where we would be placing our PHP files
in my case since i installed it in the c
drive c and we started c lamp and you
notice that the WWF older here is
highlighted i'm going to say go with
that default that's the default
directory that the install all be your
PHP files essentially this WWF older is
the equivalent of the public HTML folder
that you would see on a live unix server
or on is it would be the equivalent of
the inet pub folder so i'm going to
leave it here to ww hit ok would you
like to use firefox is default browser
for lamp 5 i'm going to go yes because i
find firefox would be an excellent
browser for developing websites whether
it be static web pages HTML CSS and PHP
because it comes with a lot of built-in
tools that make web development a lot
easier all right the setup wizard has
completed as its set up and we're going
to click finish it's asking us whether
or not we want to launch ramp 5 now i'm
going to go yes and
well we're going to look at the web 5
server tools it allows you to easily
manage your PHP and you mysql in your
apache installation those are the three
programs that wamp installs really
automatically it really makes a life a
lot easier I'm going to click finish
okay at this point the web server has
been successfully installed on our
windows machines I'm just going to move
the installer program out of the way
here and what we're going to do now is
we're going to navigate to the sea lamp
directory or folder in Windows and here
we are you're going to see that wamp has
installed the installers installed all
these files now these are all necessary
for glam to do with stuff the thing we
were concerned about now is the ww
folder here on WWF older so we open that
up and we're going to see if there's
three files our index dot PHP a couple
images so we're going to load up the
index.php by navigating to localhost as
we discussed in the previous video or
1270 dot 0 dot 1 and we're going to see
what index dot PHP actually looks like
I've launched Firefox and they've opened
up a new tab here and we're going to
type in the localhost URL which is the
127 001 of course I could have just
written localhost and what it does the
same thing so I'm going to leave it like
this for now because it's done easier
hit go and in any second we should see
the default lamp PHP index page against
atropine with this page tells us is what
version lamp or running what version of
patchy we have which PHP version 5.1
point for the PHP extensions that are
loaded with that now PHP extensions are
basically add-on modules to PHP that
gives PHP extra capabilities for
instance here we have a PHP module
extension rather that allows PHP to work
with XML easily and you have xml and
xmlreader and there's a few other things
as well in here we'll get into some of
these things within the video itself I
can tell you right now that MySQL hasn't
been launched and we're going to launch
that in the next video because i'm going
to show you the toolbar web five MOS
scuze me i'm going to show you the web
five toolbar that makes it easy to start
and stop mysql and apache web server and
it comes in a couple tools PHP my TM PHP
info which we looked at our previous
videos basically it gives us detailed
information about our installation of
PHP PHP my admin which is the web tool
that allows you to interact with mysql
we'll be using that a lot and yes that
pretty much covers what we need to see
here
in the next part 2 lamp install video
we're going to look at the web toolbar
which allows us to easily start and stop
the services and so on
