for now well we'll revisit that in a
minute this one is going to be called
it's going to be a public function and
it's going to be called call and call
takes in a name and it takes a
collection of arguments
happens is call runs whenever a function
can't be found in a particular class so
let's say I delete get address here if I
go back to killer PHP here and I echo or
I refresh you'll notice nothing happens
if I comment out this call function
you'll see that I get called to
undefined method blah blah blah blah
blah get address it can't find it but
with this call function we don't get any
errors anymore if I actually echo this
then I can say has been called and if i
refresh this again you'll see that call
has been called as echoed instead of you
know whatever the address is so using
this approach we can dynamically create
methods in our class so in this case I
want to make sure that whenever I do
something that starts with a get it
immediately gets called or it actually
returns the value of a variable so we're
gonna write a little bit of code here
I'm gonna create I'm gonna basically I
need to give the method prefix which in
this case is a substring for the name
and we're gonna go from 0 to 3 so if I
just do an echo of the method prefix we
can see that the bet that prefixes get
if I go to echo get address and I put
you know XYZ address then I'm gonna get
XYZ so basically it's just getting the
first three characters in the name of
the method the next thing I want to do
is I want to get the rest of the method
the the property that it's accessing
because there's there's quite an obvious
repetition here we could have get
address actually before we move further
I'm just going to create
first name actually yeah let's do first
name last name protected email so now we
have all these properties you could
imagine that if we had getters and
setters for all of this we would have
instead of a you know ten or twenty line
class we would probably have a fifty or
sixty or seventy line class so things
would start growing rather quickly
and now I'm also gonna grab the method
property now the method property is in
this case it would be address but it
could also be first name or last name or
email a property is another way of
saying it's a variable sitting inside of
a class or an instance of a class so the
property here is address and right now
we're gonna be getting the property
dynamically so I'm gonna say method
property equals and I'm going to start
by getting everything after the name and
the fourth character so if I echo method
property
I'll get dress which is very interesting
actually we want the third character so
that we get address which is great
except that we want this a to be a lower
case address right we're following a
very strict naming convention here it's
called I think it's called camel case or
Hungarian notation or something anyways
it doesn't matter basically the first
character is lower case and then if we
want to have subsequent names or nouns
inside of our variable name then they're
also upper case so in order to do this
properly instead of getting the third
character I'm going to get the fourth
character and I'm going to grab the
third character and I'm going to lower
case it by doing STR to lower and then
I'll just concatenate the two so now I
should get address lower case so we're
almost there
the next step instead of echoing the
method property is to actually just
return it so I could just say return
this method property and I'll get Eiffel
Tower so you see instead of actually
going in here and saying you know return
this address I can actually pass in a
variable and it'll do exactly the same
thing which is really cool so let's see
if we can create something a little more
generic for handling all of these cases
I'm gonna have we want to return the
method property in the instance where
something begins with debt but we also
want to have our setters to work
dynamically as well so I'm gonna get rid
of set address here and let's see if we
can make that dynamic as well to do that
I'm going to start with a switch
statement and the switch statement is
exactly like else if or else and if
except that you're just declaring it a
little differently so you'll see that
you'll see what this looks like in a
second so a switch statement basically
allows you to create different cases
based on a particular variable so if
method prefix equals get then we'll do
stuff where method prefix equals get and
then we'll break and then if the case is
set then we'll do something where the
method prefix equals set and then the
default case in other words it's
anything but get or set we're actually
going to throw an exception and throwing
an exception is a way of basically
telling the you know the programmer or
the user or basically your your
application that you know something
didn't go right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
