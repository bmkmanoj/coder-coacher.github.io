this video I'm gonna talk about becoming
an entrepreneur so first of all Cheers
now I was always supposed to use that
cup for my Python video but I liked it
so much it's just it's such a great cup
anyway people have been following my
channel know i've been coding for about
22 years since 94 95 but I've been an
entrepreneur for a few years longer so
I'm in my 40s so I've been an
entrepreneur since I've been 18 you can
do two math 26 27 28 years something
like that when you get old like me
you'll forget the years go by like
Dave's right and you start forgetting
things and the reason the years ago
anyway I'll get into the tips so I'm
going to talk about becoming an
entrepreneur how to do it what you can
expect now this I could go on for many
videos and write two books on it so what
I'm going to do in this video is just
give you a quick introduction a quick
taste so you have an understanding of
what it's all about though I'm a nerd
who has tons of computers I still love
3/4 I still write notes I love writing
notes on paper because when you write
notes on paper it helps you to remember
things and it's just a lot easier for me
in many respects although I do have a I
do have a surface pro 4 which is an
amazing tablet and you can take notes on
that as well
but if I drop my my notebook I don't
break it
so I kind of like that alright let's get
to the point so yeah so according to my
calculations I've been talking to
entrepreneur for talk for 28 years
believe it or not and after took me
several years it took me a decade where
I got to the point where I went into
will just say semi-retirement we'll
leave it at that I don't like to talk
about incomes and wealth and all this
kind of stuff because it's just bad
policy in general so when you start
making money and good money be quiet
because
is no advantage for you to tell people
even your friends especially your
friends and family so that's your first
lesson number two I started with $200 to
my name
I didn't put $200 in the business I had
$200 to my name and an old mattress I
started when I was 18 and I got no money
for my parents and I got no contacts
from my parents and I was living on my
own when I was 17 or 18 and I was
supporting myself as a bouncer in a
nightclub and I worked three dates up
three nights a week and that's all I was
earning as I was going to school so at
one point I had to make a decision
between becoming an entrepreneur or
accelerating my entrepreneurial my
little business rather versus continuing
in university when I was like 19 or 20
but anyway but I started when I was
about 18 I was 80s are my very first
business
it was import/export business I had
nothing to do with technology and this
is a good thing because if you're just
in one type of business then you may
have one point of view but have you done
several different types of businesses
I've done a few it gives you perspective
and then you start to identify those
universal principles or those
universalities across all types of
businesses so that's an important thing
so let's get into some realities about
entrepreneur oh let me say that again
let's get into some realities about
being an entrepreneur so first of all
expect to work much longer hours don't
become an entrepreneur because you think
it's gonna be simple and easy you're
gonna work less hours when you become
successful later on for sure but
initially until you get the thing going
it's gonna take a lot more work so do
something you find interesting because
if you don't find it fun it's going to
be like pulling teeth the whole time
through I don't know as an entrepreneur
you're gonna have to learn how to become
very good at money management knowing
when not to spend money in fact you
shouldn't spend money unless you
absolutely after it without is a formula
for this I've come up with but I won't
give it to you in here because that's
what I give you a quick run-through in
this video on eve of New Year's Eve and
- to 2017 you're going to be happy
you're gonna have to be a self-starter
entrepreneurs have to be somewhat
discipline and B and that you have to
become a self-starter you have to push
yourself sometimes to do work now
when you become an entrepreneur try to
choose some business or some business
model some business way of working that
goes with your personality so that it's
not like work for you it's something
that you enjoy to do it's like for me
doing these YouTube videos it's not
really my business as you know this is a
hobby at this time I'm not monetizing
and I haven't monetized for years since
this the YouTube channels been up and I
might start doing it you know soon to
maybe help pay for some computers and
stuff I don't know but I don't monetize
in YouTube but I still do two YouTube
videos because it's something I enjoy to
do in doing and as I did a previous
video about why do my YouTube videos one
of the reasons it allows me to practice
and my ability to deliver it's taken me
years to become comfortable in front of
the camera I was so self-conscious I was
terrible not that I'm great now but you
get the idea so you have to enjoy what
you're doing it has to be you have to be
motivated and not you know it should be
a question of force of will to have to
get your work done for your business it
has to be some of your motivated to do
it's something you rather do than I
don't know hang out with your buddies
and having a beer in fact right now I'm
doing this video where I'm on New Year's
Eve they have friends right you know
they're at late early dinner parties now
or late lunch is lunch parties and I've
said that I read a state home as an
entrepreneur you're gonna learn you're
gonna have to learn to be consistent in
that a lot of what you do especially in
the beginning you won't see immediate
results not like when you go work for
somebody you were
you work you get your two weeks you get
your pay a lot of times arch proneural
activity require years if months and
months if not years before you actually
start seeing the payoff and that's
important Studio web it didn't get it
first school until after a year over a
year and it's been very slow because the
whole education business is a slow
business and also I held back that
business because I wanted to make sure
the studio web app and the courses were
we're good for schools because when
you're teaching in schools the whole
different thing than teaching just
standard videos for adults and it's
another story so you have to be
consistent where you don't necessarily
expect a payoff immediately brings me to
my next point you have to be patient
patience is a virtue in life but it's
especially so in business there's
something called deferment of
gratification now in psychology they've
learned a long time ago I study
psychology and university that was my
major if you wanted to measure who will
be more successful in life they did what
all these kids they found what the kids
were able to defer gratification meaning
who who didn't need a payoff right away
they ended up there was a study where
like 30 years or 40 years as I mean they
they ended up finding the kids who are
able to defer gratification they were in
the end far more successful and that's a
big part about being entrepreneurs being
able to think of the medium term and the
long term to not absolutely need that
payoff or gratification right away
that's key you don't have that you
moisés become an employee there's
nothing wrong with being employees a
different lifestyle but I'm just letting
you know as an entrepreneur a lot of the
process is a process of trial and error
so you're going to have to learn to
accept that you are wrong and you will
be wrong often especially in the
beginning you have to take that ego you
have and you have to have a certain
amount of ego to want to even step into
the breach to become an entrepreneur
to get in the ring which I respect I
respect people who try to be
entrepreneurs and fail so much because
at least they had the guts to try right
even if they fail that's fine
that's great you had the guts to try so
as an entrepreneur you have to accept
that you will have failures many of them
you also have to accept that your
initial opinions and ideas can be wrong
and many will be that's a very important
thing your goal should not be to prove
yourself right your goal should be to
get the job done your goal should be to
accomplish your goals
that's all and your goal should be set
up a series of tasks and things you need
to do that will eventually get you to
where you want to be an annus I suppose
financial success but in the end it's
not the financial success well I'm gonna
live money is good but there's much more
to it in terms of personal gratification
in an entrepreneurial lifestyle much
more than the money and that is the
knowledge that you've built a system you
built a mechanism the business that does
something and helps people and gives
back the best businesses are the
businesses where everybody concerned in
the transaction you as defender or
product or service provider and the
client and everybody else involved
benefit from this transaction that's the
great thing because first of all it
makes you feel good as a human being and
second of all you see that it leads to
long term business opportunities and
relationships and that's how you build
you build based on goodwill goodwill
that you create by being an honest
person by delivering value to your
clients that's a huge part of it so
summarise to be an entrepreneur is a
difficult path especially in the
beginning but in the end is far more
rewarding because you're able to express
your personality or able to express your
will and this is a line from the
original Star Trek series from the 70s
not from the 60s in fact that I used to
watch them as a kid in reruns of lava
and it was a line from his character
named Kai and it was stolen from a book
Dante's Inferno so I never read the
original book but I got the line from
Star Trek that proves I'm a nerd right
and the line is one of the character
says he quotes Dante's Inferno says but
better to rule in Hell than serve in
heaven and this was a reference to you
know when when Satan gets thrown down
into the abyss and to hell he screams
back at God better to rule in Hell than
serve in heaven and now I'm not trying
to be religious here but I'm making a
point that at times being entrepreneur
can be pretty stressful and tasking you
don't know when you're gonna get paid
you're trying to come up with ideas and
you're always putting out fires it's
kind of hellish for a lot of people but
if you can learn to embrace it like a
good fight when I use the boxes to love
getting in there it's you can get to you
you can get your nose broken stuff but
it's actually a lot of fun once you get
into it so entrepreneurial lifestyle can
be like that where you know you're the
ruler but sometimes you're ruling over
hell and but then it sounds pretty good
after a while so just understand I'm not
trying to dissuade you I'm trying to
give you just a reality check about what
it's all about I encourage you to do it
because even if you fail specially if
you're younger
so should for you in your 20s or early
thirties and you don't have any kids you
got no responsibilities this is the time
to do it
not when you're 50 60 70 when you got
kids and stuff not that I'm saying don't
do it 50 60 70 because some people have
been very successful in later years as
entrepreneurs you know going back a long
time like Colonel Sanders
KFC Kentucky Fried Chicken guy he didn't
make his money until 65 and then there
was this billionaire T boone pickens who
was broke gets in his 60s or 70s and he
came back and became a billionaire again
so don't let necessarily the age and put
you off but if especially though if you
are younger in your teens and you've got
no responsibilities no debts and this
that was the time to do it because you
have plenty of time to move to mess up
all right that's it
that's the end of this video
and happy 2017 and going forward this is
recording this on New Year's Eve 2016 so
uh ciao
