going to talk about becoming a freelance
web designer so it's actually from a
article I wrote about a year ago on how
to build websites and I'm gonna go over
a few things here very quickly for
people who are just learning this stuff
first of all let me point out but I'm
putting together a guide a module for my
Python course and then I'm gonna do a
similar thing for my interactive web
developer course specifically on career
paths for Python and then career paths
for web developers and the three basic
career paths by the way are getting a
job number one number two becoming a
freelancer contractor and number three
building your own app or your own
programs in Python so there are pros and
cons so each their lifestyle
considerations for each and so again I
just I just have to edit the last couple
videos for the Python version of this
and essentially I go over the pros and
cons of each and then I give you an
action plan for each of these career
paths so you can get up and running
quickly as possible that's something
that people have done my course will
tell you they see that it's very real
world oriented I'm there to teach you
real world coding so I figure it made
sense since so many people haven't asked
me over the years to actually put
together a module for my courses that
show you how to take these courses and
to turn them into money to become to
commercialize your skillsets whether
whether it be working for somebody or
becoming a freelancer or maybe building
your own apps let's get back to this
main vlog point becoming a freelance web
designer so the first question I answer
is how do you get your first clients so
you have to have your basic skill sets
and then what you got to do is you got
to get yourself a blog site up there you
got to get a website up there
demonstrating your skills and there's a
couple ways you can use some sites that
were you can go bid on contracts there
might be a good way to establish some
experience because being a professional
web designer or web developer
professional programmer in
general regardless of the language
requires that you understand how to deal
with clients whether clients happen to
be working the same company as you and
you're doing your your the web developer
and your producing the code for the
company or whether you're working as a
contractor and working with clients in
that regard that's the big part of being
professional coders working with working
with the clients so how do you get your
first clients you have to establish your
credibility you have to establish that
you know what you're doing
putting up a website putting up a vlog
having a good hub account with some code
and having done a couple projects that's
why that you can demonstrate that's why
I'm a interactive web developer of
course we teach the core which is key to
getting up and running quick and then we
have all these projects that you can
choose from now there's 66 hours of
video which is quite a bit but it's not
expected it's not required but you do
all the projects in fact if you just you
do the core which is the core language
training then you do the projects you do
one maybe two projects and you're gonna
be ready to go professionally and you're
gonna have something to show in your
your github and you're gonna have
something to show online you show
prospective clients hey look this is
what I've done so that's the first thing
if you're a freelancer who would on this
yeah yeah this is all about being a
freelancer not getting a job so much if
you're freelancer word of mouth is
probably a great way to go talk to some
friends family say I'll do a job for
free you got to learn first one or two
projects do for free and it goes from
there now in that module is where I
actually taught teach this comes with an
e-book my ebook it's a small guide
including videos I get into more detail
so whatever things you got to learn to
do is managing your projects managing
your clients and that's a big part of
creating a good working relationship
with your clients be able to set
expectations to meet deadlines and to
just be professional and by doing this
it will go a long way in terms of
keeping the process smooth so that you
don't get into any into any disputes
which
clients again I cover more of that in
other courses what to charge and how to
bill your clients ah that's a that's an
interesting subject now I won't go into
detail here because this is a vlog but
in a nutshell when you're first starting
out the first one or two small gigs are
gonna be freebies probably unless you're
lucky and the reason is because you're
still learning you're still cutting your
teeth as they say and so once you've
done those first couple projects for
free I what it teaches that you should
keep meticulous records of how long
everything takes and then from there you
can then start judging how to actually
bid on a contract and actually how to
manage of the cost of a job so it makes
sense for both you and the client and
again I'm just going over things quickly
in the actual course there's well more
detail and and as you become more and
more advanced you're gonna be much more
efficient in how you code and you whoa
my camera shut off for some reason don't
know why so at the end of the day in a
nutshell rather the rate that you charge
for a job and what you're gonna be able
to make per hour is going to increase in
time as you develop more and more skills
so keep that in mind what's their speed
per diem and a cost per project so you
as a developer will want to charge per
hour right because it's hard to judge
the cost of things so she at first
that's where meticulous notes on how
long it takes you to do things going to
help your law a lot in the medium and
long term because you can understand how
long things take but your clients are
going to want to pay per project they
will ask you how much you charge for
Albert but they're all going to want
paper project because they don't want to
have runaway cost especially when they
just getting to know you they don't know
who you are finally I'll end off this
vlog and say go check out my video on
eff you money very important a few money
will help you in your freelance career
in ways you hadn't you would never
expect and so it's very important that
you develop and they
big stash of fu money and that's pretty
much it for now
I'm just curious if this cameras gonna
show off again I don't know
I write much more to come much more to
come bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
