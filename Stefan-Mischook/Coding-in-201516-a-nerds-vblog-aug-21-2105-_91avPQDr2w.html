and other sites it's been a long long
time since I've done a video on quick
I've been super busy with work so but I
see the light at the end of the tunnel
and I should be able to start putting
out regular V blogs again so what have I
been working on well first thing I did
was we finished we I finished the book
it's a beginners book on web design that
covers all the latest stuff you know
css3 html5 I touch on some JavaScript I
touch on bootstrap jQuery I just touch
it though because it is a beginners book
so if you're an experienced coder this
is this is not the book for you but if
you're a total beginner and I invite you
to take a look it's got little projects
in there and it's pretty cool you know
but yeah so why did I wrote the book I
wrote the book because I decided that it
was time for me to build a whole new
curriculum of courses some of you may or
may not know I've been building web
development and coding courses since
2003 about I've been teaching it since
about 2002 and through my websites
articles and print and and the web sites
you know for many years quarter-million
people a month you know from articles
everything I probably taught millions
and I've gotten emails from countless I
don't know thousands or tens of
thousands over the years but anyway long
story short I've been doing courses for
a long time and what you typically see
out there is you know they walk you
through things it's you know that's fine
and that's cool I was doing that you
know in 2003 and but I decided for a new
set of courses I wanted to raise the bar
in terms of how code and how practical
web development skills are taught it's a
personal thing for me and what do I mean
by that I just want to see if I can do
something different something new
something better and so I've been
working on these things for a couple
years now getting a hardcore
now into the new curriculum and I think
I got something pretty interesting in
fact you know it's not my thought is
we've been testing it on thousands of
students and we're getting fantastic
results better than I've ever seen so
I'll be excited to release that to you
guys
soon very soon we're just wrapping up
some stuff and that's pretty much it so
once that once the product is done then
I'm going to be able to spend some time
commenting on the trends and technology
and so forth because I think since I've
been coding since 1994 I've written many
lots of software many languages over the
years that I have something to offer in
terms of not just teaching you to code
would teach you teaching you how to how
to set yourself up so you're in the
right technology space you're you're
using the right technologies and you're
mindful where to go so that you can
maximize how much you can earn or
getting the best jobs and so on I've
seen technology trends flow and I see
how things come in in vogue and fall out
of favor and I see a pattern you know
you've been doing this since 94 so how
many years it's two decades I guess it's
a long time so you see these patterns
see how things happen how things happen
I see you know there there we go again I
see a pattern again I see another
pattern again so we're seeing a move now
we've seen this big move javascript is a
part of it
so you can ask yourself you got
JavaScript you've got Ruby at PHP
normally you wouldn't put JavaScript you
know alongside Ruby PHP Java C sharp and
so on you normally wouldn't because
JavaScript is traditionally the language
that works in the web browser but now
I've seen this move a major mover
javascript is being pushed down into the
server as well and that competes against
Ruby a competes up against PHP that
competes against all these other
server-side languages if any of this is
unclear to you don't worry in subsequent
videos and articles I'm going to start
looking at this because when you're
learning technology you have to be
mindful that few
so for instance would I be learning Ruby
now I know Ruby's very popular to start
up crowd because you know for whatever
reasons it's a fun language it's a great
language it's gonna be wrong technically
but I think personally that Ruby is on
its way out I think it's gonna be a
fringe technology I'm not saying it's
gonna go two-way a flash anytime soon
but I think that the the mojo is going
to be in JavaScript the Mojo is going to
be in PHP that's where you want to put
your efforts I would suggest and finally
you see out there and this really pisses
me off that you see out there to say
learn to code learn to build video games
and you become a great coder that you
can then jump into to another language
well first the first thing you will not
make money built coding video games you
indie games and making money building
indie games been a little for small
games we're not working for EA or
Ubisoft or something the chance of you
making money doing that or next to zero
because like that whole market is super
saturated for instance you know I talked
about this the iOS market the chance of
your app on the App Store ever being
seen are highly unlikely let alone you
making a living in fact the survey shows
that if you are or if you are an app
developer for iOS or Android a chance
you making money errors these guys are
working for slave labor and also go work
at McDonald's a lot easier at McDonald's
right no no no you're not gonna be an
app cash earning app developer for iOS
apps that's that's that's not true it's
highly unlikely highly unlikely where
you can make money doing apps I'm going
on my rounds here where you can make
money doing apps is building apps for
other businesses small businesses maybe
you got a local club who wants to build
an app or some cafe or something but if
you think you're gonna make a video game
or some sort of app that you're gonna
put on the iOS store and make money from
it think again it's it's highly highly
unlikely if you're looking to make a
living if you're looking to secure work
you want to get again the king is still
web app development browser-based
development that's where the money is in
for the foreseeable future I'm just
letting you know if you want to get into
game development you probably didn't
have to get yourself a comp side degree
computer science degree cuz you're gonna
probably have to go work for a big huge
gaming company and when you have big and
huge in a company that means HR
departments which means degrees are
required but if you're working as an
independent or go after small business
then they don't care about degrees they
care about your portfolio and your
resume and what you can do so that's a
whole different issue I've talked about
this in the past but anyway this is one
of the things that was bothering me yeah
you're not gonna be a catch earning app
developer putting your apps on iOS
stores you can be a catcher earning app
developer if you're selling that
services of building apps but selling
your own apps highly unlikely I don't
mean to burst your bubble that's just
reality of situation all right we'll
talk some bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
