relevant is it something worth learning
well let me just say that I've never
written C++ I may have done the
equivalent of hello world why did the
equivalent of hello world about 15 years
ago it wasn't a type of programming I
was interested in but it's still
extremely extremely extremely extremely
important today I'm sure there are tons
of c++ jobs out there because so many
apps rely on C++ so is it just it's just
a different space you have to understand
something C++ coding and the type of
person that does C+ C++ code is very
different from somebody who might be
doing PHP or somebody might be doing
Ruby somebody might be doing even Java
C++ is a lower level language meaning
it's a language that's closer to the CPU
and so what does that mean that means
that it's far more efficient in terms of
run time meaning that C++ code is far
faster than Java PHP Ruby in fact C++ is
used to write Java it's used it was used
to write Ruby meaning they created Ruby
by using C++ and I think C they created
Java with C+ muscles C++ is like a
foundation language and so you got like
a phone that you got except you got the
CPU here you got a CPU right here at the
bottom of the stack and then you've got
right on top and I get something like
assembler maybe which is like a really
low-level talking to them to the CPU at
a very CPU type of language meaning zero
and one zero one zero one zero zero zero
zero one that's type of coding I would
never do then on top of that you may
have you have C and then on top you have
a C++ so these are all layers that have
to be passed through when your code is
processing to get to the CPU because at
the end of the days at the bottom of
that stack the very bottom you got that
CPU it's doing all the computations so
you got
CPU you got assembler you can see you
got C++ this is kind of rough and then
on top of that you got like C++ has been
used to create PHP well C and C++ C PHP
Java Ruby assembler ml not simpler Java
Ruby PHP c-sharp Python you get the idea
so as the languages are higher and
higher up to stack farther from the CPU
they're much more productive meaning you
can write a lot more code you get a lot
more done with less code whereas like
with assembler if you're writing
assembler code you have tremendous
control over everything but it would
take like you know a week to create a
button you know what I mean
whereas you you can create a bug a
button in Java
Java's UI kit and like you know three
seconds so you know there you go so when
you're writing low-level code c plus
plus code it's used for game creating
gaming engines it's used for creating
the engines that have do a lot of the
heavy duty processing like the engines
behind all the video games and stuff
like that so understand the type of
coding that you're getting into with C++
it's different from let's say if you're
going to be writing Python so you get
that idea
so yeah I'm sure there's plenty of work
understand the type of coding that it is
but it's extremely valuable and I don't
see it going away for many many years
yeah
so you'd be pretty good there again I'm
not I'm far from being an expert in fact
I know very little about C++ cuz I never
wrote any but it's very lucrative you
can be sure about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
