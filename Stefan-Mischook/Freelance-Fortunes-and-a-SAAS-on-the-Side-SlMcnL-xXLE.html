answer to a common question I get
freelancing versus working for somebody
versus starting your own business
starting a sauce creating your own
software and selling that software into
the into the world the soul let's look
at them very briefly getting a job it's
probably the easiest route to go you
develop your skills step one
you help your foundations whatever you
want to do so let's say we're doing the
web you got to do your html5 CSS your
JavaScript then you know a little bit of
design chops and then you could probably
get at least entry level work as a web
designer now to make that a little bit
juicier you probably need to add in
perhaps a touch of react maybe react yes
a little bit of bootstrap of course just
a little bit and you can get in there if
you want to really maximize your chances
of getting a job and you want to get
into the server-side programming so that
would be programming on the server
talking about web server you don't know
what this is just do a good beginners
course if you want to program on the
server you got many choices you can do
it with JavaScript you can do with PHP
you're gonna do it Python you can do it
Java you can do a c-sharp which one to
choose depends on the type of work you
want to do but a good entry-level work
you're probably gonna find jobs doing
server-side PHP number one then I've
number two I would choose JavaScript
number three I would choose Python this
is for web development I'm talking about
web development okay let's move on from
getting a job
how about freelancing freelancing again
you got to do your basics HTML your CSS
your JavaScript and put up a nice site
that's step two so for step one for
freelancers you put up you learn your
basics step two you put up a
nice-looking site step three you reach
out and start talking small business
owners you may have to do one or two
free first jobs for free that's normal
but then you're gonna start picking up
more and more clients if you can add in
some again for freelancing PHP skills
that will add up quite a bit in terms of
you know that will increase rather the
chances that you're going to get a get
you're gonna get jobs once you start
doing server-side you know you be once
you do some basic PHP you do shopping
card stuff and stalling cards
configuring cards that kind of thing and
maybe kick in some WordPress skills
theming basic configuration and so on
then you're gonna have a lot of
potential work for you in terms of a
freelance web developer now you could
get freelance work as a JavaScript web
developer but I've heard anywhere from
60s a high 60s and 80s 80% of small
businesses run on a PHP based background
just the way it is and I can tell you
they're not going to want to change off
a PHP unless they absolutely have to so
learning PHP as a freelancer just makes
dollars and cents not just cents again
before you judge nodejs guys or your
Java guys or your Ruby guys start going
crazy and saying telling me how PHP
sucks first of all doesn't suck second
of all I'm not saying PHP superior in
terms of the technology over other
solution I'm just saying that a lot of
businesses use it and if you understand
anything about business business owners
are loath to trash something they spent
a lot of money on there you have
something invested in they're gonna want
to continue that's just the way it works
so it's a business decision more than a
tech decision when you're looking at the
languages that you're going to choose
for freelance work and of course number
three creating your own software this
can be the most rewarding in the end but
is also far more difficult and becoming
a freelancer for freelance work once you
know your basic you your basic you can
be up and running within a month or so
you can probably start getting gigs
right and within a year you probably
have a lot of gigs where as a SAS I
could take years and years to develop
and it could possibly fail in fact in
terms of vc-backed software based
products bc venture capital 80% of them
fail
80 85 % something like that they fail
and in fact the investors they count on
that they actually factor into their
equations
when they're investing all their money
they're investing a little here though
here a little here a little here a
little here they assume that 80% are
gonna go Boop nowhere so keep that in
mind so the hardest thing to do is to
helps asses I've developed a few and if
had some success it's nothing stellar
but successful and yeah that's just the
way it is it's difficult and it takes
time so if your ultimate goal is to get
into building your own software but you
want to sell it to the marketplace
whether it be web-based or an app that
you sell in the App Store which is best
really hard to do nowadays by the way
just because there's so much competition
then stowable the approach in that
regard is to first get out there
freelance develop your chops develop
your skills develop your workflows
working on other people's projects get
some cash flow get some contacts going
and understand the business environment
and what will happen is that as you do
more work in the real world where you're
actually dealing directly with clients
you're gonna have a better understanding
of how business works
you're gonna start seeing opportunities
that you would not have seen otherwise
and then from there you go say okay I'm
gonna start developing a sass on the
side that's what I did when I develop a
first one that comes to mind is my
online dating site and I shut it down
many many years ago because it got
invaded by all these swingers and it was
growing but I don't want to become the
swinger coder I've talked about this in
other videos so I shut it down and maybe
I shouldn't have but anyway again it was
a side project that i was developing
while I was doing freelance work and so
had money coming in from the freelancers
and in fact because of my freelance work
it gave me a not it gave the opportunity
for this dating site to actually start
to grow because of contacts and stuff I
won't get into the specifics here so
that was a key part of it now the other
thing about that yeah yeah so if you
want to find yourself in the end
developing your own software doing the
freelance route is a good way to get
there it's a way there to
to bridge that again being a freelancer
can be extremely really creative you
made a ton of money much more than you
killed working as an employee and that
comes down to not thinking oh what's my
per hour rate that I'm gonna charge you
know it has to do with workflows and
efficiencies coding and development
workflows and project management
workflows that will maximize your profit
your your your profitability and you can
make a fortune as a freelancer but just
got to know what you do it anyway I hope
this video helps Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
