put into place so you know that these
are all tags this is a body tag head tag
title tag and then we have the HTML tag
we've seen these all before but what we
haven't seen before is this thing this
is called a doctype tag and this is one
of those tags in HTML where there's no
closing tag there's just one doctype and
what this tag does it just tells the web
browser which version of HTML we are
using I'll get into the details about
doc types later and the versions of HTML
so just understand now but this is the
latest version of the doctype so this is
the one you're gonna be using all the
time first thing you put into any HTML
page is your doctype so that you're
telling the web browser that I'm using
the latest version of HTML in my HTML
pages okay the HTML tags I was the
opening here and the closing here this
tells the web browser that this is the
beginning of the HTML code and this is
the end of the HTML code so that's
pretty clear a web page has two major
sections it has a head section and it
has the body section the head section
contains all kinds of extra information
about your page but are not viewable in
the web browser
meaning you don't see it in the actual
page that you load the only exception to
that of course is the title tag as we've
seen before so let's add a title I'm
going to call it our first page and
we'll save that and let's preview in the
browser open and browser and as you can
see we have nothing in the body so our
page is blank this would be in a body
area but you see in our tab our first
page with a period I don't like to
period there so I'm just gonna take it
out and that's just because I just don't
like the way it looks so we'll say that
there again there we go the period is
gone
we need to do some crazy things like
this and yeah we'll save that there it
is right so there's all kinds of
different things we can put in our title
so let me just delete this again because
whatever you don't really need it okay
enough of that
so let's now add some stuff to our body
as you just saw sublime text our code
editor auto-completed the paragraph for
me let me do that again just in case you
you missed it before so I'm gonna put
the angle brackets hit P and it gives us
suggestions I can tab up and down use my
arrow key rather to up go up and down
and choose but I want to go with the P
tag I just hit enter and it finishes the
tag for us I'm gonna type in simple
enough and let's preview in browser open
in browser there we go
this is our first now let's see that's
the old page there we go we reloaded it
so here we go this is our first
paragraph we've created our very first
web page on the desktop yes
a simple page but now we've done it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
