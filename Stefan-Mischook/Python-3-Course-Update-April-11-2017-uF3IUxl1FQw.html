then that means I've been able to start
working again on the Python course so if
you were part of that group of people
were doing the Python course I know you
have to wait weeks could be helped my
voice I lost my voice and over a month
or so at a very weak force and I don't
like recording courses which are going
to be out there for a long time I don't
like recording these when I have a very
weak voice so you're going to see if you
go to the spot online there are new
videos online for you to explore if you
want part of the original group and you
want to join in I'm open to letting in a
few more people so just email me at
Stefan ste fa n at Studio web.com say
you want to participate in the Python
course beta this of course is video only
this is not the same course as the full
course when I release it into studio web
where anybody who tells you is use the
city web system it's so much more
engaging it's so much more conducive to
learning than just videos because when
you just watch videos it's kind of a
passive way of learning whereas a studio
web you are involved in you get in and
engaged in an active learning process
within studi web and you just learned so
much more easily and so much more
quickly anyhow so yeah the Python course
I'm back on it in fact it's my primary
focus now hopefully for the next two
weeks to get it done and so head on over
to the Python beta site which you're
aware of and you can start watching and
commenting on the new videos I really
appreciate that because you helped me to
make the course better and if you want
to participate you have it please send
me an email and I will
getting at least a few people and you
know you get access to free stuff in
exchange for you giving me your feedback
about the videos it's very important to
me and I appreciate it very much so
alright that's it for this long judge
