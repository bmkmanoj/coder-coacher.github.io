talk about Max Audi's vs windows and
Chryslers I'm into buying top lurline
everything because at the end of the day
I value the experience that you get from
the top of the line product now not
everybody would agree with that and not
everybody with value that experience
will give you a few examples for example
hi def music 32-mile 24-bit and 32-bit
music and Japanese vinyl pressings I am
a bit of an audiophile not a crazy guy
was an audio file some of you value
sound so I'll spend a few bucks and I
got some audio file speakers and audio
file vinyl and high def 24 bit and 32
bit audio I hear the difference now
you're not going to hear the difference
unless a you have good speakers number
one you need good speakers decent amp
and you need to hear it some people
simply don't hear it they don't care
they don't value they say why are you
spending money on 24-bit audio files
that are 60 70 Meg's you can just get to
the three Meg mp3 well for me I hear the
difference so I'm going to pay for that
difference same thing with Mac computers
with the windows a lot of Windows people
look at Mac people say why are you
spending all that extra money on the Mac
computer well it's the experience I have
latest mac book pro and with all the
complaints that people have hurled at it
including me at one point it's still the
best computer I've he owned thus far I
also have the flagship surface pro
windows tablet / convertible well
whatever it's a tablet / computer and I
had really good experiences in the
beginning but with the update number 689
from microsoft windows all the windows
update number 689 I'm exaggerating is
you know they seem to update every two
weeks it's inconsistent sometimes you
try to close a window what this gets
stuck and sometimes you try to move a
nap and just get stuck it just sometimes
it works really well and sometimes I go
it's very frustrating with Mac it's
always smooth it's almost always smooth
yes you hear people occasional buds but
compared to windows it's not even close
for Mike spread it's always smooth let's
look at expensive German cars German
automobiles versus your standard matter
little Toyota or for the crisis or
whatnot some people like friends of mine
they'll look at my maintenance costs on
my LD I get a pretty high-end ally and
so my maintenance costs are much much
higher than your Toyota CRV or your
Honda court but the difference is the
ride the ride in a German sports car is
off the charts for me so I'm going to
pay for that luxury but I'm paying and
so my friends would drive Toyota's and
stuff they've allow you're overpaying my
god now if you're paying so much more
than I'm paying to do an oil change or
to change your tires or to do full of
changes in the maintenance oh I said
well yeah this is true but I'm driving
at a luxury audi sports car and with
that luxury with that amazing ride that
you get you have to pay and that's the
thing so you have to decide for yourself
whether or not that luxury is worth it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
