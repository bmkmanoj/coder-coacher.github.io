now we're just going to pass in one
variable and that variable is going to
have the parameter name of color and the
value of red now if I hit save
traditionally you would think okay maybe
the a link gets overridden and it
doesn't increase in font size anymore
but actually the a link now has two
event listeners attached to it so
they're both going to fire one after
another so if i click on be linked it's
just going to increase the font size
like it did before but if i click on a
link you'll see that it also increases
in font size but also slowly animates
and turns red just kind of neat so we're
going to take the knowledge that we've
acquired here and we're going to start a
new project and this project is going to
be a very simple menu system that's
going to use animation and some jQuery
events i'm going to start this off by
just saving what we've got right here
and i'm going to call this menus HTML
now we're going to need a bit of CSS to
get us going so i'm going to be writing
a bit of that and i'm also going to have
to change our current HTML by the way as
you see this start to grow it would make
sense to create your own javascript file
that sits in another file and then just
to simply reference it the same way that
we reference ajax google api is calm /
jsapi you can reference local or remote
javascript files j/s files and they'll
run on your page so you could take you
know this body of code right here stick
it in a function and then you could call
that function from your page so the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to say that this is this title is
actually going to be called simple
events menus and down here we're going
to create a
unordered list and we're going to have
some list items because this is a menu
after all and then a hyperlink we're
going to call this nav a and I'm going
to copy this a couple times we'll have
nav a nav be navsea and nap d and then
down here I'm going to have another div
of type of class content and inside that
I'm going to have a paragraph with a bit
of text in my content section and lastly
I'm going to create a container around
my whole day instructor Anna div is just
a division in your page so this is a a
div that is wrapped around our whole
project if I hit save refresh this out
we've changed our file name so i should
change that to menus HTML so far it's
not very interesting with a bit of CSS
though it's going to look a lot better
so let's get started with the CSS the
styling of our document object model or
our HTML page so i'm going to start with
a style tag of type text / CSS and again
you probably want to put this in another
file a dot CSS file but for the purposes
of this example I think it's simpler
just to keep it all in one page it'll
make it a lot easier to read instead of
jumping back and forth the first thing I
want to style is the actual body and the
body should have a background of gray
efefef the EF corresponds to read and
then this EF corresponds to red green
and then the last two EFS correspond to
blue
and then we're going to say that the
font family should be Ariel and Saul
serif we're just specifying a primary
font and font in case that primary font
doesn't exist and we're going to have
our container which will be Center
aligned this top margin is 0 and the
left and right margin are set to auto
and we're going to give it a width of
eight hundred and fifty pixels a
background of white and we'll just have
a nice little border around our
container so we can create a bit of
definition also of grey you'll notice
that I'm indenting my CSS here this is a
trick that a associate of mine taught me
which I thought was really neat because
it lets you kind of see the structure of
your page within your CSS as well so
we've got a title tag which is being
styled as well and you'll notice that
I've got a dot container which
corresponds to the class container and a
pound title which corresponds to the ID
title and this is just typical CSS and
this is how CSS selects various elements
on a page also before we get into
styling the navigation I want to add
some more classes here I'm going to have
an unordered list but this unordered
list is special it's going to be of type
nav and we're going to start by saying
that our nav item of nav item B is going
to have the class called active this is
going to be really helpful in helping a
style which is the active navigation on
our page so I'm going to refresh this
again it should look a little different
now so we've got our title the top and
our navigation and then a bit of text in
my contents content section now we just
need to style the navigation so we're
going to start off by saying that our
nav doesn't have those ugly bullets
it's going to have a background of dark
gray the same dark gray that we have in
the title it's going to be centered and
it's going to have a height of 40 pixels
then for each list item inside of our
navigation we want that to be displayed
in line we want it to float left in
other words we want them to be stacked
one next to the other if our nav
container is 40 pixels we want our
height of our nav items to be 34 pixels
with a padding of 0 pixels and 10 pixels
so this is the top padding and bottom
padding and this is the left padding and
the right padding we'll just set some
margins all across so if you think of a
clock you've got five pixels on the top
5 pixels on the right no pixels on the
bottom and 5 pixels on the left so that
we've got some space around our nav
items and we've got a line height of 10
pixels what this will do is move the
text inside of our list items down a
notch we're going to be using this for
animation later we also need to specify
a bit of a background so that there's
some definition and let's create a
border so the border width is going to
be one pixel on the top one pixel on the
right no pixels on the bottom and one
pixel on the left so that it creates
like a tab the border style has to be
something so we'll say it's solid just a
solid line and a color of 999 which is
another gray a little lighter than 666
refresh this and we've got ourselves
some tabs they're not too shabby but
they could use a bit of work so now that
I've got my list item I'm trying to go
through this relatively quickly just
because this is a jQuery tutorial and
not a CSS tutorial but if you have any
questions feel free to email me or talk
about them in the killer PHP forum
so we want our hyperlinks to have a
certain color and will say that the text
decoration should be none in other words
we don't want that underline and now
we're going to start styling our active
div items and this is very important so
we've got an active element here and we
want our active elements to look a
little different from the rest of our
elements actually before I get into this
I want to make sure that I can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
