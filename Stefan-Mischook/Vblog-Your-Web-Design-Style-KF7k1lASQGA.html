with killer sites calm this is me right
here in this video I want to talk about
web design styles specifically your web
design style so let me get to the point
of this video just in case you guys are
impatient essentially what you're going
to find is that every web designer just
about every web designer has a
particular style particular look that
they produce consistently you'll see
telltale signs of this and all that work
and that includes you if your web
designer now the big question is as you
develop in your web design career and
you find that maybe your style is
getting a little stale or maybe just
want to change it up what are your
solutions how do you get out from being
locked into your own style that's all a
braid on later on in this video but
again back to it begs the question what
do you do the two solutions either are
to use a web template find another style
that's different from your own and you
know in a template and then leverage
that or leverage the style in that
template and start using it in your work
or the other option is to hire another
web designer to just develop the basic
skin for your website so let's get back
to the meat of the video what I'm
arguing and what I have seen over the
years last 15 years of being in this
game that a web designer actually any
artist really develops at some point in
time in a career a particular style or
that it's consistent throughout their
work and you can see this across the
board I it's very very rare that you see
a web designer who can design in very
different ways you know you you'll see
someone who
since you can diet you know they'll
design a restaurant website and then a
website for a dog kennel and then some
other type of website and you'll see
telltale signs of their artwork of their
design aesthetic throughout and that's
just a fact of life it's very rare that
you see somebody who can create a
totally different look and this is not
just something in web design this is
something to see in just about any art
form you see what painters if you look
at P castle for instance Gopi castle and
let's look at some of his images now you
look at all these Picasso images you
notice how they're very very similar
right it's this is his style right you
can pretty much identify a Picasso
painting right away and so if the greats
like p castle seems to be the great
sleepy castle get locked into a style
then it's no shame that you as a humble
web designer should find yourself in the
same boat let me let me look look back
at some earlier work so here is
something i did in i guess i established
this particular look in the early 2000s
like 2001 2007 like that and it carried
it through up until a few years ago this
particular site was last updated in 2007
so it's this is the last of the
evolution of this style steph style
you'll notice that this style has
earmarks of the period in which it was
built you notice that the width is
actually quite narrow compared to modern
more modern web sites if you look a
width is about 780 pic pixels 8080 ye 5
pixels roughly and it's because when
this site was but it was designed it was
designed a period when most people had
800
by 600 resolution monitors so you needed
to design it narrow enough so we move
forward to a more modern looking site
like this is our current in 2011 killer
site site and you notice that the width
is it's much much wider why because
people have much better video card so we
have a lot more screen real estate to
work with now for this particular design
here I just acted as art director at
this point in time in my career I'm just
busy running things so though I didn't
write any code here myself and I didn't
do any design but I basically I'm the
art director so what does that mean it
means I specified a color schemes I /
specify the type of layout I want fonts
use etc so I have you know a big hand in
it but really this site is an expression
of another web designer style and the
reason I went with this particular web
designer one of my assistants is because
I liked I like their style so let's look
at another one of our killer sites web
sites this is killer JavaScript com this
was again I art-directed this and this
is another guy and of course you can see
as a more minimal style more of a
corporate style and whether or not you
prefer this style or Vista it comes down
to taste and actually comes down to the
type of website you're building because
of the nature of killer sites in our
network of sites I wanted to move from a
more corporate look like this to a more
of a fun look that we have here if you
look at CSS tutorial net this style is
again by the same designer who did this
and you can see some are some
similarities i hope i think at least I
do and with this style particular we we
have a tutorial structure here so I want
to really simplify the layout so that
people can concentrate on the material
on
lessons and so on so though it's a same
designers this guy and and those are the
different structures a bit different you
can see the tell-tale signs of this
guy's work rather than or uh supposed to
this guy it's pretty clear but this is a
different person here and which is awful
obviously a very different person here
now this also shows a date is it shows
you a different time period in web
design and in fact if you go back
earlier on you'll see that you know web
design and the look of websites are
greatly affected by the technology
that's available at the time so as I
mentioned earlier when I first started
this video I have found that 99% of web
designers seem to have a particular
style and they seem to basically conform
to that style and the reason being i
find is more my series i think it gets
kind of gets hard coded in your brain
and it's very hard to switch out of it
and as i said it's the same thing in all
art styles it's even in the same thing
in certain sports for instance if you
watch i don't know if this may be a risk
reference may be too old for some of you
guys but Muhammad Ali had a very
particular style that was a style and
he's very identifiable and for him to
switch and imitate what say Joe Frazier
style which was a totally different type
of fighter he could do it but he
wouldn't do it very well relative to his
his own style so you see that an art as
well so back to the original problem the
problem is in time your design style
like mine may become dated or you may
want to switch off into another style
because of whatever circumstance so what
are the solutions number one is to hire
a web designer to just produce the skin
again you can art direct it as I do I
my hands and everything you get somebody
to inject their style into your work so
that it can really freshen up what you
provide to import for your clients or
whatnot or for your own sites another
option and it's pretty similar is just
you find a particular layout but you
like whether it be in a template or
whatnot and then you borrow from that
and you take it you take off from there
and this allowing you to perhaps appeal
to a broader range of clients in terms
of style</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
