PHP and today what we're gonna be doing
is looking at how we can perform some
more advanced operations with MySQL so
this is gonna be probably a ten part
video where we're going to be starting
with just looking at what joins are in a
relational database from there we're
going to be looking at how we can create
constraints to make sure that we have
integrity in our data then we're gonna
look at what many people who design
databases call one too many and then
many too many and then creating views
we're gonna look at timestamps we're
gonna look up back and we're gonna look
at how we can do backups and restore
data and we're also going to take a
little bit of a peek into the MySQL
search engine so to start off today what
I'm gonna do is just look at joins with
you and before we even get there I'm
going to have to introduce some of the
tools I'm going to be working with today
as you've probably noticed I'm using the
I'm using a Mac however all this
information and all these different
tools have equivalencies on a PC whether
you're using Linux or you're using
Windows I have a very simple text editor
here it's called BB edit there's an
equivalent free version called text
wrangler which you can download if
you're on a Mac I'm also using a a map
stack which is to say essentially I have
essentially I have MySQL Apache and PHP
running on top of Mac OS X there are
equivalent versions of this stack of
open source free software usually if you
look up exam X a MPP you can probably
get yourself set up on pretty much any
platform again this is free to download
and lastly we're going to be doing a lot
of work with the terminal and we're
going to be working on the command line
because we're dealing with advanced
topics we're gonna want to have to you
know we're gonna want to interface
directly with MySQL and using the
terminal is at the end of the day the
fastest and the simplest way of actually
doing that
so on one hand I'm going to be creating
SQL scripts that we're gonna work with
back and forth so that we don't lose our
place and on the other hand we're gonna
actually be interfacing with MySQL at a
command line level you'll also notice
that I have PHP myadmin open just to
show you that you know yes we can
actually double check things using PHP
myadmin
so with all of that I say let's get
started so the first thing I want to do
is just show you a bit of some of the
tools we're gonna be using with on the
command line
the first one is MySQL and because I'm
on a Mac and because I am working
specifically with the map version of
MySQL I am going to have to be a little
more explicit with my connection to
MySQL now I already have the map server
running which you can see right here so
I know it's running but I want to
actually use MySQL as command-line tool
to perform all the operations I need to
perform just a note about SQL in general
now a while back
stephane me shook put together an
excellent beginner introduction to MySQL
with the focus of being able to run SQL
queries from the from PHP mainly if you
wanted to you know create records update
records and delete records the goal of
this video is really to kind of broaden
that knowledge and make you kind of more
comfortable with how how to do kind of
complex queries with SQL really use the
relational aspects of relational
database like MySQL where you're
actually using different tables and
you're relating data from one place to
another and lastly if you do get into a
you know object relational mapping
frameworks
ORM as they're called where you're not
even dealing with SQL anymore you've got
some other package in PHP like propel or
doctrine that's doing all that for you
that you can actually debug that code
and understand a little bit of what is
being generated for you on the fly
you won't be totally at a loss so in
order to access my MySQL database I'm
gonna have to actually use the client
and in this case it's sitting in the map
folder under library under bin for
binary and it's gonna be MySQL so if I
just hit enter then it's gonna show me
it's gonna log me in and everything
looks okay however something that I need
to kind of check is if I go show
databases I'm gonna notice that there's
actually nothing there whereas if I go
back to get to my PHP myadmin you'll see
that I have a whole bunch of different
databases that I use for development
purposes on my local machine so in order
to make sure that I'm properly accessing
my database I'm going to specify a
username and a password and in this case
it's gonna be we're gonna use - u which
is the username flag and then password
is root now this is the default username
and password for MAMP and I'm just gonna
hit enter so now if I say show databases
semicolon and hit enter I'm gonna get
all the databases that I'm getting here
so you can see the same thing in one
place as well as the other now the first
thing I want to do is actually create a
database that we can work with and then
from there we'll be building up our
examples together so I'm gonna create a
database kay PHP with a character set of
utf-8 and a collation of utf-8
underscore general underscore or CI now
let me just explain that for a minute
essentially the create database is
pretty obvious we're creating a database
it's going to be called Kay PHP the
character set being utf-8 is just a
default in other words we want to make
sure that all the text that's being
stored in our database is going to be
encoded using the utf-8 encoding
structure which means that if we have ax
and we have Spanish characters and
French characters that they're going to
be rendered properly the other thing
here is the utf-8 underscore general
under CI and this is how the ordering of
those characters in the character of map
this is a pretty standard collation so
it's pretty much recommended the CI at
the end stands for case-insensitive and
the utf-8 is just because it's a utf-8
collation so I'm just gonna finish that
off with a semicolon and now if I go
show databases you should see that there
is now a que PHP database so I'm just
gonna quit and this time I'm going to
log in and I'm going to specify my K PHP
database at the command line by just
adding K PHP at the end now if I go show
tables I should see nothing in there but
basically now I'm in the I'm in the
client and I'm also in that database so
now we're working within the K PHP
database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
