potato this vlog is pointless perfection
so I'm going to go back way way back and
I was in my other business my very first
business in fact and I had a dry line of
products basically products that would
be sold on store shelves water
purification products and other things
so for this particular line I decide I
decided to design the labels myself and
I had graphic design training so I
figure why not I'll leverage my skills
so I started working on the labels I
kept working on the labels I kept
working on the labels and my partner
will come to me Steph Steph what are
your prize is going to be houses well
I'm working on the labels are almost
there and you would look at the labels
and you say to me labels are pretty good
so now I'd only a couple little things
here don't like you know so a week would
pass second we could pass if they're we
could pass for if we would pass so then
the part would be saying hey come on
stuff let's go let's get these labels on
me like well you know I'm Justin Isaac
it's not quite there I got more work you
know I'm almost got it and it was
becoming an obsessive thing for me to
get just a perfect font just a perfect
placement we're talking moving an image
by millimeters and so forth and my
partner would say you gotta sell we
gotta sell we gotta sell we can't keep
designing these things because we won't
make any money and you had a very good
point and the point of this vlog
pointless perfection is to know when to
stop when to stop and put the product
out whether it be a piece of software a
product line you're putting out an
article you're writing a video vlog
which are doing it comes the point where
you have to just cut it off and reminds
me of very good advice I got from a
highly experienced graphic designer
he told me just that he was talking
about image correction and layout terms
of layout for ads and so forth website
and who say you know at some point you
just gotta let it go you know you could
you can keep tweaking and tweaking and
tweaking and tweaking and it could go on
forever so at some point you just going
to accept where it is and let it go
because a lot of times your perceptions
about whether something is just right or
not is very emotional you could change
from day to day our tower so you got to
use the good enough principle meaning
you got to take the product to the point
where it's just good enough it looks pro
as sharp it gets the job done and just
get it out just get it out into the
marketplace it has what you'll find a
lot of times that what you perceive as
being great and so forth may not be
perceived as being great by the general
public and or things that you thought
weren't so great a lot of people think
are great I can think of many examples
in music where the artists thought that
this song would be the hit and turn out
to be this song it was the hit and in
fact I've heard more than one very big
big artist big musician say sum of
hating rather some of their most popular
songs literally I hate that song with it
how so well so you never don't so you
just got to get it to a two level of
professionalism if you will if you're
writing software a building website
you're designing design labels you just
got to get it out there so it's pretty
good it's at a professional level if you
will and let just let the chips fall let
the market decide whether or not it is
really good and brings the last point to
this vlog is that even if you have the
perfect label the perfect looking
website it doesn't really guarantee
whether or not your product or your
service will sell and the website and
lay
bow and the imagery and the message and
all this kind of stuff helps and can
drive it but at the end of the day the
product is not good or the market is not
ready for the product no matter how much
average put into marketing or tweaking
of the webui of the marketing message or
the videos it isn't it out at the end of
the day the product has to appeal to the
audience so again it's one of my
problems where I get caught up in a bit
of an obsessive I would get caught up in
code cleanliness so for instance when I
was actively writing a lot of Java back
in the day and I remember at one point I
was really getting into database design
and optimizations and then I was really
getting into the middle layer in terms
of writing Java code that was efficient
in terms of extracting the data from the
database and I would go into all kinds
of painful details about you know how
the best approach is depending on the
take the data set you were pulling out
and it got silly because at the end of
the day all this extra work that I was
doing would not actually impact anything
in any real way unless the volume got
sick huge that's what happens a lot of
times a lot of times with apps for most
people these days computers are so
powerful programming languages and AP is
and frameworks are so refining these
days relative to just 10 years ago that
all these elements combine the need for
code optimization for ninety-nine
percent of applications is not really
better because things are just so fast
so even if you have sloppy code it will
probably run pretty good you know it
will probably run pretty good so I'm not
saying right sloppy colored but I want
to get obsessed by it because you can
always go back to your code if the app
starts growing he said you get lucky and
your app starts really growing and
you're starting to see a performance hit
you can always go back and refactor
aspects of the codebase that are slowing
it down or you can just put more
hardware on it etc etc each other so
that's it pointless perfection don't get
stuff caught up in it I get it caught up
in it you see all these loggers on
YouTube and I do it they get caught up
with the sound or the video quality I
got to get this new camera because it's
just a little bit sharper and at the end
of the day as long as you get decent
video and pretty clear audio you're good
all right ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
