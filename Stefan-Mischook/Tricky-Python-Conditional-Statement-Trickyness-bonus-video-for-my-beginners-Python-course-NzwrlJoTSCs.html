from the suti web beginner's Python
course asking me a question so here's
one of the code challenges in the course
where we have to check to see well I'll
just read the question update the code
below so we are checking if the car
variable contains either BMW or Audi so
he put in this answer and at first
glance this may seem correct but it's
actually incorrect and let me
demonstrate I got my trusty ID Ely's so
I'm gonna create a car variable car
equals we'll call it bad car so we got
our bad car right so we type in card ID
he said yeah the car variable contains
bad car cool cool cool so now let's do
our little conditional or if statement
so your car is equal double equals
comparing you're checking inside values
the car is equal to be MW or Audi there
we go and now we're gonna say if it is
equal to BMW or Audi we say you got a
cool car but not as cool as the bad car
that's clear right when I enter this
you've done basic Python you know that
this should return false right because
we're checking to see if it if car
variable car variable contains BMW or
Audi now it contains bat car so when
this runs it shouldn't print out
anything you should only print out if
car contains BMW or Audi so let's just
hit enter and see what happens what what
this doesn't make any sense because
right now python said yeah car does
contain either BMW or Audi but we know
right here car doesn't contain BMW or
Audi car contains back car how can we
check we go car indeed it says back car
so why is this happening well first of
all we know that this code is wrong
what's happening is we're fooling
ourselves because this second or here
where we're checking this string of text
what Python is actually checking to see
if this is actually true or not and it's
a string attack so it's true it's kind
of a weird thing I won't get into the
details here but this is the wrong
syntax for a conditional if you're going
to check for two values the way you're
supposed to do or a car see what you got
to do it like this and then we go print
it is a bat mobile you about whatever
like that I hit enter
nothing prints why because it's not true
because car is a bad car so if we do
that again I just copy this and I'm
gonna go bad car yeah we enter this it
is a barb on that bar mobile anyway you
get the idea so that's an example of a
peculiar behavior I suppose at least
from a beginner's point of view it seems
kind of weird but remember this first
syntax will always return true because
this will always be considered true by
Python I won't get into the details you
want to get into the nerve details you
can which is take away from this is that
if you want to check for two values with
an if statement
there's we'll call this a conditional
you have to do it like this this will
always return true which means it will
screw up your code badly alright that's
it but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
