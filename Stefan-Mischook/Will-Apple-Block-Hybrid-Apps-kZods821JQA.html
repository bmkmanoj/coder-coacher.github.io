from being published to the App Store
I got a few comments in my last video
with regards to VAT they're saying that
they're gonna block Cordova apps and so
on and I asked for specific references
because I just don't believe that's
gonna happen it doesn't make any
business sense to me
Apple did not create the Swift
programming language because they wanted
to have a dominant programming language
they actually open source to Swift they
don't make any money on Swift they make
their money selling hardware that's what
they do they're a hardware company and
they know that without a steady stream
of quality apps on their hardware the
hardware goes nowhere so they wrote
Swift they created Swift so that they
would have an easy-to-use programming
language for for that hardware so
blocking hybrid apps has no advantage in
terms of the end goal that end goal is
having more apps on your App Store for
your hardware so that's reason number
one I don't see any advantage to Apple
by blocking third hybrid apps or perhaps
flutter if actually turns out to be
pretty good so another reason I don't
think they would do it because they
would piss off a lot of their partners
Adobe Microsoft Google they would all be
whacked hard if they did this because
Adobe's got PhoneGap Microsoft's because
Ameren Google of course got flutter and
they're also into the hybrid ecosystem
they put they've invested into that as
well again yes they're competitors but
they're also partners and you got to
look at this from a business point of
view what's the business advantage for
Apple to do this there is none because
the end goal is to just have more apps
on your platform besides that there are
lots and lots of companies who've now
developed their apps with hybrid
technology and it would throw a big
wrench in there right it would cause a
lot of problems for a lot of companies
and again it goes against the ultimate
goal that Apple has is to have more apps
on their platform and I know from people
who work at very huge corporations they
develop exclusively now almost
exclusively on on hybrid so I just don't
see why they want to piss these guys off
so I did some searching though my
reasoning aside my business reasoning
aside I started doing some searching and
I checked out this phone gap out for
rejection so I'm looking and we got some
results here and four months ago but
there's nothing on Apple like there's
nothing from Apple here if this is such
a big move that would effects that huge
corporations Apple would announce this
so apparently from my researching it
comes from this Twitter post here and
people are saying basically it's a spoof
email it's it's it's fake so I started
looking around some other sites well
Apple remove and bans Avron xamarin and
PhoneGap from the App Store and
apparently they offer the first tweet
this guy here JZ ferrino email with an
update saying that the email we saw
screenshots was spoofed so I don't know
the fact of the matter is that months
later Apple has not at least I can't
find any announcements this would be a
huge announcements because this would
put a big wrench into Adobe to put big
wrench into Microsoft mom a small wrench
of Microsoft it would take a shot at
Google yes they're all competitors but
they also work together on projects as
well I don't see it also I would hear
from my friend who works at one of the
largest software development companies
in the world multi billion and he tells
me that they do everything with hybrid
technology Cordova specifically so I
call BS on this I would be very
surprised if this was the case again
ultimately Apple has no motivation to do
this why would they possibly do this
when hybrid apps can perform very well
and apparently according to again
posting on the web apparently reviewers
at Apple recommend certain hybrid tools
again Apple's goal is not to promote
Swift Apple's goal is to have as many
developers being able to develop for
their platform and I want to clarify my
previous video where I said Swift is
going down
I didn't mean to say
or suggest that it was going to
disappear but I think that if flutter is
actually workable and lives up to the
expectations that will cause people to
want to use it versus going native
whether it be Swift for iOS or Java and
Kotlin for Android again as smartphones
become more and more powerful terms of
processor RAM and so forth the need for
native app power is diminished because
you just got such fast CPUs and people
say well Apple is not gonna let their
main language die again I'm not saying
they're gonna die but at the same time I
can give you examples of for example
Microsoft their main language VB who
uses VB anymore nobody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
