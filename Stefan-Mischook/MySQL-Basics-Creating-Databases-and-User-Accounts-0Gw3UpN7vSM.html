killer sights calm and killer University
calm in this video tutorial what I want
to do is show you how to set up a MySQL
database using the cPanel interface if
you don't use cPanel and your web
hosting company is who will decide
whether or not you have cPanel although
unfortunately most of us do you the
principles will work just as well or
work pretty much the same way with Plesk
and other hosting C control panels that
you may have so here we go so I've
logged in to a control panel for one of
the killer sites and so what you gotta
do is once you log in you scroll down
and you want to look for your databases
tab here the databases tab contains
everything you need to set up your MySQL
database so what I like to do is I like
to go right into the MySQL database
option here so we click through and as
you can see this environment here gives
you pretty much a breakdown of what your
particular hosting account has in terms
of databases there are no databases
associated with your account so let's
create one so I want to call it and
we'll call it products it seems to be a
common one now because this is cPanel
what it does is is that it appends to
your database name your account name
plus the underscore so in this case the
account name is killer J a yokel may
your account name will be whatever your
account name happens to be so what's
this hit create databases and now cPanel
in the background is creating the
database for us this typically is pretty
fast but I guess the killer site server
is
has a little bit of traffic now which
fortunately or unfortunately depending
how you want to look at it it's
happening more often but not so we'll
just wait to see so we see here that the
cPanel interface added the database
killer Jay underscore products right
here so let's go back and under our
databases you see that it's listed here
so we can delete the database and of
course it tells us how many megabytes
are applied to the database here's the
thing you have to now create a user to
associate with the database now if we
scroll down I'm gonna have to minimize
this window here let me scroll down you
see that there are no current users
that's why this is blank so we're gonna
have to create a user first right up
here mysql users add new users so we're
just gonna keep the user killer j-a
underscore killer j this is of course
again the account name you could give it
any name you like you know called Stefan
you know or whatever but you know I'll
call Stefan and now the password you can
set it to whatever you like so I'm just
gonna set it to something and the best
password of course contains letters and
numbers and use something like an
underscore or a dash at some point so if
your data if your password is for
instance mono fish
25
trout you might have a - in between fish
and 25 or maybe have fish - - five
underscore trout maybe a capital letter
here there why so that the database is
much harder to break into anyway and the
password generator here is something
that you can use or would actually
create a password for you and of course
right here it gives you the strength of
the password so it's it's a moderately
strong password these green checkmarks
are pretty obvious so let's just create
the user so now we have the user created
the user name is killer J a and the
score stephane with the password of my -
password - 30 - so you might want to
remember this you can you know I just
tend to cut cut and paste this copy and
paste this rather so we go back now if
you're asking yourself or saying to
yourself that this process seems a
little covering you know why not just
create the user and password at the same
time and the user and the database at
the same time etc I I tend to agree but
you understand the user account is not
necessarily associated with any
particular database users exist within
MySQL and they can be associated with
one or many databases they can be
removed they may change so users not
part of the database the database is a
separate thing
so you just then assign users to the
particular database you want to assign
them to so we do that finally add user
to database so you select your user from
the lists we only have one user we all
have one database but you know let's
create another database just to make the
point mo called members so we create the
database
we see here that we've created a new
database added the database killer J a
underscore member so let's go back so
here we have two databases the members
database and the products database and
we have only one user let's create
another user we'll call the user
products ok product so if we do this
user name cannot be longer than 7
characters so we make it 6 and we give
it the database password of P - 23 -
name P - 23 - name so you see the
password strength is very strong we like
that so let's create that user now this
thing keeps on popping up this is my web
browser saying hey you want to remember
the password I'll just keep saying no so
here we go the data the user killer J a
product underscore product has a
password Pete - 23 - name which is
pretty strong user password so let's go
back so we have two databases killer GA
and score members killer J and score
products they have little data in them
right size or Omega Bates and you see
now we have two users now I gave the
user name the name of product but it
doesn't matter whatever name I decide to
give it it does the name of the user
does not have to be the name of the
database it doesn't really matter so for
instance I'm gonna select the product
database instead of using the product
user account I'm just going to use
Stefan so we add user to product so much
this
see when you associate a user account
this with a database you have to tell
the database what this particular user
can do on your database
you see there's many different types of
things
they're called operations that you can
you can execute on a MySQL database any
database really so what you could do is
create a user that just is able to read
data from particular from a particular
database or even from a particular table
in the database or you could create
another user they can only add records
to a database but couldn't delete
records for instance so it's really all
these different types of privileges that
you can assign a user when this user is
interacting with a particular database
this is very useful for security reasons
you know maybe you know maybe you've got
a particular type of web app where you
want to be sure that when certain people
log in you can only view of a data and
not alter the data but generally
speaking when it comes to general
database interaction you want to create
a super user that's able to do
everything so would you just do instead
of having to select these individually I
just select all privileges so this
essentially will make killer J a
underscores to find this user when it
comes to working with this database
they'll be able to do everything so I'm
just going to say make changes
so tells us right here killer J a and
score Stephane was added to the database
killer J a underscore products and we
know that they got complete power so
there you go so now in our current
databases list it lists the database and
the user associated with that database
so if we click through it gives us some
basic details here nothing to get
excited about and here we go
it expands as I thought it was gonna do
and now we could go in there and change
some of the permissions if we wanted to
remove etc so I'm just going to go back
because we don't want to change anything
and let's actually associate a user with
this members database you know what I
think Stephin killer J and the score
Stephane is a pretty reliable guy
reliable users so we're going to assign
him to that database as well we'll
assign him to members so we go add but
this guy I just want him to be able to
look at record and select them I don't
want to be able to lead I don't want him
to be able to insert the show view and
make changes
and there you go so I've had a killer
Jays the fan to the database killer
members we will member won't kill Jay a
members so as you can see here we've
added our member excuse me our users to
our database
this gives Stephon app what's give
excuse me
this gives qrj a products access to the
products database as well so Goldman had
and let's give this guy all privileges
make changes all right here's the usual
message or used to that by now
as you can see in our current databases
table killer products or killer JM Score
products now has two users you got
Stephane user and the product user so
I'm just not saying killer J a
underscore just a save time so you get
the idea that's how you create a
database with mysql at create users add
users change the permissions on the
database with regards to the user the
understand you can sign multiple users
are no users to a particular database so
it's pretty powerful stuff and this is
using cPanel although the principles are
of course a hundred percent the same
whether you cPanel Plesk
or any other interface that you can you
know that you have available to interact
with MySQL or any other relational
database of course minus QL is a type of
database a relational database and they
all work pretty much the same way
although there are nuances in
differences depending on the particular
database whether it be MySQL in terms of
how its configured by the amends or
whether you use sequel server or
whatever database that is out there
I hope you found this interesting it
certainly wasn't for me now I'm just
kidding at it's pretty cool all right
