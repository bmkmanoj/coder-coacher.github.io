sites calm and studio web.com so in this
quick video blog I'm gonna give you a
bit of a sneak peek at the new studio
web layout well here it is and all its
glory
this is nearly done it's not public yet
and you see it is one of those flexible
layout and adaptable the actual proper
term is responsive design so it it flows
looks pretty good and this becomes a
menu item and it's kind of cool now the
way we implemented this was using
Twitter bootstrap but it just makes your
life much much easier so let me show you
something in chrome which is kind of
cool we have an emulator built right in
so you can see how your site looks in
different devices so you go to these
this little panel here click on that and
what you want to select is the developer
tools tools developer tools and it will
pop up in the bottom here and you see
down here you got emulation so you can
select the device that you want to
emulate and so you can see your how your
site looks like in that so I'm just
gonna say iPhone 5
click emulate you may have to refresh
your page like this and that's it so you
can move around you go see it without
buttons too close together here and you
can pretty much see what your page is
going to look like in an iPhone 5 it's
kind of cool the menu button works it's
all good so there's many devices you can
select from yeah of course who's gonna
use a blackberry playbook but let's
check out something cool galaxy note 3
very popular these days so it's emulate
the note 3 again let's refresh so you
get a proper page and this how your
site's gonna look like on the note 3 but
better if you ask me is about the right
size so anyway there's a cool tool that
you can use sometimes you can receive it
back norm
you go into your developer tools select
the emulation and you can select which
device you want to see your site in if
you want to create one of these
responsive websites I always forget the
name Pam anyway if you want to select
create responsive website I would highly
highly recommend that you get into
Twitter bootstrap it'll make your life a
lot easier anyway that's about it I hope
you find this video useful and I hope
you find this new studio web layout
better-looking than the current one I'll
show you the current one the current
went to a couple years
it's an old Styles a few years old this
style so unresponsive kind of old-school
versus what we have here anyway that's
mMmmm that's pretty much it thanks for
watching bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
