killer sights calm and killer peach be
calm in this video I want to talk about
learning PHP and different versions of
PHP
this is the reason for this blog is
because of an email I got recently
somebody asked me about you know which
version of PHP do I cover in my videos
they were concerned about the fact that
PHP Stix is on the horizon etc you know
what's what's going on here here's the
situation as of August today August 23
or 25 PHP 5 is the version that you have
to use right now according to PHP dot
org it's version 5.3 eight so yes
PHP 6 is out an early versions but it's
not something I would be using now
because I would imagine
99% of servers out there supporting PHP
5 meaning a run PHP 5 PHP 6 it's still
not an official release as far as I know
so I would be looking at that with
regards the differences between PHP 4
and PHP 5 it comes down to just a few
thing that comes down to object oriented
PHP PHP 5 makes object oriented PHP real
object oriented code as opposed to PHP 4
which was kind of a hobbled version XML
processing was changed in PHP 5 and
approved and you have a new MySQL
extension MySQL I if you learn minded -
extension the traditional one the
differencing that eyes is really minimal
especially if you're learning doing the
basic stuff if you were to go from
learning MySQL the classic extensions in
PHP and then go to I you're not going to
have any difficulty with that it's just
better implemented
php5 there's some extra doodads I'm not
going to get into it if you're already
knowledgeable about PHP and you've you
understand the basics and so on you want
to sort of learn the differences and get
into some details a good book I would
recommend is an O'Reilly book although
it's loaded it's a few years old it's
upgraded to PHP five in contrast the
differences between PHP four and five
and you see what you know what's going
on there so that's a great book you know
it was published in all four so I'm sure
they have an updated version but again
if you're new to PHP you don't want to
and you don't have any programming
experience you probably don't want to go
with an O'Reilly book you can go to
killer PHP calm we have all kinds of
videos there are lots of free stuff
basic articles you can get going that
way and once you have some pretty good
knowledge we got no I don't want to push
my stuff too much and only hard selling
my own services and products but we have
quite an extensive library of training
videos on PHP and so on we get pretty
advanced as well but good publishers for
people already have knowledge in PHP is
all Riley and again if you're upgrading
this is a good book to upgrade to again
in terms of PHP 6 I wouldn't be spending
too much time on that right now because
I don't know when that's gonna be widely
adopted by the community probably a few
years from now so you know we're talking
on them to word this video of shooting
that in 2011 August so I wouldn't be
getting too crazy about that at the end
of the day really though except for some
you know specific things like global
VARs and the magic quotes thing I'm not
gonna get into that in this video really
between PHP four and five it's not so
huge the object-oriented stuff it's
interesting very important if you're
doing xml processing again you know I
can these are rare things the XML
processing is kind of rare and again if
you learn MySQL which classic extension
to get into the new libraries so my skew
oh I don't think you have too much of a
difficulty transitioning it's pretty
much the same thing that's about it so
learning PHP you don't have to worry
about PHP 6 right now look at PHP 5
although a lot of the basics in PHP
whether it be pH before or 5 or 6
although I haven't really looked at 6
too much so you know again it's not
prime time so I'm not too concerned I
wouldn't be too concerned about all that
so you should be you should be ok
I don't short video but you know that's
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
