be doing here is splitting up our flash
movie into many different sections while
we did that in our first introduction to
flash tutorial but all of the different
sections of the website were on one
timeline in one main flash movie well
this is potentially problematic it
wasn't really in the first example that
I showed you in the previous video and
that's simply because all of the
different sections of that video and of
that website were all exceptionally
light there was just some text
information in them and they all weighed
like you know two or three KS nothing
fancy at all however most flash projects
and most professional flash projects do
contain sections which are considerably
heavy in that case what we want to be
doing is not sticking everything into
one main flash movie if we did that now
for example let's say I had four
sections on my flash timeline if we're
jumping to the different sections what
we will start to realize is that if each
of those sections Wade 5k well not the
end of the world right the entire
website waste 20 k however what if each
of those sections Wade 100k 100k in and
of itself is not at the end of the world
either it still gives a relatively nice
download time although it's a little
heavier than I like to use but if we add
it up all of the sections of that flash
website on one timeline each of them
100k then your Flash movie weighs 400 k
that is way too long to have people
waiting to see your Flash content so one
of the ways that we can get around this
is only loading the sections we need
when we need them so first and foremost
what we're going to be doing is loading
in the master level and the master FLA
is going to be what's embedded on your
HTML file
and that will always from this point on
view refer to as level zero now level
zero never changes you never want to
load anything into level zero because
your level zero your master a fillet is
the only thing that loads on level zero
if you were to load something else on
level zero after the fact it would knock
master out but the master FLA is
designed to hold all of the action
script that we're going to be using for
all of the other flas as well so when we
load master on to level zero master then
controls all of the other SWFs so if i
needed to click on the author button i
would do so and it would then load the
author swf on top of level zero master
i'm going to be loading these things on
level five you could load it on level
one it doesn't matter and every time we
do so if I then click contact I'm going
to be replacing whatever was on level 5
with the new swf in this case contact so
I load something onto level 5 if I load
something else on to level 5 it
effectively bumps what was there before
out of the way and leaves me with the
new file so let's take a look at things
and see how in fact they work well as
you can see the first thing you should
be doing is navigating to the killer
sites starter folder which you
downloaded when you got this video
tutorial now once you've done that
you'll notice that I've prepared for you
all of the design for this website it's
got all of the different sections ready
for it in fact it also has the SWFs made
for it as well also it's got a folder
called VARs which is storing all of our
external txt files for our text for each
of those sections
contact killer sites and portfolio and
in fact there's also a Styles folder
which contains the Styles dot CSS style
sheet we are going to be controlling
this text with external style sheets as
well so at this point what we can now
recognize is that we have all at
different sections of our movie if we go
to flash I'll show you a little bit
about them here this is the master swf
you'll notice let me just shut this for
a second see a better idea of what it
looks like you'll notice that this is
your master level there's nothing else
on this level everything is in place the
only things that we do see here are the
background layer which internet it
Siddhant layer all these little boxes
and of course the logo that was here
then there is a layer for be text or
button text all of these buttons that we
have here are always going to be on the
level 0 could have put them on another
level but I'm keeping them on level 0 to
make things simple and they will be
controlling the loading of everything
else at the same time we've got an A for
ActionScript layer which has nothing on
it at the moment but we will be placing
stuff on that very soon so that's your
master level there's nothing else excuse
me that's here if I press control enter
you get a look at what it looks like and
notice these buttons are not in place or
they're not active at the moment right
nothing happens at this point it's it
it's it's just a dead blank movie it's
the starter also let's take a look at
some of the other ones notice that when
I'm in the preview mode control enter to
preview my swf you'll notice that this
movie is exactly the same size as the
master movie however the first 100
pixels have nothing on it well let's
explain why exactly that is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
