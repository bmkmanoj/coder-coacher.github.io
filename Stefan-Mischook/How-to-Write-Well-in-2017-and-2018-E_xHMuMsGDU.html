of a review on this book I had mentioned
it in another vlog and I said you should
read this book so somebody said can you
talk more about this book okay it's
called writing in bullets and
essentially it's a book that talks about
modern day writing the cut on the cover
the book it says emails memos reports
websites presentations it is basically a
way of writing in a concise and a dent
in a way that's easy for people to
consume I read it a long time ago I
bought this book in 2003 and actually
here's the list of things like I put out
for myself and I stay put it in this
when I just realized I had this in here
essentially it talks about modern day
concise writing because the idea of I
don't fits in this book because I've
read a few things particular my ideas
over the years but I can tell you
generally speaking because people are
bombarded with so much information
there's so much to read so much to watch
if you are presenting information to
people especially in a business context
you have to get to the point right away
and you have to break up complex topics
that you're discussing into manageable
chunks and what are ways you can do that
I'll give you one rule that I learned
from this book I'm pretty sure anyway
yes I did learn this from the book and
it's certainly very well if for instance
you're describing a list of things if
it's more than three things more than
two things actually so let's say I don't
know describing a list of features for a
web app that you're building our website
you need to discuss don't put that list
of items inside of a paragraph of text
it's too much what you should do is
break it out into a list a bulleted list
if there's no order of precedence
meaning something is not more important
than the other or a numbered list if
there's an order of presence something
has to be is more important than other
things so if you had I don't know
the broaching is a grocery list you hate
to pick up bad ass tomatoes mayonnaise
and blueberries you shouldn't put that
in a paragraph you should have like one
sentence that says please pick up these
items at the store : then you have your
bulleted list then your next line the
main point of this particular lesson is
that people don't like to read long
paragraphs they prefer short lists
people will scan pages very quickly so
keep that in mind that's just one of the
many many rules that they that he
teaches in this particular book highly
recommended so for instance and other
things that he does he talks about
replacing words that are he would
characterize I guess as as $10 words
with $1 words you want to keep it simple
and I do that in my courses all the time
I have in my normal conversation to use
more more advanced terminology viewer
like the word terminology if you're
teaching or communicating with a general
public instead of using the word
terminology say I use fancier words or
we use a specifically we use a lingo
that this language uses as opposed to
saying we use a very specific
terminology in feet I mean we you
simplify it so in this book he provides
a list of examples in that regard so for
instance he'll say replace quote a large
segment of this replace that with many
so don't say a large segment of you to
say many people right instead of saying
as a general rule you would condense
that and say generally speaking or just
generally right and then instead of
saying at this time you would say now
etc etc etc and what you find is that as
you learn to simplify your writing to
chunk it to break it down to simpler
chunks it's just going to be more
effective in communicating that the
point of this particular book so I don't
know if it's still in print I would
imagine it might be I bought this in
2003 and I don't ki I've given away to
the library
most books I've ever bought but this is
one of the few books of the Keaton it's
not that big is one of the three
important books that I read on writing
well and it has served me well and not
just my business but in other areas as
well I hope this is useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
