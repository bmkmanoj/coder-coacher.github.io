effectively we have to understand first
a couple of simple concepts I'd like to
introduce you at this time the concept
of data types there are three very
specific data types which you'll be
using most often and inside of flash and
when we discuss in just a little while a
little bit more about variables you'll
notice that will be declaring our
valuables as a specific data type so in
order to understand what I'm talking
about I'd ask you to open up your action
scripting window by pressing f9 going to
the window menu here or two if you have
it available on top of your properties
window just open it up right there the
first data type that I'll be addressing
is what we refer to as a string or a
string literal strings are literally
just strings of words which are
oftentimes as we'll see encompass
between two quotation marks whenever you
have a quotation mark flash will
highlight this specific color in my
color coding preferences I've used green
for Strings you probably have a blue
default either way as you can see any
time you put something in between
quotation marks you are in fact telling
flash that it is a string of words in
other words literally the value is what
is in between these quotation marks the
second data type that I introducing to
you at this point is very simply a
number data type and that is literally
any number so anytime you write a number
you'll notice that what happens is
there's no color coding associated with
it and that's because it's not a string
right it's not the word five it's the
number five so if we were to put these
in between quotations like this that is
no longer the number five it's a string
5 that's something we'd never want to do
whenever we're working with numbers
another data type
the third most important one is what we
refer to as the boolean data type
boolean data types are literally only
true or false so if you write the word
true or false as you can see here it's
color-coded blue because flash
recognizes it as a value for a boolean
true or false but also notice that it is
not in quotation marks if it was in
quotation marks then that would not be
the boolean value true it would be a
word true it would be the same thing as
my writing true to form as a string of
words in here well that's not enough
necessarily something we associate with
variables boolean variables especially
its either true or false on or off 0 or
1 so that's a little bit about the data
types what we're now going to do is talk
about variables and how we can use data
types now while all of these are valid
actionscript we don't really work with
actionscript in this particular fashion
so let's talk a little bit more about
variables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
