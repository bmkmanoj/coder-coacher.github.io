killer sites calm and killer PHP calm
and welcome to killer JavaScript 1 this
is a beginners video tutorial course on
JavaScript
as I said this course is designed for
total beginners so I'm assuming that
you've never seen JavaScript before and
more importantly I'm assuming that
you've never actually programmed in any
programming language before so when we
come across one of these concepts that
may trip up a few people will step aside
and we'll take a closer look at it
just to be sure that you're you're
pretty clear about it so we can move
forward
for this course you don't need to have a
terrible amount of web design knowledge
but what you do need to know is number
one basic HTML you should be comfortable
writing HTML code and you should also
know some CSS although in either case
you don't need to be a guru maniac nerd
master and each of them you just need to
have basic working knowledge of HTML and
CSS so that when we do our JavaScript
work you feel comfortable manipulating
the HTML and so on what the JavaScript
that's a little sneak peek there that's
a big part of what JavaScript does it
allows you to go in there and
dynamically on the fly change things in
your HTML and it's pretty cool
one thing about all my videos tutorials
and cured JavaScript one is no exception
is that I tend to really focus on
practical work as opposed to theoretical
so what does that mean well in the case
of JavaScript one my goal is to get into
your hands if you will an understanding
of JavaScript so that you can actually
use it in practical ways in your own
websites as quickly as possible
I'm not trying to make you in killer
JavaScript one into some sort of
JavaScript guru some maniac understands
the finer points and the nuances of the
language because really to have
practical working knowledge of
JavaScript you don't need to really get
that deep into it and for most of us out
there we will never need to get that
deep into it again the goal of this
course is to emphasize the practical so
what I try to do as much as possible is
to get you going with practical usable
JavaScript and JavaScript theory as
quickly as possible
in terms of a software you don't need
anything special to write JavaScript
code all you need is a your simple text
editor and you need the web browser of
course to run the code any web browser
will do because all the modern web
browsers supports JavaScript right out
of the box so what does that mean by
support it means it runs it so whether
you're using ie Firefox Safari Opera
they all work and use JavaScript pretty
much pretty much the same so it doesn't
really matter although in the long run I
recommend using Firefox especially on
the PC for your web designing because
when it comes to web browsers Firefox
has a lot of friendly features built
into it and has a lot of external
plugins that are free but make it very
useful for web designers and it does
have of course some extra JavaScript
tools which I may look at in this course
that will help you when you're writing
your JavaScript code that all said it's
not essential if you prefer to use IE 7
or safari or whatever it's up to you
personally in these tutorials were
probably going to be running everything
in Firefox
if you are a Dreamweaver or an
expression web user you can use that to
to write your JavaScript code it really
doesn't matter even if you're one of
these bare-bones guys in terms of your
HTML CSS you can use BBEdit
on the Mac or WordPad or notepad on
windows turn it again in terms of a
software you don't need anything complex
you just need something to edit you do
your code what you use for HTML and CSS
is fine and a your web browser of course
to close
traduction I want to talk about the
style of my presentation and the style
is something that's consistent
throughout my videos I won't give you
the long version I'm going to give you
the short version here essentially
everything that I do is based on three
principles be simple be practical and be
concise so what I'm talking about being
simple when I teach JavaScript 1 or PHP
or whatever when I teach JavaScript 1
you'll find that I use a very easygoing
language I do my best to avoid complex
and near terms on the occasion that I do
have to introduce some sort of new
technical term to you related to
JavaScript and there are a couple I take
my time and I make sure that that you
understand these things before we move
ahead so don't worry about that but my
bi tendency though is in all my videos
is to use a simpler language to try to
make this stuff as approachable as
possible the other principle is to be
practical and again I addressed this
earlier on where my go again is to as
quickly as possible get practical usable
JavaScript skills in your hands so that
you can apply them in your websites
right away I stay away from the stuff
that's not really used to often in
day-to-day JavaScript programming
and finally I try to be concise I I'm
not here to fill up hours of video my
point is to get the stuff in your hands
as quickly as possible because we all
got things to do and I'm gonna play
video games or go have a beer or
something so we don't want to be sitting
in front of video tutorials listening to
me for hours unnecessarily so you'll
find that I try to as quickly as
possible without being confusing of
course to get this javascript knowledge
in your head
so what can we do with JavaScript well
let's look at a couple of things
javascript is one of the common things
that you see JavaScript used for is a
form of validation let's go back on the
strainer or I put some form validation
routines here we go here's an old page
and killer site so here's a form now it
says it's looking for an email address
now when I click this I'll click the
join button you see this little pop-up
window this is called a JavaScript alert
box and there's a message please be sure
to enter a property email address so
that's JavaScript doing this javascript
is be able to I wrote the JavaScript us
to study this to make sure it was a
property email address to make sure it
matched and then when somebody clicks on
this the JavaScript fires off and we get
this error because I didn't put anything
in there that's a simple example so
we're gonna look at that how we can use
javascript to verify for information
another thing you can do with JavaScript
is dynamically reposition elements on
your page so you get these these nifty
dropdowns here this is all done with
JavaScript of course so we're gonna look
at stuff like this now this is very
simple stuff for instance this video
actually is actually embedded using
javascript and that's just a another
example names well this is flash of
course but this flash was invented using
javascript routines and finally i'm
going to show you JavaScript is is as
universal standard and so there's lots
of free JavaScript libraries out there
that you can use in your websites and
you can add a lot of power to your
websites without doing very much work
one of these free libraries something
called script Occulus now watch what
happens when I load this page what
you're going to see here is this pure
JavaScript let me just Center this so we
see it here
miss effect was done using JavaScript
which is kind of cool and so we can look
at different functionality that
frameworks like script tactics provides
for us for free so let's see there's a
demo down here now here's a demo so I
was like see this is JavaScript is
allowing us to do this drag and drop
type of thing or watch this it's going
to bounce back I think see this is all
JavaScript so it's kind of cool
stacking cedar transparency when I click
on it
so this is just some of the things that
you can do with javascript in script
Occulus it's just one of these
JavaScript packages that are free that
you can use to add all kinds of dynamic
cool functionality or site without too
much work
