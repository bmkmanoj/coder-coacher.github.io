our elements in place and we as I
mentioned we have our universal selector
the body and the rapper definition so
you can take a look at what they look
like you can even go to full code view
inside the style dot CSS and you can see
all of those three definitions I've also
added a couple of comments inside here
so you can keep track of what we're
doing and how it all works and now we're
back to the source code view and in the
split-screen mode alright so at this
point in time we can recognize that
we're going to need a header and three
specific columns I'll also include a
footer even though there's not going to
be anything in there at the moment if
ever you do need something in there you
can absolutely put something in there so
let's first and foremost define our
header now notice I'm going to hit the
tab key well first I'll press return
just to get a little bit of spacing
happening inside there and I'm going to
hit the tab key to indent all of these
other dibs that we're going to be
creating here and the only reason I'm
doing that is so that we can visualize
things a little bit easier when we're
looking in our code view so you could
just do the same thing that we did
before which was to actually either
write it out div ID and we'll call it
header or you could go to your insert
menus one more time and take note that's
where my cursor happens to be located
perfect and what I'm going to do is
insert a div tag now it's not a class
but rather we're going to use an ID and
I'm going to call it header now I could
stop right here and then just define my
own CSS but in cs4 adobe dreamweaver cs4
there's this new rule new CSS rule
button that we have here which i will
click that takes me directly to the new
CSS rule so as you can see it's an ID
and the name for this ID is pound symbol
header it's perfect it's going to be in
our external style sheet called style
dot CSS so let's click OK
now do we have to worry about
positioning with this element actually
not really because it's the first
element that appears inside of my
wrapper that's perfectly fine so it's
going to be right at the top by default
so I don't have to worry about
positioning things with regards to
relative or absolute positioning or
anything like that in fact all I really
want to be doing with this element is
defining the height and the width now I
said not to define the hyatt in the
wrapper but here the height for the
header will need to be defined and the
only reason for that is simply because
if we do not specify how high we want
this header the graphic that we're going
to be using as a background image will
not show up the way we want it to so 900
I don't even have to worry about because
it's going to stretch out to the actual
width of the wrapper which happens to be
900 but just you know to ensure the fact
that this is 900 I'm going to put in 100
pixels right here now the height you may
or may not remember the value for that
so I'm going to hit the tab key excuse
me command tab or alt tab on a PC and
I'm going to go back to where we were
now if you'll notice it's the top
section here that I want to be working
with so if I were to switch to my zoom
tool and you'll notice if i turn on my
rulers and guides command semicolon here
it is and you can see that I've got
about a hundred 30 pixels sort of
defined for this area here perfectly
fine let's go back to Dreamweaver and
we'll say a hundred and thirty pixels is
what we need for the height of this
value now if I were to apply that you
know we don't really see anything
because there's no definition inside
this code here that says div ID header
but that's okay at this point what I
also want to do is to go to the
background and here it's not so much the
background color that I'm concerned with
because the background color is the same
as the color that we have on the body so
I don't really have to define anything
here
it's the background image that we're
going to be using so I'm going to browse
to my images folder and check it out
remember we have something in here
called branding and if you were unsure
about the size of the object you can
also see that the dimensions are 8 40 x
130 and that brings me to another point
we had to find all of our other elements
as being nine hundred and that's because
my canvas was 900 exactly command 1 i'm
going to go back to zero but that's not
an accurate representation because if
you remember our slices now are sliced
with a little bit of extra space on the
sides that have been sort of eliminated
I don't really need all that extra space
so my wrapper then is going to be
actually the size of the elements that I
have here so nine hundred minus thirty
and another thirty nine hundred minus 60
which gives me a value of 840 so now I'm
going to go back to Dreamweaver and as
we can see because my branding not give
is going to be 8 40 I'm going to go back
to where it says box and instead of 900
I'm going to add a value of 840 we're
going to deal with the 900 a little bit
later on now if i go back to background
we can see that it says background image
and we've got the background image do i
want that image to repeat on the x and y
axis no so we're just going to say no
repeat and we don't have to worry about
positioning because it's going to be
positioned to the top left which is
exactly where I want it to be so I'm
going to click OK and at this point
insert div tag we're going to click OK
as well now a couple of things that
happen you may notice that you know when
you use the insert menu as i did
dreamweaver likes to put in a little bit
of you know space holder text a little
extra text in here i'm going to delete
that text because we don't really need
it and i'll hit refresh also while this
looks fine do take a note that the
wrapper is actually bigger than I want
to be I want the rapper to be exactly
the size as my header so I'm going to go
back to the CSS we can go back to rapper
and we're going to edit the rule we're
going to say look it's not exactly 900
it's 840 that we're dealing with I will
deal with the extra 30 pixels of space a
little bit later on so I'm going to
click apply you could see how everything
now is all nicely centered inside my
browser window if you save that file
command s or even if you just preview
for example in Firefox it'll ask you hey
you're going to have to save the index
page all right save the index page then
it says some files need to accurately
preview this page have been modified but
not save save them now what are they
talking about they're talking about that
external CSS stylesheet and as you can
see here there's an asterisk there
meaning it hasn't been saved yet so you
won't really see these changes take
place unless you save these as well so
we'll say yeah sure save the other
elements so look what we've got you've
got the image that we prepared inside a
photograph and it's centered on this
page and also check this out as i move
my browser window i can see that that
little trick of centering the rapper has
absolutely worked for us and we can see
that the object is centering now it's
usually not enough to just you know
preview in one browser you should also
preview in all the ones that you have
available so you can preview in safari
and you can see that that too is working
exactly the way it should if you were
working on a mac a pc excuse me and you
happen to have internet explorer also
installed then you should do that
incidentally let me make mention anybody
that is working on a mac absolutely no
problem creating websites on macintosh
computers but it's really a good idea to
have a pc at your disposal even if some
old crappy pc that you've got like from
5-6 years ago keep it around right if
for no other reason just to check what
to see excuse me just to check to see
what your website looks like inside of
something like Internet Explorer but
also to see what the vast majority
jority of the population who are on PC
are going to see when they view your
website so as you can see we've got the
header in place we've got the the
background image being used properly
inside of it we've also resized our
wrapper and our header to the
appropriate 840 which is the size we
need now what we're going to be doing in
the next video is setting up the three
columns that we'll need for all of our
information so let's do that in just
another second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
