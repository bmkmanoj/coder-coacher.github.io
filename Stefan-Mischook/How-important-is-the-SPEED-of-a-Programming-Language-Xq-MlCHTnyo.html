programming language when choosing which
programming language to build your app
in as you might guess it really depends
on the type of app that you are building
so for example if you were designing a
gaming engine that was gonna be used on
you know whether it be consoles or would
be used on home computers and you
probably want to write that in C C++
because this code C C++ code is the
fastest code as you're gonna get on the
other hand if you're building a web app
for you know some exploratory project or
for maybe firms for some small
medium-sized business then the speed of
the programming language is much less
important and what's more important is
the speed of development usually there
is a trade-off
meaning the faster at runtime languages
typically are slower in development so
runtime is basically how fast the code
actually runs when it's actually running
and development time is how long it
takes to develop something with a
particular language now this is this
isn't always the case so for example PHP
when it comes to writing web apps it's
much much faster at runtime than a
Python based web app or a ruby based a
web app PHP is super fast now compare
Ruby to Java or C sharp SPG asp.net
c-sharp or Java Java web development
I believe that Java and c-sharp are
still a little bit faster now I'm not
too sure because I haven't looked into
this in a long time
back in the day when I was actively
developing yes a Java was definitely
much faster than PHP at runtime once it
got once it got going initially with
Java based web apps there's this first
time that when somebody hits the app the
Java Virtual Machine which is basically
the Java app
Brens Java code it first has to sort of
process everything and get everything
going quickly to get everything compiled
rather and then it runs much much faster
than PHP now this is traditional PHP
with the recent release of PHP seven
it's far far far faster than PHP five so
PHP seven I've seen some reports saying
as much as fifty percent faster or takes
fifty percent less resources less CPU
less time to get the same job done so
that's pretty cool so comparing PHP
seven versus Java today on the web I
couldn't say haven't looked at it but
prior to PHP seven Java was definitely
faster at runtime and c-sharp asp.net
was faster I'm pretty sure as well
though that's been well here's the
difference though with Java web and
c-sharp asp.net web development it takes
a lot more work to get an app out versus
doing the same app in PHP it's just the
nature of the languages PHP was a
language developed specifically for web
app developments and in fact PHP is
originally a stand for a personal home
page in the old days we used to call
websites home pages that's how people
used to call in the early 90s any home
so PHP was designed specifically for web
app development so it's super easy to
get up and running and building apps
with PHP at runtime it's not quite as
fast as Java or C sharp asp.net as far
as I know and it's definitely though PHP
seven is definitely much faster than
Ruby or Python in web app development so
coming back to the original question how
important is speed of the programming
language when developing apps it depends
on the type of app so if you're
developing a gaming engine you don't
want to do in Python although you could
but you don't want to do in Python you
probably don't want to do in Java for
the most part
you probably want to do a heavy-duty
gaming engine as an example in C C++
because it's just a much faster language
at runtime the downside of programming
with C C++ is that it takes a lot more
work to get stuff done so you have to
pick and choose your language to do
situations so unless you're doing some
that's heavy-duty gaming or you're
building an engine for a core engine for
AI or something you'd probably want to
use a higher-level languages so C is
down here on top of that is like Java
Ruby Python and PHP in terms of a higher
level of the language the faster it is
develop in but the slower it is at
runtime so c plus plus is a lower level
language i mean lower mean closer to the
cpu i've discussed this in other videos
so choosing your language depends on the
type of work you want to do depends on
the that will affect whether or not you
need to use this language or not
language in terms of speed you see at
any time Java will say is faster than
PHP doing web apps but computers and
servers are so fast these days the speed
difference that you would see in Java
versus PHP is minuscule if you even see
it at all it just gets so fast at some
point you don't really see much of a
difference the speed difference oh it
comes in becomes noticeable rather when
you do some heavy-duty processing so
sometimes developers will develop the
big part of their app in a higher-level
language it's easier to develop and
sometimes it developed a higher level
parts and like PHP or Python or
something and then for a core components
but they need some real major speed the
develop those little components in a
much faster language so we actually did
that recently with my app where there's
all PHP but basically we had an old an
older arm framework or mature for object
relational mapping it's a layer of code
that talks to it databases anyway so we
had an old arm in our original system
and the old one was old kind of slow and
we had a new PHP based arm which is far
far faster
but we didn't want to gut the whole old
form out of the old system which has
been a huge job so what we did is we
implemented a new app using a new arm
and then we fed the results of that or
basically had the new app queried the
database and we send the results back to
the old app that we send results back in
JSON objects it's bypassing the old slow
arm being able to use allowing us to use
the brand-new fast tool the fast layer
of code and this way we're able to take
advantage of a brand new fast layer of
code or a framework of code rather and
without having to gut our whole
application so there's an example where
we use not too valiant not two languages
but two different frameworks to speed up
the original app so you can do that
across languages as well so there's no
reason that you couldn't take your
Python based app and use it to call
libraries that you've written in C or
C++ in fact Python makes that quite easy
so that's very common you would do that
type of thing again it's all very
project specific whether or not you need
to do that when you need to do that and
so for most people out there if you're
writing general-purpose apps and so
forth you could probably if you're doing
web apps most 99% of you could do your
web apps and in PHP Python or Ruby
whatever you want and it's only on rare
occasion now generally speaking you have
to be concerned about the speed of the
code of the language that you're using
when developing your apps because
computer just so fast these days so hope
that answers the question
meandered a little bit but yeah if you
have any questions if I do have an
answer if I know and what I know a while
I'll try to answer in one of these vlogs
