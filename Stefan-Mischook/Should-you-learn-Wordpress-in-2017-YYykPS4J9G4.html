learn WordPress in 2017 well it comes
down to a if you want to do the work
meaning you're interested in actually
working with WordPress and to depending
on the man in your area
the demand for WordPress developers so
let me just say given the market today
in 2017 the demand for WordPress
developer is probably very very high why
is that the case well thirty percent of
the world's websites approximately are
run on WordPress now if you focus in on
small businesses I bet you that
percentage is much higher so what I mean
by that is that the percentage of small
businesses who have their work who have
their websites built on WordPress is
probably very very high probably much
higher than 30 percent WordPress
development
I hate those about to say we're pressed
web development and I guess it is but
WordPress development is I'm going to
define what that isn't two seconds here
WordPress development is a great choice
for people want to get into freelance
work because there are so many small and
medium-sized businesses whose sites are
actually based on WordPress and this is
significant because as a small and
medium-sized businesses are going to be
the people who will hire of a freelance
developer one of the big advantages of
using WordPress as your primary platform
for website development and basic web
app development is that it's an
established platform and when you have
established platforms basically it's an
app that makes it easy for you to deploy
particular types of sites that WordPress
is good at information rich sites
because it's an established platform you
will be able to create an optimized
workflow meaning once you really get
your hands or your head wrapped around
how WordPress works and how WordPress
should be deployed and so
you will be able to create this
optimized workflow which will allow you
to make a lot more money for your time
as you get better and better and better
and better at it to get your head
wrapped around WordPress you have to
learn a few things first of all you have
to learn how to install and configure
WordPress those are the basics you
should understand the different ways you
secure WordPress good conventions in
terms of user levels and so forth the
basic operations of the app you should
also get into themes you should
understand how themes are installed
deployed and to take it to the highest
level you should understand how to
create themes in WordPress this is
probably the hardest part about working
with wordpress it's just understanding
the whole theme structure there's a very
particular structure to it
you should understand theme providers
you should know who the theme companies
are out there so let's say a client
comes to you and they want to put up
their small business website you should
understand all the theme options that
are out there free and paid so that you
can look at the project and say ok this
paid theme here from this provider would
be the best choice or this reef theme
here that we can build off of off of
would be a great choice all this plays
into your skills as it wordpress
developer so it's much more about
understanding code it's much more than
understanding the basic app it's
understanding the whole WordPress
ecosystem you understand the theme
providers you understand all the plug-in
providers you understand how to secure
WordPress how to set up WordPress
properly depending on the type of
business structure that the client comes
to you with these are all factored into
being a wordpress developer in addition
to that you have to understand basics of
coding of course now WordPress is
created with HTML CSS some JavaScript
and PHP so you have to be really
comfortable with your HTML and CSS you
should know at least the basics of
JavaScript and probably jQuery the
basics and you should know the basics of
PHP and something called crud operations
credits are basically using PHP to talk
to databases credit short for create
read update and delete these are the
basic commands that you can execute with
PHP against a database again you don't
have to be a master PHP developer or a
JavaScript developer you just have to
know your way around the basics because
we're press is created with these
languages and so I would say as a
wordpress developer you don't need to be
a full fledged app PHP app developer or
a full-fledged JavaScript app developer
you need to be the PHP code ER or
scripter a JavaScript coder or script er
what that means is that you're
comfortable using the languages but
you're not necessarily somebody that's
going to be building apps from scratch
with these languages knowing these four
languages HTML CSS JavaScript PHP will
really allow you to take full advantage
of WordPress as a platform so you can
deliver customizations to your clients
so the big advantage with WordPress in
2017 is that it is not considered a sexy
platform to work with a lot of
developers just don't like WordPress
because it's got its problems its
idiosyncrasies I think that's the right
word and because of that a lot of
developers is they don't want to work
with WordPress and that gives you a huge
opportunity because there's such a huge
demand since as I said before about 30%
of the world's websites are run on
WordPress and I bet you a very high
percentage of much higher percentage of
small businesses in the world are based
on WordPress so if you're one of those
WordPress professionals that have the
skills but I talked about the basic
coding skills HTML CSS JavaScript PHP
understanding how to build themes and
modify modify themes and WordPress
understanding and the ecosystem around
WordPress you understand the theme
providers free themes you understand the
plugins that are out there you
understand the security threats and how
to secure and set up WordPress this is
very poor
you know all this stuff if you have that
you bring back to the table and then
what you'll be able to do is create an
optimized workflow and an optimized
workflow allow you to get things dialed
at a hyper productive rate so that you'd
be much more competitive in the
marketplace and in the end you'll be
making a lot more money than you would
expect yeah so there's much more I could
talk about that but in this vlog I'm not
going to get into all the details here
so yes to conclude WordPress can be an
extremely valuable skill set to have if
hey you want to work before WordPress
because some people just don't want to
be especially if you want to be a
freelancer being a wordpress developer
or a wordpress professional will get you
in the door with so many small
businesses that are desperately looking
for WordPress professionals to do their
work it's a great platform to get into
in terms of the financial rewards and
some people out there they may not want
to become from scratch developers it's a
totally different game maybe they want
to develop a strong business a
consulting business based on WordPress
where you're dealing with many small and
medium sized companies who are
desperately looking for professional
WordPress developers and I tell you what
in terms of business you're much better
off to have ten small clients than two
big lines because having ten small
clients means that if you get into an
argument with one of the clients you can
fire the client and you have because you
know you have nine other clients that
you can lean on but if you only have one
or two big clients they'll know that
you're there are only one or two of your
clients and they'll know that they'll
have leverage over you so they're going
to try to push you around a bit so
having many small clients is a 10 times
better situation as a freelancer it's
like having it's like having a
diversified stock portfolio where if one
company goes down big deal you get nine
others so anyway that's it for now I
hope you found this log useful if you
like it you know do thumbs up you got
any questions feel free to ask
I do try as best I can to answer any
questions that people put in in the
comment section alright that's it for
now bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
