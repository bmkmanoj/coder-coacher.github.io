about two basic principles minimalism
encoding and life and business and open
being open to new ideas and practices
and the third is the importance of
concentrating on the basics so how did
this all come up well I was going
through my bookshelf this morning and in
my closet and I have tons and tons of
books and I've gotten rid of so many
books over the last few years because
when I moved whenever it was five six
years ago I had boxes and boxes and
boxes of books a lot of tech books a lot
of them programming books and biggest
part of the move was moving all these
books
it was all these little things these
little boxes but took up all the was the
hard work took up all the time not the
big piece of the furniture which was
kind of strange
ironic so when I started to do after
move stupidly was to was to start going
through those books and just getting rid
of them and this make sounds really
strange with it certain coding books
have a certain sentimental value to me
because they remind me of back in the
coding hey my coding heyday if you will
back in the 90s early 90s late 90s and
early 2000s I guess where I was really
elbow deep into code and that's where
ever you know cut my chops if you will I
really develop my skill sets then so
these books have a certain sentimental
value I know it sounds weirder coding
books but to give you background when I
got time we didn't have the great
material that we have now online so
books were essential to learning there
wasn't so many coding videos tutorials
back in the day I had some of the first
amongst the first programming courses
out there period back in you know
literally not late 90s mid 90s rather so
I've been doing this a while
and anyway so back in the day we would
buy books and I became a reviewer of
tech books because I was buying I was
calculating I was buying spending about
three to four thousand dollars a year on
coding and programming books I said wow
that's pretty good money to spend so I
started doing reviews for publishers
because my website so I'm getting am
getting you know two hundred fifty three
hundred thousand or more unique visitors
a month millions of pageviews I just I
would just email any publishers and set
a semi review copy and then read the
book and do review and I was reading
tons and tons back in the day a because
I thought it was interesting I had fun
with it and B I was an insomniac now I
used to box and in the process of boxing
I broke my nose or my nose got broken
two or three times and I had a deviated
septum and I couldn't breathe so I was
effectively insomniac through for my 20s
and into my late 30s and as a result of
being an insomniac
I could have fall asleep at night so I
would read tons I would read tons of
books I have literally read hundreds of
those programming books coding books
that could be three inches thick you'll
see him too much anymore by Bacchanalia
in the 90s and early 2000s that was the
norm big big books by Sam's and Riley of
course and all the major publishers so I
read hundreds of these books on all
types of different languages and coding
for me was a business as much as it was
a hobby for me an intellectual pursuit
so all that said and done today I went
through again my collection of books and
I just had to let them come here because
I was looking at book for published in
2004 2005 on JavaScript on Java you know
whatever pick a language ruby books so I
said you know what I gotta get rid of
these because
first of all I don't need them anymore a
second of all they're very dated so even
though there's a lot of good knowledge
and then there's also some bad knowledge
and even if it's 20% bad knowledge
meaning they're teaching in the books or
teaching or describing old libraries or
old ways of doing things that bad
knowledge can really screw people up so
see I used to give away books to the
people or give bringing to libraries but
these books are so dated I said you know
what even if they're 80% accurately 5
percent accurate throw them out so I
threw them out I have to tell you when
you get rid of stuff it's very freeing
mentally and it kind of reminds me when
you hear about certain CEOs of big
companies where they have a habit of
wearing the same clothes every day or
just had just two types of shirts or two
types of pads or something because
they're reducing decisions they're
reducing things to think about because
when you're running a business I can
tell you all you do is make decisions
all the time so the less things you have
to decide about you're making your life
a little easier the less things you have
floating around in your house or in your
office or in your code where it just
makes it just sort of relaxes you that's
why when you go on vacation where you
know much to do and you just relaxing
sitting around it's very relaxing I
think think because you just have less
options so it's just easier so what the
takeaway from this vlog is number one
you have to learn to let go of things
that are really not that important
strive for simplicity and everything
because when you surround yourself with
an uncluttered cluttered experience
around you less things less problems to
deal with
you'll find that things will get to see
easier your life will be much more
relaxed and it's just much more pleasant
that way
so I want to close with something though
that I spoken about other videos when it
comes directly to programming and
development learn to code I've always
been a big advocate of the basics
learning the basics because the basic
concepts of basic techniques don't
change
so if you
learn the basics of programming and
basics basics of object-oriented coding
this will hold true across all
programming languages the basics that
are good today will be good in ten years
from now I'm sure and so that's where
you concentrate your effort I found in
my coding career whenever I had
difficulties with I didn't understand a
chunk of code or something you know
besides poorly written cold but what I
always came down to I realized when I
was having difficult difficulty
understanding something was that there's
some hole there's a hole a gaping a gap
in my knowledge with regards to some
basic concepts or some basic technique
in in a language that's it so that's why
in my courses I always concentrate on
the basic concepts basic techniques and
once you have a super solid foundation
the rest is really easy because a lot of
the complex stuff mostly complex stuff
are just basic things later on top each
other like a hamburger so if that's the
key you got to learn those basics you're
going to concentrate on those basics if
you do that that's going to serve you a
long term all right that's it for this
