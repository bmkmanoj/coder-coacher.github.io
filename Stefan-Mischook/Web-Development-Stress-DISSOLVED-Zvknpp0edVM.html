angle I don't know if I'm gonna do this
for the vlog or not where I just filmed
but the main point of the vlog is to use
this camera excuse me to use this mic
because this mic is gonna have a higher
quality sound a richer sound so I'm just
gonna answer some questions to recently
put to me on the youtubes and we'll see
how it goes from there
so yeah Steph can you give me some tips
on how to use libraries to solve
problems are really struggling with it
for example if I want to make a certain
app how should I use the library to
solve my problem well I'm talking about
libraries I'm talking about it could be
a framework like an MVC framework
something like a lair eval an MVC
framework is just a framework it's a
bunch of code that basically gives you
the basic structure of 99% of web apps
out there so you learn this framework we
can call it a library it's technically
not a library but it's a framework a
framework is like a very big library
with all kinds of other libraries in it
again I'm trying to use non nerd words
here to explain it anyway what you got
to do is you got to learn your basics
your HTML CSS your JavaScript and
whatever server language you want to use
you could use PHP if you're doing
freelance signals back from my
recommendation if your going to be doing
another thing you could use is
JavaScript and node J s nodejs is an
engine you have to go look it up you
just do a quick tutorial once you do
your basics then you can explore
different avenues if you know your
basics then you're gonna have a better
idea what I mean by library another
library is jQuery which is used quite a
bit although it's use is diminishing in
terms of active views again this is
stuff that you understand much more
readily if you do a basic course on web
development and basic coding and
programming what it is is that once you
do your basics you're gonna have a
better understanding of what's out there
and then you're going to be able to
choose which libraries which frameworks
you want to use depending on the type of
work that you want to do so for instance
if you decide you
be doing PHP based apps from scratch
you're probably gonna want to learn
laravel these days if you decide that
you want to do Python based web apps
you're probably gonna be getting into
Python and Python django django is this
big framework which is like a very big
library again it makes it easy for you
to to build web apps with Python etc etc
now whether you use Python or PHP
depends on a whole bunch of different
factors which I've discussed enough of
logs but you get the idea let's say you
decide you know your HTML your CSS your
JavaScript you did a bit of server-side
programming with my stuff and then you
decide to get into react GS cuz you want
to do some react sceptile react is the
library so you would go choose react you
sort of dabble in it my strategy is that
I teach people is that you learn your
basics your solid foundational languages
and and technologies and then from there
you just get aware of the basic
libraries and frameworks that are out
there today just so you understand when
they are used and why they are used
superficial and then you do the same as
the equivalent of the hello world with
each of these libraries or at least a
couple of them you don't want to spend
all your time trying to learn every
single library everybody tells you that
I learn because you you'll never spend
time working it's learning your basics
then start doing some projects and just
become somewhat familiar with the
different libraries out there VSA is a
popular one to react yes if you're gonna
do mobile apps with web stack you're
gonna do react native you might want to
learn an MVC framework like laravel for
PHP or Django if you don't do Python you
want to learn anyway you can pick it
there's so many out there and I think I
might do a vlog on top 5 frameworks or
top 5 libraries I would learn so in the
react would be one of them that's for
sure at least the basics of jQuery I
would learn that although I said as I
said jQuery in terms of active use it's
kind of fade
I get that sense in terms of CSS
libraries I would probably go with
bootstrap if you want to sort of learn
one bootstrap three maybe then I would
get into what see let's see
in terms of JavaScript libraries there's
you know reactive big one huge AAS is
very good apparently for just doing
charts and grass real-time graphs and
charts we're actually going to be using
View j/s in our city web for release so
again the key is not to try to learn
every single library in the world the
key is to try to just understand what's
out there and then when you come across
a project where you may need a library
you may go oh you would be good right
here oh react would be good here here oh
you know etc then you just learn it at
that moment like I tell people I've been
telling people for years the the
software developer the professional
software software developer learned on a
need-to-know basis on a need-to-know
basis because it's literally impossible
for you to remember and to learn
everything all at once hello can you
give me a good sources to learn about
JSON and Ajax well if you know your
Basics in HTML CSS and JavaScript then I
would just go to w3c schools they got
JSON Ajax like quick dirty tutorials w3c
schools is a good place to go
once you know your basics well once you
know your foundations
once you know your foundations then you
can go right there and get a quick
boom-boom-boom overview and learn all
kinds of different things from JSON ajax
to advanced CSS to bootstrap etc they're
pretty good good a good site but again
you have to know your basics first once
you've got that and everything else
comes pretty easily Alexandria I hope
you can answer my question on your
podcasts about the levels of stress in
web development I'm very curious about
that factor hmm levels of stress what
typically happens rather in the web
development game is that
everything has to be done yesterday
that's the usual thing everybody's
rushing to get the project out as
quickly as possible so the best web
development companies or freelancers
they learn to manage their time and
manage the expectation the clients more
effectively and that has to do a lot of
times with controlling something called
feature creep because what you're going
to see as the project develops first you
set your specifications for a particular
web app or any type of app and then what
happens in you have to document that
really well because if you don't what
you're gonna have is clients deciding
that they're geniuses halfway through
the process it again we have it to visca
we have it do this can we have it do
that can we have it to do this and the
problem with that is going to increase
increase the time that it takes to do
things and if you don't make that clear
to them they're gonna be getting pissed
off at you if you know if you said
you're gonna deliver by March 1st but
they've added a whole bunch of new
features and you're not able to deliver
until the end of March okay you said
March 1st and you have to remind them
then you will have to remind them hey
you know you had a diss on this and
there goes I didn't say you have to
really manage your clients well so
that's the first level of reducing
stress in terms of the web development
game if you're a freelancer a big thing
you have to do to reduce stress because
in the freelance world there's a lot of
ups and downs we tons of work tons of
where tons of work so much more you
don't do with it now then you're in a
drought oh boy now okay here comes again
it's very rare that it's linear it's
it's considered it's very now as you
develop more and more clients as you do
have good workflows as you've learned
how to manage clients properly you can
even this out so it's not like this tons
of work no work times of work now it's
more like okay so you have to learn to
develop workflows client management
skills you also have to put away the fu
money the emergency money the money that
allows you to live comfortably sleep
well at night
I recommend minimum six months of
few money this is money but separate
from long-term savings or investment
money this is money strictly for paying
your bills in the case of emergency now
I keep a two years good two years in a
separate bank account that I never touch
and people say you know I've lost a lot
you know I have the interest rates I'm
getting on it's terrible but it allows
me to sleep well at night because I know
that if everything what the hell I have
at least two years of cash on hand
this is apart from long-term savings
retirement savings this is apart from
funds for vacation or whatnot I know
it's hard to get there at first but the
fu money will help a lot with reducing
stress levels so in a nutshell and off
the top of my head to answer Alexandra's
question how do you reduce stress levels
or howlers or stress how are stress
levels in blood development a big part
of it comes from not meeting deadlines a
big part of it is not controlling client
expectations so you have to do that you
have to set it up so you have enough
time to do things and what are the
tricks when you're bidding on projects
especially in the early stages you have
to multiply whatever your calculation is
by two point four so if you think it's
gonna take ten hours it might take you
24 hours to complete the project now as
you become more experienced in bidding
on projects you'll be able to judge this
more accurately and in fact you get very
accurate and I talked about how to do
that in time but being able to judge how
long it will take to do projects it's
part of the process and so setting an
expectation of delivery dates and being
able to judge your time so that you're
not working 50 hours when you're only
making 30 this is all part of the
process and this is all something I talk
about I've talked about how the vlogs in
terms of how to manage this so your
stress levels and web development have a
lot to do with how you manage your
client how you manage
your finances so you're never in dire
situation and in terms of managing your
budgeted order a lot of time on a
particular project and I hope that helps
this is the very first test of this type
of setup it's probably not going to be
the final way I'm going to do this but
yeah we'll see how it goes so that's it
for now
that's a nice boat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
