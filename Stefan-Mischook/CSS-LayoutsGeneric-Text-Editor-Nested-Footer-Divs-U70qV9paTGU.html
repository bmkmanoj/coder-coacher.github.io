happening for our left column that we
see over here our right column which
contains not only the main information
but also two nested dibs nested left and
right and what I had mentioned in the
last video is that we were going to
attempt to put in let's say about four
different divs down in our footer area
and we'll talk a little bit about you
know what happens in that situation and
how we can make it work so let's go back
to your editor and you'll notice here in
the footer area I just have that
copyright information maybe we'll keep
that around and one of the ways i'm
going to say that will keep it around is
i'm just going to put in a HTML comment
in between the letters that we have here
so if i save that and we preview it in
our browser you'll notice just a second
here we go that I've just hidden it
because it's in a comment but maybe I'll
still use it so we'll think about that
in just a second so let's return back to
our footer div and what I want to do is
well perhaps we can take the same
information that we had in our left and
right floated elements up on the top I'm
just going to copy that just for time
purposes here and I'm going to paste it
in now let's make some changes first and
foremost I'm going to remove the float
right class because we're going to be
doing something that's a little bit
different with these and I'm going to
say instead of nested right div I'll
just change that to say nested footer
give now we'll probably get rid of like
maybe a sentence or two in here just to
keep that information relatively short
and you can see here what's as ends
nested right div i'm going to say ends
nested footer div now we had mentioned
now i just want to open up the ending of
the footer div you see it's really
useful for us to have this code in here
this little comment in here so it tells
me that look this div belongs to the
closing of the footer so what
I want to do at this point is after
we've made a few changes I'll copy this
information and we'll just place a few
nested divs in here so I'm just going to
do the same thing maybe another two
times so we'll come in here and let me
just get that working properly and we'll
paste in four different dibs alright so
let's save this that's previewed in our
browser and let's see what kind of
damage we've done so far I'll actually
hold on a second I've gone to the wrong
website there you go all right well a
couple of things first and foremost that
I do notice if you remember we had
already placed inside that footer some
padding and as you can see it's moved
this thing too far away now we still
have some of the left and right padding
on our paragraphs that we had inherited
from the top paragraphs over here and
that's okay I don't mind that but I want
to get rid of the padding that we had on
the footer because look I want things to
line up really nicely so that my text
should be around here about 20 pixels
away so let's go into our CSS styles and
here where the padding for the footer
was set to 20 I'm going to remove that
we're going to save this and we're going
to go back to Safari and notice that's
great if you were to follow the line
right along here you would see that it
matches up just perfectly and that's
exactly what I want to do perfect and
it's a little close to the edge but
we'll deal with that once we get a
little bit deeper into our plans okay so
we've got four of these nested elements
inside here but what we want to be doing
is floating these things so that we will
have them next to each other and in
order to do that we're also going to
have to determine a specific size so let
me try one thing in particular what we
could do is to go inside of our CSS and
if I were to just put in a little bit of
information in here for footer but will
say look there's a bunch of
dibs in footer so let's see if we can't
try and address all of those divs all at
the same time and what we would need to
do is to say look I want all of these
things to float on the left-hand side
first and foremost and will also come in
here and say and I want to give them all
a width some kind of wit that can work
for us now if we were to divide 960 x
for x right we would end up with a
number that would kind of be uneven and
I'm really all about trying to keep
things even as well now just to show you
if I did want to come in here and I just
turn on my computer here and I'm sorry
this is the calculator i should say
rather and if i were to say you know 960
/ 4 would give me a nice 240 so let's
come in here and say okay well what does
240 pixels give me so i'll just do this
will command s we'll save that and we'll
preview this in our browser there we go
and when we pit preview a couple of
things have happened and for the most
part I'm pretty pleased with the results
right we have even information that's
been split up in here but the one thing
oh actually there's two things that are
kind of a little bit off first and
foremost you may notice that the color
that was being given to us by the
wrapper seems to have disappeared and
it's the same thing that happened to us
when we have the footer in here it sort
of collapses the elements right so
because these things are all floating
inside there we will need to do a little
something a little trick that will help
us to bring back what's happening inside
of our wrapper and that trick being
exactly what we had done with the footer
before which was when you have something
above an element that is floating you're
going to have to use clear both so we
made that work for these two columns
because the footer was clearing both of
them but we don't have something
underneath this one I could put
something in there and tell it to clear
like a div or something like that
usually sometimes all you really need is
like something as simple as a beat our
tag so let me do something first and
foremost let's go to our editor and what
I want to do is we're going to create a
very customized class and I'm just going
to call this the clearing class and what
is the clearing class going to do well
we want it to as you might imagine clear
both and don't forget to close that so
we have this class in here that's still
not going to help us until we actually
go into our source code and you can see
here this is the nested footer div but
this is the end of the footer I'm just
going to put something in here it could
be a div could be anything really but
I'm just going to put in a br tag which
stands for a line break just one line
break but to that line break I'm going
to include the class that we just
created called clearing and in order to
close this will put a space than a
forward slash and just close it like
that so if we were to save this and the
CSS should be saved as well and then we
come in here ah voila just beautiful we
have all of our elements in place and
everything's looking pretty much the way
I wanted it to look okay a couple of
other things we can do at this
particular point in time you might be
happy with this that's perfectly fine
there's really nothing wrong with that
and all we'd really need to do is to
maybe make these you know h3's be the
same purple color that we're using over
here just to keep things consistent but
there's also something else we could do
first of all let's do this I'm not
really crazy about the amount of space
that I have on the top as well as at the
bottom of these divs so let's go back to
our CSS and will say hey remember those
floating gives yeah what about them well
let's put a little bit of padding
perhaps on the top and bottom we
shouldn't have to worry about any of the
width sizes quite simply because padding
on the top and padding on the bottom is
not going to affect the width it would
only affect the height but we don't have
a height value here so if I were to say
padding on top something like well 20
pics is a bit much but why not let's
just do it to keep things consistent and
padding on the bottom is going to be
same thing will say 20 pixels and if I
save this and then we go back into our
browser and take a look at that looks
like as you can see it's got padding top
and bottom but you know what I'm looking
at that and I'm finding this a little
bit much I think I'd prefer to just work
with a padding of 10 top and bottom
instead so I'm going to come in here and
we're going to just quickly change this
value and i'll save that go back to our
browser and we preview that and that
looks good nice and easy easy to work
with easy to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
