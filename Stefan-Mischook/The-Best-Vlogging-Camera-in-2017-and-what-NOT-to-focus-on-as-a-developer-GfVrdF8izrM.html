camera so you can see myself and on
greene avenue and west about my voice is
i say ninety five percent five ninety
percent i still have to rest it and I
dodged a bullet well I didn't buy I
didn't buy that super expensive camera
that would have been stupid all super
expensive grind and this big cannon a TD
dlsr which is a very good camera I'm for
a guy like me is doing solo video work
that's what you want any camera you both
you want three things specifically you
want super fast and accurate auto focus
there's only two manufacturers that
could provide that in a camera that's
canon and sony you also want a flip
screen so you can see yourself so you
can see yourself as your target into the
camera as i am here with this cell phone
and you also want ideally an ability to
attach an external microphone so the
only high-end camera that i know of
Walsman a mid-level is a cannon Ed Gein
you can all three you can do all three
you can plug in a bike sir Mike because
the bikes that are built into the camera
is typically suck in fact this cell
phone is a much better internal
microphone than most cameras I guess it
kind of makes sense this instance it's a
phone anyway you have to have the flip
screen so you can see yourself and you
got to have that super solid auto focus
so that's the three things at the Canon
EDD provides that's if you're doing what
I'm doing here solo shooting where I
don't have a camera man I'm not shooting
other people to free myself talking to
the camera so the other camera i was
looking at bias because so many RX 105
and it surely will have slightly at
least better picture than this in
certain lighting because it conditions
but the problem was it didn't have the
ability to plug in an external mic and a
decent sound would probably be good
enough for vlogs but sound is crucial
as more important video quality at the
end of the day and with this camera
provides here this pixel I'm able to
plug in an external mic which are going
to get they taken a few days by
expansions like 20 bucks and it should
really confuse a sound quality when I'm
driving around stuff and this brings me
to the point of this vlog when you get
into something you got to be careful
tonight to get caught up in the tools
I'm do theater at Bendel's with the
cameras and the mics and I thought I
spent so much money on Mike's you have
no idea I have Mitchell II maybe four
thousand dollars worth of Mike's fact of
the matter is all I really needed was
one pro mic through my video courses any
unless it does the point of this vlog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
