you're into code this is not going to be
a video for you don't want to have a
civil coming out pretty soon anyway
freelancers aspiring freelancers here is
a couple freelancer tips that you should
write down because it's going to have a
tremendous impact on you long term
number one when you're a freelancer you
never know when the next paycheck is
going to come that is for sure
especially in the early days so you have
to keep in mind the cash flow
unlike working for somebody is
inconsistent so you don't know what an X
check is coming in so what you have to
do you have to be extremely mindful of
the money that you save you have to be
on top of that so you have to make
saving money every month a religion a
religion especially once you get going
don't make the mistake that so many
people make of living beyond their means
meaning beyond what they earn every
month so they keep on getting into more
and more debt even it's $100 more every
month and you earn you're going to be in
a world of pain down the road and forget
about living beyond your means you
should live actually way below your
means way below your means as a
freelancer you have to be much more
careful about your money because it's
inconsistent in terms of getting
contracts and so you have to be on top
of it like a hawk you have to manage it
and one of the most important factors in
determining the success of a new
business or freelancer etc etc is your
ability to manage your money that's huge
so what you got to do is you got to get
into the habit like religion you have to
start saving every single month and
express it in terms of a percentage so
what I mean by that
so to say I'm going to save 100 bucks a
month or 500 a month or thousand month
whatever it is say I'm going to save 10%
a month I'm going to save 50% of months
that's what you're doing well or 12
cinema etc no matter what you have to
make saving money every month but you
want to start get going the priority in
terms of your business
certainly you should need to get a new
car no you can see that 10% every month
are you going to buy a new TV no if you
can't see that 10% forget the new TV
saving that money and you put that money
that you're saving every month into two
places your Fu stash which I talked
about in other videos and your
retirement savings
now this habit I'm talking about it's
going to pay you huge down the road it's
going to give you a financial freedom
within a short period of time it's going
to relieve a lot of pressure and a lot
of stress on your life when you know you
have a pile of cash there to pay your
bills you have to worry and most
importantly when you have this habit of
every month you have to save with some
exceptions which I'll get into and so
another course under the video for
instance if you're doing some major
investments or something but beyond that
in terms of your cash flow coming in you
have to save every month get into the
habit it becomes religion so that in 10
years I know may seem like forever five
years ten years twenty years thirty
years you don't want to wake up like so
many people I've met several where
they're your late 40s early 50s and they
never saved enter in a big trouble
you're in their big trouble because I am
saved all those years and save those
you're save save save save saving will
give you freedom of elbow to help with
your freedom lots of stress will be
removed so if you take anything from all
my videos this particular lesson is one
you should really take to heart you do
that you're going to be way ahead of the
game
way ahead of
most people that's it for now bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
