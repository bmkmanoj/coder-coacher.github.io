this late-night vlog I'm gonna go over
the business battle plan now the
business battle plan is a new course
it's also kind of a mentoring forum
where I'm gonna teach you everything I
wish I knew when I started my first
business when I was 18 so that's like
eight hundred thousand years ago that's
an old joke along use it again so the
course segments what I'm teaching into
three basic components or the three
pillars and the first one is the core
business skills pretty self-explanatory
the next one is money management and
financial skills now this is huge I've
seen business courses out there and
books and they dance around the money
management skills if you will it's such
an important part of the business the
reason I've been able to do pretty good
over the years is because I manage my
money well so even on the down times I
was doing fine anyway we're gonna talk
about that we're gonna integrate that
into the context of this course finally
you have the psychological skills
I discovered a long time ago of my 20s
that entrepreneurs had a different
mindset than people who learn to
entrepreneurs you have a different world
view and this progresses over time as
you become more and more inexperienced
as you become more and more experienced
as a as a business owner or an
entrepreneur you start to develop that
that mindset and the more you develop
that the more quickly you get into that
mindset into a state that psychological
states gives me the quicker you're gonna
be a little able to identify
opportunities and it quicker you're
going to be able to identify problems
and so what are they they're gonna be
teaching in this course is some of these
psychological skills if you will so
video you got the core business skills
money management skills financial skills
and the psychological skills now if
you're wondering about the money
management skills and financial skills
to me it's pretty simple stuff but let
me tell you something
let me give you a couple of statistics
to sort of illustrate what I'm talking
about here
NBA players make a ton of money
eighty-five percent eighty eighty-five
percent of them go bankrupt within three
years of leaving the NBA 85 percent go
bankrupt within three years that's just
incredible the same thing with
professional football players eighty
eighty-five percent of them go bankrupt
within the first few years after
retirement and these are people who made
huge money and this has to do with just
terrible money management skills so you
need to develop that so even if you were
making a ton of money in your business
if you don't know how to manage money
you're gonna be in deep trouble so
that's why I include it in here that
being said the ball could of course
really is in the first pillar the first
area the core business skills so the way
I'm going to structure each of the
lessons is first they're going to be are
going to have a summary right at the top
of a lesson I say here's the point of
this lesson then I'm gonna get into the
detail of the lesson a lot of times as a
story because everything I'm teaching
you here is based on my experience and
number three when appropriate I will
give you an action plan steps that allow
you to basically put to work in the real
world the lesson the pointed lesson so
let me just go over a bunch of the
chapters very quickly just a quick
overview so you understand so number one
chapter one and to be honest with you
even though there's chapters the order
in which you watch the lessons or listen
to the lessons lesson is going to come
in a video and audio format by the way
process all kinds of notes in the
premium form see I'm releasing this in a
premium form so you play one fee then
there's a monthly fee after that it's
like buying me a beer once a month if
it's worth it for you in terms of your
career as an entrepreneur and so in the
forum we'll be posting the videos links
to the videos and links to the audio and
I will be detailing what's in the videos
as well
or Matt I might put up PDFs if people
want it and you could put questions to
me and so on it's kinda like a mentor in
terms of situation not just a typical
course anyhow so let's go over two
chapters which you can watch in any
order watch and listen to any order so
number one in Chapter one the categories
of business you're gonna find there's
four business categories I'll give you a
couple of selling your time selling
other people's time selling products and
selling IP that's intellectual property
so we're gonna get into each of these
categories I'm gonna cover the pros and
the cons of each and I've done all these
things by boy and I'll tell you what
I've learned over the years about these
different business categories and
depending on your personality type you
may want one or the other
and anyway in the in the course I'll get
into that chapter two the 10 business
ideas I figured I would present 10
different business ideas in different
sectors different fields and I will go
over the pros and cons of each the money
requirements for each the skills needed
and to get into that particular category
business and how hard it is to acquire
these skills the potential scale the
business what that means and how to get
started again the idea is to give you
some ideas not necessarily you're gonna
use any of these 10 ideas but it'll give
you an idea how it's like out there with
the different businesses type what the
different business types are and what
you can do with it next one
chapter 3 how to pick your business
there's a few things you got to consider
first and foremost believe it or not you
got to decide what kind of life you want
to leave live because different business
types require a different type of
commitment and in terms of your daily
life so we're gonna look at that as well
you also have to consider your talents
and you have to consider how much money
you got some businesses could be
start-up for a cheap some require a lot
of money so depending on your situation
I'm assuming for this course that you
got no money and you have no contacts
and that's how I started my business so
we're going to
from there next one finding your niche
that's chapter 4 chapter 5 how most rich
people get rich that's a very
interesting thing I looked that up a
long time ago what is the key to
becoming rich and financially well-off
we're gonna look at what most people do
not the unicorns like Bill Gates and the
Zuckerberg who you know they're the
unicorns or super rare it's not a good
idea to emulate the super rare or super
successful what you want to do is you
want to go after you want to look at
what most people do to get rigid and
learn from them anyway we'll get into
that chapter 6
bootstrap business versus raising money
pros and cons I'll talk about the
differences chapter 7 may be the most
important chapter Stef's top three
business truths hi yes somebody I
observed over the last 28 years of being
in business myself not just my own but
many of my friends and family so we'll
talk about that chapter 8 partners or no
partners pros and cons tax implications
legal implications psychological
implications of having partners or no
partners next one
working at home versus working at the
office hiring people to work for you
chapter 10 chapter 11 buy equipment for
your business a few things you gotta
consider chapter 12 developing business
workflows increasing profits reducing
headaches business workflows I talked
about this in my vlogs we're going to go
to greater death next chapter 13
long-term money management I talked
about one thing if you stash you could
look that up and YouTube next word how
to build clients how to get paid five
sections to that and then chapter 15 is
the psychology of entrepreneurs look at
the business we'll look at that issue
chapter 16 business myths popular
business myths so we're gonna get we're
gonna dispel and finally chapter 17
principles of phim that's kind of the
secret bonus chapter we'll won't get
into so here we go there you go this is
just an outline of what it's going to be
I'm gonna be delivering this in the
killer size form under a premium forum
because I'm gonna be releasing I'm not
sure very soon hopefully by the end of
this week maybe Saturday Sunday the
first few chapters it's gonna be audio
and video format and I'm just going to
build it up from there and based on
people's interaction what they share
with me I will be answering questions in
there I will be adding new videos so
it's not just a static static course
it's not just a course it's just sits
there and that's it it's going to be on
a live course so I'm gonna be responding
people to people and that's it
the business battle plan all right to
