look at selector types in CSS selectors
are basically the mechanism or the
mechanisms that allows you to select
aspects of your page many a times most
of the time these things are just tags
and so selectors allow you to select
tags in your page and so that you can
apply CSS styles to those tags and any
text or images of course within the
confines of the tag so in the situation
of a paragraph or a table tag etc so
we're going to look at the basic
selector types and we'll take it from
there
CSS has many selector types and with
each new specification of CSS or CSS one
two three and so on there are more and
more interesting selector types what I'm
going to do though for this video is
concentrate on the big ones the tag
selectors class selectors ID selectors
and I show you how to group selectors
together
tag selectors are the easiest you
basically put down the tag you want to
style you put your curly braces and you
had your various CSS rules and that's
pretty much it if we look at the page
this is the page pre CSS post CSS no big
deal
the second selector type I want to look
at is the class selector the class
selector basically allows you to create
a a user-defined CSS rule so i'll just
create a name so all classes start with
the period and i'll say i'll call it
bold so then i can go text text
transform i'll go uppercase and i'll go
font style normal and font size it man
see which one we want font variant i
guess yeah i'll hit both since it's
called bulb so now that we have this
particular class we can apply to any
element in our page so we could oh let's
make this one bowl here so i go here now
let's say dreamweaver really makes this
easy for us there you go so i applied
the class bowed to this particular
paragraph and when i refresh it's
actually this item right here so it made
it bold so there you go you can create
as many classes as you like a force and
allows you to specify individual
elements in the page to be styled in a
particular way whereas with tag
selectors when you select h3 or p or any
other tag and you give it a property
this rule will be applied to all the
tags in the page so if you say make your
h3s give them about this background car
all your h3s will have that background
color regardless of what you want but if
you want to specify that particular h3s
will have a certain background color
that's where you might create a class
that does that
the next type of selector is the ID
selector now ID is pretty much like a
class except the assumption is that
there's only one element in the entire
page an element probably being a tag
there's only one thing in the entire
page that's actually that will have that
ID other than that it's pretty much the
same except when you want an ID you can
see you would use the hash symbol as
your ID so it will main title make your
own font size and I want to make it 24
pixels and then I must say but this is
the main title here i'm going to say ID
again dreamweaver just makes it easy for
us likes a refresh stylist main title
there we go so even though you can
actually apply this ID role too many
different items on your page so you
could have ID on main title for P and
this one here the idea is in this
situation with IDs you only use it for
one item if you want to apply a
particular rule if you want to apply
font size 24 too many items what you
would be doing is creating a class and
then applying that class you're probably
asking me now what what's the point if
they both do the same thing it has a lot
to do with Dom scripting later on where
you would use IDs in your dog scripting
to target things and then change things
so it's a little loose and wild and that
it's up to you to make sure that you let
you do this properly but so that you
know so it's a refresh this page and
yeah there we go so we made it to us
font size bigger here you know what
let's just for the sake of there we go
now we know it works
a final selector type if you will wells
are such electrotype I look at grouping
selectors if we looked up here you saw
how we have a rule for a pee in a rule
for vh three there's an easier way to do
this we could group them together so we
can go I'm just going to say let's say
we want everything to have this font
color so let's put that here like this
and we could go all peas o.h ones all h2
oops h3 teach fours so let's just see if
we die anything here yeah so see we over
written this very good so you see how
I've applied one style rule too many
different selectors in this case tag
selectors very easily right here
let's change
little go like this we'll say our
headings well have a color of whatever
960 is and we're going to say it has a
border border as a border and we're
going to say it's thin it's a blue and
it's solid this is gonna look very ugly
but yeah we'll see we'll see what
happens here there we go so we have our
our blue border of course this has got
the it's aqua green color here and why
is that because it mayn't Otto no no
much because of yeah yeah it's cuz the
h3 so looking to change this well use
you don't we use a little inheritance
and we're going to say background color
I'm sneaking in something here even
though up here we said that the
background color for the h3 would be
this ugly green here I've overridden it
even though it's in a group selector
here I've overridden it down here with
white and that's why that turned white
house this make sense and that's because
of course the way the Cascade works top
to bottom right because this is stacked
below this thing this gets processed
lasso to override anything up here
as I said earlier very different
selector types but I haven't covered
here in CSS and it really comes down to
the specification in that certain
browsers will support well I'm talking
about specification is like you know
they came up with CSS and they came up
with CSS two and then css3 and at this
point in time there are a lot of
selector types five work in certain
browsers but don't work in others so I'm
just concentrating here on this main
selector type that you're going to be
using probably all the time there are
some others perhaps that will work in
most browsers but I find personally that
it's rare but I use them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
