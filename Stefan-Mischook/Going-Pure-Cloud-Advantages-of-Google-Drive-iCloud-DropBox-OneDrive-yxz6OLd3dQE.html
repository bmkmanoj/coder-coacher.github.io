going pure cloud so what am I talking
about I wanna talk about pure cloud I'm
talking about using cloud storage like I
got my notes again like Google Drive
Dropbox iCloud and there are several
others in case you don't know you might
not know cloud storage is basically
storing your files on some remote server
hosted by Google hosted by Apple hosted
by Dropbox hosted by Microsoft eccentric
cetera et cetera
and usually they'll give away a gig of
space for free and then you might have
to spend like two bucks a month again
like 60 or 100 gigs or whatever it is
yeah so at first I was uncomfortable
with this having my files and on their
systems on their servers I was
uncomfortable about this because I'm
kind of a an old-school computer guy but
if you think about it having your stuff
on the cloud is actually safer than
having them on your own hard disk why
because the chances of Google's cloud
going down and then losing your data or
Microsoft or Apple or Dropbox the chance
of any of these companies losing your
data is like 1 bazillion trillion to one
versus you having your hard drive fail
are you having you losing your your
backup drive or your computer crashing
it's like so much safer on the cloud so
much safer on the cloud and all these
cloud guys ORS everything's encrypted
and stuff and if you're uploading like
personal stuff that you don't want
necessary to public see you can encrypt
it of course your cell password protect
your PDAs whatever anyway point is cloud
computing I think is becoming more and
more prevalent
we've have been on terms of our websites
and our apps we've been moving off a
dedicated servers migrating into the
cloud we're almost all the way that
we're like 3/4 of the way there by
spring 2017 we should be pure cloud no
more physical servers because when you
have a physical server e of a single
point of failure if
CPU burns if that hard disk fails that
power supply fails that box is down it's
offline but if you use cloud-based
serving then you're in this virtualized
environments you don't have to worry
about that no single point of failure
again the chances of a cloud hosting
service there network going down are far
far less than their whole network going
down rather it's far far less and your
dedicated box going down your dedicated
machine going down but anyway off on a
tangent let's go back to cloud going
pure cloud in terms of your own
computing your own computers so let's
look at a few things we're gonna have
the pros and the cons so we the cons I
think is that you need big bandwidth
with your internet connection depending
on the file size if you're just moving
text files doing coding and so forth
then there's you know if you have just a
normal high speed internet connection
then you're fine you know it's like text
files are so small and you'll be able to
store tons information on a gig for free
on Google or Dropbox or iCloud etc and
the amount of bangle if it takes to move
text files over the web there's nothing
it's nothing now if you're like me and
you do a lot of video work where you
have big files then you're gonna need
some more bandwidth but again up here in
Canada we don't necessarily have the
best internet although it's pretty good
I'm gonna get for an extra five bucks a
month I'm gonna get ultra super fast
high speed mega internet with unlimited
uploads and downloads so that solves my
problems even what I'm doing video the
great thing about being on a cloud well
what was I'm gonna follow my list I
don't want to go off on a tangent here
so so with cloud computing you don't
have to worry about backups right
because there's a chance of Google going
down or like you know zero you don't
have to about losing your computer
imagine if you had all your important
files on your laptop and one day you
lose it or one day our cat spills you're
a wine on your lap
happened to me once spilled wine on my
laptop destroyed my laptop everything
was fried if you had data on there you
hadn't backed up but you forgot to back
it up that day what you always do then
you lose your data and that's that's
terrible but if you haven't always on
the cloud you never lose your data what
happens when you have your stuff on a
cloud you your computer you become
computer neutral I call you become a
computer neutral meaning I have multiple
computers right now I have three
computers three laptops and went well
two laptops and one hybrid
and I don't have to worry about whatever
laptop I'm on I can go to use a friend's
laptop it's got a login to my cloud
account and I get access my file is
there right no big deal so when your
stuff is on the cloud you're not bound
to a particular machine which is
fantastic writes sewing machines losing
machine thrashing machine getting new
machines machines beating computers is
so much easier right because you don't
have to transfer all these local files
amazing that's it so the options are
again there's many options the three big
ones that I know of Google Drive from
Google Dropbox and Dropbox iCloud which
you get with Apple and there are others
out there Microsoft has their own was it
one cloud or something like that
Microsoft is onedrive is looking up here
same type of deal huh it's all pretty
much the same so you might actually have
a cloud storage on each of them right
you can one gig here two gigs here one
gig here and you could probably set it
up to do some automated backups between
them I haven't looked into that but it's
a possibility there so there you go
there's a big for me anyway this mental
changes idea of always working with the
cloud drives as your primary drives
rather than your local computers and
doing local backups so I highly
recommend that you look into that
especially if you have good high-speed
internet and you don't have Battle of
consideration issues for the reasons I
just discussed because it's going to
give you a huge amount of freedom it's
the future of computing it's great
alright I hope you found this video
useful
