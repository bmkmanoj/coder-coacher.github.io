killer video store calm and here we go
killer sites calm this is me in this
video I want to go over a subject that I
just blogged about and that is the web
designers roadmap for 2011 so what this
is is basically an outline of skill sets
that a complete web professional you
know whether it be web designer web
programmer should work towards given
what the demands are today on the web so
let me just translate that into English
I've loaded up the outline right here
and yeah so let's just look at the list
so we have HTML CSS PHP basics
javascript jquery wordpress OPP HP html5
css3 iphone ipad development so this is
a list of the technologies and i'm sure
some of you are familiar with these
things in the order in which you need to
learn them i'm not saying that you need
to know all these things to be a web
designer or to be a web programmer all
saying is that in the order of priority
you need to learn these things and the
more you know the more chances you're
going to get work and the higher your
fees you'll be able to charge for your
time of course you see if you know HTML
and CSS very basics of course of any
site that's good you might be able to
get some jobs with that if you're a good
designer but you add a little bit of PHP
on top of that and I can tell you that
you're almost guaranteed to get
significantly more work and you'll start
entering into an area where you'll be
able to charge more for your time then
you spice that up a little JavaScript
you know all these things that we see
the sliders and so on so if I go to
I go to killer sites like this slider
here that we see this is all done with
javascript jquery so knowing that has
certain advantages so back to my outline
so Oh skip HTML CSS PHP basics again I'm
looking at this from the point of view
that you are a junior web designer or
web designer with some years of
experience but you've never programmed
before and all I'm suggesting here is
not that you become a PHP programmer
although there are certain advantages to
that all I'm suggesting was number three
here is that you learn at least the
basics of the PHP language so you can
get you so you can get around it so you
can work with it as you probably know
you know a lot of the common elements of
a modern web site are built with PHP
these days or some competing language
although PHP by far and away is the most
popular so what are we talking about
things I'm talking about things like
shopping carts e-commerce systems blog's
content management systems blogs like
wordpress content management systems
like joomla drupal etc many forms and
contact systems and social networking
systems these things are all built with
PHP and you're going to find more and
more of your clients or people you work
for and I'm going to need to implement
to put these type of things into
websites and if you don't know PHP it's
going to be real real pain in the butt
so to get I'm not saying you should have
the PHP skills to be able to build these
things from scratch but having certain
basic PHP skills will allow you to
install and work with these things and
modify these type of systems much much
more easily
working along with PHP many times is of
course javascript javascript is one of
these must learn web programming
language the javascript works in the web
browser where as PHP works on the server
if you don't understand that just go to
killer sites calm or a killer video
store calm and learn about the
differences essentially javascript is an
essential language you have to learn
today because so many things in today's
modern web site requires the use of
javascript you see JavaScript pal with
the help of packages like jQuery which I
listing point number five are used all
over the place these days to create all
kinds of fancy page widgets like the
slider showed you before in dynamic
menus and all kinds of other things that
you know countless things really in
effect in fact jQuery is replacing many
times flash where you would use flash
before with jquery and similar packages
like script oculus although jQuery is
the most popular flash is being replaced
just to summarize and just in case you
don't know jquery is age you have a
script library that's free that pre
packages if you will always type of all
these types of widgets and sliders and
so on so it's really really something
you should learn WordPress number six
wordpress wordpress is the most popular
blogging and content management system
out there it may not necessarily be the
best i can't comment on that in
comparison to Drupal and Joomla I've
used Drupal a little bit all I can say
is that if you got a big big site to
build build up then drupal might be a
better choice for you we use WordPress
extensively hot killer sites and on the
killer sites network because
because we just were used to WordPress
it has a lot of built-in functionality
and it has a huge community which
provides you with a lot of support the
point to take away about WordPress is
modern web design is that these days i
would suggest everybody pick a blogging
edge in like wordpress or or full CMS a
drupal or joomla and then base much if
not all of your web design work on these
platforms on these products why because
they're free and because they provide a
whole bunch of functionality for free
the days of building static websites are
becoming less meaning HTML only without
dynamic components without being
database driven and so on those days are
quickly fading so you might as well
learn one of these packages work crew
pal or juma and start basing all your
web design work on that because you'll
be able to go in there and be much more
competitive relative to people who don't
understand these things don't work with
these things every day simply because
you're gonna be able to provide much
more bang for the buck if you will point
number 700 PP HP now this is for people
who are not necessarily web designers
this is for people who want to take it
to the next step want to learn how to
actually build PHP based websites
application things that are a little bit
more complex than your typical you know
contact forms and so on the reason i
mention OPP HP is because object o P is
short for object-oriented programming
and object-oriented programming
programming is the modern style
programming it's used in many languages
including PHP Ruby Java JavaScript to
certain extent because javascript is
more of a prototypical language but
that's really getting to nerd details in
terms of you know most functionality in
terms of using javascript everyday its
object oriented the whole point of this
is that
object-oriented programming once you
learn in PHP or once you learn in Ruby
or Java you know object-oriented
programming and many of the systems i
mentioned before wordpress joomla drupal
to a certain extent if not totally
depending on the package our object
oriented based meaning they use
object-oriented structures so if you
understand the principles of
object-oriented programming you
understand how to work with it it's
going to make your life much easier
again this is getting into a level here
with Opie it is not terribly important
for web designers of what will be kind
of helpful this is more for people want
to get into the programming anything's i
yeah so let me just recap you very
quickly in terms of the list from one
through nine I would suggest that one to
six from HTML to WordPress these are
things that I would say all web designer
should learn and it looks pretty
daunting I would imagine but actually
it's not as difficult as you'd think as
you know HTML CSS what are more
challenging things to learn is actually
CSS even more challenging some respects
because of browser quirks and
inconsistencies PHP basics is actually
pretty easy especially go to killer PHP
com we make it stupid easy terms of you
know seven eight nine we'll get into
that will seven that's more in the
realms being a pure programmer let's get
into a number eight here html5 and css3
see this is the new version of these two
languages HTML CSS and I separated them
because what html5 and css3 brings to
the play is different from HTML and CSS
the current widely used versions of
these technologies and what I mean is
that they provide a lot of functionality
like HTML has video embed capabilities
and animation capabilities and so on
although I haven't looked at the
animation keep
I was told that so you know I'm not
confirming that css3 again all kinds of
capabilities it just makes it really
easy to do things a reason I separated
is because right now html5 and css3
cannot be used on your typical standard
web site of all this is quickly changing
and the reason you can't use on your
standard your typical web sites because
there's still quite a few people who are
using web browsers that don't understand
html5 and css3 but this is changing
quick because Google Microsoft Firefox
apple and are all pushing everybody to
adopt to use the latest and greatest
browsers which read all this this is the
future this is something that have to
learn and if you're developing sites or
little applications for ipads iphones or
android phones html5 and css3 they read
all these things and these are going to
be very important these being you know
the people using the pads and the phones
smartphones so it's going to be it's you
it's a huge market that's growing bigger
and bigger every day so you might as
well get into it whether or not your
programmer or just a web designer learn
it it's going to pay off dividends very
quickly if not right away finally is a
ipad and iphone development if you learn
html5 and css3 that will take you a long
way what you need to do as a web
designers just explore what you can do
what iPads and iPhones and just get
familiar with it so that if you get
approached in terms of developing a site
you make you know for vez and they will
add some extra functionality at least
you'd be familiar with your options
there we're going to get into this
extensively at killer sites in the near
future so I'm like I get into here I
just want to make a quick comment about
flash I've been a fan of flash since its
inception we're actually back in the day
I think he was nineteen ninety something
it was actually owned by another company
was called future splash
and it evolved into a very powerful
platform for developing all kinds of
things the problem is is what flash is
now dying and I think in large part
because of Apple you see Apple basically
does not allow flash to run on iPhones
or iPads and since there are hundreds of
millions of iphones and since ipad is
going to be it still is it is it's going
to be V dominant pad being used out
there I believe by the end of 2012
they're expecting somewhere in 100
million plus iPads being used they won't
run flash so if you want to reach this
very large segment of the web audience
you cannot you cannot you can't have
pages that rely on flash and now to add
on top of that with purple with packages
like jQuery JavaScript libraries like
jQuery and html5 and css3 it really
these technologies which are free and
open don't require plugins and the
browsers don't require the people
install special extra doodads into their
web browsers these tools jquery html5
sistership they replace much about all
of the functionality of the capability
that flash gave you so it's I would not
be investing in flash now that's all I'm
saying we've actually stopped any future
production of flash training videos
because we see about writing on the wall
I don't want to lead people down the
wrong path you know you're much better
off learning jquery html5 css3 pen you
would be flash as far as i can tell
going forward let me close off of a
couple of final comments again as i
mentioned before you don't need to learn
all these technologies to build a
website or to be a successful web
professional whether your web designer
or web programmer but there are certain
basic so for instance three points
number one if you if you just want to
build the site small site for yourself
or your own little bit
this knowing one and two basically
basically HTML and CSS it's probably
more than enough for you to sort of get
things going so you can create a simple
site at pages and images that kind of
stuff then you find if though you want
to become a web designer you should know
one through six HTML CSS PHP basic
JavaScript jQuery WordPress and I
explained why that was the case before
well if you want to be competitive you
know that's what you should do finally
if your web programmer you have to learn
of course all these things one through
eight and if you really want to take
advantage of what's hot now you want to
get to iPhone iPad development whether
that means understanding html5 and css3
and how that works with eyeball iPad
iPhone or if you want you to go real
crazy if your programmer get into
objective-c where you can really take
full advantage of the ipad iphone
hardware one thing I don't mention is
document of course is android android is
as a global platform as an audience it's
going to be it's already bigger than I
phone and iPad not a problem is is that
Android has several versions and they
don't play perfectly consistently across
the versions and across the device at
sea whereas Apple controls everything
they sell I they sold off the phone
hardware and the software and a pad
hardware has software everything is
consistent whereas apparently with the
Android which is a great operating
system it's not consistent so Android
3.12 might be different on 3.13 etc I'm
just ponies these numbers out of my you
know out of the air but you get the idea
so you gotta really consider that aspect
of it as well i joyed development is
going to be extremely important going
forward of course and again html5 and
css3 is a great cheap way to sort of get
into that cheap meaning easy to do
so you want to consider as well in terms
of developing applications for Android
and android-based tablets and phones I
believe the base language is Java so
that's a whole kettle of fish and so
yeah anyway they're you're gonna have to
sort of make a choice personally right
now you have to look at what i would
suggest in terms of choosing android
become an android expert or ipad iphone
expert you have to in terms of rented
code and so on i would look at what type
of sites or programs you're going to
want to build because you find that
certain groups of people may be more
attracted to Android versus people more
attracted to iPad so yeah we're
concentrating on ipad iphone simply
because education and apple go hand in
hand and since we're in the education
market that's what we are going to work
on I hope you found this podcast useful
and we shall talk very soon bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
