save this page Davis I'm going to call
it lesson 9 because it's it's going to
be less a night I'm trying to save the
pages for you as many as i can so you
can look at the source code just in case
you get lost as you're doing the course
so what we're going to do now is we're
going to simplify our code I was going
to get rid of these tag selectors for
now and so we're left with our ID
selector and our class selector and so
what do I want to talk about in the last
lesson I mentioned to you that you don't
want to repeat code in your pages
whether it be CSS code HTML code or in
programming JavaScript code whatever
language PHP Python code one of the
basic rules of coding is not to repeat
code so let me give you an example how
this works in CSS a little bit so for
instance you notice how we use the class
of super p on two different paragraph
tags right i'm here to super p CSS rules
that we use so let me just copy that now
if you remember back in the HTML course
i use the style attribute to apply CSS
two elements in the page i forget what
elements member elements and tags equal
to each other means the same thing now
remember you back in previous examples i
use style equals open quotes and then I
close quotes and here's of all our CSS
rules or CSS properties and the value
the property and the value anyway so
remember I did that now we could do that
here as well right now this works now
problem is though I've repeated code I
have the same exact CSS rules for both
paragraphs and so that's double the code
for no good reason so that means that if
I want to change it I have to go back to
two different spots lot of changes to
read have to go here I have to go here
and you know and so on so imagine you
had many paragraphs on many pages where
you put the style attribute on and you
put your CSS rules right on the tags
themselves it works but it creates a lot
of extra work for you and it leaves a
lot of openings for mistakes to be made
and bugs that come out I know it's hard
to understand maybe well how this would
happen but trust me less code is better
so how do you solve that well you go
back to using a class so since both
paragraphs are going to be exactly the
same we're going to have a font color of
red we're going to have a font size of
16 pixels it makes sense to create a
class for that so let me just turn this
to read up here
and I'm just going to remove this i'm
going to say class equals and i say
super p remember when you use your class
that should be on the tag class equals
open and close quotes of course when you
named your class that you create it up
here in the CSS you don't include the
period you don't include this that means
you don't do this that won't work you
have to go just name the class this
period here for a class and this number
sign for an ID this is only used inside
of your CSS code not in your HTML so I
got the class super p here we select
that be there there we go you see how
much cleaner vet is much less code so
let me preview that make sure
everything's cool see it's red so
imagine you have many pages and you
don't want this text to be read any
Michael once read text you want it to be
I don't know grey boom now I've only had
to change it in one place and our
paragraphs now have great X now you see
why is just a small example of why you
want to use classes and how using
classes will avoid you having to repeat
code over and over again which means
less mistakes unless work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
