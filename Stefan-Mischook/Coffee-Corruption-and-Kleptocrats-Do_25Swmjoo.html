bagel and a coffee and I got to get new
nibs before my surface pro 4 pen
fortunately I think the nibs are only
like 10 bucks for a little case of them
so
Montreal is one of the worst places I
don't know if it's waterworks worst
places in the world but at least in the
country there's so much corruption roads
are in a constant state of being
repaired this has been going on just one
repair job here this is been going on
for months now you figured it get it
done in 30 days it's been going on for
months a lot of times they'll they'll
drill all these holes here do all this
damage and then there will close it up
and then a month later it'll come back
again and open it up again it's
incredible how much corruption is
speaking of which I'm now entering West
Mount which is the wealthiest part of
Montreal and average house prices are in
the multi-millions and the thing about
West bout is that it is the the only
place I've ever gotten tickets I've
gotten two tickets in my entire life
one for doing 55 in a school zone you
just turn the corner by him it's 55 30
kilometers an hour excuse me I got a
ticket last week or two weeks ago for
rolling stop through a stop sign on a
deserted Road essentially if you want to
get tickets this is the place that go we
had a police strike for months and
months of months so at one point the
police stopped issuing tickets so people
just went around without the police
issuing tickets and strangely enough the
number of accidents did not go up the
number of fatalities did not go up and
then the city was complaining because
they weren't getting the revenue from
all the ticketing and I say to myself
this is the whole point of the ticketing
to keep people from doing reckless
things you know but for a few months but
for a few months they were not ticketing
and there's no extra actions there's
nothing it was pretty constant in terms
of that so it tells me you know it's
just a basic empiricist somebody just
looks at facts no ticketing no accidents
stikat edessa prevent accidents so why
are we ticketing now here's a place I
was thinking of buying a little place
because it was a cool place the problem
with the place is whywe visited it they
wanted like 1.4 million or something and
it's like tiny smaller than my place and
I said nah no view smaller than my place
my Chow is in a huge housing bubble huge
housing bubble
and it's driven by foreign speculators
specifically Chinese nationals and look
at me wrong I love the Chinese culture
Chinese culture and Chinese medicine
saved my life
but anyway so you got these foreign
Chinese Cup decline kleptocrats coming
in buying up real estate with all kinds
of money and they're driving up the
value of housing big-time causing a
frenzy so now houses that used to be you
know they're up for four times what they
were just ten years ago just based on
its foreign speculation from people who
have a lot of these Chinese speculators
apparently according to Chinese
government apparently they have stolen
money they fill up suitcases filled with
money tens of millions they come over
and they wash the money by real estate
in Montreal and Vancouver and so the
Chinese government is now making a deal
with the Quebec Canadian government to
be able to extradite these financial
criminals quote in the words of the
Chinese government and actually somebody
got caught
just because last week I was told in one
of our provinces with like hundred
million dollars or something in cash in
a suitcase he's coming over to buy some
real estate you know what these guys do
is they buy a piece of real estate a lot
of times they're never just put it on
sale for like a million more than they
pay just three weeks before so that's
pretty bad it's pretty bad anybody who
knows anything will tell you when you
have an economy based on gambling and
speculation and then you allow dirty
money to enter and to enter your country
and to start buying up all the choice
real estate you kill your communities
you kill them and it's just not a good
thing to do it's not a healthy thing to
you anybody knows if you have a
household based on gambling order the
main bread earners is gambling
you know that's gonna lead to disaster
so why do economies allow for incomes to
be generated based on gambling and
speculation on real estate it's a
temporary fix because everybody spends a
lot of money on furniture and stuff but
at the end of the day everybody loses
and gets poor except for except for the
bankers the bankers make up a lot of
money any municipalities love it cuz the
via Real Estate's goes up falsely so
then they can charge more property tax
for the exact same place that's silly
anyhow that's just my two cents about
this whole thing speculation which is a
fancy Wall Street term for gambling is
not a healthy thing everybody knows it
why do we allow it on such a large scale
makes no sense to me what are you gonna
do
on my way back home got my chicken got a
new wallet while I make this light
listen by now
you know watch it in this area of
entering where you see a lot of police a
lot of police don't get me wrong I
believe they made a police force and
stuff but I think sometimes they're
unreasonable in certain circumstances
that guy's in a hurry
yeah this is where I actually got my my
first ticket just turning around here
and this becomes a 30 zone I didn't see
the sign I guess I was doing 55
see if there's a cop that person will
get a ticket big time that's what
happened to me last time
this is where I got nailed three points
130 bucks they didn't stop here at a
full stop because gay
this is the wealthiest part of the city
yes some pretty prominent people here at
least in the minds of some good Tommy
Hilfiger's up here you got the founder
of Cirque de Soleil as in his house up
here another billionaire and a whole
bunch of other people are up here
you'd figured this is a country road
right this is actually a road in the
middle of the city and the richest part
of the city and look at this room</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
