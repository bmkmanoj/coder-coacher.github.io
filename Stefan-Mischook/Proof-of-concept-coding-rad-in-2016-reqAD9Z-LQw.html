of killer sites now I'm recording this
with my cheap little webcam here I'm
just too lazy to break out the the big
camera and even too lazy to put out the
better lighting so you have to deal with
it anyway I wants to see my face so what
is a POC in web development POC and web
development POC is something I totally
invented maybe it's out there i call it
proof of concept proof of concept and
this is a term proof of concept is
refers to making or testing whether or
not your idea or business idea your
invention your software whether it has
any merit whether there is a use or a
demand for it the proof of concept is
kind of like an initial stage of
development so since this is much about
web development and coding careers on
this channel will stick to the POC the
park when it comes to development and it
goes to a development strategy yeah so
what I advocate for is that you
concentrate on getting your project out
as quickly as possible so that you can
see whether or not it is viable and if
it is then viable then you go back and
you start refactoring or if it's really
crappy code to begin with a totally
crappy prototype code to begin with it
may be justified and actually writing
from scratch and you may have to because
many times proof of concept POC projects
end up going nowhere or you figure out
that what you had in mind was actually
not exactly what the market demanded
this is an underlying theme or idea you
should try to understand and embrace
most businesses start out with an idea
of it does not work and then they shift
into some other idea this happens all
the
I'm in more often than not and whether
it be technology or whether it be a
traditional business this is the way it
goes even successful businesses will be
continuously reinventing themselves
based on what they learn in the
marketplace so I have a good friend of
mine it was very popular restaurant up
here why did a top hundred restaurants
in a city of it has about 5,000
restaurants and they've been in the top
100 for about 20 years now and the
reason they're always in the top one of
the reasons anyway is because they're
always innovating in terms of the menu
that the producer always trying out new
foods new ingredients new sources a
supply so they're in in essence their
their app which is a restaurant is in a
constant state of development and in
constant in a constant state of flux so
you have to keep that in mind terms of
business now of course the cleaner to
code the easier it is to keep it up to
date but when you first are developing
your pocket code you prove a concept
code it's really a shot in the dark at
that point because you're just starting
out you don't have any user data you
don't have any client data to justify
the business model or the code vector or
the app model rather that you are
proposing now sometimes you do because
you're just copying somebody else but
especially if you're trying to go to an
area you're not aware of you don't know
if there's any competitors and our
direct doing things where you are doing
it's really a shot in the dark so we
shot in the dark type of projects
proof-of-concept talk i would suggest
strongly that you just get out the app
very quickly now some people have
suggested in the comments but no no you
got to rachel your code almost perfectly
from the beginning that's not that
doesn't work in reality there's only
like so many once said there's crap code
anders crap your code in life and that's
the way it works so that's it in keeping
with the
team if you will of this shadow you know
where i talk about code and careers and
reality of coding and i leverage or I go
to rather my experience of writing code
for commercial side since 1994 in fact I
wrote my very first sight back in 94 it
goes late 94 early 95 Vegas late 94 I
wrote it back in 1994 for my business my
business had nothing to do with
technology the opposite in fact I was
dealing with rare fish tropical fish for
zoos and aquariums and collectors and
water purification products for these
same people so I'd nothing to do with
technology but I my brother told me
about this thing called the interwebs
and Lonnie interwebs with the internet
and and the world wide web and had no
idea what it was all about until he told
me about it he said you know why you
should build a website what's a website
i said and he showed me and so I learned
HTML so there you go that's pretty much
it for this blog I hope you can stand
the crappy quality video I just you know
the webcam was here the idea was here it
was just easier to use the webcam ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
