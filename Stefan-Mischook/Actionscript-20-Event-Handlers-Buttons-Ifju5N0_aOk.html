basic variables and how to get them to
display inside of a text field as we did
we'll now move on to event handlers and
this is how we can manage to have our
buttons and our movie clips do things
for us so let's get through this but
first let me just draw your attention to
the fact that I've reorganized my layers
to be a little bit more logical for
example here at the very top we have the
a layer which represents our
ActionScript layer that's where we're
gonna be writing ActionScript and only
ActionScript don't put anything else on
this layer notice I've locked it all so
we've got the T layer and that
represents our text field as we had in
the previous example I've also got an
empty layer for MC movie clips and B
buttons so this is going to be our basic
structure let's now put an event handler
on a button so in order to do this I'm
just gonna make a very simple circle
press f8 to convert this into a symbol
the name here doesn't really matter but
the type button is what's most important
now that we've got that done the real
important issue that I want to have you
do is give this particular button an
instance name so if you've selected the
instance of the button in the property
window let's just give it a simple name
like v1 for the first button if there's
other buttons we'll call them
B 2 3 4 whatever but here I want to
remind us all that whenever we put a
graphic of any kind on the stage you
should always associate the instance
name with the proper suffix so in other
words but we'll have the suffix
underscore BTN much like the text field
had the suffix underscore txt so I'm
gonna call this b1 underscore BTN so now
our instance has a proper instance name
we can now get ready to put an event on
this before we do that I just want to
make
of how actions were attached to buttons
in the past in previous versions of
flash most likely what you would have
seen is somebody selecting the instance
of that button then in the ActionScript
window applying an event handler to this
button notice the button d1 BTN is
what's selected here in order to do that
what would happen in the past was you'd
per say on for example press and you
would just have your curly brackets and
at this point I'll separate them we
could do something like a simple trace
message here let's trace a message and
we'll say the older paradigm
so this is the older model of working in
flash notice if I press control enter
when I press this button my output
window says the older paradigm all right
well that's fine but I'm here to show
you the most recent ways of working and
this has been around for quite some time
but just in case we're used to an older
way of writing event handlers now what
we do is create something called
callback functions notice what I've done
I've selected frame number one of the
ActionScript layer so down here I'm
actually going to be applying an event
handler associated associating it to
that button directly on the first frame
of the action layer so here
let's just write a little comment to
ourselves keep that in practice I'll
just say callback functions
and directly after that single line
comment what we're gonna do is target
that but remember how we did it with the
text view right I could come here and I
could say look I want v1 BTN and because
it has an instance name we can see it
directly could give it an absolute
reference I could give it a relative
reference I'm gonna choose relative and
look at this I can actually even same as
the text field just say b1 BTN why
because it's already on the root level
so I know that's going to work
at this point when I put the dot in the
dot syntax drop-down list appears and
because we're using underscore BTN all
of these particular properties that we
can associate with movie clips and other
things we'll also be able to associate
with buttons but you'll notice that
there are event handlers here specific
to buttons and as you can see when we
put in on with a capital P I can just
press ENTER and now we associate with
this particular button v1 BTN on press
now the only thing that's different from
the first method that I showed you was
to create a callback function so here we
say equals function open and close
regular brackets and that is declaring
to flash like look this is a callback
function this is what's gonna happen
every time we press that button so again
just like in the first example we have
our curly braces and these particular
braces encompass the actions so when I
press this button what happens let's do
a simple trace method again trace
the new method no you know what let's
just say callback function I would just
drive the point home callback and when
we close this and test our movie with
control enter notice when I press this
bang callback so isn't that easy it's a
lot easier than putting individual
scripts all over different buttons and
in this fashion we're just making it so
much simpler for yourself or anybody
else who's working with this file to
locate information it's all on frame
number one of the ActionScript layer all
right let's do something a little bit
more interesting with this
remember how we declared values for my
number and my strength right and we
displayed my string and my number inside
of a little message which displays in
the text field let's do something to
change that
for example the scope of this variable
when we talk about variable scope we say
where was that variable initialized
formally declared well since this
variable was formally declared on the
root level its scope belongs to the root
level it's not a global variable now you
can make global variables later on talk
about that in upcoming examples but at
this point the scope is local in this
case it was declared on the on the root
level so it's local to the root level so
in order to get the value of my number
we would have to define that or notice
and take notice of where it was declared
so it's declared on the root so here's
the root level what about the root level
find me the variable called my capital
and
make sure it's all the same case
sensitivity okay
so root mite number yes well it
currently has the value of 30 but we're
gonna change the value to something like
35 it's the line of ActionScript we'll
end it with a semicolon well that's
great and right now if we press this
button it will give us a value my number
of 35 however let's do something else
let's also copy this information which
displayed that inside of the text field
and we'll say look go find me my text
field txt right now because we're
declaring this on the button it might
think that this is associated inside
this button it's not it was declared on
the root level so let's say look go to
the root level that's where you'll find
my text field txt and then make the text
inside of it say this information the
information is exactly the same as
before the only thing that's different
is my number now has a value of 35 so
let's test this out control enter and
see if this works so here our original
message says Jimmy's 30 thought the 30
years old when we press this aha
Jimmy becomes 35 years old so as you can
see buttons callback functions
associated with buttons are extremely
useful not only because they can allow
us to have all of our scripts in one
place but it also shows us how even with
a button we can go to the root level
find that variable that we were working
with it change its value and then
redisplayed inside of it of a text field
as we've just done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
