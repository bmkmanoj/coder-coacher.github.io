little controversial
what about coding boot camps in late
2017 2018 would you do coding boot camps
now generally speaking no and the reason
being is because they're expensive ten
fifteen twenty thousand dollars for six
months whatever it is and you're going
to come out of there with some sort of
skills but you're going to be a junior
coder at the end of the day and you
could learn this stuff with a good set
of videos and you know as you know I do
sell and produce training courses and so
forth and you know for a hundred bucks
woo you can get everything that is
coding cab will get you a boot camp and
much more actually I would argue the
reason I say that is a lot of teacher as
far as I could tell
not really you know they got a few years
of coding they don't have much of a
business background so they can't really
give you great career advice because
they barely have a career of themselves
and you know this is a generalization I
don't know everybody is out there but at
the end of the day you don't need to
spend 10 15 20 grand on a coding boot
camp you could better off just go to
Community College if you want to go to a
classroom but again you can do stuff
resources online if you're self starting
what I've developed with my system of
shameless self-promotion it's kind of
like a bridge it's a virtualized
classroom type of environment with the
system the software kind of makes it
it's in between just watching a bunch of
videos and being in the classroom that's
where my system is and a lot of people
could tell you it's actually better than
a lot of the classrooms much better
because of the way everything is put
together but ok so shameless
self-promotion aside yeah in 2017 18
I wouldn't go 10 to $15,000 in debt to
go coding boot camp you hear about
people we get jobs I'm sure certain
people do but at the end of the day you
can get jobs if you just sell teach or
use systems like mine or others because
at the end of the day the certification
from the coding boot camps are not worth
much if a
and they see any can help you get jobs
but you watch my vlogs I'll teach you
how to get jobs and how to get in there
so what a lot of these coding boot camps
will do is will partner with local
businesses the Senate coders there and
if you're any good they'll send you
there I'll stash you work for free and
they'll send you there which is cool by
the way when you're first starting out
to go to work for free so they'll send
you there and they'll keep the best ones
and the fire guys are no good and the
guys or the girls are no good no keep
the best within or the best guys at the
jobs and that's it but guess what if you
went to these same places and say listen
I've been only had a KO for six months
and took all these type of things and
they learn where'd you learn I learned
with City where I watch youtube videos
okay what so what can you uh it will
give you a job
no tryout right you don't need the
coding bootcamp to do that useful yeah
you look in the indeed.com
or Craigslist or wherever you look in
your local area what is what is the
demand you know in terms of jobs and
that's all you have to do really the key
thing I look for when I'm hiring coders
is skills I want to see what they can do
I want to see their background and then
I will I will interview of course
unfortunate that I know a little bit of
a cold so I can interview and I'll ask
them pertinent questions and more
importantly I want them to ask me
important questions that tells me what
questions they ask rather will tell me
how good they are at what they do and of
course then I'll just try them out
whether they've gone to a coding boot
camp or not is absolutely irrelevant to
me so coding boot camps will get you
into huge organizations I doubt Google
and Microsoft Azure these guys are
looking for people with degrees or very
long track records so with the coding
boot camp will do will get you into
startups perhaps but you can just walk
to any startup and show me portfolio and
you'll get in as well this is easily or
in small businesses small businesses
don't give it no care about resume
they don't I never I memorized to do
tons and tons of work as a freelancer
for small businesses never cared and
never once they asked me if I went to a
boot camp of course they didn't exist
when I was doing my stuff and or whether
or not I had a concise degree or a
computer engineering degree or I think
they didn't care didn't care they don't
care my emphasis though in what I teach
is code technology and entrepreneurial
ISM to be an entrepreneur because I
haven't worked in it for anybody since I
was 18 years old and the last job I had
was as a bouncer in a nightclub and I've
been an entrepreneur my entire adult
life effectively and I've used coding
since 1996 as the basis of my businesses
don't get me wrong I wasn't totally in
the coding business I was always related
to code but I would I would write my own
apps and so forth and I would use
cleaning and development to my knowledge
of technology in different areas
something they talked about something
eyes I have it so my emphasis in my
courses which is different from anything
I've ever seen out there is you see that
that people tell you they're very
practical that are very oriented towards
the real life implementation of these
coding these programming skills these
technology skills and the reason I think
minor you kind of unique in that sense
they got that flavor that subtlety is
because everybody else is doing this
stuff who's jumped into this whole I'm
going to teach it a cold day either
barely had any career they've only
worked for other people they don't have
the business background as well so you
get that in there that's why now that
I've completed the Python course I
covered what I think are the key key
programming languages it's JavaScript
PHP the Python they represent different
worked traumas if you will Python server
automation AI robotics that kind of
stuff you can do web apps and stuff like
that with it but that's what AI is the
mates
you mentioned if you want to do web app
development WordPress small business web
app and web design web development PHP
is a key and of course JavaScript
JavaScript could get you into the
startup world at least as a foundation
that the foundation that I teach you get
you if you wanted to get into that but
javascript is just good to know because
it's used in web apps and so forth so
with these things of course the web tech
html5 css3 etc would be things covered
now what I'm doing is I'm pivoting into
more of the business slash tech end of
things so what I'm starting to work on
now with a couple people who have a
successful and growing social media
marketing company we're putting out
material is social media marketing and
we're going to get into that and that
will be combined with my many many years
of experience with content marketing to
this day the killer to this data killer
sites network of sites in a couple
million pageviews every month without
even trying hard and this is from work
but I put into it to be sites in the
early in mid-2000s so now I'm coming
back to it because I'm not just pure
tech I have other business interests I
will be emphasizing more the business
end of technology the marketing end of
technology which includes social media
marketing it also includes content
marketing and just pure business small
business development there is a fad now
in start-up culture and startup business
is very different from the type of
business that I have ever done and so
I'm going to help you to understand
those differences and understand the
pros and the cons startup type
businesses are the types of businesses
or requires huge amounts of money
because you require a huge investment
just to get the thing off the ground
it's a totally different model and
startups really they're looking for
the acquisition that's what they're
looking to do they're looking to within
the five years or so that you sell the
company to a big boy that's that's the
game plan and there's a lot of personal
implications for the founders involved
in the startup now you have to
understand something about the startup
world you can be the unicorn the rare
person that makes a lot of money working
at a start-up or creating a start-up but
most don't
the vast majority don't and so what
you're going to find in the startup
world is you're going to be building
something and there's an 80% chance or
so that you end up having worked five
years or more at subpar rates relative
to what you would have made if you just
work for somebody let us start up a
consulting business or do some things
that I would teach and then you've got
nothing Friday that's just the nature of
the game and that's that's how they play
it these guys these VC guys that your
capital and I'm not blaming them it's
it's it's legitimate they will take a
bunch of money but they collect from
people I've got a cat got a bunch of
cash money is cheap now because the
Federal Reserve has pushed the value of
interest rates so low so everybody's
going crazy looking to invest in any
whack job type of business if they can
you know because they're looking for
return on their money because they can't
make any interest anywhere it's a
problem and so what they do is they they
throw their money on twenty different
companies fully expecting 80% of it fail
I know I have friends who have a
start-up and I've you know I've talked
to people and startups that's not that's
the thinking say eighty percent are
going to fail it's okay because they
expect that you know ten percent will do
50 times their money so if that ten
percent does ten hundred fifty times the
money even twenty times the money the
piece are all the other failures right
here's the problem if you're the guy who
worked for 40% 50% 60% cut and pay for
many years and then you're part of that
fast majority that 80% which is goes
nowhere you're five six years classes
and would you get nothing
you have nothing a good experience it's
something to take away from when you're
young but you've been you should change
yourself
that's something called opportunity cost
opportunity cost is the cost of the
opportunity and something that you have
to factor in when you're jumping into
any type of business venture any type of
activity just going to school for four
years you have to factor in how much you
would have made if you live just with
the school for one year of a trade and
whatever it may be 50k year versus the
guy who went to school for four years
not earning money in fact many money
they lost two hundred thousand dollars
in earnings with the person the other
person was earning at that time that
that two hundred grand which you lost
while being at school it's called
opportunity cost it's the cost of taking
the opportunity to go into school the
same thing applies to startups to
starting a new business I have to deal
with that myself I've been eating a very
very expensive opportunity costs a
certain business and you just got to
factor that in that is the cost if you
spend four or five six years building
your business it's not making much and
all that time and effort you put into
this business that you're Stewart you're
establishing the base for it you could
spend that time with something where
you're making big money right and
something else that was kind of
guaranteed but why would you do that
while you're hoping that this the
speculative startup business will grow
huge you know make up for the fact that
you you lost years of a full income if
you just want another out in my career
as an entrepreneur from eighteen years
old I've never gone to speculation route
maybe I made a mistake not doing that
who knows I've decided that I was going
to play according to the averages
meaning that I was assuming that I
looked at where most of the big wealth
is made we're mostly big most people are
wealthy or people who have good little
businesses that earn consistent money
every year for many year
whether it be 200 grand year or 500
grand year million a year you never hear
about these guys are these girls you
never hear about them because they're
not no they only make a half a million a
year but because in most countries I
would imagine those countries the
taxation rate for business is far lower
than it is for an individual there's a
huge advantage in terms of earning a
dollar in a business versus earning a
dollar working for somebody you get to
keep much more of your money so in
Canada for instance the corporate
taxation rates eighteen point five
percent that's provincials which is
equivalent to state and is quoting to
fellow eighteen point five percent
combined so for every $100,000 the
company makes profit it's only taxed
eighteen and a half thousand dollars
whereas I made a hundred thousand
dollars one for somebody because of the
way the taxation system works here
you're losing like 40 50 percent of your
money something like that I think well I
think if you have to help you like 45
percent you taxable and double the rate
so add this up over five ten fifteen
years it starts to add up and of course
you work for somebody others glass
ceiling chances are you're gonna you
know you're not you're not going to be
the person making the 200 grand here and
they should one in a rare ones so I've
always been an advocate of building a
small under-the-radar business that's
highly profitable and built up over time
now you may get a hit that happens to
some of us once then why are you going
to hit and it just grows really nicely
and then you could sell it who knows but
keep that in mind it's a it's a very
different approach you know when you go
for the VC route versus the traditional
business route I'm a traditionalist in
that regard and so there you go so going
forward you're going to see many more
vlogs or talk about the business end of
things
and I'm going to tie it back to coding
and software development and so on so
for example one of the big things I've
been talking about for years I coined it
I think
2006 I call the WordPress web designer
there's a blog I wrote about it and
essentially I saw how you're going to
have people are going to make a lot of
money just specializing in WordPress
support and development for people
because so many small companies depend
on WordPress in fact there's a huge
ecosystem built up around WordPress
accrue themes and this theme company in
this plugin and these guys have made a
lot of money I think the boo themes they
just sold them sold themselves for a
twenty millions in there I forget the
exact number but that tells you
something about that market so when
you're looking around are trying to find
a node.js job for the startup because no
js' is very specialized because you
think no it's so cool meanwhile you get
these WordPress the developers who have
like 20 or 10 small of medium-sized
businesses who depend on him to do the
work and they're making big money big
money you know that's something to
consider</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
