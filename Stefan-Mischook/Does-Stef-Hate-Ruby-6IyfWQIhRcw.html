videos and they go staff hates Ruby he
just hates Ruby so let's see does Stef
that's me
this stuff really hate Ruby I don't know
let's see I just pulled a few books off
my bookshelf here's one book yeah yeah I
don't know when I spend 50 bucks on a
book if I thought it was crap I don't
know that's one bit
oh geez there's another book off my
bookshelf geez
Stef hates Ruby thinks Ruby's crap I
don't know all that is Oh another book
off my bookshelf Wow Stef thinks Ruby is
crap you see I don't think Ruby is crap
I actually think Ruby is a very cool
language and I think rails was very cool
framework what I learned today
no and that's not because I think this
technology is no good is actually really
good it's just because it's losing favor
quickly all the hipster nerds are moving
into the JavaScript and the JavaScript
stack no js' Express etc and the legacy
guys the PHP guys for small businesses
they're not going anywhere and Ruby Ruby
rails is sinking as a result no I'm not
saying it's going away tomorrow it's not
gonna be flash but it's it's this it's
just not something I would jump into at
this point that being said it's a great
very productive Ruby's are very
productive it's a great language it's a
fun writing Ruby code no question kind
of reminds me of Python in some ways
although it is very different other ways
and rails its rails is one of the most
important frameworks in the history of
modern day development because of the
structure now rails is no longer heads
and heads above heads and shoulders
above the other frameworks out there
what happens rails came out they stirred
up a lot of stuff in the development
community
and as a result all the other languages
came out with rails like frameworks as
well in the PHP worlds laravel in the
Python world you have Django and flask
I'm not saying they're copies of rails
are exactly like rails but you know
rails had a major influence and rails
once had a huge advantage but it's no
longer the case as I've said many times
all the modern programming languages all
have the pros and cons and they all have
they're they're all very capable you
could produce great apps in any of the
modern languages doesn't matter I just
say rails Ruby rather and rails
framework it's fading it for whatever
reasons it's fading and I actually had
particularly years ago and so if you're
getting into it
freelance it's PHP secondary freelance I
would go with the JavaScript and node
and so on if you're going to do machine
learning AI Python anyway I've discussed
this in many other videos so I just
wanted to dispel this myth that somehow
I felt that I was crapping over Ruby's
got Ruby because I thought it was a bad
techno I know I don't so I think it's
got it's great things I think it's got
as bad things like every other language
it's just I as a entrepreneur and the
software developer encoder always pay
attention to market forces as should you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
