going to talk about why Oh
object-oriented inheritance sucks so
well I don't know about any other type
of inheritance I guess personal
inheritance in terms of object-oriented
programming
one of the fundamental structures of
object-oriented programming is something
called inheritance so I assume for this
particular video you've done a little
bit of object-oriented coding you're
learning it your jr. so let me give you
a piece of advice object-oriented
inheritance inheritance sucks don't use
it it's something you should rarely if
ever use and the reason you don't want
to use it because object-oriented
inheritance inheritance will make your
code base far more brittle it will make
it far more easy for you to break it so
let me just give you a quick story so
we're gonna go way back way back back in
the 1990s when I was doing a lot of Java
coding so I was called in as a hard gun
for project for publicly traded telco up
here in Canada cell phone company and so
we I was on this team of coders and we
needed to get this project out for some
deadline so that they could get their
license to actually become a cellphone
provider so it was a top priority
project so I was one of a team with
maybe 10 guys 10 nerds maybe AIT's been
a long time so I was just brought in to
do the help file system that said that
my role was very limited in that in that
regard nonetheless so I was I was
writing the code for that and so he had
a couple other guys got two guys to lead
coders their key to this particular
story so one league coder will call Mick
and he was building he built the base
classes for the entire system
he built out well not the entire system
but much of the system so the base
classes are like the foundation of the
house they're the first layer of objects
if you don't know coding classes an
object an object is a class essentially
anyway so he built the base will calm
objects for the sake of the story so he
built the base objects
and back in those days it was still
early on in any all in terms of in the
commercial application of all
object-oriented coding has been around
for a while a lot of people still design
apps using inheritance which is no no
bad news but we didn't know about so so
you got this guy Mik he designs all the
base classes the base objects and then
he builds the next layer the second
layer on top using inheritance basically
inheritance allows you to leverage to
use code from your base classes into
your subclasses so that you can in
theory reuse the code and reuse the
functionality of the base classes now
sounds good in theory but the problem is
you're creating a very tight
relationship tight coupling as they call
it between your base class and your
subclasses as they would call them or
the classes that are based on top of it
so what happens is that they become very
brittle because if anything changes with
this this underlying class it will break
your top little classes your subclasses
so what happened Mik was writing a bunch
of Coley writes the base class and he
was writing now at this point he's at
this point in a story he's writing his
his subclasses and he's writing is
writing and he's right near me he's like
he's like over right over here it's kind
of an open concept office and he's
raising he starts swearing but what's
going on I did why isn't this working
why isn't just working and he's this is
going on for like two hours right he's
really getting frustrated because you
can't figure out why one of his
subclasses is not working it doesn't
know so what he does he he goes in to
back to the original base classes that
he had built and he goes in there and
what he discovers somebody had changed
the base class without telling him so
there the other co-lead Mik was one Koli
in this guy John was the
Khalid so Michaels John and we're all
we're all this is John did you change
the base class blah blah blah I forget
the name he goes yeah I had to change it
so jungles yeah I had to change because
there's sadness in the other reasons but
he didn't L didn't tell Mick so myth
jiggled nuts what da hell you why did
you do it cost me hours of worth anyway
long story short because Jon changed the
base class and because Mick was using
inheritance to try to use some of the
code in the base class
he made his subclasses extremely brittle
because John do you could just John to
change a variable name could change the
signature of a method and also all your
subclasses are screwed if they're based
you know they're done so you don't want
to use inheritance 99% at a time when
you're building your apps inheritance
was an idea what's interesting it's kind
of a passe idea you may use it for low
level infrastructure code once in a
while but I've never used inheritance I
never liked it because I always found it
to be brittle instead what you do is you
do your design through interface of
something called an interface and I've
talked about this in other videos and
the whole advantage of designer buy an
interface just a little snapshot of this
in a nutshell is that the interface is
not tightly bound to the to some to some
base object so you don't have that
brittleness that you have when you use
inheritance so yeah oh oh in heritance
socks don't use it
designed by interfaces and as always
keep your code clean keep your code
simple I would rather have simpler code
but it's temp 20% less efficient in some
way or another than to have very complex
code that's ten twenty percent more
efficient whatever what do we what do I
mean by more efficient well maybe you
can it up write some very sophisticated
code that will cut down the amount of
you're writing by 30% or 20% but it's
very complex hard to understand I
wouldn't do that
I would rather simpler code it's a
little bit more verbose a little bit
longer than then more complex code and
same thing in terms of maybe run time
maybe you can write much more
sophisticated code that's 10% faster
tweye percent faster now unless it's
really mission-critical speed because I
wouldn't I still wouldn't do it you know
I wouldn't you know because a lot of
times 10% 20% faster looks good on paper
but in reality you don't really see much
of a difference when you're using the
app right it's kind of like when they
talk about the specs on computers you
can spend you know you get your
mid-level computer you know cost you
whatever a thousand bucks but you but if
you want to get like the top-of-the-line
chip it'll cost you much more but you're
only getting maybe a 15% faster computer
I never buy that ultra expensive
computer that's 15 percent faster maybe
if I was doing some heavy-duty 3d
animation maybe but generally speaking
it's not worth it so when it comes to
your code simple is better and
object-oriented inheritance is a big
thumbs down that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
