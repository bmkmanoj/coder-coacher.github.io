sites calm in this video blog I'm gonna
get straight to the point louis c.k got
ripped off so let me give you a back
story a friend of mine who's a fan of
louis c.k contacted me he's also
assistant of mine web designer budding
web programmer that he is and he you
mentioned this hole louis c.k experiment
where he basically created his own show
and took care of all the production and
then hired a web design firm to build
the site and he details his cost further
thing in the statement here i just want
to read this one thing the development
of the web sites which needed a very
robust reliable and carefully
constructed web site was around 32,000
now when my my buddy told me yeah he
built the site is 32 graphics it whoa
what's he doing on the site
I said why he's just selling one video I
go really just one video and 32,000 I
said how's the design he goes well it's
pretty good
let's see it him anyway so I had to
check it out so I went on I checked it
out and you know it's a clean simple
site you know I thought what I heard
32,000 he probably invested a lot of
time and effort into the design design
can be expensive but seeing this though
with you know its professional and so on
there's no way that this design took you
know it's it's very very very simple you
know to be fair to the designers you
know it's it's easy to copy a design
once you see it and this in terms of the
structure of the site you know this is
as simple as it gets you know this is
something you know we teach this kind of
layout this you know in minutes in the
first course the beginners course that
we teach you learn this in the first 20
minutes how to do something as simple as
this in terms of the structure now in
terms of the
and the aesthetics the actual design
again it's really really simple so maybe
with the back and forth you know between
you know between the comedian blue CK
and the web design designers maybe you
know I'm being generous here maybe two
and a half thousand and cost you know
and that's really pushing it you know I
can see you know I don't know I don't
know this guy I mean maybe he's real
picky and he made him go back and forth
100 times so that's why the cost boomed
up but this class would balloon up to
maybe a few thousand in design and
that's perfect that's being really
generous you know to do this from
scratch would be like you know it's a
day's work two days work maybe you know
in real time so you know so so we're
looking at now for the main cost is
definitely not in the design of this
project the being cost is I would guess
would be in the e-commerce component and
the you know in the login components so
forth but you know in looking at this
it's a 32 brand you know so he has this
buy this thing button you click through
and you put your email address you
confirm it and I assume that may be okay
maybe part of the cost was because the
web development company that Lucy Kate
hired and you know they set up merchant
accounts for him so he could process
credit cards through his own bank
accounts and so on but no not even that
how he's doing is going to PayPal so but
you put in an email address so I'm gonna
put in my email address and we click
here and you know oh I got a confirm so
we have a little agree with the terms
and conditions you know so that extra
five minutes there and then we little
PayPal and that's it
it goes to PayPal it's really this is a
really simple you could set up a PayPal
payment like this if you know PayPal is
not it's not complex to know PayPal you
don't even need to know how to program
that being said you know this is really
really simple stuff so the other thing
that the
have to do is create the login system
where once you've paid for the video you
login you're able to download the video
content this is not difficult at all you
know we we do it quite a bit our
interval to video tutorial store of
course we do it for dozens and dozens of
courses then you go to video demos and
you log in we track down load counts and
all kinds of stuff it's not difficult
you know the only thing that the they
have to do is they have to set up PayPal
so when PayPal sends a message back to
the site saying oh case you know Stef
bought the louis c.k video allow them to
download the videos it's not that
difficult so anyway the reason I'm
producing this video is because I often
get the question from budding web
developers and programmers and they're
asking about how to judge the cost of a
site and it really depends on a lot of
factors you know depends on you know how
many pages you know this is only like a
five page site although the page counts
not huge because more about the design
and setting up the basic structure and
you know and it depends on how much the
client how many revisions they want and
how much back and forth you're gonna
have you're gonna have to deal with and
I teach about that and in terms of how
to handle that to minimize it so they
save money for the client didn't save
headaches and time for you the web
designer web programmer and then we look
at this basic ecommerce system here I
think this is as basic as it gets
using PayPal in the end I would say that
this site I would have quoted no more
than three grand maybe four grand maybe
five if I thought this guy might be a
pain in the butt in terms of managing
him you know I don't know but this is
thick unless they're doing something
special I don't know they're writing a
code with gold letters or something you
know this is just 32 grand that's way
beyond the pale crazy pricing for this
video for this website so yeah but for
the price for the video from Lulu CK is
actually a good price five bucks I think
that's worth it anyway I hope you
learned something from this
in terms of being able to judge the cost
of websites and again this is also
something for small business owners to
sort of you know recognize and ters you
know you don't want to get a hosed and
like I think Lucy Kay did buy their web
design firm unless I'm missing something
but I've been doing this kind of stuff
since 1994 and I don't think I'm missing
anything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
