video I'm gonna talk about universal
principles and how they apply to coding
and other aspects of life so first of
all what's a universal principle a
universal principle is an idea or a
concept a truth that seems to be valid
across all disciplines so it works in
coding it can work in business it can
work in health I know it's kind of weird
kind of weird I started to identify
these universal principles believe it or
not when I was like 14 15 years old now
some of you may know I was deep into
martial arts I started doing martial
arts when I was 10 and I was pretty
solid in my martial arts until you know
my late thirties you know maybe early
forties I still do a little training
these days not too much and to be honest
with you I haven't done much martial
arts training in the last five six years
I'm starting to do a little bit I'm
teaching some people in a box now but
anyway I started to identify universal
principles in martial arts you would see
a concept or an idea that was let's say
in boxing and you see the same ideas the
same principles in white.i or Taekwondo
or even Aikido yeah yeah yeah yeah so I
started seeing these type types of
universal principles early on and then I
started seeing principles that I learned
about in martial arts they applied to
business so let's do a few obvious ones
so you get the idea and then I'll get
back to coding so for instance
persistence persistence and efforts will
get you success whether it be in your
business you got to be persistent you're
gonna keep move pushing forward whether
it be writing an app whether it be just
staying in shape it's about consistency
and persistence that's kind of obvious
right it's an obvious universal
principle there are more esoteric
universal principles out there that can
really help you out so let's get into
what the first one that applies directly
to web development and
coding and not just web development any
type of development any types of coding
and that is the idea of incremental
progress so what is incremental progress
well when it comes to coding it has to
do with not trying to come out with the
perfect app in version 1 that doesn't
happen typically well never happens
you notice how apps 10 and electronics
and computers whatever cars they tend to
find their way sort of they tend to get
to where they want to be in terms of
quality with version 3
it's a strangest thing you see that even
with TV shows TV shows tend to really
find their stride typically in this 3rd
4th season to really get into it
you know what I think I'm going back to
the 90s is Seinfeld Seinfeld was kind of
until version 3 into wall excuse me
until the third season same thing with
coding and apps like I never touch a
first version of any new device I always
wait to Version three unless it's really
really really really really compelling
really good typically it they tend to
find their footing in Version three
so the whole idea of an incremental
progression towards a final goal so when
you look at coding again app versions
one two three right the federal version
but also in terms of let's get into some
more micro detail about the coding
itself again the principles incremental
refinement is the key to success in all
these things so when you first write
your app I always suggest that you write
a twosie very quickly well and then you
go back and then you start refining
elements of your app you know refining
the database access refining the UI and
refining the usability refining the
database structures even and so on and
so forth incremental incremental you
don't try to do these huge huge changes
all at once you know besides the first
effort or sure
set the groundwork and then the third so
you go psycho and you serve as a spill
from a to Zed you get your app working
barely write alpha code the second pass
around second iteration you go through
your app and you you start refining it
you get it out of alpha and it's a beta
and the final revision for the first
release is to get to your first release
your version while you do your final
refinements and you clean up and so
forth
so we can even dig down even deeper into
code where we start looking at the code
base itself I like the concept of well
it's not my opinion it's everybody's
opinion now you decide this idea in
coding it's all sudden the term just
jumped right out of my head something of
concerns distribution of concerns I'll
just use that term for now basically the
idea of the principle here this is
different from incremental ism the
principle here is that separation of
concerns there you go that is the term
you could look it up and on the web
separation of concerns the idea is that
you have you develop your code base in
accordance to what major components of
your app does so you have a library of
code just for your database access you
have a library of code just for your
user interface your visual alright you
keep your you know it goes with this
whole model-view-controller design
pattern separation of concerns then you
might have another aspect of your code
base that just deals with for instance
in synchronous messaging etc etc so I
talked about this where you have
we have the separation of conservatives
this allows you to first of all you're
gonna have a cleaner app because you
don't have that database access code
mixed in with your validation code and
so on and so that that allows you right
from start to have a cleaner app but at
the same time allows you to separate the
work so you can have your database
coders do the database work you have
your validation guy work on all the
validation libraries another person work
on the in synchronous messaging another
person work on the UI front-end so
that's that's cool so when you get even
deeper into the code so we talked about
app creation process right it's it's
it's incremental once way you know cycle
one cycle to cycle three right and then
when now we're looking at separation of
concerns this allows again for cleaner
apps and then you can go right into the
code itself you can look at how you
would incrementally improve the quality
of your code base so you might say you
write out your your all your methods all
your objects I'm assuming you have a bit
of programming knowledge at this point
in the video so you're ready you've
written all your objects and you've
written all your methods and so forth
and now it's time to go back and to do
something called refactoring you go back
you check out your your methods you
start looking to make sure that you know
that your methods are clean and simple
you make sure it's consistency in the
naming conventions and so forth again
you incrementally improve the quality of
your app as you go through now so that's
that's the prism incremental improvement
is the best way to get to where you're
going now think about nature that's how
nature worked nature is very slow and
incrementally you see changes typically
not a good idea to see huge changes
happen quickly you know our destruction
in that situation so when it comes to
let's say building a business again
building a business you define the basic
concept of business now you know what
you do when you build a business you
want to identify a problem you better
my problem you that if I need and then
you see if you can use technology or
developer services or whatnot to address
that problem so you sort of come with
the big picture just like you come with
the big picture for the app and then in
business I can tell you from experience
from you have been building businesses
since I was since I've been 18 it's an
incremental process you start with the
framework you start reacting with
clients and you start you start with
fining your business processes you start
refining things refining refining
refining and eventually it usually takes
most businesses take about three years
three to five years before they really
start to roll they start really start to
go well
because you start fixing all the
problems again the number three it's
like that's another universal concept
right it's it's biblical even its kind
of interesting so yeah so even when
building a business there's this
incremental process where you you're
refining and refining and refining and
eventually you find yourself with a nice
solid business even with weight loss now
you may look back at some old videos on
YouTube from 2008 where I'm like much
heavier I'm like I'm like 30 40 pounds
heavier and how did I lose that weight
you know since that time and I've kept
it off for the most part again I was I
took the approach of incrementally
reducing my weight not by cutting off
the foods I loved but just by slowly
slowly reducing just slowly reducing my
cut the intake of calories and at the
same time slowly slowly increasing my
exercise that's all so I still eat
pizzas and burgers and fries and all
this stuff but I just see less of it and
so I would start off with something
simple that back when I was a real big
hog a big pig I would order an all
address medium size pizza and a fry just
for me crazy so that would be eight
slices of pizza in a medium I think it's
eight yeah so I had then I I said okay I
was getting too too big it was becoming
like a big walrus so I said okay I got
to lose him right here so what I did is
I started I was ordered a medium because
you know you
seeing a medium pizza and I was just
instead of eating eight slices
I would eat seven I take the other slice
put in the fridge wait to the next day
and instead of drinking a whole you know
a big coke every drink a small coke
and eventually I would slowly slowly
reduce the slices of pizza and you know
your stomach shrinks and incrementally
you get you know you you just develop
proper habits and you get better and
better and better you lose weight quick
you know slowly slowly slowly and if the
weight comes off slowly it's not gonna
go back up it's not going to bounce
quickly so slow reduction and your
weight and if you slowly add habits that
are healthy they stick with you
same thing with writing code you you you
slowly slowly improve the quality of the
code so you write a big chunk of code
let's say you've written you know a
bunch of code to access the database you
write it it's working okay everything's
cool I would suggest at that moment when
it's still fresh in your head to go and
look at the code and see how you can
clean it up make it a little bit more
efficient you know use extract method
which is a common Factory refactoring
pattern and so on and there's a whatever
all the other refactorings that you can
look up on the web and you you when the
code is fresh in your head you go in
there and you do some little changes
here and there
clean it up clean it up and whenever you
go back to your code the next day or
whatever when you go back now first
thing you do look over to code look see
if you can see any problem areas parts
of your code that could be easily
cleaned up and to make it a bit better
if you insert this habit of continuously
improving your code that you've written
slowly incrementally you're gonna see in
the end you're gonna have much better
apps okay that's it for now I hope you
