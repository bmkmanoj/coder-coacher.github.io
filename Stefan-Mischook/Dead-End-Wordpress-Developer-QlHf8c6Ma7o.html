comment somebody made somebody made if
you become a CMS developer let's say you
decide you're gonna start doing a bunch
of wordpress gigs as a freelancer
because you find in your area there's
tons of WordPress geeks
does that doom you in the sense that
you're gonna find yourself in a
declining market nope
not at all because first of all I think
it's something like 30% of 35% of small
websites are running on WordPress
you think these millions of sites are
going to stop using WordPress all of a
sudden not a chance
the reason WordPress will not be
replaced is because though it has its
flaws it works right it works it's gonna
take something really really
significantly better as far as a client
is concerned before they decide to
switch off and we're pressed that's
something developers have to understand
business owners don't care about the
nuances of what's going on behind the
scenes in the codebase they just want
their system to work so if they have a
wordpress based site or e-commerce shop
or whatever it is they're using or doing
before press they're not gonna change
just because you say that WordPress
sucks right they're only gonna change
when we're pressed as far as their
concern for their user perspective is
not hacking it anymore
and let me tell you if they've invested
the hundreds if not thousands and tens
of thousands of dollars over the years
in their WordPress site to get them to
switch off of that is like next to 0%
chance it's just not gonna happen
this is an example where having a bit of
business training can really help
developers because they'll start
understanding what business owners
consider and how they consider whatever
whatever it is that they're doing you
have to get out of your pure programmers
point of view so that you can make
better decisions as a programmer
ironically in addition to that just
because you do WordPress and PHP CMS
work for a couple years it doesn't cut
you off from anything else the more work
you do as a developer the better a
developer you're going to be regardless
of the language or platform you happen
to use and I base this on my own career
I started off writing simple HTML with
some pro CGI then I moved into classic
ASP what at the time it wasn't called
classic ASP it was ASP then I moved into
HTA applications I even did cd-rom
authoring the Java lots of Java
I did some dotnet in the early days of
dotnet and several other things as well
I would just move around based on what
was required for the project and in fact
once you become experienced enough
developer you you stop you should stop
identifying yourself as a JavaScript
developer or no developer or a PHP
developer or a Java developer your
developer doesn't matter what language
once you know your foundations you can
jump from one language one technology to
another for the most part because
they're so similar they're so similar
now if you've been watching my vlogs you
know I always talk about the market
forces behind technology choices so I
look at Ruby in rails and though I think
it's a very good technology my respects
some things are like about some things I
liked about us some things I loved about
some things I didn't like at all and I
knew based on my understanding of
business that Ruby was gonna slowly fade
so way back in the day when ruby was at
its height in 2007 or 10 whatever it was
I was saying yeah Ruby's gonna slowly
fade you can look at old flogs and stuff
I was right and I said that PHP wasn't
gonna be around I was right now the Ruby
people said yeah you suck Stef you know
what you're talking about
he's better because of all these
technical reasons the technical reasons
oftentimes don't drive market adoption
I've seen that many times I remember
back in the 90s a good friend of mine
was begging to if he was called visual
Delphi and visual Delphi competed with
something called Visual Basic and he was
convinced that visual Delphi was better
technology than Visual Basic they
basically did the exact same thing
building thick client apps for Windows
boxes I never used visual Delphi I
looked at Delphi remember back in the
day but I knew was gonna go nowhere even
though he thought it was superior
simply because Visual Basic was more
than good enough and it was had the
market share and it was backed by
Microsoft and sure enough visual Delphi
a faded very very quickly and Microsoft
VB was dominant for many years for
Windows development I wouldn't be doing
VB today oh I'm sure it's probably a lot
of legacy stuff out there but you get my
point
so you always got to consider market
forces and you got to also think about
the development game the career whether
it's freelancer for looking for somebody
as a fluid thing you don't want to be
stuck in a certain mindset back in 1996
it was 96 Java was the hot new young
language and all the old C++ guys were
crapping all over John it's crap it's
never gonna go anywhere and blahblahblah
so it then Java became like the dominant
language because it offers some
significant advantages over C++ in terms
of business app development but now Java
is a good old man's language now rave
old man you know it's taught in schools
it still use hugely in very large
organizations there's a lot of legacy
jobs there but Java is no longer of a
young hipster language does that mean
Javas going away I really doubt it a big
Java will be run for decades and decades
just because it's sold
wisely you Sammy with PHP
PHP will probably be here for a long
long time when Ruby is a distant faint
memory you're gonna have PHP ground why
it just it just has penetrated too much
into the marketplace to see it displaced
I hope that makes sense
