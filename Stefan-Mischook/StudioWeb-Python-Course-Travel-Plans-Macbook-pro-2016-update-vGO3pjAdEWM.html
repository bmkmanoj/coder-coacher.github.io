since I've done a vlog I've been super
busy for a couple of reasons number one
I've been working on the Python course I
think so far I've put out nine videos
and about fifty minutes of content now
you have to understand something about
my video tutorials what I'm producing a
video tutorial for use within studio web
they're far far more detailed but we
change that there's much more work to
build those because they have to be
built according to a particular
structure that city web is designed to
used and this particular structure is
required when you're teaching younger
students middle school and up so what
happens in the end all of the extra work
I have to put into to create these these
courses but our structure for studio Web
it comes out in the end you need a far
easier to understand course so it's very
very effective but it's a lot more work
so it's really exhausting to put in
perspective making a vlog like this
where I discuss a particular topic is
easy it's nothing compared to building a
studio web video course that's for sure
so let's take it up a lot of my time
also I'm about to head out to the west
coast of California on a business trip
and some relaxation a bit of both that
I'll be gone for about a week I'll try
to put some vlogs in the can if I can I
don't know if I will matter of about
time so I may be incognito for a few
days more than a few days unfortunately
I don't know I don't think I'm gonna be
bringing my vlogging camera so I have to
see about all that but anyway that's the
story with that with the Python course
itself where I had this open beta that's
going on I stopped the number of people
participating at 7701 there's a lot more
who wanted to join in and sort of
fortunately I couldn't I didn't think I
could have
much more but the participation is there
a gang decent amount of comments not
great so in a few days or we if I see
that the participation of those who
signed up isn't really they're really
not engaging in the way I had hoped or
at least enough in terms of comment and
so on I might be opening it up to a few
more people my goal is to basically get
feedback from people as I put out the
videos so that I can refine them even
more may rerecord particular videos edit
them slightly differently based on the
feedback I get from people so that's
kind of useful for me
it allows me to get feedback up front
before it's just deployed live inside of
schools so that's kind of cool that way
so I've been using the new MacBook Pro
2060 with the touch bar 15 inch for
about a month now I suppose whatever it
is and I have to say whatever it's the
touch bar I barely ever used although
I'm not exactly a good person to talk
about that because I just put my macbook
down I got one dong little connected to
my Thunderbolt Display and I use a
wireless keyboard and mouse and I hardly
ever touch the keyboard on the laptop I
hardly ever used a touch bar so it's
really not that big of an issue for me
that said I'm kind of glad that I went
with the 2016 because a it's
significantly faster than 2050 as far as
I get talent or my use case and because
you're starting to see all these USB
type-c peripherals come out and that is
not only the future is it's the now so
who knows within six months or so people
will start thinking about well they
won't be thinking about they'll start
forgetting about USB old USB and old the
old ports because all the new ports are
coming out and in fact a camera that I'm
considering for a course work at vlog
work is a new GH five from Panasonic and
guess what type of connection it has yep
it has a USB see out so you can connect
it right into the MacBook Pro and
transfer all
files I mentioned that because a lot of
people were complaining about the
MacBook Pro but I was one of those like
where's the SD card where's the SD card
well the newer cameras are all gonna
probably adopt the USBC so that's takes
care of that issue here's a little story
that you might find interesting as a
developing developer yeah so about six
years ago I decided to create the
prototype for what is studio web so I
put together the idea I didn't write the
code for it I hired people to do that
but I paid very close attention to UX in
UI I actually micro manage that aspect
of the app because these days I believe
that the the hurdles in terms of
software development for the most part
or not they're not infrastructure
hurdles they are much more UX and UI
what separates the great apps from the
not-so-great apps is that the great apps
have a superior user experience superior
user interface look at Apple what really
made the iOS stand out versus early
versions Android operating system was
how easy it was to use right how easy it
was to use how pretty it was people
wanted to have these phones because they
look good and they ran well and that's
the thing about Apple still now I have a
surface pro 4 and Windows 10 great
computer a superior interface in the
sense of its sophistication and that you
can do pen input touch input the
windowing is superior in terms of you
know how it just basically works its
functionality it's it's more advanced I
will say that's a peer but more advanced
but if you look at Mac OS it's just much
more stable consistent everything just
works with Mac OS relatively speaking so
when I got my new MacBook Pro 2016 and
then I used that for pretty hardcore
because I'm doing all these new videos
now and then I would jump back to the
surface pro to do some other work and it
would be it'd be annoying cuz sometimes
you're just dragging a window will truly
smoke and boom boom in Windows also
that's glitch glitch glitch glitch it
just freezes and get stuck you don't get
any of that with Mac OS so Windows is
getting close it boy is getting close
but he still got some little problems in
terms of the functionality just some
little tiny problems alright that's it
for this vlog and we shall move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
