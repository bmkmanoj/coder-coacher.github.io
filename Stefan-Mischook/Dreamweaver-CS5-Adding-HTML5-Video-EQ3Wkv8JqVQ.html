talk to a little bit about introducing a
new way of having video on our page and
that's by creating what's called the
html5 page now if you remember way back
in the beginning of our video tutorials
we did briefly mention that when you
create a new file you could create a new
file with the doctype that was specific
for a html5 document we also mentioned
that html5 is the newest version of HTML
and it's where things are going towards
but not all browsers supported for
example all of the internet explorer
browsers do not support hardly any of
the features on in html5 for the most
part Safari does google chrome does as
to does some versions of at least three
point 0 versions of three point 01
versions and higher of firefox will do
as well on the window system but not
every tag is supported so but
nevertheless i want to show you a little
bit about it and how it's going to work
so if you remember we had created a
template i'm going to do something
that's completely different because all
of the files that we're working with
here are quite simply in excuse me the
stitch in time and i'm pointing to the
stitch in time final here so you could
do the same if you wish and what I'm
doing is we're going to create a new
HTML document so HTML layout none in
this case layout none i'm not creating
from a template I'm just creating a
blank page that we want to test with you
may or may not choose to put this into
your browser and we'll see what's going
to happen so I'm going to choose the
doctype HTML 5 now before I do anything
else let's save this file and you'll
notice i'm just going to save it inside
of the stitch in time well chapter 7
stitch in time not to start but here I'm
using the final and I'll go to the web
folder and in here instead of saying
video dot HTML I'm just going to say h5
or html5 underscore video test so we'll
use this and you can see if your
browsers that your use
can support the html5 video tag so again
not something that we can insert using
Dreamweaver necessarily at this point so
I'm just going to enter in some
information in my code view so I'm going
to switch to code view and I'm going to
just show you what it looks like here I
have a video tag and a closing video tag
yes it's right you don't need any fancy
plugins or anything like that it just
works with the simple video tag that is
amazing it's really great so look what
we're going to do we're going to say in
the attributes for the first video file
we're going to give it a width we're
using the same Superman video so 320 and
a height of 240 and the reason we do
this 240 instead of 256 as we did in the
previous the previous one we had to give
16 pixels of extra space on the height
for the controls however the default
video here the controls are embedded in
part of the height so we don't need to
end add any extra we just give the
actual height value and notice we do
want to see control so we'll say
controls equals controls and that's in
the first video tag and then we have a
closing video tag now inside of that
video tag you can write a little bit of
text like I did here and it says your
browser does not support the video tag
meaning if your browser browser doesn't
support it that's the text that you'll
see if it does support it the text will
be obscured by the video that's on top
of it so that's great so notice what we
do to get the video inside of that tag
you create what's called here the source
tag and SRC we're pointing to in this
case since I saved it in the same folder
here we're jumping out of the web and
we're trying to find the video here so I
said dot dot slash go to the video
folder find me Superman underscore the
mechanical monsters mp4 close your
quotations and then we say what type of
video is this well you can see it's a
mp4 so we say video / mp4 great now if
we go to the design view what is the
design view show me it says your browser
does not support the video tag and
normally that's what we would see if you
had an older browser or a version of
internet explorer that does not support
this tag however if I were to
this in a browser that does support it
for example Safari does and I'm going to
save this and open it up and check it
out doesn't play by default but if you
click on the plus sign you've got your
Superman and look that's the default
html5 supported browser controller for
video let me just turn that off and as
you can see it automatically supports
the full screen option which is really
nice it also has you know mute control
and here this is not really as you can
see you can reload it and open it up and
that's something that's specific to the
browser that you're in but nevertheless
as you can see it's a great way to
introduce video into your work but again
I'm reluctant to put this in the larger
picture because it's only supported by
certain browsers but as of 2010 when
this recording was taking place only a
few browsers supported it but more
browsers will be supporting it in the
future and that's a great thing because
it really simplifies a lot on how to
work with video and what to do with that
video element and it's really quite
simple just one little line of code is
really all we need to embed that video
no extra information necessary so that's
a little bit about the video and its
support in html5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
