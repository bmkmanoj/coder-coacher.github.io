place what we're going to be doing is
trying to style this text so that it
looks a little bit more interesting and
we'll put in some links in here that at
the moment will just function as links
they won't actually go anywhere so why
don't we start with that and we'll put
in some links at the same time I may
actually just get rid of this third
column for the moment so in order for us
to go back to where we were before we
had that third column in place we could
just comment out this information for
the aside or we could just completely
remove it and I'm going to completely
remove it I'm also going to return back
to our CSS I'll just remove this one and
if you remember in order to make this
work now I'm going to change the width
back to 760 and we're going to be
floating the width for this element on
the right-hand side so let's just save
this and we'll save our HTML page as
well and if we go back to our browser
and preview it you should see something
that looks more along the lines of what
we see right here so that's fine it's
all good but as I said we're going to be
styling the text a little bit more now
so that it looks better than it does at
the current state so to begin with why
don't we insert some links in this area
here on the side and we'll see about how
we can style them to make them work so
I'm returning back to Dreamweaver and
I'm going to the navigation area now
generally speaking links are created by
using a tags and a tags are something
that we use often for different
structure and link structure inside of
our HTML pages but it's not unusual to
nest those links inside of another
container called an unordered list and
unordered lists usually work as you
might imagine with other list items but
they're often used in CSS design for
navigational areas
so I'm just since they're so common I'm
going to show you how we can actually
work with some list elements in here so
in order to begin with what I would like
you to do is to create a ul or an
unordered list and as any unordered list
will have an opening and closing tags
now within those we're going to include
some Li list items and these list items
will have a tags inside of them now I've
just prepared a little bit of
information which I've just copy pasted
here but you can do the same thing and
as I break these down I'll show you what
I mean so we start with a ul and we
close with a ul within these unordered
list items that we see here there are Li
list items Li Li closing and within
their we have an a tag open a tech
closing a tag now you'll notice I just
put in like you know home about news
products services clients employment
contact just some basic standard links
you'll notice that the haight ref only
has the pound symbol or number sign that
means it's going to act just like a link
but it's not going anywhere right now
not specifically because we only have
one page and I'm only showing you the
basic layout of these pages so there's
really no need to make them go anywhere
at the moment so we just have this in
place so take a second to create a ul
closing ul and within the UL have Li
closing allies within the Allies the
list items have a tags with closing a
tags and some text in between once
you've got that done save your page and
let's take a look at what this looks
like in the browser as I refresh it and
you can see it looks nothing like the
way I'd want it to look although they
are links and they won't go anywhere as
you can see but nevertheless these links
also show us these little dots that are
over here which are not unusual when
we're dealing with list items however we
don't want those in place so there's a
number of things that I'm going to do
too
make these list items look a little bit
better so let's go back to our CSS code
and you can see here that we have our
nav section which we've defined since
our links and list items are going to be
inside the nav area right after our nav
area and that is before our main section
I'm going to start writing out some
information here and we do that so that
we can keep everything all nice and neat
and you know keep it all in mind so the
first thing I want to do is and again
you can copy this information for the
nav make sure that if you are copy
pasting things the way I am that you
have this information written with the
closing tags in place so same as before
nav but this time I'm going to put a
space after the selector and say el in
other words we are targeting here all
list items inside of nav whatever they
may be and the thing that we want to
address first of all is let's get rid of
those black dots so i'll say list and
you'll notice that when you're running
through this right i'm just going to do
it this way because dreamweaver gives me
a handy drop down thing and the thing
that we want to do here is to say list
style type and basically we're saying no
no I don't want it to be a circle or a
disk or a square or anything along those
lines I actually just wanted to say none
so list I'll types or list items inside
of nav should have a list style type of
none so I'm going to save that page
command ass let's save it let's go back
to Safari and preview this in our
browser voila right away you'll see that
all those little dots are missing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
