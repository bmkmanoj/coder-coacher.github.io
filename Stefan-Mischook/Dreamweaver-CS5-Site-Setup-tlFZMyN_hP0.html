what we talked about was a little bit
about understanding the basic interface
of Dreamweaver and what some of the
actions are for example what the
properties window does and what these
inserts allow you to do but in order to
get started with this if I were to just
close this window that I had opened
previously we can see we've got the
welcome screen so what we want to be
doing is creating a new HTML page inside
of Dreamweaver now if we were gonna do
that I'm gonna just show you exactly
what's going on with this but the best
way for us to get started inside a
Dreamweaver is to define a site and
that's the first thing that we're gonna
do so here's what I'd like you to do you
can define a site by either coming up to
this icon right here and as you can see
you can say new site or you can manage
existing sites but just to get us on the
same page I'm going to say site from the
top site menu and I'll say new site
alright well the site window has been
greatly simplified in the cs5 version of
Dreamweaver in comparison to the
previous versions of Dreamweaver and
that is something that is always going
to be advantageous for anybody working
with this especially for anybody who's
coming to Dreamweaver for the first time
so what you can see here is there's the
site information there's server
information version control is another
aspect that will look into later and
there are also advanced settings well
normally speaking the only thing that
you need to do and worry about when
you're concerned with creating your site
is to as we mentioned when we were
talking about planning your site you
want to have all of the resources for
your website located and stored in one
nice convenient location also if you
remember when we were talking about how
the web works and discussing the
information about having your website
local on your computer the computer
that's right in front of you that's the
local information and server information
is enabling us to
you upload our websites to a specific
server so in order for us to do that
we're gonna have to enter in server
information now we're going to talk
about servers a little bit later and
testing on your server in future video
tutorials and in doing so I'm going to
concentrate only on the server rather
than the local information however if
we're talking about local information in
other words here on the computer that's
sitting right in front of you that is
your local computer so what I want to do
is to define where on this local
computer you can find all of the files
and the folder more specifically that
contains all of the files that go into
making my website what it is so first
and foremost we can give a site name now
if you remember we talked about naming
convention when we were discussing
websites before and naming conventions
are something that you know are really
specifically important to files folders
and images however this particular site
name need not conform to those naming
conventions because it's got nothing to
do with your HTML files it's only going
to allow Dreamweaver to understand where
we are so I can just write you know my
first site in other words my first
Dreamweaver web page and here we can say
local site folder now we don't have a
local folder made however Dreamweaver
will allow us to choose one so I'm just
gonna click on this little browse icon
right there and what you can do is just
go to your desktop and here I'm pointing
to on my Mac my desktop if you're on a
PC not a problem you can just point to
your desktop from the drop-down menus
and let's create a new folder this new
folder now this does conform to naming
conventions because you know folders
files and images are what we're going to
be uploading to the web so nevertheless
I'm just going to write here root now
that's not a very intuitive name I must
admit but this is just for our testing
purposes and we're just experimenting
with this website should you for example
be hired to create a website for company
X then more than likely you'd be naming
this root folder by the company's name
company X and you would never leave a
space if you remember you would say
either company underscore X or something
along those lines so I'm just gonna call
this root and if I wanted to I could
also say for example root underscore
folder now remember the underscore is an
acceptable special character spaces
however are not acceptable when naming
our files so root folder is the folder
that I'm going to create notice it is
now located on my desktop so this is the
folder that I will choose as my local
site folder and you should be able to
follow this path to your desktop and
whatever your folder was called in this
case root folder all right well at that
point I could if I if I knew how to go
to my server and enter my server
information but as I mentioned we are
going to discuss how to work with that
and what to do with that in a future
video tutorial as well we'll also talk
about some of the advanced settings
inside of this window but for the most
part this is really all you need to do
to get started and to start working
inside of Dreamweaver so you should
always remember that whenever you're
starting a new project it's extremely
important to define your site and by
doing so you can take advantage of
Dreamweaver site management window and
allow you to really really use the
strengths of this application to your
advantage so save that and you'll notice
now that in this files menu or window
right here look I'm just gonna double
click on the CSS Styles to collapse it
so that we could see more of this window
well notice it says local files and in
here it says site my first site right so
that's what I called it my first site
and you can see that there is another
list here you can you know show me
what's on my computer if I wanted to
what's on my Mac hard drive if I wanted
to or some of the other sites that I
have also created and these are just
ones that I use personally this is one
for Concordia University where I teach
there's one for killer sites who were
doing this work for and this is the one
that we just created ourselves my first
site so notice there's nothing in that
folder and that's to be expected
but what we're going to be doing soon
enough is to create the information that
we have in this folder and we'll create
the skeleton of our website in other
words the very basic pages that are
going to be built upon for us to create
our entire site so we'll do that when we
come back in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
