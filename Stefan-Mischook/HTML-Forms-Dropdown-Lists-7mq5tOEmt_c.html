about working with things like
checkboxes let's take a little bit of
time to examine how to create our own
drop-down list now you've seen these of
course as you've seen just about every
form element that I've been discussing
up to this point and you know every one
that we'll be discussing as well once
you see them in action you'll say oh yes
of course I recognize that I've had to
do this on a number of occasions well as
we saw working with something like a
checkbox is a great thing to do and it
allows our end-user our audiences to
actually have a number of different
choices that they wish to work with but
oftentimes you can work with something
like a drop-down box and drop down list
as I should say so as you'll see here
we're going to introduce a new tag and
this is actually called the Select tag
and in the Select tag you can give a
number of different sort of attributes
but in this particular attribute what
we're going to do is similarly to what
we did with some of the earlier ones
well name this particular drop down list
according to its values so for example
if we're still working with the fruit
scenario that I had initially I'll say
look all the elements inside of this
drop down list that I'm creating are
going to be you know articles that
belong to this fruit now before we do
anything else and as I usually tell all
my students to do is when you introduce
a tag that can be closed go about
closing it right away that way we don't
actually have any problems understanding
exactly what is being open what's being
closed but more importantly we won't
forget to close that a little bit later
on all right so now that we're inside
here certainly you could press tab and
indent these elements if it makes it
easier for you to read really not a
problem to do so so let's introduce yet
another new tag and it's called option
and when we have an option as you'll see
here we're going to define
value for that option in other words we
can actually give it a value that's
going to be visible and that's going to
be described in just a second as we
close our option tag but here these
values will you know be essential when
we're sending this information to again
either a PHP script or an ASP script or
some other sort of intermediary
programming language that's going to
help us to retrieve and extract this
information when we need it so anyways
if I wanted to I could say Apple and as
I close the opening tag inside we're
going to actually say Apple and you'll
notice now I'm going to close this
option tag very simple easy to do if I
wanted to I could copy this I'll just
right click copy and I'll paste in the
information and here instead of Apple
you know you can pick any of your other
favorite fruits or something along those
lines so I'm just going to say pear and
I'll do the same thing in here and I
will come back here and paste in another
value
another option tag as we saw being done
earlier you know if I wanted to
introduce Kiwi or something like that I
could do the same thing here and again
it really is a matter of how many of
these you want to be adding and you know
it's completely up to you so you know if
I came in here and said plum and added
something here as well like a plum and
then I could say command S will save
this file now let's go back to Firefox
and now what you'll see inside of
Firefox is this you know very defaulted
little drop-down box and when you click
on them check it out the first one in
our list was Apple we had pear and we
had Kiwis and we had plums so if we
wanted to eventually when we introduced
submit button into our form elements
this information would be taken and then
you could use it in whatever way that
you want with conjunction with some
other you know scripting languages like
PHP as I mentioned or ASP among other
things now oftentimes however sometimes
you'll have sort of a how should I say a
push of some kind in magic tricks you'll
often see this where the magician is
sort of forcing a card on you pick a
card any card but the you know ace of
spade is the one that seems to be pushed
out in front well anyways if you wanted
to introduce something where you had an
element in this list so one of these
options that we have here would be made
the first selected option the one that
is available by default and people could
change it if they wished all you would
really have to do for example let's say
somebody really likes pears all they
would really have to do is to introduce
another attribute to the option tag and
in this case it would be an attribute
called selected and as you'll see here
I'll just say equals selected item we'll
close that particular element and now if
I command s or ctrl s or file save as we
see here and we'll switch back over to
Firefox and when I do so let's take a
look at what's going on here
well I'll have to double check what
we've done just to make sure I might
have to close this and go back to my
desktop here and open it there you go I
just had to shut it down and open it up
again but as you can see pair the second
item on my list is the one that was
selected by default which just goes to
show you that when you are working with
the selected elements as I mentioned in
this particular example you have the our
selected file
tell it what it is and we said we want
pair to be the selected option so that's
working with drop-down lists and these
drop-down lists will be an indispensable
part of how you make your forms work for
you and how successful those form
elements will actually end up being</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
