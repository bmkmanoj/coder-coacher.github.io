something called an array
and Rey is a type of variable that
allows you to hold multiple pieces of
information as you may recall from our
previous videos we use variables to
store information so that we could use
this information later on and multiple
times in our scripts arrays work like
variables except that you can hold or
store many different things inside one
single array arrays are very useful and
as such they're used throughout the PHP
language and they're one of these things
that you really have to understand and
master
a great thing about learning about PHP
arrays is that just about every other
modern programming language comes built
with arrays as well that's because
they're so important and they're so
useful so when you learn PHP arrays
you're going to learn how to use arrays
in many different languages so again
once again you're going to be killing
many birds with one stone
to help clarify things for you I've put
together this little graphic that we see
here illustrating the difference between
an array this is the array and a
standard variable as we can see here
with the standard variable it holds one
piece of information the array on the
other hand as you can see here holds
multiple pieces of information you can
look at an array as being a box or a
container that has many slots for
instance like a carton of eggs so in a
sense arrays are like mini databases
that use something called keys to track
the information that they're storing in
the database a key is sort of like a
page number in a book where you can use
the page number to find a particular
piece of information so in this case
you'd have this would be one page would
be a second page would be the next page
and so on each of these boxes represents
a slot in the array by the way arrays
can have literally an unlimited number
of these spots or slots if you will the
limit is really dependent on how much
memory you have on the particular server
there are two types of arrays in PHP the
indexed array and the associative array
we're going to actually go into examples
of each and once you see the examples
it's going to be very clear I believe so
if it's unclear for now don't worry
about it it's going to clear very soon
let's start with a indexed array you
notice here I put a PHP comment which is
the double slash and I put the I just
put indexed array so I'm leaving myself
a note or a comment so first thing I did
is create a variable called my array and
I use the assignment operator so I'm
assigning this variable my array and I'm
assigning it the array or let me
rephrase that I'm assigning it an array
you see the word array this is what you
would call a keyword or a reserved word
in PHP this is a special word that when
PHP comes across it knows that we're
creating array here an array we start
with the keyword array Open bracket you
see you got the double quotes staff
comma Bobby comma Jimmy comma and the
number seven then I close off with
another bracket and of course our
semicolon you can see by this that we
create an array by adding items each of
these things or items and you separate
the items with the comma here you can
have strings in here you can have
numbers which you should take from this
as a is how to build an array and B that
you know that you can put different
types of information in an array by the
way in PHP and then just about every
other programming language you would
refer to these different types of
information as being data types that
doesn't another subject we'll cover in
another video but in programming there's
a distinction of classifying the type of
data that you're working this is string
data and we've looked at that in our
verse one of the first videos and this
is actually number data you would
actually refer to as an integer I'm
going off on a tangent here let's get
back to arrays so we've created our
array using the special array keyword
and we've assigned this array using the
assignment operator to the variable my
array now this type of array here is
called an indexed array because it uses
the position of the data that you add to
the array
as its key if you want to access it when
we back up and explain this to you in a
different way and the index position
refers to the order in which you added
the item to the array so staff would
have an index position would be the
first item that you add to array so you
would say you would have an index
position of one and this would be a
second item that you added to the
written to the array so it's the index
position of two and so on you would use
this index position to access whatever
information you have in that index so
you can think of an index position as a
seat number in a row of seats if you
will so this would be seat number two or
index two
that confuses a little bit I'm going to
tell you something about index positions
in PHP index position always start with
0 not 1 so this is position 0 this is
position 1 this is position 2 and this
is position 3 so remember that doesn't
start with 1 it starts with 0 so here is
how you would access a value in an array
so I'm referring to our variable I'm
saying my array grab the variable value
at position 2 so you figure our first
thought it would be Bobby but in reality
it's Jimmy because 0 1 2 let's look at
the syntax here a little bit closer to
access array elements and an index array
you put the index position of the item
that you want to access from the array
in between the square brackets
so let's look at how this will look like
in our screen we're using the print
command as we've seen before so let's
take a look how this renders in the
browser so as you can see it prints out
the value of Jimmy so we go back a my
array index position of 2 is Jimmy even
though it's a third element it's a third
element because it's 0 1 2 what's access
array element with an index of 0 so I'll
say that let's refresh the page and we
get Steff right 0 is Steph I'm using the
term index position but reality is what
programmers would call these are the
keys right this would be the first key
this will be the third key this would be
a second key remember we're always doing
it we're always starting our account
from a 0
so to enter little discussion on indexed
arrays just want to look at this print
statement here in English which if we
translate this print statement we're
saying print whatever variable whatever
value excuse me we have stored in the
third position of our array</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
