tutorial I'm going to show you how to to
use Dreamweaver cs3 to connect to your
web server your hosting company using a
stream weavers a built-in ftp program
ftp is short for File Transfer Protocol
essentially an FTP program is a program
that just is designed to move files back
and forth from over a network and in
this case over the biggest network in
the world the internet so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna use Dreamweaver
cs3 FTP program to connect to your web
server so that you can upload your
websites in a server so that the world
can see your website
I've popped open Dreamweaver three you
see here I've defined a few sites
already these counts of that so what I
what I've done here is I've actually
registered domain killer where press
column for the sake of some WordPress
demo so I'm going to be doing and here
we see what the I have on my my own
computer here in terms of files inside
of killer at wordpress.com and I know
it's the local view on my own computer
because I've selected local view in this
drop-down list here when you want to see
your files on your web host you would
select remote view we won't talk about
the rest today so right now I have a set
to look at the local view so let's
actually configure Dreamweaver now to
connect to the web server so what you
want to do is you want to go to site
manage sites and you want to set select
the site you say have three defined here
in Dreamweaver I want to select the site
where I want to make some changes and
add the FTP information so this site
definition box appears now you love
people you're gonna get this what I'd
like to do is go to advanced
I find that easier for me so let's just
use that so what we're going to do is
we're going to click remote info
now I've already filled in the
information prior to making this video
but I'll walk you through what my steps
were and why where I got this
information etc so first thing we want
to look at this first drop-down list the
access drop-down list you notice that we
have several options and that we can use
to access the remote server our web
hosts the most common by far the one but
99.9% of you are going to be using is
the FTP so we're going to select FTP and
FTP ho's essentially is the address of
your web server this is the address you
get from your hosting company I'll give
it to you no problem
then you're gonna get a login name and
you're gonna get a password again you
get these three pieces of information
from the hosting company host directory
this basically tells Dreamweaver to
automatically connect to a particular
directory on your hosting company's
server so what I'm going to do is then
remove this public underscore HTML for
now the reason I have this in here is
because I know about on my server the
killer site server all our web sites are
configured so that they are they all go
into a folder called public HTML on the
server so that this is where the live
files the files that people see when it
comes surfing at your site this is where
everything sits now if this is a little
unclear
let me demonstrate in about two seconds
here so I'm just gonna remove this and
just for the sake of this video and I'm
gonna hit the test button so the dreamy
we will now test to see if we've filled
in this information properly and we know
everything is working so we can see
Adobe Dreamweaver cs3 connected to your
web server successfully so we hit OK
let's for instance pretend but I didn't
put in the right login name so I'll just
I just changed it I'm gonna hit test
again and now we're gonna get an error
ftp ftps ocker cannot make connections
to hosts your login or password is
incorrect so that it actually tells us
specifically what's wrong so I'm going
to fix that again hit test and as you
can see now I'm connected successfully
well I'm as I changed the address wrong
let's say I put a different number here
and I hit test
as you can see again now we notice we
got a different error here
FTP error occurred can I make connection
to host remote host cannot be found so
essentially it's saying this message is
saying we can't find this there's
address here because it's actually it's
not a proper address let me just change
it to a proper structured address but a
different address and you can see yet
another error message watch this
now here's an error message where
Dreamweaver cannot again Schriever
cannot make connection holes it can't
connect connectors address now the
reason it can't in this case because we
don't actually have access to that
address for real but as you can see
Dreamweaver gives you a bunch of options
and which will help you diagnose any
problem so I'm just going to put the
right address as you can see we've
connected successfully and I'm going to
hit OK
so again we're back at the mean
Dreamweaver window now and we're looking
at the local view of killer WordPress
com basically Dreamweaver is showing us
this folder here I hope you list so it
looks similar as you can see so what we
want to do now is check take a look at
what what we see on the remote server
here we go so you see on the remote
server we got all kinds of different
folders and this can be confusing for
people at first let me just explain a
couple quick things all the stuff that
the people see when they come visit your
website all the pages that people see
are in the public HTML folder and that's
why if you remember in the site
definition window manner sites and
remote info host directory I had put in
public HTML right because I wanted to
just deposit the files directly into
this folder directly all these other
folders temp and mail and so forth have
nothing to do really with your typical
web design work the WWF folder you may
think is where you would put all your
web files but actually that's something
that the server uses and you shouldn't
touch that
anyhow so now you see why I created that
in the site excuse me let me said at
that why I put this in because I wanted
to go directly into that particular
folder now you see Dreamweaver is
disconnected because I changed to say
information remote information so I'll
just reconnect by clicking this button
and as you can see we don't see all
those folders anymore because
Dreamweaver has taken us right into the
public HTML folder and that's where all
the action is
to finish off this video we're going to
just upload a file we can sir that I'm
just going to local view so I'm gonna
upload this index dot PHP file now here
it is pretty simple welcome to killer
WordPress com
so to upload files in Dreamweaver
there's many different ways but the
easiest way for me is this you select
the file you want to upload and then you
select the put files button the up arrow
and that will just basically upload a
file to the server so I'll just click
that and that's it it's since it's only
one file it runs very very quickly
another way you can help put a file
excuse me
output upload a file rather to the web
server is if you're editing the file you
can select this button here file
management click the drop-down and you
can use put put means to put it on the
server and get means to download from
the server sometimes you want to do you
want to do either/or so you can also use
a shortcut key ctrl shift u on the PC so
I'm just going to click put and it's
uploading a file so if we go to killer
WordPress com
you see that our file is indeed has been
uploaded onto the web server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
