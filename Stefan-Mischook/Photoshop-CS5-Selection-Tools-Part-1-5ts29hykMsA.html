talking about is working with selections
and selections are really the key to
understanding how to work inside of a
Photoshop environment and what you can
do I'm just gonna close that previous
image that we had and I could move
directly to bridge myself if I wished or
I can just go to the mini bridge as you
can see here and whether you're in
bridge or the mini bridge what I want
you to open up is the ROS photographer
or studio picture that you see here and
as you can see I'll just collapse mini
bridge for a second and I will go to the
specific mode screen mode that I want to
see and remember you can see screen mode
with the menu bar and you can see those
by pressing F as well just this simple F
Fox keyboard shortcut so what we can see
here is we've got this particular image
at our disposal now if I wanted to I
could make a selection which allows me
to take a portion of the image or some
of this image and remove it for example
from its background or create something
a little bit different what I'll also
introduce you to is this little icon
right here which is the layers icon it's
this one that I'm pointing to right here
if you don't see that for whatever
reason you can all let's go to the
window menu and open up the layers icon
right here f7 is the shortcut and you
can attempt to do that however if you're
on a Mac that might be different from
what your f7 shortcut key is configured
to do right away but nevertheless if
you're on a PC f7 work just fine
so as you can see here I've got the
layer palette all right now the layer
palette is written or on it is written
the word background it's just one flat
layer and that's all that's really going
on here you'll notice that it's also a
locked layer if I were to take this
black arrow tool and attempt to move it
it's gonna give me a little error icon
that says hey it's locked sorry you
can't move it if I wanted to I could
just double click this icon and change
the new layer layer options
to give it a new name like layer zero
now if I were to move this you'll see
that it actually does move and this
entire layer that I have here actually
happens to have a transparency right now
see if I were to move it over here all
of this checkerboard pattern in the
background represents a transparency so
that's some of the basics but what if I
wanted to make a selection and sort of
remove this from its background or you
know just position it somewhere else
well a couple of things that you can do
you can work with the rectangular
marquee tool now let me show you
something about Photoshop or any other
you know Adobe program when you look at
them inside the tool bar you see that
there's separations here these little
lines that separate the tools that
generally means that each of these
groups of tools usually work in
conjunction with each other or do
similar things so the first set of tools
here are all about selecting and you
know moving objects and doing different
things and there's a number of different
tools that we'll be looking at that will
allow us to do just that well here the
first one and very easily we can see
that this one here is the marquee tool
and what that allows us to do is to
click and drag so for example if I were
to click and drag around this you end up
seeing what we affectionately call the
marching ants selection around this
object so that's specifically targeting
the area inside of this object here if I
wanted to I could go to the Edit menu
and I could do a number of things I
could say let's cut what's in this
selection and we could paste it on
another layer or you could copy this and
do a number of other things as well do
note the shortcut command X for cut
almost thinks scissors and copy is
command C and paste is command V those
are extremely important shortcuts if
ever you're unhappy with what you want
to have happened or let's say I didn't
like this selection get all this press
command Z or undo and as you can see
here edit undo will undo that selection
well let me mention some
else now I could come in here and I can
make a different selection and if I
wanted to step back more than one step
instead of just pressing command Zed you
could go edit and look here command Zed
and you add the option or alt on your PC
and that allows you to jump back a
number of steps not just one but
multiple steps see this now it's more
than just it says background instead of
layer zero as we did before so commands
EDD moves back one step command alt or
option Z moves back multiple steps how
many steps does it move back well it
moves back 20 steps but that's it if you
wish you can go into your preferences
and increase the amount of undos that
you're available to step back but
remember Photoshop is enough of a hog on
your RAM memory as it is and if you were
to do that it would just eat up a lot
more so usually 20 should suffice so
remember this if I make a selection
I could command Z to undo that selection
but the best way to undo that selection
is to look at here select menu up at the
top if you wanted to select all
everything on this canvas that's control
a select all but if you wish to deselect
just press control D or command D on
your Mac and as you can see here command
E control the will undo that selection
so that's really important now let's see
what we can do with it let's say I was
happy with this and I wanted to say copy
it command C copy and then if I press
command V you'll notice that I happen to
have two layers here one layer on top of
the other one let's see what that looks
like I'm going to take my black arrow
tool the move tool you could oppressed V
on your keyboard shortcut and let's see
this notice by default if I click on the
background I'm not able to move the
background I'm only able to move the one
on the top and why is that well let's
see the move tool that I have here has
auto selection area right here and
see that I could select a group or I
could auto select a layer I like to use
auto-select layer wide because look
layer one is highlighted here if I want
to move layer one that's great but what
if I want to move layer two the back our
layer zero of the background well now
all I have to do is click on that layer
and it will select the background here
or click on the front selects the one in
front so look we copied what was in the
selection and we pasted it into this
area over here right up on top so that's
great but you know if I were to hide the
background you would see all of that
transparency that we did not copy so
that's a real good start and we can see
how that transformation or the or how
the marquee selection copying and
pasting it can work for you but when we
come back we're going to explore some of
the other selection tools that will
allow us to get in a little bit closer
around this edge and produce something
that's a little bit different from what
we've just seen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
