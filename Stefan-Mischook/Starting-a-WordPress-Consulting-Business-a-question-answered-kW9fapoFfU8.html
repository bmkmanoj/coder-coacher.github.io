consulting business what are the skills
that you need and what are the first
steps a lot of skills that you need for
small you have to know how to install
and set up and configure WordPress
number one number two you've got to
learn your basics of HTML CSS you should
learn a little bit of PHP because
WordPress is created with PHP and
knowing PHP will allow you to have
better control over WordPress
specifically when you get into the
theming the themes are the visual parts
of WordPress and there's tons and tons
and tons of themes out there some very
very elaborate and so forth and you may
never have to get into the code
depending on the type of theme but if
you really want to learn how to build
themes from scratch you don't
necessarily need the PHP it but it will
help when you understand even just the
basics of PHP so I recommend that this
is a good beginners course will get you
up and running there so yeah of course
the next thing is you have to learn how
to create install and configure themes
with WordPress and again you have to
know every single thing but you should
be comfortable with it and I would get
to know the big theme providers there's
big theme providers out there like rule
themes and there's others just so you
know what's available so you can
understand understand that also
understand be plug-in architecture
WordPress has a plugins capabilities
there's a huge world of plugins that's a
very dangerous world because a lot of
plugins could be tunnels where hackers
could hack your WordPress will be very
careful about that understand how
plugins are rated understand which
plugins are super useful not you have to
get into the WordPress community
wordpress.org get in there start
searching there's rating systems and
really understand that and understand
the implications of using different
plugins and this of course the plugins
will be impacted by the themes that you
might utilize or commercial themes and
they have capabilities or it can be some
conflicts between plugins and themes
accessory etc these are things you just
have to get an overview about what's out
there so what you as a WordPress
consultant or professional when a small
business client approaches you
wants to do this surah the other thing
with WordPress or wants to install
wordpress wants update WordPress you're
going to be well aware of the landscape
what's available what you can leverage
to do remember encoding the top three
wrote rules of coding is reuse reuse
reuse just like in real estate its
location location location so same thing
as a wordpress professional you don't
want to start trying to reinvent things
from scratch building themes from
scratch it's not necessarily the thing
you want to do you wanted to basically
start with a basic theme maybe modify
that you don't want to try to come up
with your own plugins although that may
be required at some point depending on
the needs of your client that's where
your PHP will come in with PHP HTML CSS
but you want to know what the plugins
are out there so you can just leverage
what's out there already I would be more
inclined to commercial plugins and free
ones although there there are plenty of
great free plugins plenty of great ones
out there but commercial ones offer a
level protection because they are
commercial the code is not out there for
everybody to see so easily that's the
downside of free free means it's open
people can see hackers can go ahead and
see the flaws in the free WordPress
plug-in code so commercial has some
level of security and protection there
and there you go so that's in terms of
technical skills which you understood
have to understand again and WordPress
become a wordpress professional the next
thing is how do you get the clients well
you're going to put up a site you're
going to put up a wordpress site you're
going to start talking about WordPress
and then what you've got to do is going
to have a couple of showcase clients
real WordPress sites are live that you
can show people and you may have some
friends who need a wordpress site local
business owners small business owners
may need a website put them on WordPress
due to one or two for free
small ones and by doing that there's any
word of mouth tours we need
communications and so on remember many
many many many many many small
businesses run on we're
press and small businesses are less
likely to an outsource to a different
country so if you're a North American or
European developer or sharing developer
in your way but you're going to lose out
to you know more competitive people who
live in India because rent is so much
cheaper their houses housing is so much
cheaper there so they can charge much
less and still live very well you have
to come to net contend with that to a
limited extent because one of the big
things that you have to understand about
small business owners is that they don't
have time to start researching all over
the place number two they want to be
able to communicate and see people and
though for instance the Indians great
people they speak English it's not the
same English as Australian English it's
not the same English as North American
English etc etc so there's all there
sometimes due to cultural issues and due
to slight language issues issues of
communication and that's huge it could
really mess up a project because things
are miscommunicated and I can tell you
from personal experience even in person
it creates a bit of a hassle sometimes
imagine you know at a distance so yes
you might have some that situation where
you might have to compete with the third
party but you just tell if the small
business owner wanted a rare and trip it
fuel that is looking at wait a listen
you know this is I'm local there's all
the advantages of dealing with me
directly you can get a hold of me every
time good communication and that's why
think back a few blogs ago I talked
about communication skills are key to
being successful as a developer whether
it be a wordpress developer or
professional or whether it be a coder
who's building apps from scratch in PHP
or in Java or and Python or whatever
language pickett all right I hope that
helps this is what you got to do and if
you follow those steps of many many many
times you will eventually maybe sooner
than later you will eventually start
getting clients start building up your
playing bass and so on it works it's a
tried and tested method many of my
mentees have gone on and done well and
whether it be what WordPress or just
general development is our general web
designed so on there you go oh by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
