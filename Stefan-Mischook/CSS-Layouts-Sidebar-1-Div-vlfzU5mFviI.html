introduce the other elements that will
be inside of our container div and
underneath our header div as we saw last
time we had our header and it was able
to as you can see give us a background
color and we were able to give it a
little bit of change as we went along
with regards to not only its size but
also its height so it's all inside of
the container we wrote the end of our
code there as well so I'm going to hit
return in my code view and as you will
see you can actually separate that a
little bit more we've got the space I'm
going to now introduce another div tag
and this div tag we're going to give the
ID name side bar one and we'll define a
new CSS rule for sidebar one as well so
sidebar one ID inside of our external
style sheet that's fantastic what we
want to do with sidebar one at this
particular point in time is to say well
first of all you know sure we can give
it a background color and we can you
know decide exactly what that color is
going to be we can change it later as
well so just roughly I'm going to come
in here and give it a background color
but what we're going to need to do is to
go into the box area now as we saw when
we were looking at the finished example
we had two smaller side bars and one
larger area in the center and the
sidebar containers were smaller because
we actually defined a width for them now
let's think our container div is 960 so
if I wanted about you know equal amounts
on the left and the right hand side as
well as a larger area in the middle well
let's think if I create that area in the
middle to be 600 that would leave me 360
left over which could then be split up
into a nice 180 on one
side 180 on the other side so we're
going to come in here and we're going to
say 180 for this particular area now
when we do that however we're also going
to have to say well sidebar one I want
to be floating on the left-hand side of
this page and that's exactly what it's
going to do it's going to push itself
over to the left-hand side just as the
other one will push itself to the right
hand side so we're going to click up
okay and we will then click OK for the
insert div tag and lo and behold what we
see is the sidebar underneath of our
header and notice it's inside of the
wrapper if I come here and I click on
this little line that we see right here
in Dreamweaver that's actually my
wrapper my container div right of
container now we created that div with a
white background how come it's not
showing up you might imagine if sidebar
one is indeed stretching it out well it
is indeed stretching it out however we
won't see the background color until we
have a floating element underneath all
of the others and we'll get to that and
do time as we will see a little bit
later so I'm going to leave the text
inside of this but you know I'm just
going to clean things up a little bit
more because we have some space and
because it'll be easier for us to read
the information so you'll notice i'm
just going to separate things like that
and at the very end of this div hey
let's put in that comment just because
it'll make things easier to understand
and i'll say end of sidebar one and
that's perfect so we've got that
information while we're here when we
preview this in the browser after every
major milestone and you can see hey
that's great we've got our information
in place and we're going to be able to
move it around notice how it's all
within the container so as I move the
browser window the actual objects are
moving inside with the
container as well so that's all good
ready to go for our next step which will
be to create the following divs so that
they'll be next to sidebar number one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
