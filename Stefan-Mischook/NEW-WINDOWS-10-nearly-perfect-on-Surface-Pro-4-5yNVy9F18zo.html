nerd to do on a Saturday night except
drink coffee and vlog this is going to
be a quick vlog i'm using my surface
Pro's built-in webcam i'm actually in a
dark room but I got a spot on me and
nothing fancy bells is some three dollar
lamp and yeah so why am I vlogging today
I'm vlogging on the surface pro in
celebration of Windows tens latest
update which caused my system to hang it
just serve system updating system
updating for about two hours so i just
restarted it and the update continued i
was lucky knock on wood and but the
resulting version of windows 10 now is
the best i have seen to date and at
times in the past was pretty good so
what's cool about it now well now the
windows are working much more responsive
lee it's much quicker it's back to its
old zippy self it's becoming once again
a pleasure to work with the best tablet
and the most advanced computer
experience i have had to date don't get
me wrong i use mac OS it's one of my
main computers ever right there and when
the new macbook pros come out hopefully
this month i'm buying a brand new one
souped up to the max that said in terms
of operating systems windows 10 now is
in terms of functionality form factor
usability it is the more advanced
operating system in terms of stability
and in terms of elegance in design if
you will i still give it to mac OS but
if they can clean their game up
microsoft and continue to make it more
and more stable and more and more
dependable in terms of the win doing and
so forth and this last update this
happened yesterday is a big big upgrade
from where it was just you know the day
before then we got something cool here
another thing that is they added extra
functionality right off the main bar at
the bottom here I figure what they call
it they've given us three new thing
sticky notes so you just click on it
no it appears right on the screen you
can write notes with the pan and a pen
super responsive i said this pen is
crazy cool it's got the eraser on the
back so you're writing boo boo boo boo
boom and you can erase and it's just
like it's just like it's this responsive
as a real pen if not faster so now you
have sticky notes you boom boom boom put
them on your screen or probably get this
whole sketch pad takes over the whole
screen you can sketch out stuff come up
with ideas on the type of guy that likes
to write so this is cool for me and then
you can just SCAP sure your screen just
by clicking on it and then right over
whatever happens be on your screen at
that time so in terms of productivity
tools presentation taking notes
communicating with people it's amazing
it really is amazing Microsoft is so
close to having nearly a perfect
implementation of a true hybrid tablet /
pc they really got it down in terms of
how it works now if they can just
stabilize it further and don't get me
wrong it's very nice now I'm really
liking it now in terms of how the
windows work and so forth then big
thumbs up competition for Apple Apple
has got to really step up because I tell
you I'm telling you when you look at mac
OS as it is today even though it's more
stable etc etc it looks like a dated OS
it looks like it's really five year old
technology compared to where Windows is
in terms of its ideas its innovation in
terms of its usability again the prom
windows it's still flaky but its
flakiness has really diminished quite a
bit with this last update just from
yesterday so far really good so that's
it I figure these type of short blogs
it's a busy of my big project these type
of sharp vlogs are so much easier using
this really very good webcam built into
the surface pro 4 and yes I can knock
these out really quickly alright I hope
you found this vlog interesting
regardless of the operating system you
happen to use Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
