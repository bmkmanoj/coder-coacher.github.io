of the basic concepts of databases and
kind of basic concepts of SQL what we're
going to do now is move into actual SQL
code but just before we do that what I
want to do is look at an interface a way
of interacting with a very popular SQL
database and that is MySQL MySQL is used
quite a bit especially when it comes to
web apps and web hosting accounts MySQL
is now free and common you get your
basic web hosting you're gonna get a
MySQL account so we're gonna jump into
that first and right after that we're
gonna get into writing SQL code and I
will be inviting you at that point to
actually launch the w3 schools website
the SQL section so you can follow along
with me it's very important when you're
learning to code any language that you
do write code so take your time at
points pause the video and actually
write out some code and just get used to
writing out the SQL code anyway that's
it for now so let's jump into it okay so
let's pop open the web browser the first
we want to show you is control a control
panel here this is cPanel very common
control panel that you get with hosting
accounts and allows you to do all kinds
of different things including
manipulating files in your web
directories adding and creating MySQL
databases this is we're going to look at
here and whole bunch of stuff email
stats and so on so what I'm going to do
first of all I'll show you how you have
a web interface here with this cPanel
tool to basically create databases
inside of your hosting accounts so I'm
gonna click on this button MySQL
databases what does it in a point and
what this is going to bring up is this
interface here too but allows us to
create a database you see a database app
like MySQL is
an app it's an app as piece of software
it sits there and it has to be installed
and all your web hosting companies will
have this of course you can set up on
your own computer there's so many ways
but you can install database apps on in
terms of your server in terms of your
development and so on and I'm not just
talking about MySQL whether it be MySQL
would be whether it be post-grad whether
it be db2 any database app a lot of
people will just call database apps
database servers just like web servers
right because a database server sitting
there waiting for you to connect to the
databases that are installed in the
server app anyhow so what it's gonna
talk about MySQL because it's the most
common one out there and it's pretty
similar to all the others so you got
MySQL installed on this particular
server here and so using this web
interface by cPanel I can create
databases and once you create a database
then you can add tables to the database
so let me create a database I'm going to
call it I don't know just call a course
no I'm gonna call it something so soul
stands up killer so because this account
in this cPanel app is called HTML nerve
the way they set up the database is
always is prefixed with HTML nerve so
what does that mean that means that you
can name your database anything you want
a normally with MySQL except with cPanel
they have certain restrictions so this
is just a restriction it's not important
that you remember all this it's just so
much in the status quo so I'm just gonna
I'm just gonna give it a killer give it
the name of killer and say create
database either the debated the database
blah blah blah killer so let me go back
you just scroll down here don't scroll
down here excuse me oh here it is
database current databases so now I have
this database HTML and Arif killer
that's it so it's in there but it has no
tables so let me go back home so now
what we want to do is we have another
app
a web app called PHP my admin so this is
a PHP app that is designed to allow you
to communicate with a pay my SQL
database so I'm just gonna click on that
so here it is PHP my admin this is very
common and you can see it it's a it's a
web page it's a web app and you see
right here this database I just created
an HTML nerve so open this up nothing's
there look at see so now what we can
deal with this database select it I just
select the HTML nerve by clicking on it
says create a table so I can create a
table I'm going to call it customers
there's a customers to a number of
columns up and down somebody it's gonna
be 5 but we can edit this later on then
just go all the way over here hit go
there we go so we got our columns here
and now you can go in there
each of these call 1 column 2 column 3
column 4 comma 5 represents this call 1
column 2 column 3 column 4 you get the
idea right so I mentioned that because
when I first started using this myself
it was kind of confusing because this
was left-to-right creating our columns
in this app but you know when you
actually start using them they actually
appear like this I know it's kind of
weird you may be a little confusing for
now but just remember each of these 1 2
our columns and they represent these
type of columns here now just so you
remember I'm using a spreadsheet here to
demonstrate basic concepts spreadsheet
is not a database so anyway so now we
can start creating our columns so let's
say I had used a spreadsheet as the
basis of for planning my data basically
okay product ok you know that's products
was a little customers so here we go
it's like a customer ID customer name
customer oh so I can go customer ID so I
go here I go customer ID its name to
column now here's something here we can
look at we can look at all this now what
is all this here type what does the type
have to do with anything
the type
has to do with the type of data that's
in this particular column now what's an
int int is an integer varchar' is a
bunch of text and text is like a huge
amount of text now a date if you want to
track dates in a particular column I'm
not gonna get into this now because I
have another course where I actually get
into this but essentially when you're
creating your columns in your database
tables you have to tell MySQL what type
of information you're holding in this
column sometimes it could be a number
which is an integer sometimes it could
be just a limited amount of text which
is varchar' sometimes could be a huge
amount of text which is a text type
sometimes it could be a date blah blah
blah blah all kinds of things you can do
and then you can set lanes you can set
default values so let's say you set up a
column with a date you could set the
default to be the current timestamp
meaning today right now so whenever you
create a record for a particular let's
say it was a sale you have automatically
you have the database to just add to
date automatically so you don't have to
do it in code there's all kinds of other
things you can do not know no primary
index now here it is the index yes I
just wanted to go over this very quickly
now the index tells you whether or not
this is the key the primary key or the
key in the table remember I talked about
that the keys we go back here like the
key in this case we decide that customer
ID would be the key mean there can only
be one number one in this whole table
this way we were able to track our
customers so what this is asking us do
we want to make this particular column
the primary key and we go yeah
now we call primary because you can have
multiple keys in a table so I'm going a
little bit more advanced all you have to
know primary to talk about the primary
key and you can put comments and you can
do all kinds of other things as well but
again I get into much more detail we get
into much more detail about that in our
ride video so just so you know this is
how you would you would just walk
through you would create different
columns so you would have customer
customer ID you could have customer name
and you say well is his name so it's not
gonna be a number it's gonna be a bar
char and you can set the minimum length
it could be you know whatever 10
characters it really depends on what you
need to do so this is just one example
of how you can interact with a database
app in this case we're interacting we're
working with MySQL this is just one
example there are many other apps that
you can use to do this and so as a
teacher it's it's a choice this can be
it can be a difficult choice in terms of
determining choosing which app to
demonstrate with you because there's you
know there's so many out there that I
may show you let's say with PHP my admin
but you may never use it you may use
another tool so what to take away is the
basic principles of that you can have
many different apps that can interact
and work with a database now I'm not
gonna go through all this now because
like I said I do it in another course I
just wanted to show you this basic
interface that you can use to create
database tables in n create a database
inside of a database app so there's
another way you could do with code you
can actually write raw SQL code to to
create a table to do all kinds of
different things so it's it's yet
another way to interact with MySQL so
let me just go back to the w3schools
and I invite you now to open up the w3
school so you go into w3schools slash
SQL slash SQL underscore syntax dot ASP
and now we're gonna start exploring some
of the SQL statements
and what is an SQL statement an SQL
statement is the code is the SQL code so
there's tons of SQL statements there's
all kinds of different but right here
you see on the left-hand side all kinds
of interesting things we can do here all
kinds of these are not all SQL
statements but it teaches you how to
really work with SQL SQL has even
built-in functions just like you have
JavaScript functions so yes that's
pretty cool but we're not going to cover
every single thing here because this is
a beginner's intro to the subject but
what I want to bring your attention to
is something called crud crud is right
here cred refer crud and crud refers to
create read update delete these are the
basic operations that you do with a
database you create records you update
records you select information from the
records that's reading them and you can
delete records and a record of course is
like a row in a table this is one record
this is an X record and so on so using
these basic four commands and calling
the crud commands you're able to do all
these things which is you know 90% of
the SQL code and database work you're
going to be doing so let me just scroll
down a little bit here so you see
database application you see you know
here's the crud create read update
delete
so the actual xql commands are insert as
an insert any record select a record
update a record or delete a record now
it's not just one record you can select
many records you can update many records
you can do you know you can delete many
at the same time so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna learn how to do these
basic crud operations using the old w3c
now I could do it we could do it by
going into
we just shut this we can do it by going
into cPanel creating a database and then
doing it with within PHP mind min but
not everybody's gonna have cPanel they
may have another app but everybody can
access the w3c schools all the w3
schools and try out the various
statements here so let's start off with
the very first statement that you're
gonna do we're gonna do the SQL select
statement
now select allows you to read
information from a table so as I hit try
it yourself and yeah so this is the
basic one day they start you with select
star from customer so I'm gonna run it
and I'm gonna break this down for you
okay so we write it there we go here's
our customers table you see how it
loaded in nice and quick boom boom boom
lots of data lots of data right so call
one column two column 3 column 4 call
them for now sometimes these columns
some pit some nerds will call them
fields as in database fields so you can
decide what you want to call call them I
interchanged myself because I'm an old
school nerd hmm so first thing you got
to do is we look at the statement now
starts with the Select statement now it
could be lowercase it doesn't have to be
uppercase this or - boom but the
convention in SQL is that you're select
that skews me that your SQL keywords
like select our uppercase this allows
you to more easily read your select your
SQL code so you can differentiate
between keywords in SQL and data or
column names that you're looking to
identify so let this select star me star
is they call it the wild-card now it's
the same thing in computer languages
okay same thing even on your operating
system a star selection is basically
it's basically telling a computer
everything
so we're saying in this SQL select
everything from from as a keyword that's
why it's capitalized all caps customers
now what's custom
that's the table name this is the tables
customers right so if we don't want to
select everything we can select the
individual column so I can go select
this one cap tab ad D re s so select
address and that's this column here
address watch this run SQL boom see we
only get the addresses now right so
there you go let me go back to select
star I just so I can see the other
column names so I can select multiple
columns at the same time so I'm going to
say I want the customer ID and I want I
want the customer name and I want their
address on this a select a customer name
comma and I want the address from
customer see what happens
here we go CU customer name cursor
Rogers noticed how ignore this squiggly
underline that's just the browser auto
correcting for us notice how you know in
the table its capital C I did lowercase
it didn't affect everything I can do
that here as well still works so we know
that this is not case-sensitive other
database apps might be case sensitive
with mysql it isn't typically I just
like to keep everything consistent so in
our table when we've created it if we
use close camel case I prefer to use the
same camel case just so that it's clear
that's it so I able to select individual
columns at will by just naming a column
first column second column and by
putting a comma
now after your last column here I just
watch what happens see error could not
prepare statement oh boy see you can't
put a comma after your last column if
you int name individual columns that's
why you got this error here I won't
explain what this error means but so I'm
just see that's why you got no results
so when you're naming your individual
columns
the last column you can have a comma
here before the keyword from remember
now we're saying selective customer name
the customer address from it could you
know it's almost like instead saying
from the table customers is just from
customers because you're gonna just be
you're selecting from a table so slope
point in saying from the table customers
so that's pretty good pretty simple so
again to see all the tables again I'm
just going to go to star and I can do
all kinds of different operations so
let's say I wanted to select clients
only from Mexico so that's pretty cool
so I'll go select star from clients
where this is another keyword and SQL
where country oops
where a country is equal to and I'm
gonna go Mexico see what happens
boom not bad right see only clients from
Mexico so imagine you have thousands of
records you want to know instantly what
clients are from Mexico bang you see the
value of SQL you see the value of having
databases now watch what happens when I
take off these quotes because I'm
looking for the value in the country
field right this is the country table or
a country roll I call it feels right
field and row column same thing field
and column same thing and I say Mexico
now no quotes watch what happens oh
could not prepare another error so when
you're referencing text data in a in a
where and SQL where you have to quote it
just like you do in JavaScript to tell
SQL that this is actually text data
right otherwise it doesn't know what
you're doing so let's say postal code
you can do it for all of them postal
code address what not so this is this is
an example of another capability in SQL
something called the where Clause allows
you to filter your select statements
from your tables so we're saying only
bring us the customers where their
country is Mexico that's pretty simple
now you can also do a knot like this
right so all sudden it's giving us all
the clients in the database table which
is called customers the tables called
customers and we're saying where the
where the country member does the not
operators means not equal to so we're
saying all clients where their country
is not Mexico so you look at what came
back
nobody from Mexico every country but
Mexico so you're starting to see the
power just a simple where clause and
this is just one couple of simple
examples I'm giving you here and it's
kind of cool so I will suggest you come
here try it out try it out to select the
star try individual columns put in the
we're try to countries for a country for
a dress or whatnot
and that's gonna help you to get more
used to the Select statement pretty cool
so now what we're gonna do is go back
here
so yeah semicolon so you see in the w3
schools they give you all kinds of
commands and details here but we're not
gonna cover everything the idea here is
just to give you an overview so you see
the most important SQL commands here
they are the most important ones see
we're gonna deal with select update
delete and yeah it's pretty much what
we're gonna learn about if for now but
you see there's a lot you can actually
create an actual database with SQL you
can destroy databases do all kinds of
wacky stuff so there we go so let's go
to the next page you'll see what the w3c
the w3 tells us a select statement so we
see as we discover you can select the
column name and then the column me
remember I told you about this and then
from the table so we did that already
right we did a select star we tried it
out an example okay so we did all this
let's go to our next one select distinct
so what is distinct distinct allows you
to select distinct things from a table
let me show you what that means so
distinct we know it's a keyword in SQL
so it's all cap right doesn't have to be
but that's the convention so you'll
select distinct city from customer so
just running see what happens so
basically what this is doing it's
finding out from our customers database
checking in the city's column and
looking for a distinct city so it's
checking out to see what cities are in
this coffee so you see there is mexico
df and it appeared multiple times as we
know but because we're using distinct
it's only showing it to us once this is
a type of SQL query remember according
as a question this is an SQL query that
allows you to figure out very detailed
information about in this case what
cities people are buying from so this
allows you to you're gonna use this in
some situations distinct is actually
used fairly often let's say I have an
online store I'm going to say I just
want to know what's these people were
buying my products from if I had 10,000
clients from Mexico I don't need Mexico
to appear 10,000 times I just need to
see it once and that's what distinct
does see there we go I figure it out to
say it so what's let me just remove that
do the old star again and boom right you
see all the cities right you see with
Mexico twice once or twice right well
actually it's the city mexico df wants
twice by using distinct though we only
display it once we can do select
distinct in many different cases we
could do a country as well so let's do a
select distinct it's like distinct and
I'm not gonna say country I'm going to
say it's not City I'm gonna say country
from customers so now it's just gonna
sell you see Mexico appears twice know
what else I'm sure other countries
appear twice there's France twice France
ones France twice now watch with select
distinct country from customer see what
happens there we go
so we see all the countries that are
that I bought our products and you see
how the list is much shorter right
because when we don't use the state we
get all
things from Canada all those things
Switzerland so on so this is where
distinct comes in it's quite useful
alright let's go to the next one
ah the where clause we all recovered the
where clause that's pretty good so you
can go in there and you can start
filtering your information we did this
select from select star from customers
where a country is equal to Mexico in
quotes right we did that or you know
I'll do this one here so you can get a
different ID so let's run the SQL we're
customers see we got the customer IDs
right so let's just take out this we're
just for the sake of he knows there's a
semicolon here right now watch this take
out the where watch what happens okay no
problem
we can put the semicolon in here still
works it's optional so we got that
select star from customers now let's add
that back in or customer ID is e1 this
is the customer ID so we already have
what customer right ID boom now you
notice wine is not in quotes right and
the reason why there's not in quotes
because one is an integer it's being
stored as an integer if I put it in
quotes with an int the SQL is smart
enough to know that even though this is
stored as a 1 as an integer not as a
text it still works but put it as a 1 it
runs if I put it in a let's say well our
customer if the idea 3 it works so you
can see how now we can use the where
Clause to select not just text but also
select numbers from the database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
