you how are you so it's been a while
since I've done one of these so this is
Sunday afternoon I just wanted to wrap
up a few loose ends over the week I've
gotten ton of questions shot at me via
email and YouTube comments and Instagram
so I'm going to do my best over the next
several days to answer them at some
point in by spring I would imagine I
think I'm going to set up more of a
podcast type of situation where I'm
going to discuss a few things a I'm
going to be answering questions so I'll
probably list out all my questions and
spend might take me half an hour to
answer questions and I will also discuss
recent technology changes and I'll give
you my perspective going with my two
decades plus experience as a developer
I'll give you my perspective in terms of
what I see in each of these technologies
and whether it's something to pursue or
something to consider although if you've
been watching my vlogs you understand my
general perspective is to you know keep
your eyes open but not to jump down
every rabbit hole every new tech that
comes along but also I'm going to start
really twisting this into twisting but
I'm going to really start looking at
this from the point of view of business
that to me is the key to all this I
started writing code in 1994 not to
become a coder but because I wanted to
build a site for my business which had
nothing to do with technology and I
still look at code
I look at code as a tool for business
owners to be able to get stuff done it
it could be to build an app to be able
to build a website it could be to
automate processes and even back then it
was such an important tool to me and I
owe so much to coding today it's even
more pronounced if you want to become an
entrepreneur you want to start a
business or you have a small business
understanding code is such an important
tool set today I think it should be
taught in any business course so that
the business decision makers will at
least have an idea of what's going on in
terms of the coding world so they can
make more intelligent decisions about
what type of software what type of
software related tools that will
implement whether they roll out their
own or whether they hire certain people
how they you know be able to talk to
developers more intelligently be able to
judge their skill sets much more
effectively to be able to judge the cost
of projects much more accurately if you
have a bit of a background in coding so
from entrepreneurial perspective I
suggest every entrepreneur learn at
least a little bit of code and that
would be primarily the web stock HTML is
tuchis CSS a little bit of programming
specifically so they understand
server-side programming again not to
become an expert but just so you
understand it and grasp the basic
concepts this will save any business
owner any entrepreneur a lot of money a
lot of headaches and will allow you to
make a lot better business decision of
course a lot of you listening to this
blog now are you're probably looking to
become a professional developer whether
you want to get a job you want to be
freelancer or maybe must write your own
business so this not may not apply
perfectly but it's still you know I
think there's a lot of people out that
are still interested in business in
general so think of coding think of
programming as a tool set in your
toolbox it's a key one so
you got your coding tool set as an
entrepreneur also you should have your
communications tool set whether they be
writing well or speaking well but such
an important skill to have no matter
what you do and I've talked about this
in other vlogs anyway I think that's
pretty much it this is a little bit of a
rambling here so again to recap I'm
going to be looking to answer questions
put to me I think in a long-form format
meaning a podcast I will probably
release the podcast both on YouTube but
also in mp3 format so something get out
of iTunes I've been people have asked
this ask this of me many a times and I
used to do podcast way back in the day
but I'm able to start implementing that
again in the spring right now it's a
little busy with work with Studio Web
and the schools and so forth I'm working
hard while working hard we're working to
get studio web 4 out the door I'm not
ready to go for City web 4 and my
programmers doing that but it's I have
to go in there and like once they get
off with you guys Sunday afternoon I'm
going in to the beta and I'm gonna start
going through it and tearing it apart
pointing out what needs to be fixed and
adjusted we're very close that's the
thing about software developments that
last 5% of it takes up so much time and
unfortunately for me or fortunately for
me I have to be the one to go in there
and and start correcting and refining
things and so that people know what to
do in terms of what has to be fixed
before it's ready for production but I
have to say though after many months of
working on this new studio web which is
a rewrite from scratch I'm excited to
get it out the door because it provides
a whole bunch of new functionality and
refinements that I've been I mean
chomping at the bit to get going anyhow
that's it for the vlog bye bye
oh one last thing for those of you who
might be interested so I'm now in I
guess the middle of a 24-hour fast I
started last night but I broke down and
I bit I binge to eight Ritz crackers but
just kind of silly for me because all
those carbs are just terrible for you
blood sugar level spikes causes all
kinds of problems and and I'm lactose
intolerant so you know the cheese's
doesn't go over well too much although
the effects have been so bad today and
yeah that's what it is I used to be
highly critical people who are
alcoholics or drug addicts because I
don't I don't drink I don't do drugs I
have no inclination towards these things
and it's just crazy to get involved in
that kind of stuff if you don't know if
you're an addict or not don't don't even
tempt it it's not worth it
and so I used to be highly critical
because I know some people who are
alcoholics but I realized something
years ago that I shouldn't be so
critical because I was fortunate
fortunate enough to not be addicted to
those substances alcohol and hard drugs
what I am addicted to what I have a
proclivity is cheese and salty foods I
got a box of Ritz yesterday cheesy
crackers and I rarely eat these things
and I just ate the whole box I couldn't
stop myself and fortunately that's my
addiction so what I typically do to
avoid I just don't have this stuff in
the house I just keep it out of the
house and anyway so I ate that box of
rich yesterday and so as a result I'm
fasting alright the science that was
last night so I'm fast I didn't have
breakfast just a coffee and then I'm
just going to be later tonight so
24-hour flasks fast drink a lot of water
flush the water to flush the body let me
tell you at first time you do the
fasting it's it's it's it's jarring
because what's going to happen you're
gonna get the cold turkey reactions from
your body your body is going to list
we act like it's coming off of a hard
drug trust me it's the weirdest thing
and you can have anxiety could have
itches you're gonna have nausea spots of
nausea you're gonna headaches all these
things that like John Lennon did the
song called cold turkey all these things
that you know I remember for summer
fasted I had that reaction I had that
cold turkey reaction it was fascinating
Wow it's just like coming off at drugs
that you know not that I ever had done
that but if just like they described in
the songs and I realized was all the
sugar and the glucose and the from you
know from the breads and mourners the
coca cola's and the soft drinks and so
on and what happens is once you go
through that cold turkey it takes you
take 24 hours 48 hours depending on you
then I'll send like a light switch like
us and all those anxiety feelings the
headaches the nazia all of it crappy it
just goes away it's a six to eight let
you go and I'll send your craving for
that kind of food goes to zero it's
unbelievable after use fasted several
times your body honey gets used to it so
I don't get all those cold turkey
feelings anymore even though like I had
like a boxer wrist yesterday I've been
off you know I haven't had anything to
eat since last night it's the afternoon
now and I'm not gonna eat until tonight
and I'm gonna cut out all carbs I'm
gonna try to come out for another two
days I hope and let me tell you why
don't you get used to doing these
intermittent fast and again you should
consult your doctor at all this kind of
stuff I don't know what your medical
condition is blah blah blah saying this
for legal reasons I don't know I I
suggest exploring nothing has been
better for me in terms of my health now
about seventy seven years ago I guess it
is now or longer I decided I need to
lose some weight that was 25 pounds
overweight and so that's what I started
doing I started doing two things
intermittent fasting I started cutting
slowly cutting down my portions so if
you're eating four slices of pizza cut
it down to three
and two then one and zero I started
moving off of carbs and sugar based
glucose glucose based foods potatoes
glycemic index is something to look at
the good indicator moving off foods with
a high sugar content if you will hi my
Simek index and I'm being rough with my
terminology and then you want to get
into foods that don't have any they
don't contribute and to any in any way
to your sugar levels in your blood
that's meat and vegetables I'm doing
that I just feel better and better and
better and better
in fact after a good 24 hour faster so
your cognitive capacity your ability to
think actually goes up whether or not I
don't know why but it just happens I've
had talked to a good friend of mine same
thing same thing now he was diabetes he
had diabetes type 2 diabetes and he was
60 pounds overweight and he was on
insulin and all this kind of jump so he
said okay that's it so he went on a hard
diet got rid of all the glucose all the
sugars with the meat and vegetables and
he lost 60 pounds of the year and his
diabetes has gone it took about nine
months a year of his diabetes
disappeared and all he did was what I'm
talking about here
somebody consider anyway off on a
tangent but without a healthy body you
can't have a healthy mind and well it's
much harder to think as much hard to
operate if your pain you're sore you're
fine you
I think she's harder to think clearly
it's harder to think clearly it's harder
to code clearly it's harder to build the
business harder to come up with ideas
and if you're overweight you're
unhealthy now you're 18 you're 20 or 30
yeah you're not gonna feel it but let me
tell you let me tell you I know from
people I know it comes to get you comes
to get you hard in your 40s now what you
put into your body and how you treat
your body when you're younger is like
it's like putting money in the bank it's
it's there's a return on investment with
healthy eating and healthy habits and if
you do anything just cut out the sugars
and the breads eat less drink more
just and moderate exercise that's
another thing I'll leave it with this
I'm everything I discovered I used to be
a hardcore martial artist tons of
training and the roughest type of
training ever to the point where it
broke my nose three times in the ring
what I discovered is that being mentally
calm when you do your workout has
tremendous impact because what you want
to do is you want to have a calm relaxed
disposition when you're training if you
will and that's gonna happen it's gonna
help with the how your body releases
certain chemicals which is going to help
with the way your body reacts to the
training essentially moderate calm
training is going to do much better for
your health and hard core heavy-duty
fight-or-flight type of training your
psychological state has tremendous
impact in terms of how your body will
react to the physical exercise that you
exert if you can do calm training
relaxed training moderate training you
can have a much better result I can tell
you from personal experience all right
not coding related but very important if
you're healthy you're gonna be happier
and you're gonna do better you're gonna
be able to think better and that's
important in business and in your work
life besides your personal life all
