PHP calm and welcome to the classes and
objects video this video is just the
last bit of theoretical videos that
we're gonna go over and this is a short
one before we actually write some real
classes the reason that I'm doing this
last bit of theory is because I want to
be sure that when we we actually write
start writing our own classes and
objects in object-oriented PHP that you
will hit the ground running and you have
at least the basic theoretical
understanding again this is gonna be a
very short discussion because like you
theory bores me to tears so let's get to
it I'm now briefly going to discuss some
of the concepts that I wrote about in
the PDF classes and objects in PHP you
can find this PDF at killer PHP com just
do a search for PDFs and look for
classes and objects you'll find it there
it will give you the background material
required to be able to start creating
objects in real code but through those
were not big readers I'm going to
quickly go over some of the key concepts
that I write about in that document so
that when we do actually start creating
our objects you on the standard so let's
get to it now in a nutshell when you're
writing object-oriented PHP you're
actually creating a series of
programmatic constructs called objects
thus object-oriented essentially when
you write object-oriented code you think
of your project as being a series of
objects and as such the foundations or
the bricks if you will of any
object-oriented software is the objects
themselves so how do you create objects
in object-oriented PHP objects are
created
first creating something called a Class
A Class is I guess you could describe it
as a blueprint or an outline or a
template these are a few ways of
describing it for an object so you as a
programmer you would first write the
code for a class and the class basically
describes everything about the object
that you're gonna be running in your
program so you would write a class let's
say you might have a class called
process email and in that class you
wouldn't stick all your functions or
your variables and any sort of logic if
statement and so on inside of this class
and this class then this becomes the
blueprint for the object itself so what
I mean it becomes the blueprint well
essentially you as a programmer you
write your class and then what you would
do is you would tell the PHP engine
again using some code with some special
keywords to actually use that class
slash blueprint to actually create
living breathing objects in the PHP
memory space memory on the server so in
reality you as a programmer or not
creating the objects you're creating the
classes the blueprints you're the
architect and then you instruct the PHP
engine when the scripts are run to
actually create the living breathing
objects if you will from your classes
some of you probably picked up that
since the class the classes that you
write are the blueprints the templates
for your objects you can use the classes
to generate many many objects when the
PHP code is actually running we'll get
more into that later but that's one of
the powerful aspects of object-oriented
programming where once you've defined
created your class you can create many
many objects
from that one class and do all kinds of
funky things with it again this is you
know I know this is kind of nebulous at
this point but when you actually start
writing a code it will become totally
clear before I go on I just want to
point out one last thing I'm not giving
you guys so much theory up front because
I don't believe in front loading this
type of stuff with tons of theory
because you're just going to forget most
of the theory anyway so what I prefer to
do is to give you the minimal amount of
theory so that we can get right into it
and actually start readying code and
building objects and our writing our
classes and so forth in our next video
we're going to sit down and write our
very first PHP classes and then from
those classes we're going to create or
generate objects using the PHP engine of
course ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
