at the road map file we've worked
through quite a bit of functionality on
this content management system and
basically the last main items that we
need to do or actually to build out the
content management side of things we
need to create editable regions that
will display and that users can edit and
add in our what you see is what you get
functionality to make the editing those
regions easy so but before we get
started on that I just wanted to take a
step back and say congratulations for
getting this far we're now on video 27
so it means you've worked your way
through quite a few videos to get here
so thanks for following along and I hope
you're finding this useful so if you do
encounter any issues or questions as
you're going along with this you can
always email me at been at kelly sites
com or post on the killer sites forums
at kabul sites calm / community so I'm
around if you need any assistance with
this so now that we have finished that
let's go ahead and dive into the actual
content management side of our system so
probably best thing for us to do now
would be to leave the core folder alone
that has the basic login and logout
functionality we need but let's create a
new folder I'm going to call it CMS
because it's going to contain the main
content management side of our
application and within the CMS folder
I'm going to basically copy the various
files here I'm going to have a month or
actually I don't even need a file here
i'm going to copy the folder structure
from the coro folder so anyway
include a models folder I don't think we
need templates i think it's just views
that we need here and within the CMS
folder i'm going to create a new file
it's going to be called em underscore
CMS PHP so this is going to be our main
content management model and within the
views let's go ahead and create a view
for V underscore edit dot PHP and we'll
come back to this in a little bit but
we'll be using these files as we go
forward so to start with let's open up
our models file and start by creating a
basic model so this is going to be our
CMS class and it's going to handle all
CMS tasks such as allowing admins to
view and edit content
like so and I think we're going to be
having a variety of different content
types so I'm going to try to do just the
basics for the moment and add to it as
we go along but I'm going to do a
private content types variable and I'm
going to make it an array and it's going
to hold a couple different content types
that the user will be able to use in
this content management system it's
going to hold something for what you see
is what you get field like this it's
going to hold a content type for a basic
text area and it's going to hold a
content type for a simple one-line input
element and then let's create a
construct function
and I think what we're going to be doing
here is we're going to have quite a few
functions within this CMS class and
they're all going to refer back to the
global FP object so I'm going to create
private FP and a rather than using
global FP let me put this in here rather
than adding this line at the top of
every single function I've created a
temporary variable that it will exist
within this class so this FP and rather
than simply duplicating the FP object I
want the FP object within this class to
directly refer to the global variable so
I do that using an ampersand FP so any
changes or commands that we call to this
FP will directly affect the global FB
object so that takes care of the
construct function and it allows us to
access the global FP variable but let me
take a brief step back and talk about
how I'm going to approach this
functionality I'm trying to build this
out involves a lot of complex functions
we're going to be needing to be able to
view content be needing to be able to
grab content from a database update
content create content blocks if one
doesn't exist so I'm going to try to
separate this into small steps and build
up to creating this large piece of
functionality I think the first step is
going to be to edit our index dot PHP
file and replace some of the HTML
content with calls to a function that
retrieves that content and displays it
within the page so I'm going to focus on
that first and I'm going to focus on
putting the right HTML in place so that
when you edit the page it's obvious to
the user that certain areas of the page
are editable
so let's adjust the index dot PHP you
file a little bit I think we're going to
be using if we go back to this we're
going to be using a variety of content
types and the first one I'm going to
replace the content within the h2 and
I'll do opening and closing PHP tags and
I think the first thing that I want to
do is do FP CMS and I want to display
the block and I'm going to create a
function in a couple seconds called
display block and it's going to have two
parameters it's going to have an ID and
it's going to have a type and the ID can
be basically anything my idea here is I
wanted to be as flexible as possible and
it could be a phrase it could be a
simple one word it shouldn't have too
many restrictions on it so i'm going to
call this content header
and we're going to have it use the one
line contenttype and i'm going to copy
this line I'll place this content i'm
going to call this main content and this
one is going to be what you see is what
you can what you get kind of block and
i'm going to create this display block
function so that it defaults to the
what-you-see-is-what-you-get type so i'm
going to skip adding in a second
parameter in the right class area i'm
going to have whoopsie we'll just copy
that again I'm going to have I guess two
blocks here and i'll just say that this
right area is used for some sort of
quote area I mean I'm not being too
picky about this but so I'm going to say
it content quote and content um I'll
call it attribution I guess I'm like I
said I'm not sort of making this up as I
go so so the first block will hold a
person's quote on the second block block
will hold who said that quote so I
believe that takes care of it I mean
obviously if you preview this you're
going to run into issues because we
haven't linked things up correctly so
that's going to be the next step let's
go to our core PHP and after creating
the off object
I'm going to create the CMS object so
I'm going to include at path it's going
to be CMS models hmmm underscore CMS and
use this CMS equals new CMS and then up
above here i'm going to add in an extra
variable CMS like so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
