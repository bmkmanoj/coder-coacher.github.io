this quick blog video well I'm recording
this with a webcam now unedited of
course it's not going to be HD videos
not you know so the qualities will be
less but it's a lot easier to do so i'm
going to do these type of commentary
blogs using the webcam so yeah I hope
you can stand a lesser quality of the
video anyhow in this particular video
want to comment on web design degrees
and colleges and the reason I want to
speak about this is because I I heard or
read or saw a piece an article about
this girl who recently graduated from
school sociology sociology degree excuse
me and she has about 190,000 dollars in
debt so she's putting up a site is
trying to get her debt paid off through
donations and so she's getting some
press and radio time and to me what's
remarkable remarkable about the story is
that somebody got into you know nearly
200 grand in debt and this is debt you
know if you not aware if you have
student loan debt you can't in the US
you can't write it off this is you know
this is indentured servitude like you're
locked in you have to pay this debt it's
really a bad situation to be in so you
know the first thing I want to say
before I get to the whole website web
programming thing first thing I would
advise you is like you don't do this you
don't get yourself into these type of
crazy gets especially if you're going to
one of these are that you know sociology
psychology you know philosophy these
kind of things you know you're going to
rack up a couple hundred grand it better
be in something good like you know you
know being a doctor or something
otherwise you're crazy you know my
advice if you want to study these things
philosophy history by kindle
under eighty six bucks and you could
probably down apparently got thousands
of free books you can probably download
all crimes and philosophical texts and
you can you know join a philosophy form
and move this on your on your own
because at the end of the day whether
you spend two years or four years of
your life doing this at home for Kindle
and rack up at that of 186 bucks for
your kindle or you go to school rack up
two hundred grand to have a degree from
so College in both situations you're not
going to get a job or are you going to
get a crappy job so you can just forget
it when it comes to web design though
it's a lot more practical because you
can you know get decent paying jobs and
you get into your high-end designer if
you get into web programming especially
it would be even better because we're
programmers once you have a couple years
experience under your belt you'll be
able to command a lot more money here's
the thing though you have to consider
that when you're looking for working web
design most employers are not going to
really ask you about your degrees you
know I never do what I hire people I the
last thing I consider is whether or not
they have a degree my concern is whether
or not they have skills and experience
so you're much better off to take your
time invested some good videos okay I'm
plugging here but you know you know
whether it be our videos at killer sites
calm killer video store calm or wherever
else or books or whatnot you're much
better off to spend a few hundred
dollars in videos and good books and
then a lot of practice as opposed to
thousands of dollars and years of your
life and where I'm not going to really
look at your degree i'm going to look at
your skills so you decide what you want
to do but the end of the day don't think
that a web design degree is going to
help you much and getting a job it can
especially with programming software
engineering if you're going if you want
to try to give Joe a google or something
yeah
the Greek comes in but handy but you
know seventy percent of us do not work
for big large corporation to have
bureaucracies and red tape you know that
they assume that you know they need for
you to have a degree because that's just
their system yes it's part of the no I'm
not going to get into that right now so
anyway well here's what you want to take
away from this video if you want to get
into web designer web programming and
you're considering a college situation
where it's going to cost you tens of
thousands of dollars and you and you
have to go into debt to do this
understand a couple things number one
that most people are not going to care
and not even give it you're not going to
care about whether or not those about
the square there or so you're not going
to care whether or not you have a degree
and there were two if you get into
student loan debt this is that you
cannot write off you cannot go bankrupt
and get rid of it which is really really
precious in my opinion yo you know
businesses can write off debts and is
called bankrupt you know but for some
reason they decided I going to punish
students by not allowing to go bankrupt
so you got these poor students like this
woman who's got a couple of hundred
grand in debt with a sociology degree
and she said she'll be a dead slave for
at least 20 years it's like it's crazy
it's a crazy situation to be it and I
feel so bad for people that way so what
I learn web design you're looking to get
a career before you decide to join the
college but all kinds of money consider
otherwise consider my two points and
that's it for now ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
