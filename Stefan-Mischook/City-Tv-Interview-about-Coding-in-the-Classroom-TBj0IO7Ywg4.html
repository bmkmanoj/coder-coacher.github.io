interview it was with City TV local TV
station up here in Montreal went fairly
well I'm told and it was pretty cool I'm
I'm okay in front of the camera I think
because of all my work and video
tutorials and of course all these
YouTube videos it's probably helping me
out as well practice makes perfect as I
think ice mentioned in a previous blog
one of the reasons I'm doing all these
YouTube vlogs it's just to get more
relaxed in front of the camera and to
get used to speaking about subject so
you know whatever that's it so well it's
part of the process I guess with a
company you have to start getting into
media I've been doing all my marketing
and media really forced to your web
online from my websites sites calm
killed a PHP how to build websites CSS
tutorial and a little bit on youtube as
you know but I think the next step is of
course traditional media TV magazines
and so on so this is a start we'll see
what happens is he how come what comes
of it i'll let you know how it goes i'm
not sure if appearing on local TV is
going to have any impact maybe i'll get
other interviews on radio or maybe some
other local TV I don't know I have to
see there's a few station up here up
here in Montreal and had to be honest
with you had fun it was easy just went
into the green room waited around they
brought me and put some makeup on and
that was it I only had a four minute
segment I'm gonna try to find it and get
it up on youtube so you guys could see
it but you're just going to hear me talk
about the usual stuff but it's gonna be
very very studio web-centric and it's uh
it's very cold centric but from a higher
level would I mean by that i'm not i'm
not talking two coders here i'm talking
to non coders so it's very simple stuff
but anyway it was a good experience i
recommend it to anybody to try it out
it's fun and people at City TV were very
very helpful it was fun seeing the
studio behind the scenes that I wish I
would have filmed it I was not
comfortable filming it with my cell it
doesn't take great video anyway but kind
of it was kind of like a very sparse set
to be honest they had take three or four
big cameras two or three operators and
into and the two hosts and it's called
breakfast TV and they just it's Remnick
operation it's quite it's quite it's
impressive to see how organized it is
and they just go through his stuff real
quickly and that's pretty much it so it
was good experience and thanks for
watching the vlog more to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
