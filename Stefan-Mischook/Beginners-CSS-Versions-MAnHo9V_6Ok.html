briefly talk about the versions of CSS
and how that affects you and your use of
CSS in your websites what evers want to
tell you is that there is a few
different versions of CSS floating
around out there different
specifications CSS one CSS to and css3
at this time most of the major browsers
including IE and firefox and so on
support the major functionality or the
majors specifications in CSS one and two
css3 stuff those is very very sketchy so
what's the difference between CSS one
three and two and the rest well it's
actually CSS one CSS to and css3
essentially it has to do with the
functionality of CSS everything that
we've done in the CSS course is
supported by all the major browsers that
means IE six seven and eight more seven
and eight that's our real target and
Firefox and Safari the key to all this
and what to take away from this is that
you may be tempted at some point in some
other you may find other articles where
they talk about some css3 capabilities
or some rare CSS 2.1 capabilities and
there's there's some real cool stuff no
question but what you're going to find
is that many of these cool things are
not supported very well in certain
browsers a lot of times internet
explorer doesn't do a great job with
them and since still the majority of
people use Internet Explorer out there
something like seventy percent or more
depending on you know the particular
website nonetheless it's such a
significant portion of people it doesn't
make sense to fiddle around with
advanced CSS that the majority of the
audience simply will not see so let's
look at this for a second i'm at a
microsoft site here msdn site and this
is basically their information site for
for nerds so I'm looking at the CSS
compatibility and Internet Explorer and
this is a very technical article and I'm
not going to go through everything here
what you find on this page is a
discussion as to how and what properties
ie supports so if we scroll down you see
it talks about the various selector
types and attributes in CSS I quality
call my out and so forth so let's let's
look at a few things for instance so you
see the version of IE what supports now
if you look at some things like see you
know all these interesting CSS rules are
supported by IE seven and eight
partial support here no sport here we're
not going to get into this year but what
you want to take a look away from this
as we scroll down we have some pretty
good support here but when we get into
CSS 2.1 pseudo classes we scroll down we
see a lot of this stuff is not supported
even in ie8 right no no no no no no and
realistic today realistically today you
have to support definitely IE seven
eight and even to a certain extent I
ecigs at this time in 2009 strangely
enough I still get on Keller sites com
maybe seventy percent ie6 users so I
don't want to alienate seven or eight
percent of my audience that's it's not
cool so look at all these CSS rules and
all these selectors that pseudo classes
rather but we simply cannot use so this
is a reason why in the courses and in my
teaching of CSS I stick to the stuff
that works across all four browsers and
I'll let myself get lured in by visa
these sometimes very cool CSS prog
capabilities sochi css3 stuff here but
not in a browser support and they won't
for years so just no point getting into
and wasting your time there
so to know what CSS to use if you stick
to the basics elector types as we
discuss in the videos and you stick with
those basics you should be in a good
position there are charts out there will
show you the different what browser
support what functionalities you can
come here for instance what you're going
to find is that Firefox and opera and i
believe the Safari browser are usually a
little bit ahead of Internet Explorer in
terms of supporting the latest CSS
features it doesn't really matter though
because again Internet Explorer is the
majority of the audience you have there
the lowest common denominator and you're
going to have to support them so you can
find charts on msdn as we did here just
do a search for CSS compatibility
Internet Explorer and you can find this
another thing you can simply do is just
just test to stretch something out and
test it out as I tell programmers who
work for me test first ask questions
later ultimately if you try something
just load it up in the browser and see
if it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
