talking about building a very simple
WordPress theme and we ended up with a
theme that basically wasn't broken and
it's sitting here it's my template we
don't even have a screenshot for it yet
that's okay
in fact for now we'll just leave it like
that and this template when we activate
it it just says my new template which
also so happens to be the name of our of
our website which is my new template if
we go back to text Wrangler we can see
that we've put in two link tags one for
the RSS and another for the pingback
which is the official URL of the page
that we're actually sitting on and then
this little declaration here which is
the WP underscore head which lets people
know that we're in fact using WordPress
again you could omit this if you wanted
to now down here I've got a PHP block
and I've got a blog info and then I've
got name which is the actual name of the
blog that we're actually developing I've
got blog info name which is the name of
the website or blog that we're
developing now I'm gonna cut out a lot
of this white space that I put in the
last video because it's not necessary
and it kind of clutters things and I'm
just gonna add some new lines now when
we go back to our dashboard here under
settings I can see that there's also a
tagline now I want to get that tagline
in there too so I'm gonna just create an
h2 and in the h2 I'm going to put in
another PHP block and I'm gonna say blog
info and this is description and I'm
gonna save that now if i refresh this
page I'm gonna see just another
WordPress web blog which happens to be
the tagline that I have here as well
already we're creating a link between
what is being put in the dashboard and
what's appearing on our website now our
website isn't particularly interesting
right now but we can change that too now
if I view the source
I'm not linking in any way to the style
dot CSS file that I created in the last
video so let's do that now I'm gonna
close this view source window which I
got to by the way by just going view and
then page source this is on Firefox and
I'm going to reference that CSS file
that I created in the last video which
is just sitting here and it's basically
empty as well to do that I'm just gonna
create some space in my head section and
I'm going to type link Arielle Arielle
is the relation style sheet and
hyperlink reference equals and then
again we're gonna do something with blog
info blog info style sheet URL semicolon
and I'm gonna double quote that type
equals text slash CSS and I'm just gonna
close that now let's see what this does
for us if i refresh this page and I view
my page source again I'll see that
WordPress has actually figured out where
my stylesheet is sitting on the web
server now if we take this a step
further and I go to style dot CSS and I
say that I want my body and I'm gonna
open this up background to be read and I
save this in my background will turn red
that's not very appealing to the eyes so
let's just delete that for a minute
now something I like to do when I'm
working on a website is I like to clear
all the padding and the margins that the
browser will have by default and to do
this I'm going to use the star and then
I'm going to open my squiggly brackets
and I'm going to say padding:0
0 margin:0 0 and this will make
everything 0 if i refresh it everything
is going to be hugging the top left of
the page generally speaking it's nice to
have some kind of fixed width or
container where I can store the body of
my website in order to do this I'm gonna
go back to my index dot PHP file and
instead of just having my header and my
header to my blog info name and my blog
info description sitting under that body
I'm gonna create a div here and my div
is going to be of class header and I'm
just going to indent these two lines and
I'm gonna close my div here and I'm
gonna hit save now nothing should happen
perfect so what I've done is I've
identified a section of my blog or a
section of my template rather that I
want to be classified as a header before
we keep going I'm going in the style dot
CSS file I'm gonna create another div
and this one is going to be called
canvas and I'm going to indent this
again so if we think about this in terms
of a canvas or a frame where we can
actually put content and then a header
we're creating a very simple language
for defining how our style sheet or our
template is going to be rendered
now that I have canvas and header I can
properly use them in my style dot CSS
file so I'm going to do canvas and I
want my canvas to be about 900 pixels
wide and I wanted to have a background
that's white this is hexadecimal and I
think that's it now I want the
background of my body to be some kind of
green
so let's see if my hexadecimal is decent
in fact you can just put anything in
there
perfect so what you're seeing is you're
seeing a 900 and pixel canvas and then
beneath it our body has a green
background and everything inside the
canvas is now sitting on a white
background we can make this center line
by just going and typing margin:0 and
then auto now the first declaration here
for margin corresponds to the top and
the bottom margins for the particular
element that we're dealing with the auto
corresponds with the left and the right
margins of the element that we're
dealing with so when I hit save again
this should be now Center aligned so
already our template is starting to take
a little bit of shape another thing I
like to do is I like to stay away from
Times New Roman
since Times New Roman tends to be a very
good font for print but not so much when
you're trying to read something on a web
page I'm gonna go into the star over
here and I'm gonna say font family
Helvetica Arial saw serif what this
means is that if the person has
Helvetica installed on their computer
they're gonna be able to see it as
Helvetica if not they'll see it as Arial
which pretty much everybody has and if
not that then just any kind of saw serif
font basically a font like Arial that
doesn't have any service that doesn't
have any little nooks at the end of the
letters so if i refresh this page again
we move to a Helvetica typeface now the
next step is to build what is called the
loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
