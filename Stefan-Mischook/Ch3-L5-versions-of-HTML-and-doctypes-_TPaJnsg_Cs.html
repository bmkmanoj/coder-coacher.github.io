about the versions of HTML and the doc
types let's look at HTML now before you
fall asleep don't worry it's gonna be a
quick one and you're gonna see why
quickly why it makes sense to understand
the history of HTML well we're just
gonna learn a little bit so HTML was
first invented in nineteen and
ninety-one and by a guy named Tim
berners-lee and you can see how it
progresses HTML there's HTML 2.0 HTML
3.2 he's showing 4.01
so XHTML what's that
XHTML is actually a nother computer
language it's based on another computer
language called XML and it was made to
look like and work like HTML and it was
very popular for many years but now like
all the previous versions of HTML XHTML
is no longer the language what you want
to use to build webpages today going
forward html5 in 2014 became pretty
solid and it's the standard and it's the
language you want to use to build your
websites I mention all these versions of
HTML because of the doc types you see as
you remember when we did our basic web
page you notice we had this doctype at
the top of the page and what the doctype
does is it tells the web browser which
version of HTML that we're going to be
coding in in our pages these days we
want to use the html5 doctype which is
this one here but sometimes when you
look at older sites you may come across
you may have to edit them who knows you
may run across some older doc types
where the websites are using older
versions of HTML or maybe XHTML look at
these doc types now the latest and
greatest version html5 the one you're
going to be using looks like this nice
and simple now the old ones look at HTML
for point
one look at how big this one was look at
xhtml even bigger so what happened is
with the nerds in charge of HTML and so
on they said you know what let's make
HTML simple so html5 was designed to not
only be much more powerful than HTML
4.01 or XHTML it's not only much more
powerful it's actually a lot easier and
a lot quicker to write and one example
is the doctype look how much simpler it
is verses these down here sometimes when
surfing the web or maybe you might do a
web project for a friend or you're
somebody in your family who knows you
may run across the site that has an
older version of HTML so let's take a
look at studi web for instance right
click you page source and if you can
look here you see that
Stevi web is a new site and it has the
latest version of HTML we know that
because we see the html5 doctype right
at the top of the page where it should
always be let's compare that to one of
my older sites Kahler sites com this
site was first built in 1996 it was
pretty old and it was updated over the
years but it needs some updating still
so if you look at this code you notice
that killer sites uses an older doctype
it uses the HTML 4.01 doctype just want
to mention this so you know that there
are still sites out there that use the
older doc types you may run across them
and I just wanted you to know you know
what they look like and I want you to
understand that there were different
versions of HTML over the years but
nowadays we're lucky enough to have HTML
5 which is the latest and greatest it's
simpler it's more powerful it's a great
version of HTML to learn and use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
