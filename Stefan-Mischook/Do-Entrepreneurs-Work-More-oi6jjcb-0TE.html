entrepreneur of law I'm not a tech vlog
although this will apply to any type of
entrepreneur tech entrepreneur - so when
you become an entrepreneur
are you working less or are you working
more than an employee
99% at a time you are working much more
but you have more freedom typically
meaning you don't necessarily have to be
at particular places at a particular
time as you do when you work for
somebody you have the freedom to choose
what type of contracts or type of work
that you work on it gives you a lot of
freedom but in the end from my
experience for 28 years you actually
have less time in many respects until
you establish yourself and you get
yourself in a good position but what
happens even when you're well
established you find that your business
really takes up a lot of your time
mentally so even if you're not in front
of a desk even if you're not in meetings
even if you're not traveling for work
you are thinking about it you're taking
notes you're you're writing things down
you're just mentally engaged just even
at dinner and that is just a reality of
the situation because when you have a
business when you are an entrepreneur
even a freelancer
it's almost endless work you bet you
have and not necessarily for clients or
directly related to products or services
that you are offering it's just the
nature of the game if you have to deal
with products and services that you're
offering if your attack whether you have
always thinking about software issues
that you have to contend with server
issues that you have to contend with
whether just marketing strategies or
hiring people or dealing with dealing
with employees etc etc so I'm not trying
to dissuade you I just want you
understand when you are an employee
there it actually is a lot less pressure
on you because you know you're gonna get
paid you know what your hours are and
you don't have to there's a lot less
mental energy expended versus
being of the owner or the boss trust me
when you have to come up with things
create structures drive things forward
what are the roles of the of the
entrepreneur is you have to be the wheel
of the company you have to be the will
to push things forward that's something
you don't have to do as an employee most
of the time maybe when you get into
upper upper upper upper upper management
you might have to do that well you
probably have to do that but I'm telling
you as a business owner you have to be
the will and when you start having
people working for you then you have to
be the will for them as well you have to
push them as well and that is there's a
strategy to that and there's an art to
that leadership isn't beating people
with a stick it's it's more like
encouraging people it's more like
showing them how to get to what do you
need to go and that's a big part of it
so when you have to be the will for
yourself that's hard enough but when you
have to be the will for yourself and
others around you that's even more
effort so keep that in mind being an
entrepreneur is is very challenging at
first but it's also very rewarding not
just in terms of money but in terms of
just accomplishing things building
things but being an employee and being a
key person writing code for a piece of
software or whatever that also that also
can be rewarding as well depending on
what drives you and that's a big part of
what I talk about in this course what
I'm about to put out is you have to
really determine what motivates you what
is what really lights your fire and will
propel you forward in your career
because no matter what you do there's
gonna be periods where it's gonna be
walls that you're going to hit so you
have to really enjoy the lifestyle you
have to really enjoy the type of work
that you do overall so that you can plow
through those difficult stages and
that's it for this vlog bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
