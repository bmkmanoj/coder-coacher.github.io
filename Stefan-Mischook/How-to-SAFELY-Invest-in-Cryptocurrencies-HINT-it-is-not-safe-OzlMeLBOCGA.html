there how to invest in cryptocurrencies
there's many different strategies you
can take people are getting into it but
I want you to understand from somebody
who's seen asset bubbles before is that
when you are in an asset bubble people
who believe in it the the loyal
followers if you will they don't see an
ass asset bubble and then when the thing
crumbles are like what happened what
happened
so it's an asset bubble but asset
bubbles can go on for years so you never
know what will happen with these crypto
currencies let me give you a couple of
tips that I think that will serve you
well if you decide to get into it and by
the way full disclosure I am getting
into it a very little bit well first
thing first rule don't go into it with
money you can't afford to lose it's
gambling money it's betting money number
one number two you're never gonna know
you're not going to know which currency
is gonna go up which one's gonna go down
he's currency in quotes because you got
you know Bitcoin litecoin
etherium they got a - coin you got a
deal 50 others Ripple what I would
suggest that you do one strategy is to
hedge your bets what does that mean that
means let's say you got $10,000 to
invest a small amount pick the top 5
coins that you think that are out there
and there's ways of evaluating that I
won't get into that in this video we
take top 5 coins and you sprout your
10,000 amongst the top 5 you never know
which one's gonna go 10 fold a hundred
fold with this crazy market now why
would you want to do that strategy
because one thing I've learned over the
years in terms of investment you never
know which one is gonna work you may
think but bitcoins that is going to be
decaying forever and maybe that will be
the case but then ripple might shoot up
as it just did or some other type of
coin might shoot up that you think that
had a good has a good chance so a great
strategy to maximize your chance of
catching one of those big gains is to
spread out your money amongst the top 5
so you put two grand in each - two - two
- and you see what happens right
now will you get the maximum possible
you come no if you put your ten thousand
you happen to pick that one
cryptocurrency with does unbelievable
then of course you would have made more
money but chances are you know you'll
miss it so what you should do is you
spread out the five so if any one of
them does a twenty five times or fifty
times you've regained all your money
you've made really good profit so that's
the strategy I would look at it
one of the things I was considering when
I was looking back at cryptocurrencies a
few months back once again because if
you saw in my previous vlogs I had I was
looking to buy bitcoins whatever seven
years ago when it was like four or five
cents apiece something like that it was
four or five cents so whatever seven
years ago eight years ago I forget now
and we got three quarters from the
process and I was just gonna buy with my
buddy we're just gonna buy a thousand
dollars u.s. but today at these crazy
prices my my personal stake in Bitcoin
be worth over two hundred million crazy
now here's another tip for you young
budding investors speculators
speculation is a is a wall street term
for gambling anyway the chances of me
holding until today are like next to
zero very few people do very few people
do you have to be a true believer I
wasn't a true believer then I'm not a
true believer now I think that crypto
currency technology the blockchain has
some application in the real world but
I'm not I don't think any of these coins
will have any significant impact on that
could be wrong but yeah so anyway you
take your money at 10k or whatever it is
that's reasonable to you in terms of
what you can afford to lose and you put
that out there you deploy it you spread
it around and you catch and hopefully
you catch some action as it goes up now
how long you hold that's anybody's guess
I hear heard of read somewhere that
apparently the Korean government is
thinking of putting in some really
strict controls in terms of who can buy
and sell cryptocurrencies I don't know
how too bad it is I don't know what it's
going to be implemented if it is I'm not
sure what the impact is
you got to understand that what's really
driving this mark as far as I understand
our Japanese the Japanese are now buying
up 40% of the Bitcoin cuz that's huge
huge percentage of the Bitcoin market is
driven by the Japanese and then you have
the Koreans or also driving that market
in a big way so between the Koreans and
the Japanese it's huge now if the Korean
government puts laws in place that keeps
Koreans from getting into this market or
buying in this market a substantial way
it could have a huge impact in terms of
the price of the crypto so I'll keep
that in mind another thing that you
should learn about investing I've seen
is that sectors tend to move together
what does that mean that means if
Bitcoin is going up that means though
the vast majority of the cryptos will
probably move up with Bitcoin if Bitcoin
starts going down the vast majority of
Krypton's will probably go down yes
there'll be some variation you know
Bitcoin may go down one day and etherium
will go up that same day but in by the
quarters every three months or every six
months or over the year perhaps you'll
see that the cripples will move together
don't move in tandem as they say I've
seen that so many times in the larger
equity markets whether it be well
equities which are stocks and I've seen
when all the shippers the dry shippers
were doing really well they all did well
then when the dry shipping enthusiasm
died all the shippers just crashed in
terms of valuation same thing with oil
when oil was huge everybody was into oil
that's all the oil companies were
amazing now they all crash boom etc etc
so you're gonna see how these markets
sectors are cause sectors market sectors
move together to move in tandem so
cryptos are in now it's the hot thing
they could stay hot for six years it
could stay hot for six months who knows
but they're moving together now so keep
that in mind but some will move more
than others you never know so I think
the best strategy is a spread out and
your money your gamble
money and invest in their top five or
whatever he feels comfortable with and
then see what happens
another option is to do the mining
equipment now I bought miners my friends
button theory of miners and see akoi
miners were the same and I also bought
some miners as well and when I bought
the miners I was singing myself maybe I
should just buy the coins and I have to
tell you I should have bought the coins
it's it it would be much better off for
me to buy the coins than to buy the
miners so this is not a cryptocurrency
vlog it is a business and technology
coding vlog I'm trying to bring real
world coding and business experience
into this including investments I was
actively trading from away to 2011 or
2010 pretty big money so it was I have a
lot experience I've seen all these
mechanisms I think I seen all these
things play out the thing that reminds
me most of this cryptocurrency boom that
we're seeing now is the gold and silver
boom if you go back watch do YouTube
videos with gold and silver guys or
watch the Ruger et ille vlogs you're
gonna see the same arguments for people
who are pro silver Pro metals pro gold
the same exact items that you see today
with regards to cryptocurrency don't let
these investments become religion I'll
leave that at that if there's enough
interest in this
these crypto investment videos and
business perspective visa vie crypto and
investment and so on I'll do others to
expand so many subjects but that's about
it
