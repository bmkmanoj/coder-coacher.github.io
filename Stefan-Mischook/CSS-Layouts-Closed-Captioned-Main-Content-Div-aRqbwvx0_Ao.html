navigational element here the sidebar
number one right next to it we're going
to define our content area and that's
going to be the larger area that's going
to contain most of our type and text but
you know we'll have room for text in all
of these however this is going to be the
main area so under the insert div tag
and click on it and we're going to come
in here and let's just call it content
and we'll define a new CSS rule as well
so here's content in the external style
sheet clicking ok and at this point what
we're really defining is we don't have
to define anything for positioning and
if we go to box we're not floating this
left or right because the other two
columns are going to be floating left
and right all we got to do here is
define the width area that we want it to
be so I want it to be 600 pixels and
that's exactly what we're going to be
doing we're not really dealing with
padding or anything else along those
lines that'll all come later but first
all we're really defining at this moment
in time is how to get the skeleton and
the architecture of our layout laid out
exactly the way we want it to be so you
can give it a background color if you
wish I'll just give it white for the
moment and as you'll see its content
should be with a white background once
we preview it inside of our work so
other than that i'm not really doing
anything else inside of this particular
area so we'll just click OK and we will
insert it at that point that we defined
earlier so if you'll notice here is the
content area and when we come in here
and see what it looks like it's being
pushed to the area that it needs to be
pushed against and that should be fine
for us before we leave let's come in
here and preview this in Safari and what
you can see is it's stretched out it
works as much as we need it to be and
you can see we've got the left content
on this side and we're now going to be
able to create the right content on the
other side and just to reiterate all we
really did with this was to go through
to the width of 600 and we gave it a
background color that's really all so
let's clean up a couple of things inside
of our code and I can do that just by
you know putting things underneath each
other like this and like we've been
doing with all the other ones will add a
little comment in here that says ends or
end pound symbol content and the pound
symbol represents the ID content so now
we've got that in place when we come
back in the next video we'll start
cleaning things up a little bit more by
adding our our third column and then
finally by adding our footer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
