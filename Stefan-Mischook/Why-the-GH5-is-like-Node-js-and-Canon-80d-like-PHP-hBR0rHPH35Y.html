code and cameras unusual subject but
there's a point to it so as you might
know I am a bit of a camera hobbyist
because I'm shooting all these vlogs and
videos and so forth and I use the Canon
cameras and I'm using a high-end cinema
camera here because it just makes my
work flow easier as I mentioned in
previous vlogs one of the big reasons
why you get professional equipment
whether it be cameras restaurant
equipment if you have a restaurant I
don't sag oould example or professional
coding tools or high-end computers that
will make your job easier that's the key
all this professional gear is there to
make the workflow the flow of the work a
lot easier you don't want to mess around
with headaches now here's the thing a
lot of times the difference between the
mid-level prosumer equipment versus the
high-end is incremental meaning it
doesn't seem like too much so for
instance the video quality in normal
circumstances and normal lighting with
this high-end cinema camera versus my
older well my older a DD DSLR cameras
it's middle-of-the-road type of camera
prosumer camera a lot of people won't
see it some people don't see the
difference but a lot of people won't see
the difference now if that was the only
reason why I got the cinema camera it
may not be justified in terms of the
cost the reason I got this camera is
because it allowed for a much easier
workflow it got things done much more
easily so how does this relate back to
code so if you look at PHP vs. node.js
JavaScript now PHP is a language design
from the ground up to create database
driven websites or web apps as we call
them today and because it's been
designed from the beginning to do that
kind of work it's really easy to get
up and running with PHP to start
building web apps super easy in fact
that PHP is now by far the dominant
programming language for server-side
coding doesn't necessarily mean it's the
best overall but it is the dominant one
because it's easy it's very fast easy to
learn very performant at runtime meaning
when you run PHP code it runs much
faster than Ruby runs much faster than
Python and many other languages yeah
there are some some other languages are
run quicker but PHP overall is quite
quite good on the flip side you guys
have a called node.js with JavaScript
and it's very popular with the hipster
nerds because it's new and because it
does something really really good for
sites that requires super high
performance and I'm not going to get
into the details here but just so that
you know when you do using node it's
because you need to do something like a
messaging system we need super fast
performance communication between the
client which is the web browser and the
server you don't want no latency you
want to go back up a bubble boom now
here's the thing those type of
absolutely that's super ultra speed and
that type of application is extremely
rare maybe 1 in 10,000 sites may need
that type of super speed that node can
provide most web sites long don't now
here's the flip side with nodejs and
javascript as i've seen so far it's
still a work in progress so it's messy
it's difficult to get up and running
you're gonna promise quit figuring it
things will conflict with this library
in that library it's a lot of work to
get something done whereas with PHP
because it's far more mature it's been
refined over the years we're at pH P 7
now it's very fast and overall it works
amazingly well it's stable easy to set
up hosting is easy configuration is easy
so it just works so how does this relate
back to cameras well
you got a couple famous vloggers on
youtubes guide nice that this guy named
McKinnon and they use Canon cameras now
Casey Neistat famously switched over to
what I would consider to be the nodejs
of the camera world that is the GH five
the G H five is a Panasonic camera
everybody loves it it's great it's got
all kinds of capabilities built into it
and people go wow so a lot of people go
let's get this camera we love it but the
problem with the G H five is that it's
missing one super crucial feature that
the Canon cameras have and that's
autofocus if you're doing this kind of
work solo work as I'm doing now right it
will have a camera person to start
focusing for me
you need a crazy-cool autofocus Canon is
the best in the game when it comes to
autofocus and Panasonic is particularly
the worst in the game in terms of
autofocus so Casey and I side very
famous vlogger he's holding the camera
up like this he's doing his vlogs and a
lot of times he was out of focus with
the gh 5 because he got he got seduced
by all the advanced features like the 4k
video and 10-bit color space just in
terms of a sharper image try a cleaner
looking image that's what the gh 5
promise problem was but the major thing
that it left out was the autofocus
there's other things as well I won't get
into it so Casey after using the gh 5
for a while realized that it doesn't
actually help his workflow gets in the
way of his workflow and the features
that are found in the gh 5 seduced him
he realized that they're really not very
important for his medium which is
YouTube's 4k video let's face it I do
shoot in 4k but I think everybody
watches everything 1080p nodejs is the
same way where's everybody sort of Oh No
look how you know if you have a
messaging system it's going to be super
fast but how many people need that type
of super speed
a messaging on the flipside you got you
got a good old PHP which is super fast
to begin with maybe not as fast as note
in terms of the messaging and a
synchronous communications yeah I said a
secret is communications but it does
everything how so well and it's stable
you don't have to mess around with
configurations and downloading libraries
and all this kind of crap you can just
get in there start building your app so
you know besides the fact if you watch
my vlogs that I believe that you should
be language agnostic meaning you
shouldn't be married to particular
programming language you should be
willing to look at any language
depending on the needs of the particular
job at hand
sometimes it's technical technical needs
sometimes it's just business needs and
yeah so there you go in the camera world
we have our our PHP which is Canon which
works great super solid great color
sights best autofocus in the game ease
of use is fantastic very stable and then
a flip side you have the gh 5 in the
camera world which is kind of like no GS
has some really nice features some great
capabilities that you don't see in the
canons but it's workflow sucks and at
the end of the day all this technology
but we're using will it be cameras
whether it be computers will there be
frameworks like nodejs
or PHP laravel or java spring and what
was my point
oh yeah all these technologies they're
there to do one thing save you time save
you time that's the whole point of it
really at the end of the day so if you
have a super nice camera like the gh 5 i
can shoot 10-bit video and 4k but you're
having a huge trouble with the autofocus
all the time and it doesn't give you
great depth of field because of the type
of sensor of it has a character Sarah
it's kind of defeating the purpose
meanwhile you get a Canon a TD
or a canon 6d mark to where you get
super fancy cinema camera although it's
overkill for a lot of people you get the
job done quickly you don't have to worry
about all kinds of configurations and
headings and setup productivity is there
when you use a certain tech so that's
one of the reasons why I say to most
people go to PHP versus node.js because
it's easy it's fast it would be able to
do 99.9% of the work that you need to do
and it's very very stable in fact I had
a friend of mine who used to work for me
he's now a CTO of a company that's doing
their series I think a in terms of their
their business they've raised millions
already and they built a part of their
system in node but he said that they
could have done in a PHP a little bit a
lot easier than would have handled the
job no problem again what I'm talking
about here is not a shot against node
it's not necessarily saying this
language is better than the other it's
it's it's a philosophical it's a
practical discussion about how you
should look at technologies and tools
that you work with there you go bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
