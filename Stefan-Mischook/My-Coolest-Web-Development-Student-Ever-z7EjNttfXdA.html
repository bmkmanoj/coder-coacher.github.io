probably aware I have been teaching code
for a real long time since 2003 and so
every now and then I get some of my very
old students who write back to me people
like their spoken to before so yesterday
I had somebody reach out to me on
Facebook guy named weed here and let me
just read what he said I don't know if
you remember doing killer PHP that's
funny because killer PHP is still up but
about 810 years ago I did your courses
all the way up to old P object-oriented
programming for the past three years
I've been employed as a full-time
software engineer for three different
companies I'm moving up the ranks quite
fast I just wanted to say thanks to you
and your videos you explain things that
clears out there out of everything that
I had watched so a little batter for
thanks man is asking if I'm still
teaching yeah I got the killer site so
on why did I bring this up well I guess
this type of thing is very cool to me as
a teacher and all admits also good
shameless self-promotion you know let's
be honest here
but one thing I wanted to bring up was
that he said that he's back to doing PHP
he had done Jay s will hear this he had
done a detour to Python and j/s but he's
back at PHP so again more and more
evidence to what I've been saying for a
longest time now that even though or
some developers out there PHP is the
dirty redheaded stepchild it's in fact
extremely extremely popular still
because it's just so effective so my old
student here
Wade is now back he calls himself a
full-stack developer they show me one of
the sites he had built just launched
that while he participated in building
it now this is out in South Africa so
let's take a few seconds of reason
here it is pretty cool thing alright so
he worked on this it's just cool was on
that team and he started quoting when he
was 14 we got into it three years ago so
yeah so he was learning my stuff he was
eighteen or nineteen years old and it's
kind of cool that after all these years
he still remembered my teaching so so we
looked at his LinkedIn profile you know
cool dude wave is a cool dude so yeah I
have to tell you having been teaching
this for a while it's very gratifying
and I have to say for whatever reasons
to hear from people from South Africa
from Europe from Asia from South America
you know Central America it's kind of
cool and one of the things I learned
over the years as a teacher and as a
developer the differences between the
cultures there are differences between
the cultures but at the end of the day
we're all humans were all motivated by
the same motivations and it's all pretty
cool it's all pretty cool so very go
that's it for this particular vlog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
