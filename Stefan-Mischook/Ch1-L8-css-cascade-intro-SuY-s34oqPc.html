whether it be HTML CSS JavaScript or any
programming language any coding language
one of the general rules is to not
repeat your code that's the that's the
goal and the reason you don't want to
repeat code is that it's a space that
saves mistakes and it just keeps your
code cleaner we'll learn more about that
as we get into the course but just keep
that in mind you want to try to not have
the same code over and over again so
let's look at this basic page here now
I've modified the page from the previous
lesson and I just simplified it because
I want to just I want to make teaching
CSS easier I want to make it easy for
you to understand so we have our we have
our heading at the top and our two
paragraphs right pretty simple hers are
heading and our two paragraphs paragraph
one paragraph two and of course the
heading has the ID of top H applied to
it and my paragraphs have the classes of
super P applied to it and here in our
CSS code here's the class super P
declaration block and here's the ID top
age so oh oh yeah we also have our tag
selectors the h1 tag selector and the
paragraph tag selector and of course our
declaration blocks that go along with
them
now here's something that's a little bit
interesting you may have noticed you
notice how we have CSS for this ID here
which is the h1 tag ID top age but we
also have CSS here which is using the h1
tag selector so this CSS rule and this
CSS rule both apply to the h1 tag in our
page
it's interesting because if you look at
this CSS rule it sets the color of the
text to black where is this CSS rule
sets the color of the text in our header
to green so let's open in browser so you
see
the CSS rule that wins is the top H the
ID where I set the color of the text to
black and it's not green that's
interesting we're gonna get into a lot
more detail about this later on in the
course but essentially there are rules
and CSS that tell the web browser which
CSS rule wins when you have a situation
like this where you have two sets of CSS
rules but apply to the same tag and they
conflict right because this CSS rule is
saying turn this color of the text green
and this CSS rule is saying turn the
color of the text black even you know so
which one wins what we saw in this case
the one that one was this CSS rule the
ID and this is all part of something
called the CSS cascade remember the name
of CSS is cascading style sheets was
cascading has to do with this it has to
do with the rules of which CSS tag
selectors excuse me the rules of which
CSS selector wins so we had a conflict
competition between the tag selector h1
versus the ID selector top page and
we've learned the top h1 and I'll tell
you I'll give you a sneak peek because I
cover this fully in another course top h
wins because an ID selector is
considered more important than h1
selector that's one of the reasons it
wins but keep that in mind so that's the
introduction to the Cascade and CSS and
a Kowski in CSS is all about which
selectors it could be a tag selector it
could be an ID selector it could be a
class selectors and there's other
selectors which selector wins in the
situation we have a conflict a conflict
for instance where I said here make the
text green and in here I said no no
we're gonna make the text black so there
you go I know this is getting pretty
deep down into new
details but understanding the stuff it
will make your life easier because a lot
of times when you're building pages and
you're you're going why is it this text
black or why isn't this text green and
if you don't understand these nerdy
details you won't understand that the
reason the text is in green and your h1
even though you set it to green here
well as you know because ID selectors
beat h1 selectors anyway we'll learn
more about this later on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
