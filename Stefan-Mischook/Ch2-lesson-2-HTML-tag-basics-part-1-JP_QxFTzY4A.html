into HTML and we're gonna learn about
something called a tag so I've popped up
in my code editor here and this is some
basic HTML that we've seen before HTML
code now HTML code is made up of small
chunks of code called tags right here we
see a bunch of tags but let me put a new
tag in there so you can see what it's
all about and here we go here is what is
called the P tag P cuz of is this letter
P is short for paragraph
now what this tag does is it tells the
web browser that we're gonna be putting
in a paragraph of text here that's what
P stands for a paragraph so how does a
tag work well it starts with a point to
you bracket then you have a letter or a
word C here we have P and here we have
another tag we have body so anyway back
to P so we have a point e bracket we get
to letter P we have another point e
bracket this is the opening of the tag
and then we see the second half of a tag
the closing tag and has a pointy bracket
again we have a forward-leaning slash
this is a slash that shares the key book
key on your keyboard shares the question
mark key and you've got a P again and
then you got a pointy bracket this chunk
of HTML forms one tag and this
particular tag is called the paragraph
tag we also have other tags in this page
we have a body tag here's the opening
body tag and here's the closing body tag
again the only difference between the
opening body tag and the closing body
tag is you got this forward slash this
tells the web browser that this is the
closing tag and this whole thing
represents the body portion of the
webpage as you can see you can have tags
inside of tags so in this situation you
see that our paragraph
Tagg is inside our body tag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
