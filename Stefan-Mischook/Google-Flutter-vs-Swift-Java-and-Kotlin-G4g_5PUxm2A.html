gonna crash
now the Swift programming language is a
very very good language in case you
don't know the Swift programming
language was designed by Apple
specifically for iOS development but
they open sourced it meaning they let
every nerd in the world work on Swift
IBM looked at sedate is a cool language
they ported it to of a server so you can
run Swift on the server and create super
fast web apps it's still in its infancy
so I wouldn't jump on that but here's
the thing Swift is largely used today
for iOS development developing native
apps for iPhone iPad and also Mac OS but
that's really nice but most people these
days don't write native apps anymore
most of the big companies from what I'm
hearing it's really all about hybrid
apps whether it be react native or
PhoneGap there's other frameworks out
there as well and the reason being is
that people don't want to write an app
in iOS and Swift and then have to write
the whole thing over again in Android
having to maintain two code bases it's
just a disaster
so I know from people who work for very
large organizations they have told me
that they have stopped writing native
code a couple years ago they go Cordova
or PhoneGap these are all frameworks
would allow you to use web technologies
html5 CSS and JavaScript and to build
your apps that way now with these
frameworks they can access things like
the gyroscope and all this native stuff
can be accessed directly using the web
stack so that's why I react native in
PhoneGap they're replacing the need of
writing native code now on occasion you
need write to write native code for
high-performance games or something like
that but that those are small least part
of the market but to address that to
address that Google has come out with a
framework called flutter which is C C++
based and he uses a language called dart
which is very much like JavaScript that
allows you to build
apps with this framework and it's still
in beta but apparently it's pretty cool
in fact it's so cool but Google's main
money earners their Adsense my dad
sensor AdWords program the app is based
on this flutter framework and so you
write your front and your flutter app
and it compiles down to native code in
both platforms again you have now native
speed or nearly native speed but one
code base
it's terrible to have to maintain two
different code bases one for iOS one for
Android yeah you don't want to do that
companies are not doing that in fact so
what does that mean in the end that
means that the main use case for Swift
that is writing fast native iOS apps
could be killed by flutter and if it
lives up to expectations I can tell you
it will be killed by flutter between the
hybrid apps which is gonna be used to
create 95% of apps for both iOS and for
Android and then you have flutter which
will give you that high performance that
you need for that other 5% of apps that
need that high performance people are
going to be going to flutter because I'm
a business owner and I hire coders I've
been hiring coders for 20 years now yeah
17 years anyway I tell you this is what
I would look at I go whoa I don't have
to hire Swift prep experts and I don't
have to hire Android Java experts for
Android I can just do it in flutter I'm
in the same thing with hybrid right
hybrid apps are probably at this point I
don't that is the exact statistics but I
would imagine they're dominating the
mobile app development space so what
happens to Swift where where does this
Swift language goes it's gonna become
super marginalized because there's going
to be no reason to write Swift because
iOS will be done with PhoneGap react
native some other frameworks are hybrid
frameworks web-based frameworks for
mobile or of this flutter
framework from Google from Google and by
the way Kotlin it's a language that
jetbrains just put out
so that people could write Android apps
much more easily than rating with Java
Kotlin is gonna get the same beating as
well
if this flutter framework turns out to
be what it looks like it's gonna beep so
I would not be investing in Swift even
though in of itself the Swift language
is a nice-looking language now there's
one other application of Swift that I'm
aware of
iBM has ported Swift to the server
because Apple they created Swift it was
214 and then they released it they open
sourced it so any nerd could work on
Swift so add the IBM nerds at a that's a
pretty good language if you watch a
previous video show you how fast Swift
is when it runs it's super fast it blows
the doors off of PHP JavaScript Java
it's almost as fast as C C++ the problem
is is that even though you have a super
high performance and IBM sees that that
application on the server talking about
the web server for those web apps it's
still very early implementation I was
reading about it and I don't think a lot
of people are gonna adopt it simply
because web servers and servers are so
powerful these days you make it they can
handle huge load so unless you're like
Facebook or you know Instagram or
YouTube or something you can you know
you can grab any server-side tech
whatever it be a JavaScript node or PHP
laravel or Ruby rails and rails to slow
just kidding Ruby people get over
anxious want to do that all kidding
aside I just don't think that the
performance is that much of an issue
when it comes to server-side code and I
don't think people most companies going
to be investing in dedicated Swift
server side apps simply because PHP
Python JavaScript it's going to be PHP
and JavaScript I think generally
speaking they're more than good enough
to handle 99% of new web absolutely
developed so to conclude because of
hybrid apps which are web-based
frameworks like react native and
PhoneGap because those
are those hybrid apps are easily able to
handle today the vast majority of mobile
app development that's gonna make Swift
not that important it's gonna make Java
for Android not that important and you
add on top of that this new flutter
framework from Google which allows you
to write one codebase compiles down to
almost native speeds for both platforms
iOS and Java it's another nail in the
coffin for Swift and I think
unfortunately caught Lin even though it
looks like it could be a great language
I think it's gonna be DOA so this is
where when you're looking at technology
you have to consider both the business
end of it and the technology end of it
and I have seen this more than one
occasion where I've seen very good
technology because of market forces it
still disappeared I remember back in
give you an example back in my java days
there's this framework UI framework
called velocity very good framework
loved it great simple it's nowhere it
wasn't you know because of market forces
because a competition that's not any
other thing even though I thought it was
very the best at what it did it
disappeared so that's what I think
what's gonna happen was Swiss so I would
not be investing in the Swift
programming language I think it is OVA
now it's gonna take time
you know these things diced well lean
apples gonna keep trying to resuscitate
it of course but now it's gonna become a
niche language that is my prediction
just like I predicted ruby would become
an initial language mmm even at a height
of its popularity I saw this coming so
but I think that the swift dropping is
going to be even faster than Ruby's drop
into the Oblivion anyway I just did that
to it trigger Ruby people again I like
Ruby great language but not good enough
