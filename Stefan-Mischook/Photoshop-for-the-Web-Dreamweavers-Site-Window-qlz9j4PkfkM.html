what we're going to be starting to do is
to take all of those images that we
sliced up in our little design that we
created inside Photoshop and if you
remember from the last video we exported
all of our slices and those slices are
now going to be turned into a website
which we will build ourselves from
scratch here in Dreamweaver it's going
to be a three-column fixed pixel website
that's something that we have to contend
with and something that we have to
remember is that we decided to make our
canvas area inside a Photoshop 900 now
keep that in mind because all those
measurements that we meticulously laid
out inside a Photoshop with regards to
the rulers and guides are now going to
come to this particular phase of the
application and we're going to really
pay attention to those things because we
want everything to be aligned perfectly
just the way we had intended inside of a
Photoshop document now of course we're
assuming that you've done a little bit
of photoshop work before if you haven't
done any Dreamweaver work before that is
I would encourage you to check out other
killer sites tutorials on working with
Dreamweaver or basic HTML and CSS skills
nevertheless though even if you are new
to everything that we're doing I'm going
to walk you through things from a very
basic and simple understanding of how to
work with Dreamweaver so let's get
started first thing you want to do
whenever you're working inside of a
dreamweaver based website is to define
your site and I can't stress how
important that is when working in
Dreamweaver if you don't define your
site first you're going to run into all
kinds of problems and that can be
potentially problematic and give you all
kinds of grief so first and foremost
what we're going to do is to say site
new site now if you remember now some of
you might be seeing the basic tab
setting that you see here you can work
with the basics that's perfectly fine
but you know what let's just go over to
advance
look at that one click of a button
you're already advanced so the name of
the site doesn't really matter we don't
even have to you know pay attention to
the fact that there are spaces in this
name this name is only for the site
definition inside a dreamweaver it's got
nothing to do with HTML per se it just
allows you to choose from different
sites a little bit later on when we're
working in this environment so why don't
we call it the type site seem to be
favoring that and here where it says
local root folder what we want to do is
to press this icon here and point to the
folder that contains all of our
information well at this point if you
remember I asked everybody in the last
video to prepare a folder on your
desktop or anywhere on your computer for
that matter that would contain the
images that we have so what I want you
to do is to select the type route that
will be the root folder for our website
that's why I asked you to name it route
you don't have to name it route I just
did that for educational purposes so
here's type route and we're going to
choose that one make sure you don't
choose the images folder that's already
in there it's just the type root folder
the main folder so we're going to choose
that a little bit later on we'll talk
about how to upload your website to a
server and in order to do that you'd
have to go to the category not local
info where we're pointing to the folder
that's on our local machines but rather
eventually you'll have to go to remote
info now you know there might be
something that says those another site
or connection types ID please enter a
different I don't even worry about that
necessarily you can of course change
what it says here you know could be
types ID number two if you have that
problem but anyways it doesn't really
matter I'll say type site final or
progress maybe like it's a work in
progress then I'm going to go to the
remote info area and where it says
access none we can choose access ftp now
i don't know what your ftp information
is but here's the
most important aspects that you will
have to sort of work with what you're
going to need to do is to act to contact
your service provider in other words
anybody who's hosting your website so if
you've bought a domain name you can
you've got a host who's hosting that
website for you if you happen to have an
internet access that is given to you by
some I pre provider often times
especially where I am and where i live
in canada we actually have a lot of IP
providers who give you internet access
and sometimes I'll even give you you
know free server space sometimes it's
your very simple small amount like five
megs or something but nevertheless if
you do have a domain name then you
certainly have somebody who's hosting
your website so what you can do is enter
in the ftp host information here you
know i could enter in mine but this will
do nothing for you especially since you
don't have this server but nevertheless
i wanted to show you and you've got to
enter in your ftp host area here you've
got to put in a log in as well and at
this point there's going to be a
password that's requested of you also so
i'm not giving you my information of
course but notice that's really all you
need sometimes you might if you have any
problems with this you might want to
choose use passive ftp but generally
speaking you don't have to worry about
it too much now at this point you might
want to test this and if you hit the
test button and you've enter in all of
your information correctly it'll say
dreamweaver cs4 connected successfully
so that's fantastic you've got your
server space ready and set up now at the
end of this project when we have
everything already we can upload this
and you can see what it looks like and
how it works but at this point if you
don't have your remote info and just set
this to none and just add the local
information now I'll come back
little bit later when we talk about
accessing the server and will enter in
that information once again so now that
we're set up you can see here that I
have a little area where I've defined
you know a number of different objects
here their assets there's the files
window there are some other things like
ap elements and you know CSS styles as
you can see here and that's going to be
important for us these CSS Styles we're
going to be using them a lot as we work
through CSS but right now all I'm really
interested in is this the files setting
so as you can see here it's got a
drop-down list of all the different
sites that you'll have available now if
you remember I had one already called
type site so i called this one type site
progress and that's just fine and you
can click on it and access more
information you can you know go in there
and add your remote info if you wish and
that's all fine and dandy but at this
point all we've really got going for us
is the definition of the site and if you
roll over it you know you should see
something like where it's located mac HD
desktop or if you're working on a pc you
know you probably got your c drive with
the desktop here as well so all my
desktop I've got these and I've got
images inside of it let me also show you
that right next to the files window
you've got the assets window the assets
window by default will show you all of
the images that are inside this entire
site root so if you remember I have an
images folder in there and what's inside
well there's the branding gif and
there's the picture type one picture
type 2 and picture type 3 all the same
all inside the elements that we need so
here is our files window that's how you
define your site root inside of
Dreamweaver and now that we've got the
site route to find let's go about
building this website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
