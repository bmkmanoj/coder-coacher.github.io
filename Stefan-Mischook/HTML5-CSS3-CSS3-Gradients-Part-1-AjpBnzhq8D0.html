PHP and today what I'm going to be doing
is building on our last tutorial where
we talked about border raise it radiuses
and some of the new css3 declarations
that are we going to be coming out and
we've been building this very simple
application or not even an application
really just a very simple website and
it's a website template where we've got
this navigation here and we've got sort
of a top header here with some borders
are some rounded corners and what I'm
going to do in this tutorial will show
you how you can create gradients with
css3 and html5 and also how you can make
sure that it works in two of the kind of
leading browsers when we're talking
about gradients and rounded corners and
all these new effects and making sure
that they work both in Safari google
chrome and mozilla firefox and those are
really kind of the major players when
we're talking about html5 web sites at
least at this stage so let's get started
so the first thing that I'm going to do
is just quickly give you an update as to
where we're at this is our html5 page
here you'll notice it with the doctype
being pretty straightforward we've got a
header section we've got a nav and then
we've got a section at the bottom here
with a left content section and then a a
side section we could probably even get
rid of that class left and we might do
that later on when we want to optimize
our CSS but for now at least in this
tutorial or this video what I want to
focus on is just getting those rounded
corners looking good in both browsers
and making sure that we can get
gradients as well now when we're talking
about when we're talking about Firefox
what we're really talking about is the
mozilla engine and that is why when you
look at the style declaration here the
style dot CSS file you'll see that in
the header section I've got this little
mo Z dash border radius
now eventually dash MMOs a dash this
part of your CSS declaration will no
longer be necessary once the standard
gets finalized it won't matter and
whether you're saying hey Mozilla wake
up to this or you know so far your
google chrome wake up to this you're not
going to have to do that and
unfortunately right now you've got to
sort of implementations of CSS you've
got the mozilla implementation and you
have another one called WebKit now
Google Chrome and Safari and a whole
bunch of other web browsers based on
those engines are basically running off
of the WebKit engine which is just
another way of rendering CSS and making
pages look beautiful so for example if i
open up google chrome right here and i
go to the exact same website hold on one
second just loading up here we go so now
I've got google chrome running i'm just
going to zoom out a little bit and
you'll notice that google chrome hasn't
taken to my rounded corners and in order
for that to happen we have to add an
additional declaration which is dash
WebKit border dash radius and then again
at 0 pixels 0 pixels 12 pixels 12 pixels
it save refresh and now we're getting
the rounded corners here to give you an
idea of how this is different if i set
this to 25 pixels and then i set my
mozilla border radius to 12 then over
here i'm going to get a larger ratted
corner and then when i go back to
firefox nothing is going to change and
that's pretty much it so let's finalize
this whole menu thing the first thing i
want to do is I'm going to go back to my
file system and I'm just going to create
a new directory for this particular
stage in art project I'm going to call
it 03 because I can't come up with
anything better and I'm just going to
copy these two files my index dot HTML
file
my CSS file and lastly I'm going to go
to my editor here and I'm just going to
open those files this way when you're
looking at the course material it'll be
very easy for you to follow along going
from one video to the next and lastly
instead of being on 02 pointed 203 and
point it to 0-3 now let's talk about
gradients for a second this whole
section at the top here could actually
be a gradient if I wanted it to and it
would be pretty straightforward to do
that and I'm going to show you how to do
it first in Mozilla and then we're going
to look at how we can do that in WebKit
so to do a gradient requires a little
bit of thought normally you'll notice
that we have this background declaration
now we can change this background
declaration to be a completely different
color if I want to make it red it's
going to be f 00 and then if i refresh
this now I'm going to get a red
background now what if I wanted to get a
gradient that went from red to this gray
well if I was doing this with if I was
doing this with Mozilla then i would add
an additional background statement here
and i would say dash mo Zed dash linear
gradient close those brackets and then a
semicolon and in here I would have to
say the position horizontally and then
the position vertically so if I said
center left there be in the middle in
the left or in the middle of the page in
then the left and then i would say si si
si si si si 0% that means start at the
top and then ff0000 one hundred percent
and that would be the bottom now let's
see what happens
so now in the center left in other words
right here you can see that i have
started a gradient that's going to
travel all the way across to the right
hand side of the page now this is a
pretty dramatic effect but we're going
to try and do something a little more
elegant for the navigation so with that
in place I'm going to go down to my nav
and I'm also going to put in a a
gradient and this one is going to be a
little less dramatic and we're going to
use a different way of defining our
color spectrum so in my navigation here
I'm going to say that I want the nav
section to have a background so you'll
notice we've got to background
declarations here one is a background
just like a safety net in case that you
can't properly implement I sure let me
just pause this
so you'll notice here that we still have
our background declaration and the
reason for that is that in case you know
internet explorer or another browser
that doesn't necessarily support
gradients is viewing our page we can
still of course have it be displayed by
the way when I was talking about Mozilla
and WebKit all the iOS platforms whether
it be the ipad or the iphone or the ipod
all of these use WebKit and there are
some additional effects that you can use
on the iphone if you're building an
iphone based web application and you
want to use some really iphone specific
effects whether they be fades or
animations or transitions but that's a
whole other video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
