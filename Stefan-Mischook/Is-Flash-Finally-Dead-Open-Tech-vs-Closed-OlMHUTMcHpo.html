alive so I was reading an article on
Slashdot I think it was and they were
saying that the ghoul engineer said that
about 8% of Google Chrome users and
Chrome as the most dominant browser by
far I believe about 8% of them still
loaded a flash based animation or a
flash based application if you will
which part of me is surprised by matter
part of me isn't surprised by that you
see that in on anything really it takes
time for something to totally fade out
but when it comes to tech when you see
like when you're under like 20% that
technology is pretty dead so what they
were saying was that I think by next
year Google Chrome will by default have
flash turned off and the following year
by 2020 they will not ship it will not
ship Chrome with flash this is just one
of many browsers I don't think Microsoft
edge ships with flash
I know Android doesn't support flash iOS
never support a flash those are just you
can see how quickly a technology dies
that factoid aside it brings back
something I've preached for quite a
while now when it comes to choosing
check tech typically what is open will
beat and surpass and dominate what is
closed so flash was a closed technology
owned by Adobe and what killed it it was
essentially html5 and css3 although it
wasn't as capable as flash into regards
initially but again open always beats
closed open always beats closed so
that's why when I look at mobile app
development I think that web-based using
the web stack mobile development is
going to in the end be by far more
dominant than writing apps natively so
if you want to get into the mobile app
development and I've heard this from
people who are and involved with big
companies I would be looking at
or PhoneGap using the web stack rather
than iOS and Swift you know Swift with
iOS or certainly not objective-c with
iOS or Android or Kotlin with C's we
call it or Java with Android again open
always beats close and the flash is just
one one of many many examples in that
regard and finally I think that when you
learn the web stack you just got a lot
more options there if you do Swift and
iOS programming your that's all you do
right
although Swift is not being used a
little bit on the server although that's
really neat at this time but that has
some interesting implications on the
roll because of the speed but I'll leave
that to another video so yeah so if
you're doing Swift programming all
you're doing is iOS that's it
if doing Kotlin what do you do Java but
java's really enterprise big huge
organizations that means you have to
have some sort of university degree to
get a job there so keep that in mind and
that's pretty much it
Enterprise and Android apps but if you
do the web stack html5 sister 3
JavaScript and then you can go into a
PhoneGap you can do web apps websites
you can do Android device if you do for
Android you can do for iOS you get the
idea it just opens you up to a lot more
work possibilities so I personally if I
was learning this stuff knew I'd be
concentrating on the web stack first
just to give me more options in terms of
what the potential job opportunities are
and certainly if you're gonna get into
freelancing the freelancing
opportunities are going to be far far
greater with the web stack no question
about that one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
