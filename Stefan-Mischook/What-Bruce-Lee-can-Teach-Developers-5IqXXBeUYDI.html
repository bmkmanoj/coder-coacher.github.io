going to talk about what Bruce Lee could
teach coders now just in case you don't
know who Bruce Lee is now for you young
uns out there Bruce Lee was a movie star
from the I guess the late 60s early 70s
but his lasting legacy you may not know
is for his martial arts a point of view
his martial arts system yes an ecology
kundo now this is all related to coding
very soon Shoji kundo is bruce lee's
martial arts style but it was it was a
more advanced style than anything seen
before in terms of how he thought about
things and he was one of these guys that
looked up to as a kid and when i started
to do martial arts oh I discovered him
when I was 14 i started doing martial
arts when i was 10 but nonetheless this
is a quote absorbed what is useful
discard what is useless and add what is
specifically your own now let me say it
again absorb what is useful discard what
is useless and add what is specifically
your own now this is a principle you
know I don't think he got it out of
nowhere he study philosophy and so on
and he plied his philosophy training out
learning from years in Seattle to
martial arts but this applies to
anything in life really now how does
this relate to code you can remember
martial arts systems whether it be
karate is kung fu is boxing wrestling
judo you name it they're all
technologies of combat they're all there
to teach you more or less how to fight
and you know some styles are much more
realistic and some are totally
unrealistic nonetheless they are
technologies and they can be very
complex and it could take years and
years to even understand some of the
more profound some of the more concepts
some of the more complex concepts in
sales and I did martial arts for with 30
years or so and I was really serious
into it and how one point when is young
going to become a pro fighter but
because of illness sickness I decided to
stop I did some JK DG kundo which is
blue seas art and I'm not going to get
into martial arts talk here but what I
want to express is again that basic
philosophy of absorbed what is useful
discard what isn't and and do your own
thing and this comes to coding as well
the g-code Oh philosophy was trial all
kinds of different styles try some boxy
and do some fencing do some taekwondo do
some judo do some wing chun do some
conga so on so forth do all these
different styles and see what you can
find it's good in each of them now
before i discovered JKD and bruce lee i
sort of had that inclination of i am an
eclectic by nature so i did you know
then i did karate the tyke 10 why
because i said to myself well if i want
to cook kick the best kicking style i
knew at the time was type window so i
want i'm going to go do some kicking
with the type of new guys because
they're best at kicking and if I longer
or not a grapple you grapple you do judo
and so on and so forth and that's
basically the JKD philosophies don't get
caught up in the system don't say I'm a
judo gun and everything else sucks I'm a
karate guy everything else sucks I'm
boxer and everything else sucks that's a
wrongheaded approach because no
particular system has all the answers no
particular coding language that
programming language has all the answers
no particular framework has all the
answers everything is very
circumstantial so in fighting I've been
in the ring like if I bittering hundred
times have been in a thousand times I
used to be a bouncer in a nightclub and
I can tell you from experience
hard-earned experience that
circumstances dictate which technology
which fighting style if you will that
you're going to implement give them the
circumstance now when you get to a high
level in martial arts and fighting
there's no style there literally is no
style because what you learn is that the
common thing that we all have to deal
with is our physical bodies you know we
all have in our arms legs and our
psychological cells or mental
and the principles will be type of oil
Thai boxing boxing judo wrestling are
all the same and so any movement in
martial art you know this for instance
this could be a parry it could be a
beginning of a grappling move it could
be you drinking some tea or beer and
seeming with coding you know whether
you're programming PHP or C sharp or
Java or Swift the the constructs of the
language the basics of the language are
pretty much the same and what separates
good coders from Bad quarters is a clear
understanding of the basics so that's
the key to key to martial arts and
Nikita coding is figuring out figuring
out what the key basics are because once
you master the key basics all the other
stuff that looks kind of flowery and
complex whether it be in martial arts or
whether it be in coding are pretty much
the same I've said this in many of the
videos in the past the complex stuff is
just basic basic concepts or basic
techniques layered on top of each other
that's all again that's why I cost you
on the basic so what Bruce Lee could
teach you is that whole idea of absorbed
winners useful reject what is useless
and come up with your own stuff do what
specifically your own because the way
your mind thinks in terms of coding is
going to be different from the way I
think so you may look at a particular
coding problem a particular task that
you need to solve using software and you
may look at it from a slightly different
point of view and sometimes points of
view are right and wrong sometimes it's
a question of taste and and how you sort
of you think so not you know all roads
lead to Rome and all the other cliches I
can come up with don't get caught up in
the language or the framework doesn't
matter so when I comment on like I say
you know I wouldn't learn ruby on rails
today I would look at other things for
blah blah blah blah reasons and then
people get all excited
uh in much in the same way in martial
arts you would have liked jiu-jitsu
school's jiu-jitsu style or school
number one would have a beef against you
two guys number two because they have a
slightly different opinion about how
jiu-jitsu should be performed or you
have karate vs kung fu or boxing vs
kickboxing or you get the idea it's all
kind of silly because when it comes to
martial arts the same five or six basic
things differentiates the good fighters
from the bad fighters because what would
happen for me in martial arts I
discovered that you can get great
fighters who do couto you can create
great fighter sort of boxers you can get
great fighters attack on the whole guys
you can get grey fighters RG kundo guys
are great fighters in many different
styles many times in terms of certainly
technique and execution how you pile try
you kick should you cake should you do
issue they contradict each other a lot
of times and I realized many years ago
if they're always contradicting each
other not always but when they do
contradict each other but they can still
produce good fighters that tells you
that the techniques that they say is so
blond or not important right because
they're both able to still produce good
fighters with techniques that are
opposed to each other so that's an
interesting thing you see that in
programming as well right now in a very
low level you can see there's a
strangely enough of surprised leaders is
rise of procedural code is good
functional coding is better than
object-oriented object-oriented is crap
but at the end of the day you can still
see good apps produced in each of these
different styles or more obvious like
people PHP silks and rubies the best or
jab is the best and see sharps the
garbage or whatever but they all produce
good apps and that tells you since all
these languages can produce good apps
that tells you that what produces a good
app is not the language it's the
programmer and the programmer will
understands how to write good code
regardless of the language final point
that's why I would always hire a guy
who's a highly experienced JavaScript
coder to do some Python work rather than
hiring intermediate or beginner
one guy to do python work why because
it's much more difficult to become an
advanced coder than it is to be a
beginner PP Python coder or intermediate
Python coder those advanced skill sets
those are those advanced understanding
that experience and ability to write
code translates all coding it translates
all languages rather so there you go so
that's that's the one of my influences
in life as a child was Bruce Lee and you
know I have to admit I first Washington
good he was pretty cool but I don't know
you can look up some Bruce Lee videos it
looks kind of silly now you know this
stuff was done in the 60s and guess it
early 70s he died i think it was 72 or
something 71 young guy so that's about
it i hope you find this video useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
