do is move on to the stage of
development where we're going to set up
each individual section of our movie now
as we already know our whole entire
website is designed to be modular or
compartmental so with this compartmental
style of architecture we were able to
separate each individual section into
its own swf as we've just seen we can
apply CSS to the text that's in the
killer sites swf well after applying
that to all the other swfs we can now
proceed to the point where we want to
enact some of the interactivity into
these buttons so for example when I
press control enter in your master file
right now we do see the CSS which we've
just applied to the killer sites default
loaded file however you'll notice that
the buttons cannot allow us to load the
other files so what we're going to do is
try and try to enable some interactivity
here I have a completed version which is
also provided for you to look at and to
examine as you're learning and
developing this website and notice how
we wanted to act you'll note that each
individual button has sort of a rollover
effect to it where it gets orange and it
becomes bold in keeping with the colors
that I have here but the killer site
section is indicated not merely by the
fact that we have a title which is
loaded here and the text but also the
fact that the button is disabled notice
these act like buttons they turn into
the fingers here we just have a normal
arrow that we would normally have and if
I click it nothing happens it's a great
way to proceed in web design especially
from a usability standpoint because here
there are a number of indicators telling
the audience what page they're on here
here as well as the text here when you
go to the author section here this text
and the fact that this is disabled
whereas the other ones still are enabled
so that's ultimately what we want our
file to look like so at this point we're
going to proceed I'm going to commence
by adding something which we haven't
seen yet so here's our master file and
as we well remember our actions are on
the first layer excuse me on the
actionscript layer first frame and we
will see the movie clip loader start MCL
and MCL we loaded the killer sites swf
by default we're going to be changing
this we're going to well we can leave
that there for now but will change a few
other things here you'll note start load
var and load farm all right well we're
also going to add some button
interactivity in this as we go along and
we'll get to that in a second but first
and foremost what I'm going to do is
introduce a new layer and this one I'm
going to call anchors and in the anchors
layer I'm going to introduce to you a
new concept so here I'm going to ask you
to stretch out the text let's go to
about frame 50 and if you click and drag
and then press f5 we've stretched out
all this text all the way out to where
we are here however I also want you to
click and drag at frame 10 press f6 to
create a new keyframe frame 20 f 6 frame
30 f6 and frame 40 f6 now you'll see a
bunch of new key frames here for us to
be using all right now here's what I
want to do the anchor layer is where
we're going to indicate what section of
the movie we are at now again we're not
using this in the traditional way where
we would load everything at frame 10
20 or 30 or 40 all-in-one swf no we're
working from a modular system a
compartmental style so what that means
is why we are going to get to section 10
there's no content here that's
physically on this page we're going to
load the content externally of course we
know that the advantages of that
primarily speed and weight so what we
are going to do at this point is call
upon those elements and style our text
the way we intend but the biggest reason
that I'm setting this up in this fashion
I could still have done all of that just
on one frame however the reason I'm
doing it in this fashion is because we
can take advantage of the anchors and
what that is as I'll show you in just a
second is a different type of label that
we can associate with this frame for
example here if it says the frame number
10 would be the killer site section i
can write inside the property window
killer sites is this sections name and
instead of label type name which would
just give me a regular label a little
flag i'm going to take this and say
comment instead and well as you can see
a comment is a comment but that doesn't
really help us here because that's just
a little way of telling us a little note
to ourselves or to anybody else who's
looking at this it's only developers who
will see this so instead of comment
we're going to choose the last option
anchor and you can see now there's a
little anchor icon here what that allows
us to do is to take advantage of the
back button inside of
the browser window which will host our
flash website this is oftentimes a
disservice to flash is the fact that the
back button never used to work with
flash it would ah wouldn't remember the
pages that you were on it would always
go back to the beginning of your movie
however if we do it with the anchors we
can take advantage of the back button
because when we publish our flash file
as will do at the very end we will also
include named anchors allowing
JavaScript to interact with flash and
take advantage of the browser's back
button this is the big big advantage and
helps to make your Flash movie a lot
more usable and friendly so continuing
in this fashion I will name this
particular frame the author anchor as
well I have a portfolio anchor
there's the portfolio anchor and finally
I have the contact anchor
last thing let's just put in a little
comment section because you can do that
as well so notice here i can write a
little comment that says oh this is
where we'll be loading information oops
and notice that will be a comment and at
this point i can say have six and i can
leave another comment here i could say
anchors are used to
and
take
advantage of the back
button
which of course is I just explained is
found
in the browser window so there you go
now all of these can be done on one
frame obviously we could have at you
know five frames here or something like
that but I stretch them out so that
we'll be able to read not only the
anchor names but also any comments that
we have here now it doesn't add any
weight or do anything detrimental to
your movie so at this point we've set up
the basic architecture I'm going to ctrl
s to save this file and now one other
thing we definitely need to open up the
action scripting window and put stop
actions on each one of these frames as
well because of course we will need
to stop at each one of these individual
sections so now that that's done we've
got our structure for the master file
ready I'm going to save the file you can
press control enter it's not really
going to do anything at this point
obviously but now what we have to do is
start to implement the button activities
and we'll do that by introducing the
context of the concept of text
