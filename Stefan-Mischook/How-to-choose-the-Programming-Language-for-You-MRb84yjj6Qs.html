I get is about choosing a programming
language the common instinct of the
average nerdling out there is to choose
the language based on what's the best
what's the best language if you've been
watching any of my vlogs you know that
there's no best language just like
there's no best guitar there is no best
set of drums there is no best martial
arts except for nothing the fact of the
matter is when it comes to programming
languages they all have their pros and
cons and each one has their strengths so
for instance if you want to write
systems that require mega horsepower
like a gaming engine you're not going to
do this with Python you're gonna do this
with C++ on the other hand if you want
to write some machine learning code or
AI chances are you're going to be doing
this with Python so again it depends on
the application it depends on the type
of work that you want to do that
determines which language is best it's
all circumstantial in my career as a
developer I would in fact go into jobs
sit down with with the client and see
what the requirements were for of a
particular job and then I would choose
the language the framework of the
library based on the needs of the
particular project and sometimes would
have to learn a whole new programming
language just to to get it done so you
have to learn to become neutral in terms
of languages so when it comes to
choosing a programming language for your
career you've got to not look at the
technology itself in terms of how good
it is because as I just said it depends
know what you should be looking at is
two things number one the type of work
that you want to do certain types of
programming are very different from
other types of programming let me put in
a better way Java programming for the
enterprise is very different from
writing PHP code in terms of the type of
work that you're doing I'll give you an
example with Java coding typically
you're gonna be working very large
organizations working on huge projects
that could take months if not a couple
years to complete it's a totally
different type of work environment job
environment than say doing PHP
programming for small business it's a
totally different game it's a totally
different lifestyle it's a totally
different mindset and you should really
consider that more than anything else
the programming language will fade in
terms of its importance in time meaning
as a programmer when you become advanced
you're not going to care really too much
if you're doing this language or that
language well you have personal
preferences but the end of the day
you're writing code you're writing code
you're solving problems but the most
important thing the type of problems
that you're solving personally I don't
like doing enterprise work I've only
done one job whereas on the enterprise
and it's a totally different game lots
of politics you're working in an
environment or corporate oriented lots
of people work if you will not nestle
paper work but there's a lot of there's
a there's a whole bunch of
infrastructure around that type of work
there's a whole different lifestyle
around that type of work
whereas if you're doing freelance work
with PHP and maybe WordPress development
something like that it's a whole
different game and once again it's about
many different clients it's about new
projects every few months or a few weeks
it's a totally different game a lot more
flexibility there again it depends on
the type of work that you do so at the
end of the day when you're looking at a
programming language don't be too
concerned about which one is best be
much more concerned about the type of
work that you want to do the type of
coding what you want to do writing a
gaming engine in C++ is very different
from building web apps in Python or PHP
or c-sharp it's a totally different game
and you have to look at the work
environment and finally you have to
consider the availability of jobs in
your region you got to look where you
want to work maybe online maybe you're
in Serbia maybe you're in California
maybe you're in New York who knows but
you have to look see what the jobs are
there are like
there was art of business opportunities
there for a particular language so you
see in choosing a programming language
the technology the code the coding
language itself the programming language
itself is not as important as a type of
work but it allows you to do and the job
availability look at it from that point
of view alright hope that helps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
