a break from code and we're gonna talk
about the client computer and the server
computer so what's the server computer a
server computer is just any computer
that has server software installed on it
traditionally server computers are
pretty beefy pretty powerful computers
but they don't have to be because
computers are so fast today even a wimpy
computer can be a server computer what
really makes the difference between a
client computer and the server computer
is the apps the server apps of service
software that is installed on the server
computer since we're talking about web
design and HTML and so on the server app
that were most concerned with is the web
server app the web server app is simply
an app that serves up websites that's
why it's called web server
it's short for a website server and
again that's all it does it's an app
whose job it is to send websites to
people who are requesting the websites
so what do I mean when I say computers
that are requesting websites let me give
you an example you're on your iPhone
your iPad you're on your laptop here on
your desktop you're on your Windows
machine you're on your Mac machine
doesn't matter what type of computer it
can be any type of computer when you go
to for example YouTube and you load up a
YouTube page what's going on behind the
scenes is that your web browser isn't
making a request to the web server but
happens to have YouTube on it and
YouTube then gets this request
well the YouTube web server does and
then it sends back whatever page
whatever video whatever images that you
wanted to load sometimes all all three
at the same time well many times
especially YouTube and this help works
on every single website in the world the
way it works is that a client computer
which is any computer when it comes to
that website and it says I want to see
this page and I see this image you want
to see this this video whatever this is
called a client request and when the
server responds to that request
that's called a server response and this
whole process of the client requesting
their server responding is called the
request response cycle cycle meaning
over and over again
and that's how the entire internet works
by the way it's all about server
computers serving up information to
client computers just like when you come
to a restaurant you're a client of the
restaurant and the waiter another word
for waiter is server when they serve you
your food that you requested that's
where all the Nerds got the Nerds who
invented the internet I think that's
where I got the idea the whole client
request server thing so there you go
finally hosting what is hosting well
hosting is when you rent space from a
company that has a server computer and
you rent space from them just like you
might rent an apartment in an apartment
building and you rent space of him so
you can upload your website all your
HTML pages or videos your images and so
on so that your site can be accessible
on the public Internet and that's what
hosting is you're paying for this
company who's got their web server in
place it's got their computers in place
and everything else that they need to be
a professional hosting company you're
renting space from them so that your
site can be public and that's what
hosting is that's what you're paying for
when you're hosting hosting is you know
it comes from that word web hosting and
hosting comes from hosting when you have
a dinner party you have a party at your
house and people come over your house
you're hosting the party you're inviting
people into your house and you're giving
them food and everything so it's kind of
the same thing with web hosting they're
letting you put your web pages your
video files your images on their server
computers so that their servers
computers can serve up your website onto
the public Internet so there you go what
you learn in this lesson when a client
computer is that's any computer what a
server computer is which is it's just
any computer with server software on it
and what hosting is oh by the way last
little point nerds will often call web
browsers the client because it's the
application it's the client app why is a
web browser a client app because the web
browser is continuously requesting
information from servers it's a it acts
like a client is always going to
restaurants eating
ordering food your your web browsers is
doing that and that's why it's called a
client</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
