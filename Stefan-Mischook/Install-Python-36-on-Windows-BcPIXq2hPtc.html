10 here and what we're going to do is
install the latest version of Python so
you see what it's like in Windows 10
I assume though that you've watched the
install Python on Mac video which came
just before this one so I'm not going to
go over all the little details I said as
I did in the Mac video first of all if
you notice down here you see that I have
Python 3.5 installed you see the IDL e
IDL e issue is the integrated
development environment for Python and
if I go into Windows because I go into
my most used apps you can see I used
Python a lot or if I scroll down and
then NOP so 3.5 here it is so I can
launch it and there we go but what we
want is we want to install the latest
version of the Python or Python itself
so we want Python 3 point 6 so let me
close this let's launch the web browser
right here and we're going to go into
Python that org slash downloads download
latest version for Windows so of course
the Python website it detects what I'm
using windows here and so it shows me
the windows download options if you want
to get really nerdy you can check out
the differences between python 2 &amp;amp; 3 but
you don't really need to do that right
now so just click on this button you see
down here it's installing python while
it's downloading rather the python
installer let's go there
so I dried the Installer onto the
desktop let's just install this
double-click blah blah blah install
launcher for all users recommended shear
add Python 3.6 to the path shear
essentially the path allows windows
develop to know where the Python app is
placed on the computer words installed
on the computer
don't worry about that for now just
putting the path for now install
launcher for all users here and then you
go install now depending on the speed of
your computer if this could take a few
minutes to install
so what's this disabled path length
limit changes your machine configuration
to allow programs including Python to
bypass 260 characters yeah might as well
alright so setup was successful ready to
go so let's uh you don't need this
installer anymore so I'm just going to
delete that now let's go into our here
we go pre sheet we got python 3.6 32 bit
we also have 5 on 3.5 so let's drag this
to our taskbar here all right so we have
3.6 3.5 recently added right right here
we scroll down there we go five hundred
point six you see you can have both
versions of Python there would be no
reason to keep Python 3.5 at the same
time whatever I'm going to keep it there
for now I'm going to right click here
point six I don't click here we go or in
Python 3.6 it's pretty cool we can type
in a commands we can type in print
let's say Python on Windows 10 loulou's
hit enter now this is called the Python
shell as we learned in the Mac install
video this is the Python IDE as well
basically this allows you to visit the
Python shell we're going to get into the
IDE in the next video so let me just
close this up another thing you can do
since you have Python installed on
Windows you can go to Windows and go to
command prompt so we're going to find go
into the windows windows I think in
keeping the accessories know it's in
system scuse me and there we go command
prompt so command prompt is basically a
direct way to talk to your computer so
if we want to know what version of
Python we have on our Windows machine
can type in Python - - version boom
we have five on three point six so if we
want to launch Python we just type in
Python and it launches the latest
version of Python so again we can issue
commands right in here it's going to
keep it short then it spits back the
response hi now this is usable but the
problem is you don't see any color
coding right it's kind of its kind of
boring but if you work with the Python
shell and in the IDL EE you notice how
when we type in our Python code it color
codes it for us so that it's nice and
easy
see so you know with the Python shell
color codes the print command a color
close or text and green etc etc so from
now on on both Windows and Mac I'm going
to be using either Python shell or the
Python IDE l Apple to see what that
looks like file well you know what we're
going to wait for the next video to get
into that so there you go you've
installed Python on Windows now we're
ready to write some code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
