working our way down our HTML document
and if you remember we were just dealing
with the container div as we see right
here at this moment we can address the
fact that we have a header div to deal
with there's really not much I want to
deal with when it comes to the header
specifically because I don't really need
any background image or anything like
that in there but I will address it
nonetheless and we'll start with a
selector called header and we'll put in
our open and close information there you
go and within that header then I'm going
to insert some information specifically
addressing well maybe the background
color and I'm just going to give it a
very light subtle background color
simply because I want you to be able to
recognize and differentiate the header
from other elements and see how big it
is and whatever the case may be so I'm
just going to come in here and insert a
very simple color scheme which we will
eventually be getting rid of there's
really nothing to worry about here as
far as color is concerned I'm just
putting in some placeholder colors so
you can see what the header is now as
far as the header goes we don't need to
give it any other values the width is
just stretching out a div is a block
level elements so it's going to stretch
out to be as large as the container
that's holding it so in essence our
header is in fact a width of 960 so I
don't have to put in a very specific
amount if I had an image that I wanted
to introduce in there as a background
then perhaps would be a good idea for
you to give a value for height like a
height of 100 or even more in fact
depending on how big you want your
element to be we're not really concerned
about that so I'm not putting an element
in there an image as at this particular
moment in time we may eventually do so
so I'm just going to leave the header
blank at the moment aside from a very
simple background call
now if i were to save this and then if
we were to preview this in the browser
yet again and just hit refresh you can
see that that header area is highlighted
in this different color if i go to my
HTML perhaps we can make this header
look a little bit more interesting just
by giving it a h1 tag so i'm going to
put the h1 tags around that header and
the logo and if i save this page and
then preview it in our browser we should
see that it says insert logo here don't
worry about the fact that everything is
touching the edges and looks really
tight if that's the case perfectly fine
and as you'll see we can give some extra
margin or space to any of these elements
if I wanted to give some margins to the
box called header up and down that's
fine but even left and right would be ok
because I don't have a specific value
for the width of this header so at the
moment I'm pretty happy with the way it
is I don't necessarily need to give it a
height value or anything along those
lines that's perfectly fine I don't have
to worry about its positioning because
it's right at the top and we're not
really dealing with anything else with
regards to our specific header
information so that's it for the header
when we come back we're going to now
deal with the two columns that are going
to be next to each other the nav and the
