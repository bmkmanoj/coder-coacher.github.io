couple questions about code and careers
and it comes down to should you
concentrate on the minutia the highly
detailed activities or should you
concentrate on the big picture in terms
of getting the job or getting to being
able to get a job or to start a career
in development as fast as possible so
this particular person was talking about
having difficult time understanding
iterating through nested arrays or
crawling sub arrays I say well I know
before you worry about doing things like
anonymous and functions nesting
excuse me crawling sub arrays and
getting confused by all that you're much
better off to understand the big picture
to get the end-to-end done in terms of a
project so let me give you a concrete
example we'll talk about web development
since this is what I teach a lot of now
instead of trying to understand the fine
details about array crawling and so on
which you should be doing after you get
your basics after you understand your
HTML 5 your CSS 3 and your basic
JavaScript then you got to get into
actually being able to build things so
on the client side in terms of the
visual side of a web app or website you
should get comfortable with being able
to build a basic responsive web user
interface whether you do it through
direct css3 as i teach a city web or you
get into bootstrap to create a
responsive layout either way whether you
use bootstrap or straight css3 you're
still going to have to understand your
HTML and your CSS 3 and maybe a little
touch of JavaScript but it's not really
that important that situation so it's
much better that you can say look I took
a layout but I drew on paper and I
transformed it into a responsive layout
using standard CSS or jQuery
or both of whatever magic or bootstrap
that's much more important than you
being able to demonstrate for instance
in CSS five different CSS filters
whether the animation filters or colored
drawing filters are whether you're able
to describe a whole bunch of CSS
properties that we use every now and
then you want to get the job done you
can always come back to the basics
or review minutiae in whatever language
or technology you want to talk about
like bootstrap for instance it's a
pretty big thing bootstrap but most
people just use bootstrap for the
responsive design component in terms of
the grid the bootstrap grid you know it
does all kinds of stuff as well but
don't need to learn all this other stuff
you just need to understand the basics
of it and then you move on from there
that's it you know you should just sort
of be aware I come back you backtrack
you go back to look at bootstrap as an
example and just be aware but what you
could do so you may say you know what I
think we later on if you're doing a
project you may say you know what I
think yeah I remember blue stuff could
do something like that so you go check
out see what bootstrap does as an
example but again as you're starting out
the way you should do is first thing you
have to learn is it is the basic so your
basic html5 your css3 in basic
JavaScript a good teachers job is to not
only simplify what they are teaching but
to also pinpoint what you're going to
need in real world that's why it's good
to have a teacher who can not only teach
but also who has been a developer and
been developing real apps real sites for
a while so we can identify so a good
teacher can identify what you need to
learn to go for because all these
technologies HTML CSS JavaScript PHP SQL
and I can go on and on Python they're
big each one is big you could spend 10
times more time on each language
each framework like bootstrap or if
you're in
figures server-side programming laravel
you can spend 10 times more time on each
technology than you need to to be to be
able to move forward and be a confident
level competent developer same thing
I'll give you another example with
databases I work with databases quite a
bit quite a bit because most web apps
are backed by relational databases and
one point I became very knowledgeable
about databases and how database design
and structure and optimizations etc etc
and I went down this rabbit hole in
details to learn all kinds little
details but how do you optimize your SQL
calls so that are really good how to how
to suck at tables properly sort of
really efficient and you can go crazy
with this and then I realized well I'm
not designing Facebook here you know I
just need to have you know a good basic
structure not you know a good basic
cause you know the major things that you
should and should not do to keep it
efficient and I'll be more in 5/4 99.9%
of apps so for me to waste my time going
to these highly detailed explorations of
database design and the SQL language SQL
language is the universal language of
relational databases but each database
has its own flavor of things so you know
MySQL had you know it has certain
drawbacks and advantages sequel server
has its own drawbacks and advantages and
own variation of SQL so but for me to
learn all these details is useless so
again to finalize now I will not spend
my time going down a rabbit hole like
doing learning about nest inter
iterations of nested arrays you know
what I mean it's much more important
that you just get the overview of each
language enough so that you can move
forward to be able to be be able to
produce an actual product and in the
case of web apps websites and web apps
than it is to get caught up in the
details that's again that's where a good
course and a good teacher comes in where
they say ok doesn't
learn this we got these things covered
in html5 now we need to learn this in
CSS okay if you say ok we're ready to go
we got these things in JavaScript ok
we're ready to go what I do in terms of
teaching the server side in terms of web
I'm a big proponent of PHP for all these
reasons you can watch videos on I'm not
saying please be the best language ever
no but I think for the web development
for freelancers just for overall for
overall startups in the web space I
would just use PHP because PHP was
dedicated to web app development of all
you can build fantastic web apps and
Ruby Ruby on Rails you do it Python and
Django you can do a java spring you know
you can do with c-sharp net etc etc so
that again is another going down a
tangent there so let me just wrap this
up because we're on seven minutes here
when it comes to this whole thing don't
get caught up in the minutia you're not
going to understand every single detail
about everything every single language
right away as long as you can produce an
end product that works
that's all it matters that's all that
matters in fact in the first few years
of my experience as a developer as a
coder going back into the 90s there are
things I didn't quite understand
sometimes so I remember back in 96 97
I'd be writing code accessing I remember
accessing databases writing some of the
code so the core didn't quite understand
but I didn't quite understand it but I
made it work I made it work it was fine
and the apps ran fine and yeah there you
go so that's it
learn about the basics so you at least
you understand the basic you know what a
tag is with CSS classes the properties
are what functions are when raised are
you'll have to worry about the more
complex stuff now just get the basics
done and then get into the projects
that's why with my interactive developer
course I teach the basics the main
language is and then right away you have
all these projects which you can you
know crud stop building a CMS but they
were pristine I provide these projects
as a way for you to exercise your basic
skills that you learned in the first
part of the package
and that's the key to learning so don't
find yourself down these intellectual
nerd rat holes because being able to
iterate through subarrays and be able to
create anonymous inner function it's
just two examples are not going to get
your job if you can't put together a
working web app from an from A to Z I
hope that helps
