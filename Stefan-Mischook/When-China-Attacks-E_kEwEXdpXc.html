killer sites calm in this quick little
podcast I just want to quickly comment
about recent attacks I've been getting
from China well it's not so recent china
chinese visitors from the main line make
up a small percentage of the traffic
hitting the killer sites network
relatively speaking but what's
disturbing is that the majority of the
nefarious attacks trying to login
through ssh ftp and so on they're from
china I've heard this through the
grapevine actually that Chinese tend to
the mainland they tend to attack a lot
of sites apparently the attack Google
they took down some other big-name sighs
they're constantly attacking I'm not
sure if it's because there's just so
many a Chinese a billion or so or is it
because there's this culture out there
that you know but causes us to occur I
don't know I have no clue but all I'm
saying is that based on my logs a based
on the fact that the Chinese traffic is
relatively small compared to North
American traffic and European traffic
for instance I'm getting a huge amount
of attacks you China and that is you
know so cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
