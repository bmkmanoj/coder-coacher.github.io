one of the many reasons to learn web
design development is to manage your own
website for your business so you may not
even have any inclinations or any desire
to become a professional web developer
but a lot of small business owners are
starting to realize that understanding
how websites and web ads are built will
actually help him out quite a bit when
managing their own website so i got an
email recently from my student of mine
and we were just talking about some
things about the courses and he
mentioned that the end game for him was
to rebuild and maintain his own business
website and to understand enough so he
can make good decisions about what to do
with the website and that's a key thing
when you have a small business for many
small businesses your website is very
very important and to be able to make
good decisions about where to take your
website with technologies to use and so
on it kind of makes sense that you at
least understand the basics of the whole
web design and web app development
process this will allow you to make good
decisions and so you're not in going in
there blind it's kind of like going into
your garage to get you know work done on
your car and you're basically if you
don't know anything about cars about the
basics about how things work like me
you're at a loss because you can you can
only trust what happens with the garage
guys tell you you know how that is right
so you have to be vigilant I think I'm
learning a little a little bit more
about cars just so I understand what's
generally going on so you know if they
suggest they want to you know change the
brakes now or it's not time to change
the tires at this point simple things
like that at least I'll have some sort
of information
to sort of weigh what they're telling me
with your website or your web app if
your small business owner this is
something that you should consider as
well having that basic level of
knowledge is going to help you to make
proper decisions about your own on the
website so that's pretty much it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
