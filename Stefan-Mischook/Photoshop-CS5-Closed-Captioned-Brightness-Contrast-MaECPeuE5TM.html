what I want to talk to you about and
commence talking to you about is working
with color Corrections inside of
Photoshop now here is one of the most
essential elements of working inside a
Photoshop it seems like every element
that I'm talking about is an essential
component well remember this is an intro
to photoshop and there's very many
elements that we are not going to be
addressing in this particular course
just because it's outside the scope of
the course and we don't really have the
time that we wouldn't like to dedicate
to it however what I'm going to be
showing you are some of the most
important elements inside of Photoshop
and easily if we go to our image menu
item right up at the top here you'll see
adjustments and easily color Corrections
which are done through adjustments are
by far one of the most important
components about working inside of
Photoshop environment so we can go to
photoshop and we can file open or we can
browse in bridge or the mini bridge as
we saw earlier however i'm just going to
say open and i'm going to direct you to
that same source files folder that's
probably on your desktop if you've done
what I asked you to and if you scroll
down you'll see one of them is called
stone church crosses so if we open this
up the very first image adjustment that
I'm going to be talking to you about is
one called brightness and contrast it's
really one of the easiest ones to work
with but it's quite simple in how you
can deal with it there's still a few
things that you should be aware of and
understand how to work with so here I'm
just going to double click on this layer
and I change it from background to layer
0 you don't really need to do that
that's just a force of habit that i
usually get into and as you can see if
we wanted to improve the color of this
particular image i'll go to image and
we'll look at adjustments and you can
see there are plenty of adjustments that
we're going to be talking about in due
time but first and foremost and
quite easily as you can see here
brightness and contrast is right at the
top so there's a few things I want you
to be aware of number one we can see a
preview of what we're going to be
affecting so this is happening on the
fly if I move my slider one way or in
another the preview is going to allow us
to see what those changes are so also
another button here called use legacy
and i am going to encourage you not to
click on use legacy if you do it will
revert to the older brightness and
contrast that was an earlier versions of
photoshop i guess some people still like
using that and that's why this legacy
button is here however it's very very
much agreed upon that the new brightness
and contrast seems to work a whole lot
better than it did in the past so it's
probably best for you guys to all
continue working in this fashion well
let's see as you can see this image
looks kind of drab it doesn't really
look all that great so one of the things
we can do is what you notice is that the
drabness here it's due to the lighting
in this particular image and if I were
to increase the amount of brightness you
can see what exactly is happening the
image gets increasingly brighter now
don't go all the way to the edge because
as you can see that's not going to help
you out notice that if we were to reduce
the brightness well just as the name
implies right the image gets a little
bit darker depending on what's happening
here my images sort of grayed out so I'm
going to be adding positive brightness
if my image was too bright you might
want to bring this down into a negative
area however we're just going to
brighten this up a little bit and we're
not going all the way to the edge even
if I were to just say yeah 50 looks good
all right well let's see what's
happening with that now I'm going to
also ask you to include the contrast now
what exactly happens number one when we
introduce the brightness and we're
increasing the brightness well what is
happening in this situation is there are
three sort of tones that you're dealing
with when it comes to color and image
inside of Photoshop now those are
generally the brightest
or the highlight areas then there are
the shadow areas which are the darkest
and then there are the middle areas the
mid-tones as they're called so when you
are increasing the brightness you're
really increasing the mid-tones the
brightest areas remain as bright as they
are and that's why we see these little
specks on the crosses here that remained
pretty much the same color that they
were see that they didn't really change
all that much while the mid-tones in
this area did change significantly
notice also the shadows did not really
change all that much because those are
kind of locked in place now when we're
dealing with contrast on the other hand
what we're doing here is we're also
adding more contrast to the element now
if I go all the way to the edge you see
like the refinement of that image sort
of you know gets a little blurry or and
doesn't really work all that well it
also creates posterization when we do
that now what does that mean well it
means that you're sort of not giving the
best to your edges and some of these
edges might actually become damaged and
if I were to increase that contrast you
can see now look I'll put it all the way
on the right hand side just so that you
can get an idea that's too much right
and what we're going to do instead sort
of bring this roughly around to the same
area that we had our brightness and that
significantly increases the brightness
and the contrast on this image so if
you're wondering hmm how much did I
improve this from the original well
certainly you can you know go back to
zero but that's not really useful here
if you just turn off your preview you
could see what it looked like originally
and now what it would look like with the
settings that you've applied so if you
click OK and you're happy with that what
you've done is you've permanently
affected the brightness and contrast of
this image now that is kind of
destructive in the sense that your
original image now if I were to save
this would be saved in this fashion
later on when we work with things called
adjustment layers you can see that will
be able
do something like effect brightness and
contrast but do so in a fashion that is
not as destructive as choosing image
adjustments from the top here so we'll
get to adjustment layers a little bit
later on and I'll show you how those
work but as you can see we've
dramatically improved the way this image
looks simply by working with the very
simplest of the adjustments and that is
brightness and contrast it's also the
easiest one to work with simply because
there's only a couple of little sliders
here that we have to deal with but as
you can see it'll dramatically improve
the way your images look just quite
quickly with a snap of a finger and a
slide of a slider and all those images
that you might have taken on your iPhone
or who knows what else will look
exponentially better once you apply this
particular adjustment to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
