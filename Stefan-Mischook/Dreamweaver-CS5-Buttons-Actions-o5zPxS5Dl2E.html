and all we really need to do is to add
ourselves a little button down at the
bottom so I'm going to press return so
that we have a nice little paragraph
that's already indented I'm going to go
up to the top of our forms and you'll
notice that there is a button icon right
up here looks like a button so we'll
press on that inserting well first of
all we'll give it an ID so I'll just
call this the submit and we can label
this submit as well perhaps you want to
capitalize that one and you'll notice
that here it's styling by default with
no label tag we don't really need a
label it's already inside and
positioning it before the element
doesn't really help us here so we're
just going to click over there and
you'll see there's our submit and if we
like it like this that's fine you may
find that you know you don't really need
to put in this irregardless of the label
so I'm just going to call it submit like
this and we now have our submit button
now in order to get the submit button to
actually work we need to examine
something in our code view and we can
see here that in the code view we've got
the entire elements wrapped up
individually inside of paragraphs and
here is the opening of the form tag
itself and you'll notice that there is
information here in the property window
when we select it that way you'll see
that the action area is empty so what we
can do is actually provide an action and
what I'm going to do is to provide a
mail to action and you can see it right
here
I've just got mail to someone at
example.com something like that and if
we were to go into our contact area here
I will enter that into the action you
could enter it into the properties
window or directly into the code so the
first form element right over there the
action now has a mail to action
associated with it the post method
is we're posting this information it's
got the ID form one form one that's fine
but there's something else that we're
going to include in here and you can see
it in the finished example I've provided
the encryption type as text plane and I
can just copy that here or I can go into
this area and go to the encryption type
here and say text forward slash plane
actually I think it's type no text
that's right so now that we have text
plane in here what you will see is once
we preview this in the browser we have
all of our elements in place and I can
preview this in Safari and just take a
look at it we can see that everything is
sort of mapped out pretty much the way I
want and you'll notice the links work go
to home section go to contact section
you may be wondering why is it shifting
the way it is because the home section
has a scrollbar whereas the contact
section does not so you might see a
little shift that's perfectly normal
because it's always supposed to be in
the center it's relative and check it
out if I were to come in here and say
you know first name Santo last name
Romano notice I'm just pressing tab to
go in between there and I'll say enter
your comments here hello and if I press
tab I can say what are you interested in
and I can say thread needles thimbles
very interested in newsletter no thank
you
Canada is my country of origin and if I
submit this notice what happens it opens
up the email I can put in subject if I
wish notice all this information that I
entered in here are the values for those
areas and it's provided us with
something that we can use as a real live
world example so that's your form
working perfectly and now all we have to
do is to think about and concern
ourselves with potentially styling this
information and making it look a little
bit more akin to what's going on with
the rest of our example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
