back into code specifically I want to
look at something called event handlers
before I get into event handlers I just
wanted to point out that this is a one
of the classic examples of we're
learning JavaScript or a concept in
JavaScript well apply will have
application rather in many other
languages that are out there for
instance event handlers are mechanism
that you see in languages like
ActionScript like Java C sharp and
several others so by learning event
handlers in this video and in JavaScript
you will pretty much have learned a lot
about event handlers and many other
languages so down the road when and if
you decide to pursue other languages
you'll it's going to be a lot easier for
you because you will already have learnt
it in JavaScript so if there's ever
times that you're sitting through one of
my videos or maybe you're learning
another language and you're getting a
little bored and you're wondering what's
the point just keep that in mind that a
lot of times with the concepts that you
learned in one language will help you
understand or will be pretty much the
same thing as in another language
there'll be a little bit of difference
in the way it's executed in the
different languages but that's not the
hard part the hard part is understanding
the basic concept to begin with and one
last point about this javascript is a
great language to learn with because
it's a language that's based on the C
programming language and why that's
important is because many other
languages like I mentioned before on
JavaScript Java C sharp action script
which is Flash's programming language
and of course Java scripts they're all
based on C so having that same root will
make it really easy for you to jump from
one to the other and today in web
programming or what
design these are all interesting
languages although you know Java c-sharp
that's more for building really hardcore
server-side programming but a lot of you
may want to get into ActionScript for
instance later on and for you to go from
JavaScript to ActionScript will be
really easy
what our JavaScript event handlers well
I'm gonna read through a couple points
and then we're gonna jump into some code
right away because I think it's just
gonna be a lot easier to understand when
you see the code in action but let's
just start off with these points event
handlers are built-in mechanisms that
basically scan for actions or events to
happen in your web page so for example
when someone clicks on on a paragraph or
some piece of text on your page the that
if event handler is called on click
think of it as on the click when
somebody moves a mouse over an image or
a paragraph or anything in a webpage
that event handler would be called on
mouse-over
when a page is loaded into the web
browser that's called on load
before I go on what's this new theory
let's just jump into some code I'm gonna
pop open my code editor I'm just gonna
use adobe CS for Dreamweaver yeah
be consistent again you can use any text
editor but you feel comfortable with
that's up to you
even no patters fine I just use it
because it's kind of nifty
so let's I'm using a trial so I'm
expecting that little trial window to
pop open here we go yeah yeah I got 20
more days so now that you have to buy
this I guess index okay we got our
simple web page here mmm not very
exciting but it will be soon okay so I
got a paragraph so I'm just gonna add an
event handler so I'm gonna go see that
little drop-down list that's extremely
ver giving me options as you can see
here it gives me all these options a
code hinting almost so you got on click
on double click on key down on key press
on Mouse up Mouse down over how it over
and you know this is um what you call it
these are all the different event
handlers that you can apply to paragraph
so Dreamweaver is intelligent enough to
figure out what we're trying to do so it
gives us these options so I'm just gonna
dope don't click on that so on click so
what are we gonna do on the click so
we're just gonna say I'm going to pop up
our handy alert box we've seen this in a
previous video and I say there we go so
let's let's preview that in a browser
and see what it looks like all right now
I'm using Firefox here I'll just shrink
this into screen size here we go so I
use Firefox so I just I'll click on it
oh nothing happened arrow or air or
what's the error I know why you see we
talked about the alert in a previous
video and if you notice on click I have
to use when I call on click this event
handler I have to use the quotes here
double quotes to surround it anything
let me just select all this Oh cut it
out anything in between these brackets
are gonna be called by the browser what
I mean called I mean it will fire it off
so you can put function to the record of
all kinds of stuff in there this is for
JavaScript Brian it's all JavaScript
anything in between these two things
it's like it's like like body and body
it's like P and P anything in between
these two things will be respond it will
be activated there's a word will be
activated by a web browser when somebody
clicks on this paragraph right it was
because we apply the on click on the
paragraph so I put in the classic alert
now the reason didn't work is because in
JavaScript you can't have it quotes you
can't have double quotes inside of
double quotes you have to have a single
quote have to go like this Co single
quote save so there's a little
JavaScript tip this is pretty consistent
actually so let's now refresh this try
again there we go ouch you click me so
what can we take away from this number
one you can apply event handlers and
there are many we just like we looked
out on clicker as one on to all kinds of
elements on our page right just about
any element that people interact with
right you wouldn't apply an event
handler to title because people can't
really interact with the title because
the title of the page appears up here
right so we know that we can apply event
handlers to elements on our page from
talking about elements tags and so far
from the images but we also know
that we can apply different types of
event handler so we had on click right
so let me go back here I click on
something the alert pops up so what that
does is that on the click do this and in
this case we said call this alert the
box here and that's just one example
your first introduction to an event
handler what's put in another one I'm on
mouse-over alright we'll try it out one
save it
I'll refresh the page said I'm not gonna
click him he's gonna run my mouse over
see how popped up I just had to run my
mouse over it pretty cool
there's a lot more to event handlers in
Jeff's with pain we're going to explore
that in the next couple of videos one or
two I'm not sure how many more we're
going to do after this so this is just
just the end of video number one on
event handlers and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
