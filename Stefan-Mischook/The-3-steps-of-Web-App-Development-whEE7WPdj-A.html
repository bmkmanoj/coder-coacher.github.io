vlog I'm going to talk about the three
stages of app development three stages
of app development so I used my nifty
new iPad pro here and I draw a nifty
diagram so I don't know if you can see
that or not but you see it or step one
two and three step one is UI UX step two
is database design step three is the
object creation those are the business
objects which you write in your
programming language of choice whether
it be PHP Java C sharp Ruby whatever so
there's a reason for this order of
things now back in the day everybody was
taught that when you're designing apps
you would design the object model first
the object model in red object model
means just a code that you write in your
language of choice now this video by the
way is for people who've done like my
beginners course on Python or my course
on my full stack web development course
I assume you have some knowledge this is
taking it to the next level so the first
thing you want to do is step number one
in blue step number one in blue you want
to do your UI and your UX now you're not
going crazy in terms of making it look
super beautiful but you might do like a
simple little sketch like this and the
whole point of designing a UI in UX
first user interface a user experience
to a lesser extent at first is just to
get a rough idea of what it is the app
is all about whether it be an app for a
phone mobile app or whether it be a web
app by designing your screens first
screens as UI UX it will allow you to
map out what exactly is going to appear
from the user now the reason I don't go
to the objects to do that first is
because it's too abstract it's - in
other words when you design your app
from objects it's too detached from what
people are actually going to see and use
in the real world it doesn't work so
well I find I found over the years so I
found a much better approach whether it
be building apps for myself or for
clients was
the screens because you see exactly
what's there so let's say I was building
a dating site what I would do is I would
first list out the various pages I would
have so in this example very simple I'd
have a home page I'd have a sign-up page
I don't even know if this isn't you or
not we'll see what happens with the
exposure so I would have a home page a
signup page and a main page where they
would you know they would lion once
they've logged in they see all the
people and a dating site they could do
the searches and so on so I would first
list out the three screens as they've
done here so you see I'm using arrows
and so forth to map out to point out
where when you click on major buttons
where it takes you so if you click on
logout it takes you back to the home
page you click on sign up on the home
page it takes you to sign up page yeah
yeah yeah this is just very rough and
basic stuff and then when you get into
the various pages I would draw out a
paycheck so and I would draw out the
various fields the boxes what would
appear in the page so the first stage of
laying out your pages is to just do a
quick sketch quick drawing it could be
on a pad it could be on a piece of paper
and pad et cetera then the next step is
to do the quick layout where things are
going to be positioned right each step
along the way you show your client
client could be somebody who's paying
you or it could be just yourself and
step 3 you kind of refine where things
are positions not make a final look and
feel to make it look beautiful just
positioning this is we're using some
free templates where you know or they
have a two column three column that kind
of thing you can get them on the web for
free again just for structuring the
position of elements on their page the
whole point of this exercise is really
just to figure out exactly what's going
to appear in your page that's the key
what's going to appear in your page why
don't you figure out what's going to
appear in your page if I went by way of
the screens and your clients can see
that clearly because they'll say oh yeah
we want to login page yeah we like to
know the members here we like this etc
etc then the next step is to go in
yellow to the databases databases you
design your databases I'm not going to
teach about database design here but
most of us are using
SQL based database of relational
database of tables base database and
since you've done your UI the UI what's
in the UI will tell you what fields with
tables what columns you would have
inside of your database it makes it much
easier then finally the last stage the
last stage is in red is he do your
object model you actually write the core
code whether it be in PHP and Python
Java Script whatever language you want
to use you rate your color code that
will basically connect the database to
your user interfaces that's pretty much
it this is an effective process because
it allows for your client to see exactly
what's going on allows you to better map
what data you're holding it's works
pretty good now of course this doesn't
necessarily apply to writing C++ to
small devices like a heater or something
or you're programming a robot or
something this of course does not apply
this is for your typical mobile app your
typical web app website this is the
structure that works really really well
and it's just going to save you a lot of
time if you build your apps using this
process all right
