here the first thing I need you to do is
to log into the Kabul sites video
tutorial library and download a zip file
which contains images that we're going
to be using throughout this tutorial
I've believe i called it images zip so
take a look for that it should be
immediately above or below the link to
this video so that's the first step so
download that file and unzip the
contents to wherever you go you're going
to be developing this application and in
my case we will be working with PHP so
I've placed the folder within the htdocs
folder so my server can access them so
the exact place where you place your
files may change depending on whether
you're on Windows or on Mac or whatever
but keep that in mind so what I have
here in the left sidebar is I have my
cool sites folder where I'll be
developing this application and I have
six different files I have a banner to
edit BG edit type my h1b G a toolbar BG
and finally a trans gift which is a
transparent gif file and probably the
first thing we need to do is build out
our folder structure so the first thing
I'm going to do is I'm going to make a
new folder I'm going to call it app and
this folder is going to hold all of our
content management system files we're
going to be working with that much in
this particular video but in future
videos it will be important with in-app
I'm going to add a new folder called
resources and within resources and add a
new folder called images and this folder
is going to hold all images that relate
to the content management system in some
way so i'm going to move all items
except for banner.jpg into that folder
there you go and now we're done with the
app folder for the moment
so I'm going to create a new folder and
this one's going to be called resources
and this will hold resources in relation
to the website itself so i'm going to
start out with the CSS folder excuse me
so a CSS folder and within that folder
and add a style that CSS file and then
I'm going to create a new folder images
and I'm going to place my banner.jpg
within that there you go and as a last
step for this particular video at least
i'm going to create one more new file
index dot PHP and let me close out all
of these if the exception to my style
tss my index dot PHP so let me move
forward building out the actual HTML and
CSS template that we're going to be
using so I'm going to start out with
just a standard HTML for layout so my
doc type I have a head section with a
title I'm just going to call this test
nothing super fancy here I'm going to
include my CSS file and in case anyone's
wondering the program that i'm using to
do all these little text snippets
something called text expander it's a
program for the mac and allows me to
type in various commands on my keyboard
hit tab and they'll automatically expand
into a full snippet of code so it's
pretty useful and helps me speed up
typing quite a bit so anyway so we have
this let's link up our CSS file
correctly so resource
is CSS style dot CSS and within the body
let's start out by giving it a class of
home I usually like adding classes to
the body tag to indicate whether its
homepage or a subpage you know a
specific layout then I'm going to add a
div ID wrapper and this is going to
Center the website thin wrapper I'm
going to have an h1 tag just going to
call it website and add a div with an
idea banner and within that div I'm
going to add my image banner dot jpg
I'll give it an alt tag of banner width
of 900 pixels and a height of 140 so
that's finishes up the banner then I'm
going to move on instead of the day of
i'm going to use an unordered list here
and this is going to be our navigation
section and I'm add unordered list items
within it and just a couple sample ones
just you know so you can get a feel for
what this would work like so home and a
copy and paste this line a couple times
just going to do a test link longer text
link your tests but doesn't really
matter and contact us
so the point of what I'm putting
together now isn't so much to work with
a show an example of a fully working
website but at least give us that
framework that we can work with our
content management system and date and
edit content I'm just give you a feel of
how this would work so i'm going to add
another div ID this will be our content
section and within this content i'll add
div with a class of left this will be a
left column and i did with a class at
right and that'll be the right column
and within these sections i'm just going
to add in a bit of filler content here
and the same thing with the right column
okay so content is done add a footer as
well add the copyright symbol 2011 test
website and I believe that'll do for now
yep looks good hope to leave these
couple extra spaces at the bottom here
just move things up so you could see it
a little bit better let me save this
let's do a quick preview and you'll
notice this is what it looks like at the
moment I'm just standard HTML and let's
go ahead and work on the style.css</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
