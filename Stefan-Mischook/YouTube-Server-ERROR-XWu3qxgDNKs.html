about to upload this particular video
that you're watching now and I get this
on youtube youtube uploaded her I've
been having a real real bad luck with
Facebook and YouTube and Twitter Vimeo
and these huge sites they're like having
all kinds of problems I keep keep
catching it well at least they're there
500 error was quite funny here a team of
highly trained monkeys has been
dispatched to deal with this situation
uh yeah here we go
that's pretty much it I just thought it
was pretty funny all right back to the
flog hey guys just a very quick vlog
here so the killer sized community the
new one is now alive and we've had a few
people join from YouTube that's great I
appreciate that
again this is it's all free I am sorry
launching I've relaunched the community
because of a few things number one it
allows me to build up a group of people
who do my courses and they will be able
to help other students along the way
it's just a place where people who have
similar interests in this case learning
a code or learning the business and the
things etc etc it will be able to be
able to get together talk discuss it's
gonna save me time because a lot of
times I get a lot of the questions sent
to me over and over again and so having
the forum where we will have top-rated
questions top-rated people answering
questions it will just simplify the
process now for you the advantage of
joining a forum is that most few things
number one you're gonna get access to
premium content I'm gonna be posting
things here to entice people I'm not
gonna lie
for instance in the Python forum I
posted a video that I've not made public
from my Python course opening files with
pythons right here so there's a little
be exclusive content in the community
that you're not going to find on YouTube
I mean we start vlogging on here and
especially when I start coming out with
some other newer
course video so that's one reason to
join the other reason is that by
participating in a forums you're going
to make connections you're going to get
to know people and this will serve you
sooner than later if you you would be
surprised in terms of making business
contacts work contacts reputational
contacts and so with the forum you will
be able to create your own profile pages
that are highly detailed which are
record and so on and this is a way you
will be able to get jobs and contracts
once you start developing a profile the
community does generate a lot of search
engine traffic even though it had been
on offline for a least publicly offline
for quite a bit of time but now that the
new forum is in place the new forum
software it's much easier to manage and
has a lot of real cool features and I'm
just setting things up yeah so that's
just a couple of reasons so exclusive
content ability to develop a reputation
online and to meet like-minded people
and I can tell you from experience I've
been running these forums like this for
many years now it's almost a guarantee
if you participate you will make contact
you will make friends which will could
lead to business employment
opportunities and so forth and for me
I'm doing it because it just generates
interest in my brand it takes a little
work off my hands because once people
start participating in the forums and
we'll have a nice archive of information
on the course materials but I put out it
would just be easier for me I won't have
to field so many email questions and
yeah the advantage finally of the forum
software over YouTube is that it's much
more searchable much more it's much
easier for you to organize and so forth
and this is just the beginners all kinds
of capabilities that this software
allowed me to access and we'll see how
it goes over time hopefully we'll be
able to relaunch the community as I
speak now if you look down here who's
online just in the last you know I think
it's every 15 minutes so 20 guests just
unless
fifteen minutes you click through you
can see where they're going topics at
the reading so these are real people so
even though this forum been pretty
dormant for a while it still gets a lot
of juice from the Google so once we get
it going it's gonna be an active place
not just for coding not just for
business I've created an open forum
where you can just chat with each other
about whatever you want and there's a
very robust private messaging it's kind
of cool etc etc etc and finally it's
really easy to join you can join
directly or could use Facebook Twitter
or Google+ so that's it for now I should
have a vlog out by the end of the day
