January it's a second yes January second
today yep incognito between work and
family events you know holidays so yeah
I just again I'm just recording this
video quickly to keep in touch with you
know I'm still round we're just
finishing up my book I'll give you a
quick look at some of the so one of the
templates here yeah what could I show
you what can I show you yes we the last
a quick peek last chapter you know all
these little comments these little boxes
and pink and stuff these are just
comments left by individuals the editor
rather and layout artist with regards to
you know things in the book anyway so
the process of writing a book is pretty
involved a lot of back and forth between
myself and the editors hope it's going
to be a good one but again and once this
is done and it's taken longer than I
thought but I'm back to work on old
brand new set of video courses as some
of you may know I'm one of the original
guys out there to put out training
courses on coding whether it be web
design or web programming and anyway so
I took a little bit of a break I have to
admit for a little while but I'm back
I'm looking at what's out there and I
think I could do much better job
sorry about that I just had to take that
call anyway to conclude this video I'm
giving you a sneak peek here at web
mentor org the big update that we've
been working on and you can see here it
a responsive design so it all flows we
have brand new courses for instance
course on full screen videos and we just
fast forward here so you can see they're
not bad and yeah so I'm pretty excited
about getting all the new stuff out it's
and yeah other stuff as well so anyway
yeah I'm back and it's January second
you start you should start seeing
regular video blogs over the next few
weeks and we're going to be exploring a
whole bunch of new topics and beyond
what we cover initially beyond what we
cover well when I cover typically which
is CSS HTML CSS 3 html5 PHP object went
to programming I'm going to be revamping
some of those courses especially the PHP
courses so getting a little long in the
tooth but I'm actually started to work
on other languages as well Python Ruby
this stuff is going to come out over
time amongst other things so yeah that's
about it we'll see we'll see if we're
going to if we could do something a
little bit different now there's no
point and redoing stuff in the same way
it's kind of boring for me and for you
so we're going to do stuff differently
and yeah i hope i hope you find this
stuff interesting once it comes out so
that's about it thanks for watching and
we will talk very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
