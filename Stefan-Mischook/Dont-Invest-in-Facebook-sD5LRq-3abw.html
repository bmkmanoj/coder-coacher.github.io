sites calm in this video I want to
briefly talk about social networks with
particular attention paid to facebook
now Facebook is about to go IPO initial
public offering IPO is short for initial
public offering and basically they're
looking to cash out all the original
investors the early investors private
investors in facebook they there they've
invested lots of money they've carried
this company for many years and now
they're doing what they got to do to
make the numbers look good numbers we
know they counting so it looks like a
this company's making money and they put
it out and the IPO to put it out on
stock market so so grannies and and
people could buy the company thinking
it's going to be a great thing and they
catch out there looking to cash out so
when they go public because it's
becoming a public company they have to
reveal a bunch of information that they
didn't have to before and what's coming
out what is something I suspected and
that is Facebook is hardly going to be a
profitable business in fact they're
doing all kinds of stuff now to try it
you know beef up the earnings and stuff
that will actually hurt the long-term
viability of the business and the
business is largely selling ad space and
the problem with Facebook type of site
social networking type of sites and ad
space is that I can tell you from
experience going back to the 90s that
these type of user communities do not
monetize very well meaning that the ads
don't work very well at all you see a
social network is just a variation of an
old the old forms the old BBS is and
I've been running forms 8 10 years and
forms are notoriously bad for ad revenue
because when people go to forums or
social site or social networking site
like facebook or myspace or Friendster
they're not there to do their dev to see
their friends
the friends are doing look at photos
upload photos they're not searching for
anything any products and services it's
not like when somebody goes to google
and they're you know a lot of they're
searching for something and the
percentage of people that can convert
into actual clients are much much much
much much much much much much higher
with a guru so that's the big problem
with facebook it doesn't convert well my
battery's about to run out crepe so
anyway whatever you do don't buy the
facebook IPO don't do it you may make
you may get lucky it made spike up
because of some hype at the end of the
day I'm pretty sure Facebook's going to
go to way of myspace eventually Facebook
equals myspace myspace huge loser
myspace equals friendster franceour huge
loser and it's just a big mess so do not
buy the facebook IPO social networks are
something that should be contained
within real businesses Google is doing
with Google+ and I think Google+ is much
better than Facebook anyway in terms of
engineering terms of privacy and so on
so that's it I was going to talk a bit
more but my batteries just about to go
turning red here so next video ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
