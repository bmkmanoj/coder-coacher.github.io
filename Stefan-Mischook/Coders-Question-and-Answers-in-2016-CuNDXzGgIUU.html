some questions off of a YouTube's right
here and yeah I was going to answer them
in text in a comment section but I
figure video would just be easier with
this nifty new camera setup I got here
it's easy to do videos now so yeah I got
stopped looking at the screen here look
at the camera anyway so here it here's
the questions from David good questions
it's in response to a video i just put
out called adapting to tech trends in
2016 so the first question he was asking
is what exactly do I mean by templates
well I was talking about web template
somebody had asked about where our web
templates killing traditional web design
we develop design a site from scratch
and for small businesses yes I think it
has a major impact I think that
templates now are so good in terms of
the code in the design that the need to
design from scratch is diminish quite a
bit for small businesses you find what
larger businesses are going to want to
customize because they got the money to
do that and they understand they care
more about their branding and they don't
want to look like they're using some
sort of template that being said
templates really good today so I would
recommend using a template and there's
nothing wrong with that as a web
designer developer I would not feel
threatened by templates don't because
they're just a tool set in your tube not
a tool set it's a tool in your toolbox
that you can leverage memmer whether
you're building websites creating
database driven websites whatever
creating mobile skins we're all using
templates or code libraries to some
extent if you're using MySQL you're
using a prefab system using an app
that's been written and given to you for
free so instead of having to roll out
your own database as people had to do 20
30 years ago four years ago you just use
MySQL or
square or whatever whatever database
that you want to use giving your app
think about these frameworks like
laravel and PHP or ruby on rails rail or
Django or Java spring these are all
frameworks of code and they simplify the
whole process so don't take these things
as being as hurting you they just help
you so instead of having to cut down the
trees in the force you now just go to
the local and a wood shop and get the
planks of wood whole process for you so
you don't make your money cutting down
the trees now but you make your money
elsewhere so yes the profession of web
design development is changing quite a
bit because of templates so I was
talking about web templates the visual
components the UI components of a site
next question he said so if you're
saying that building sites from scratch
and paraphrasing pneus are you saying
that I shouldn't bother trying to learn
how to write code in HTML CSS and J's no
you have to write HTML CSS and jazz
great because even if you're using a
template even if you're using a J's
library like jquery or using a prefab
template a wordpress template a theme
template to call or just a standard
website template you steep you still
need to understand the code behind the
templates be able to tweak them make
little modifications because even the
best template there's going to be
changes to be made a little bit
sometimes a little sometimes a lot and
I've been advocating template use in
terms of design and web design for a lot
for the longest time it just saves money
for the client it makes you more
competitive and it just speeds up the
process so the role of the web designer
the web developer has changed your no
longer stripping things up from scratch
for the most part but do you make your
money elsewhere so let's say you don't
want to be a full-fledged developer
you just like doing you out user
interface design so that's cool so what
you can do is you can become somebody
who understands all the templates that
are out there all the different options
so when you deal with a collage sale
okay you interview them you say okay
what do you need for your site you take
your notes and then you present to him
the next day or the following week you
present to the client maybe three
template options at your file so here
are the three templates and you say
we're using templates because we're
gonna be saving a lot of money because
they're the prefab but well then we're
going to modify them to suit your
specific needs that's what a coding
comes in you have to understand code so
you can go in there and tweak the HTML
tweak the CSS and maybe tweak some in a
JavaScript maybe bring in a jquery
library to do some rotating elements
within the page who knows so you have to
know code even though we've entered into
an era of using templates in web
development now again you know to take
away that fear encoding for the longest
time where we are constantly using
prefabricated chunks of code whether
they be whether they be libraries
whether they be frameworks full fledge
flame works like Django or laravel or
rails or spring or whatever that's okay
template uses five it just changes the
role and in fact between you and me be
glad that we have templates doing the
old what's the word I'm looking for the
nuts and bolts work of having to create
some basic user interface component it's
just it's not fun coding I remember back
in the 90s would take somebody a couple
weeks a friend of mine took them like
two weeks to create a calendar picking
app widget rather for a HTML form now he
just with html5 you just you set the
input type to to calendar i think it is
i figured i'll also knocks off my head
and cook you got yourself a date picker
or input type
whatever it is we you know I rather that
than spending two weeks and building a
client two weeks to do is crazy silly
calendar stuff deal with the bigger
picture stuff so if you'd want to get
into raw code go into server-side coding
where there's still tremendous amount of
work you could maybe stick on the front
end user interface design and get into
more into usability which is UX user
experience maybe you could get into
things like web marketing social media
marketing so you can take a template get
it into their site integrate their
social media accounts set up their
social media accounts help them out turn
to setting up a schedule or they can use
social media teach you how to do that
maybe if they want video on their site
maybe you set them up a YouTube account
or maybe a Vimeo count and show them how
to integrate office so instead of you
becoming just a pure code monkey you're
in there providing a more a bigger
consulting service role and it's very
very lucrative so you come in more
turnkey like that as opposed to just
here's your website ok see ya that's
another route the other round of course
is getting into more advanced coding
board vas could be server-side coding
were you doing you know PHP framework
coding with laravel or something or
maybe you can get into or you know if
you're in you're in Ruby on Rails you
can do get into rails but that's a whole
different beast in terms of the type of
work you do remember in all my videos on
this channel i really emphasize how your
business goals your career goals affects
the technologies and the skill sets that
you develop so you have to serve think
about what you want to do what you feel
comfortable with and try to match that
with where the market is I hope that
makes sense to answer question number
four in the era of hand coding HTML CSS
websites since they're fading how
exactly does becoming a java chip or in
specific terms a front
and developer come into place our
front-end developer is not hand coding
HTML CSS and JavaScript to create a
product no there there hand coding for
sure but they're just not creating the
UI's the web UI is the basic structure
of a site from scratch anymore you know
at the very least are going to be using
something like bootstrap for instance
right if not a full-fledged template but
again today I would tell you I would say
that coders front-end developer coders
HTML guy CSS guys JavaScript guys they
got to be much more sophisticated than
they were 10 years ago they have to be
much more sophisticated and it were 10
years ago which is good it shows
maturity in the whole platform and the
whole thing so front-end developers the
elite guys I probably people getting
into well I think they know their way
around bootstrap they go the way a
little bit away they're a little bit
their way around jquery although jquery
is becoming more of a boilerplate so
that sort of background thing although
it's used jquery of course is used
within boosts crap anyway but i think
the Bucks will be in react j/s react
guys maybe angular 2 guys to look into
it see if that interest you may or may
not interest you so that's an option if
you want to stick to front end but again
that becomes your much more of a coder
so question number 5 is I mentioned a
previous video how jazz developers hot
and then I said that working knowledge
of Raj 20 CSS any other instance is long
gone no I didn't say that i I'm sorry it
was not clear in that video I'm not
saying that being a hand holder is gone
what I'm saying is developing a basic
user interface a basic website from
scratch is fading or is under a lot of
pressure for small business development
for small business development there are
still more established businesses where
they will do things from scratch because
they got the budgets and they understand
that having a very precise layout to fit
their particular business needs and
brands comes in handy you know for
instance
web everything is custom everything is
custom because it needed to be now for
many small businesses out there with a
butyl local butcher or bakery or some
nightclub or some bar or whatever what
have you a lot of them because they're
not the whole web component of their
marketing business is still kind of
young for them because it's a new
business they all have big budgets
they're the type that are going to be
using templates for now but at some
point if they grow successful I'm
telling you they're going to probably be
moving into custom websites and more
customizations of the template at least
so no again I'm not saying for a minute
but coding hand coding is going away in
fact it's coming much more important
what I am saying is how and when you use
that code is changing now you're not
building from scratch as much anymore
you're leveraging templates just like a
PHP coders no longer hacking out quick
little PHP scripts they are jumping into
a framework many of the times that would
be a framework like laravel or symphony
or whereas Java guys most of them are
not going to be reading old-fashioned
java servlets what I used to use a lot
and jsps now these are kind of like the
primitive version first version of Java
on the web for dynamic websites now all
the java developers are going to be
using some sort of framework these days
the most popular is the spring or
framework so again don't try not to be
feel threatened by the fact that we have
more automation more tools that we can
leverage as developers and technology
professionals they just speed up the
process and they just change where the
work lies but I'm telling you tell you
there's a huge demand it's only
increasing you just have to be aware of
developing you know for now in the
future as opposed to looking back for
instance seven eight years ago flash was
big there was a lot of work for flash
developers and okay maybe nine years ago
it's dead now because while Steve Jobs
pretty much
but nonetheless doesn't mean that coding
is dead it just means that type of
coding is God that area is gone I hope
that helps and that's it for this qna
