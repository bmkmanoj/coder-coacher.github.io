experience where we've been following my
vlogs about three months ago four months
ago I forget now I lose track of time
I bought a 10 thousand dollar
professional cinema camera for Canon C
200 well it's 7,500 us ten thousand
Canadian and I haven't missed a fancy
lens and Mike etc etc boom boom boom
bang bang it adds up to like twelve
thirteen thousand can a fourteen
thousand or so Canadian with the tax um
and I have my what I'm filming on now my
Canon EDD which I've had so with the
cinema camera I was forced to because
it's got all these fancy controls and
you know tremendous capabilities to
really dig deep into camera fundamentals
whether it be DSLR videos still camera
it has video capabilities or the
professional video camera now this
experience with this device has reminded
me of something I talk about all the
time and what do I talk about all the
time I say that at the end of the day
when it comes to all this programming
and software development etc any skill
business the fundamentals the basics are
what separates the pros from the not-so
pros it's really that and it's
consistent across all disciplines so I'm
talking about programming I'm talking
about business I'm talking about
jiu-jitsu our boxing and martial art and
which I've been reminded painfully same
thing with video work so I bought this
thing this is my kick-ass cinema camera
here it is a little picture that's it
it's ninety five hundred about US
dollars 850 Mike was about a thousand
bucks
it's up and if you look at the videos
last 50 videos I've been filming mostly
the cinema camera sometimes this camera
mostly a cinema camera and you see what
the results are inconsistent sometimes
the picture looks amazing sometimes I
look a little a little too crispy a
little too overexposed sometimes to
underexpose meaning the pictures a
little dark undetailed sometimes I got
like a blue sheen sometimes it looks
like I'm about to get sick but my face
is green or blue and that's just all
science and me not knowing exactly how
to use that camera properly so what's
the larger point the larger point is
that though I have this beautiful cinema
camera cost ten thousand Canadian
dollars seventy five hundred US dollars
I was still screwing up the quality of
the video so though I had this amazing
tool I will still wasn't producing great
results why because I was still learning
how to use the bloody tool I didn't know
my foundations very well but this is
what I'm discovering I was forced to
learn my foundations and that's that
kind of money so I better put some time
into learning this stuff so I put some
time and now I understand the
fundamentals of photography and
cinematography much better I understand
how to use white balance now I
understand about exposure much better
etc etc etc and so the results you're
gonna see last four or five videos are
much nicer now much more consistent
you're never gonna see the blue and the
green I'm never gonna look like I've
been cooked in the oven for two hours
etc etc but I've also seen that now with
DSLR does a Dede I understand these
fundamentals better so I'm able to
produce much better results even with
this very inexpensive camera so why do I
mention all this same thing with
programming by the way I can tell you
from over 20 years experience as a
software developer writing commercial
code going back to the 90s it's not the
language really that makes your apps
great it's not the language it's not the
framework it's you whether or not you're
a good developer
you can produce excellent apps and there
have been excellent web apps and
websites produced in languages that are
now considered crappy and out-of-date
and guess what a lot of these apps still
exist today and they do very well so
keep that in mind when you're in coders
pane programmers pane where you're
trying to decide which which programming
language you are going to pick to learn
don't get too hung up on that because
you can always switch from one language
to the next because once you know your
foundation once you know your core to
learn new languages pretty easy new
frameworks pretty easy so don't get
caught up on that and number two
understand that what's going to make
your apps great is not that you picked
the perfect language it's gonna make the
apps greatest whether you write good
code that's it that's it I can pull out
some mothball I'll take them some old
language out of the mothballs
you know an old framework and I can tell
you I could produce an app that does
pretty well I produce a website that
does pretty well now don't get me wrong
I'm not saying she look to the old stuff
the new stuff will just speed up the
process in certain areas not always you
gotta be careful but they will allow
certain types of work to be easier so
for instance in the web stack I'll use
that go that's what I'm most familiar
with you have all these frameworks PHP
has symphony and laravel and CodeIgniter
although these days I would be losing
laravel pythons Django flask
Java has they still use struts
apparently but spring is the most
popular one JavaScript you got no js' of
course on the server side etc etc so now
the whole point of these frameworks and
he's library sometimes react chances are
in library is that they just really
speed up the process it allows you to do
things much more quickly and that's why
you use a framework that's why you use
libraries so when I was actively writing
Java when Javel is my language de soir
my scores I sort of speak French given
I'm from Quebec it's my choice language
at one point it was Java was I had
developed my own MVC framework from
scratch because it just made be much
more productive these days most of the
time it would not be writing my own
frameworks there's so many great
frameworks out there it would be kind of
crazy to do it so very avid I hope this
lesson sinks in and the lesson is
knowing your fundamentals is more
important than anything else
don't get into coders pain or
programmers pain trying to figure out
what language you should learn or what
framework and it's not like I'm going to
learn the wrong language at all my apps
will be terrible doesn't work that way
you learn to program well you're right
simple modular code as I teach etc etc
doesn't matter what language you do
you're gonna produce goods good software
that's it for now oh here's a tip here's
a tip if you want to have people smile
at you when you're going in a coffee
shop your whatever just public random
public you want to smile or you can get
like this you can get this thing here
this works wonders I I had this I bought
this a couple of years back because I
used to wear shirt like this back in
college and so I bought this pin I put
it on my lapel and I bet it's it's
pretty good Mickey does the smiling for
you alright that's it for now bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
