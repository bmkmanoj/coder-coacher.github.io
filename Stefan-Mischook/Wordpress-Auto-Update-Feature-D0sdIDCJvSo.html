killer sites calm and other sites so in
this quick little V block I want to talk
about WordPress is new capability since
version 3.7 it's new capability to
update itself automatically this is an
important if you know development if you
will in WordPress because it really I
think it will really help cut down the
number of times WordPress sites are
hacked so I first found out about it by
getting this email here which WordPress
automatically sent to me it's at a yeah
we've updated WordPress automatically I
said well I'd even know about this
capability so the new update has new
dashboard enhancements you know now
we're pressed the WordPress dashboard
the WordPress control panel if you will
the dashboard as you can see here now is
supported by now now can support mobile
devices all those kind of stuff that's
cool but again the most important thing
about this this development where it can
auto update as bad as that you know it's
it's kind of like it's kind of like your
personal backups at home I know time
machine on Apple for instance you can
get this on Windows as well where you
said it updates it's it continuously
backs up your computer's every hour on
its own without telling you about you
having to do anything and that's the
only way that updates and backups really
especially backups rather really work
because you always lose files if you
don't have auto backup you always lose
files before you had a chance to backup
up but it's happened to be many times so
the auto backup is crucial so if you're
working with your computer
professionally whether your web designer
programmer whatever I strongly suggest
that you get an automatic backup system
it does it on its own timer at least you
know once every two hours once an hour
and they're sophisticated and
so you don't have to worry about backing
up your systems anymore you know and
WordPress 3.7 and above does a similar
thing with the update of its of itself
and that's crucial because the more
WordPress is updated last chance your
WordPress is going to get hacked which
is one of the downsides of using
WordPress because it's so popular and a
code base is traditionally it hasn't
been the best I don't know I haven't
looked at it in a while so I can't say
for today
I'm sure it's getting better and it's
not if it's not really good yet but
anyway the fact that it can update
itself and for instance this update
three point eight point one was there to
dress thirty-one bucks so that's that's
worth doing and a lot of these bugs can
be security holes that people discover
so auto update is fantastic now for auto
update the work you have to have your
webserver set up in a particular way two
things first of all the files your
WordPress files have to be owned by the
same user server user but execute the
web server now this is a little complex
I'm not gonna get into the details here
so you want to know about it just go to
codex dot wordpress.org slash updating
underscore WordPress and you can get
this information this is something that
your host and provider has to set up and
a lot of them a lot of you guys will
probably have it set up anyway
automatically so you should be fine the
other thing that you need is the file
permission for your WordPress files have
to be set correctly and the file
permissions have to be seventy five five
or six four four again you can read this
get to details and if it's not done if
it doesn't work this the automatic
update doesn't work then what you've got
to do is bug your web host two and set
up the files accordingly the federal
senators so that this happens it's such
an important feature yeah so what's the
next thing I want to cover so yeah okay
so setting your files to have the right
permissions the 755 is 644
as I'm showing here how do you do that
well if you log in for instance you're
you're in this cPanel here and this is a
cPanel for that particular site that how
to build websites calm website which is
one of my beginner sites on web design
anyhow so what you want to do is you
want to go into the file manager under
files tab here you click on it and you
want to go in to be if if your WordPress
is on the web root as mine is this whole
site is actually driven by WordPress
everything is WordPress so the public
HTML is where all your web files reside
and you knows you the permission is set
to 750 so that's pretty good now if you
need to reset the permission you
right-click any change select change
permissions and there you go mrs. seven
750 so I know this is a very simple
superficial overview of WordPress and
its new capability yes you may not be
using a cPanel hosted service like we
use you may be using is gonna call
Polaski maybe I asked I don't know
anyhow what you want to take away from
this is a three point seven WordPress
does odd update automatically be this is
very good because how it will help
prevent hacking of your WordPress site
and finally you need to set your file
permissions properly seventy-five all as
well as it's on the WordPress codex site
here I'm gonna get the URL interview and
yeah you need to set it to seven five
five or six four four it depends on the
particular
circumstances of your server so
basically if your update is an auto
updates not working you have to bug your
your webhost and they can help you out
with that and then that's pretty much it
