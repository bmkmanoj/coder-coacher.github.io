update if you saw the vlog I did I don't
know a couple days ago where I talked
about where I mean a mistake in that I
destroyed my dev server installation
before deploying that codebase to the
live production server and we found the
bug and something wouldn't work and I
guessed at the time that it was probably
a database issue because the code in the
dev server was of course identical to
the code being deployed to the
production of the live server because we
use a repo we use github everything is
managed to that so it had to be
something else it had to even be a
server configuration or a database issue
so it wasn't a server configuration
because both the deaths the dev
installation and the production server
were on the exact same virtual private
network receiving virtual private server
so had to be a database issue now
typically well not typically but because
we have a dev box and a live box being
used by actual people we could not clone
the database from the dev box right we
had to just basically make changes now
it's not too often typically with mature
app it you could be changing the
structure of your database but we had to
do it in this particular instance
anyhow so we compared the structure of
the database on the dev box and the
database on the production server and
they were the same same fields etc etc
but when we looked a little closer we
saw the problem there is a setting a not
null setting on one of the fields which
is causing a problem that's always now
if you don't know database design then
this is probably you know gobbledygook
for you but at the end of the day
there's like basically an attribute if
you will a little setting if you will on
one of the database fields or columns
people might look at them as columns
which was different on the production
server
than on the development server that
caused the whole thing while that one
piece of functionality which is core to
fail so we're able to discover thy and
what you know it took only a few minutes
once we discovered what collect I have
to change the add that attribute to the
database field in the production server
bing bang Bob Junko where we go so
that's the update yes to that story
those development story there
