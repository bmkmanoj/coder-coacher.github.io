vlog it's unbelievable I was kind of
anti flogged for a while but I figured
why not so I'm adding one of these days
it's five o'clock and i was working on
the powerful python3 course and i'm just
running into all these blocks I getting
calls coming in from clients new clients
and then developers sending the emails
and other people it's just like ah so
it's very frustrating because you're
starting to record audio video and then
a little pop-up appears from messenger
on your screen I got shut that off what
are one of those days of frustrations
when I'm creating courses what I do is I
don't script exactly because for me
course creation is a process of feel so
I do outline the course let me show you
so you just saw one of my rough outlines
of the subjects but it's loose because
as I'm doing it I use into things a lot
when I'm producing a course I've been
teaching since 2003 so things will pop
up in my head automatically i'll be
explaining some concept like i don't
know polymorphism in object-oriented
programming and then a question will pop
it pop up in my head meaning a question
that I figured that I figured a steam
pipe might ask this probably comes from
just experience having but has so many
questions over the years so the dessert
comes to me otherwise if I was to sit
there and do detailed notes and step by
step I don't know how that would turn
out I just kind of prefer my method of a
loose structure and then I kind of just
fill in the blanks as I go along with
the course now of course when you are
creating an app you have to get your
ones actually pretty much same thing
because I found in my experience in
creating apps especially for other
people is they don't quite know what
they want so it doesn't mean you go in
there totally loose you create a loose
you create a structure you create all
the views the page use in the case of a
web app already out to use so they know
what what fields and buttons and things
are seeing so forth but what I found is
that ultimately the end user or the
client won't really know what they want
in a nap until they start using it and
interacting with it I learned through
experience to really work really quickly
to just get it out as quickly as
possible that being said I do plan out
my code in my courses so for example
that's just a snippet of codes a simple
page where I'm showing flow control
using conditional statements and
functions as well we're actually
creating a guessing game with that
simple bit of code that's the thing
about Python with relatively little code
you can get a lot more done than you
could with several other languages
especially especially Java and C sharp
not criticizing Java and she sharp
they're very very capable languages of
the same of pythons really quick to get
things done although Python runs pretty
slow compared to chaplaincy sure that's
for sure so that's it one of these fuss
trading days so as a result i'm doing
this log alright that's it if you have a
fuss trading day what i would suggest is
you just try to get whatever you're
trying to do the big project if you will
just push it for just a little bit so
let's see if it's like coming out was
for 25 minutes half an hour just push it
forward you know set up set up what
you're going to be doing the next day so
if you're learning to code just you know
watch the first it's just 10 videos or
five videos for a particular chapter
watch the first video take some notes
maybe plan out if you're writing code
for a project maybe I right right be out
the basic the objects you know the a
strat abstract classes as an example or
if you're doing a PHP Java write out
your interfaces basically just to lose
outline what you're going to do do
something to push it forward but when
you're you're not feeling it after 25 30
minutes you probably but the work you're
going to put out that day is going to be
so it's probably just better to blow it
off and do something else until you get
that feeling especially in a creative
process if you force a creativity
whether you're a code or building a
course or writing a book or writing an
article I can tell you from experience
if you're forcing it's it's going to be
too bad as the French would say garbage
so yeah don't force it and but also when
your entrepreneurial when you are a
freelancer when you decide your hours
you have to
said you have to accept that you are not
night to find you have that advantage
where you're not going to work nine to
five but you may work from you know nine
until midnight or nine or 22 in the
morning you may work Saturdays and
Sundays a lot tomorrow you will alive so
in the end as a freelancer royal / place
with this vlog any and as freelancer you
probably be more not probably but you
will be working many more hours but you
have a lot of flexibility in terms of
when you put in those hours okay that's
it for this model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
