sites calm and killer PHP so in this
video I'm going to go off of programming
and web design but I'm going to show you
something very useful if you are a
Google gmail user Gmail is pretty
flexible has all kinds of extra
capability so I'm going to show you how
to create so I'm going to show you how
to create something like a web email so
anyway
first things first now you don't have to
look at me anymore so let's fly off the
screen now let's go to settings there we
go and then you go to labs and in labs
you want to look for canned responses
this thing right here and this is going
to allow you to set up an email template
or two or three or four or many more
I'll just read email for the truly lazy
see that's that's good for me save and
then send your common messages using a
button next to the compose form also
automatically send emails using filters
I never use that but I know the first
part so we're going to learn the first
part so you enable it by selecting while
talking toggling on the radio button
here and once that's selected just go to
compose and down here in the bottom
corner here this can responses menu item
is going to appear so you see I have a
few already but what you need to do is
you need to if you're going to create a
new one from scratch you type in your
message my message so you could be just
some standard stuff with your footer and
I don't know it depends what you were
doing you know I'll show you mine
afterwards and then you go back to your
can responses oops and then you're going
to select new canned response that will
save a brand new OC all right here and
I'm going to say indicate rather the new
canned response and okay so now it's
there and you can send off your email
you can cancel it but now it's most
importantly it's saved as a canned
response so if I compose again I go back
canned response you see it right at the
top in
you want to so you got three sub menus
insert save and delete when you're
inserting a canned response you want to
select from your insert menu because you
certain if you if you go under the save
menu you're going to overwrite one of
your saved canned responses with
whatever you have in the page so right
now would be a blank a blank page which
wouldn't be good so I'm just going to in
any of course you can delete them down
here so I'm just going to insert my new
canned response and you see my message
just comes up right here but that's kind
of boy let me show you one of my big one
so I go canned responses insert number
two boom see all this all perfectly
formatted ready to go so if you're
sending consistent emails over and over
again the canned response is quite nice
in fact so I'm just going to go back in
here now and I'm just going to delete
this one I'm not going to use are you
sure you want to delete this canned
response and we assure and let's go back
can't response and you see it's no
longer present I hope you found this
