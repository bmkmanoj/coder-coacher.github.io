bit of a different vlog here I'm gonna
do a screencast in our conversation so
YouTube has given me the choice to be
able to change the channel name right
now if you look at it it's actually
named killer PHP so killer PHP is in
reference to I just get this in place
killer PHP is in reference to this site
the killer PHP this is one of my coding
sites that goes back to I guess 2005
2006 if you like this and this is where
I put up a bunch of PHP videos right now
it's just a blog my most famous course I
think they put out here and it's free is
on object oriented PHP I had people
translated into different languages well
a couple one language and it's still up
there it's a classic Opie beginners
tutorial written and in video format the
classic videos are here they're a little
old but and I'm a little young in this
video but it will still help you to
understand the basics of object-oriented
programming anyway so the decision I'm
trying to make now is whether or not I
should change the YouTube channel name
to my name mr. Phan mr. Chuck or if I
should just keep it as killer PHP I'm
not sure how many people really pay
attention to that but I figured I put it
out there see how you guys felt let me
know in the comments what you think
below and that's about it I'm using my
webcam here because I'm just too lazy to
break out the other camera ok that's it
we'll talk later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
