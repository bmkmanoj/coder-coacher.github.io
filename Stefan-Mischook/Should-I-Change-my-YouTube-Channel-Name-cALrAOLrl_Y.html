bit of a different vlog here i'm going
to do a screencast in our conversation
so youtube has given me the choice to be
able to change the channel name right
now if you look at it it's actually
named killer PHP so killer PHP's in
reference to I just get this in place
killer PHP is in reference to this site
killer PHP this is one of my coatings
icicles back to I guess 2005-2006 of it
like this and this is where I put up a
bunch of PHP videos right now it's just
a blog my most famous course I think
they put out here it's free is on object
oriented PHP I had people translate it
into different languages well a couple
one language and it's still up there
it's a classic 00 p beginners tutorial
written and in video format the classic
videos are here they're little old but
I'm a little young in this video but it
will still help you to understand the
basics of object-oriented programming
anyway so the decision I'm trying to
make now is whether or not i should
change the youtube channel name to my
name stefan miss Chuck or if I should
just keep it as killer PHP I'm not sure
how many people really pay attention to
that but I figured I put it out there
see how you guys felt let me know in the
comments what you think below and that's
about it i'm using my webcam here
because i'm just too lazy to break out
the other camera ok that's it we'll talk
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
