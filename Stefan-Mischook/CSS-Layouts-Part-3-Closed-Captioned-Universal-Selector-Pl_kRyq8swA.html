what I'm going to ask us to do at this
point is to start out by creating a
proper site now when you're dealing with
any project and Dreamweaver the standard
protocol before you begin is to go to
your site window as you can see here and
you could define a new site now when you
are doing this and here we are in the
site information area we can just set up
a simple name so i'll say fixed and we
will now locate the local site folder so
um i'm just going to go onto my desktop
and we can create a new folder here
called fixed and i'll just create there
and i'll choose that one so there we
have our information now if we wanted to
at this particular point in time you
could also go in and define server
information to upload your work but
we're not doing that we're just defining
our site quite simply as we can see
right here local info if you wanted to
give even more information you could
also do that and these are just
dreamweaver extras and not really things
that I'm dealing with at the moment so
I'm just defining my local root folder
in the site window here so we can save
this now now as you can see we don't
really have any information here so what
I'm going to do is to just set up the
basic skeleton of our website so I'll
say new file and I will create an index
HTML file as you can see there
inevitably and eventually i'll be
creating a CSS file to style all of my
work so here in the local root folder
i'm actually going to anticipate this by
creating a folder right now called CSS
but when we insert our CSS a little bit
later we will actually define the name
of that folder and
so on so at this point in time what you
can do is just double click the index
information I had an untitled file open
at the time but I'm going to close that
so as you can see here it says
index.html at the moment we can come in
and change our title to something like
fixed pixel layout and you'll notice
that inside of Dreamweavers code view we
have a title now that says expects a
layout so if you're following along
outside of Dreamweaver all you really
got to do at this point is to define
your local root folder by creating an
index HTML page in it CSS folder next to
it and we'll be creating the CSS folders
as we go along and I'll be showing you
where the links will take place and how
it's going to be written but if you're
following in Dreamweaver define your
site as I did and now we're ready to
introduce information if you're in the
design view and you only see the design
I encourage you to go to the split
screen view so that we could take a look
at the code as we go about writing that
code so at this point what I can say is
we're going to start by defining our
fixed pixel layout now the first thing
we'll do is to create our CSS page
because our CSS page is going to be
defining how all of this information is
going to be distributed and how it's
going to end up looking the way it does
so come here and we'll click on the new
CSS rule button and as you can see it
says you know choose your contextual
selector so we're assuming that you know
a little bit about CSS and even if you
don't you can follow along and still be
able to manage with this exercise we're
not creating a class in this case I'm
not even creating an ID although we will
be using that a little bit later however
I do want to redefine a HTML element
normally we could come in here and we
could say look everything that's on the
body let's make the body look a certain
way but first and foremost what I'm
going to do
is to redefine a tag but the tag that I
want to redefine will be the asterisk
symbol so I put in an asterisk sign here
because what I'm going to attempt to do
is to create a definition that will be
applied to every single tag on this page
what that actually means is we will be
creating as you'll see in just a second
the opportunity to pare down all of our
tags so that they have zero margins and
zero padding now I'll explain why we're
doing that in just a second as we go
about doing that in the rest of our
video but before we get to that point
after you've chosen this asterisk
selector or in our case we will define
that as the universal selector it will
be applied to everything before we click
OK we want to choose where this rule
will be defined and if we were to say
this document only we would be writing
the CSS in the head section of this
document now that's something that we
normally don't do it's easier to
externalize your CSS and it's something
that will work a whole lot better if you
have more than one page in your website
and more than likely you do have more
than one page so to take full advantage
of CSS we're going to create a new style
sheet and the Stasi will be externalized
so when we click ok the first thing it
asks us is well you say you want an
external style sheet but where do you
want to save it so you can open up your
windows and actually show where this
thing will in fact be saved so notice
I'm going to go to the desktop where we
created that fixed pixel over here now
that I'm inside of fixed I'm going to
open up the CSS folder in here and we'll
create something called let's just call
it style dot CSS
so notice that the URL says well it's
located inside of CSS folder inside
style dot CSS that's excellent it's
relative to the document meaning this is
our root folder and right next to this
index page you'll find a folder called
CSS inside of which is style dot CSS so
let's click Save perfect so now we will
define the rule for the asterisks so
what I want you to do is to go to the
Box category and in the CSS box model
we're going to say same for all padding
zero same for all margin zero now what
that does is it ensures that all the
elements on our page anything whether
it's the body whether it's a paragraph
anything like that is all going to have
zero margin and padding at this point
the only reason I'm doing this is
because when we write CSS and we're
working with CSS layout some of the most
common problems arise because of
differences in browsers well internet
explorer has proprietary browser
technology that handles the spacing of
margins differently than other browsers
so this can sometimes create some
unwanted and undesired effects when it
comes to separating content or making
things move around and if you're off by
even a pixel in certain cases that will
break your design it'll make columns
appear on top of each other instead of
next to each other the way you intended
so one of the easiest ways to sort of
alleviate this issue is to set all of
your elements to zero margin and padding
and then we'll apply margin and padding
as we go along as we need it because we
still need to space things so as we
continue in this process I'll be talking
to you a little bit more about how this
will be changed by dealing with margin
and padding on an element by element
basis so we'll talk more about that as
the need arises so at this point we're
setting everything to zero margin and
padding and we're going to click OK and
you'll notice right away that when i
have my cursor blinking on this blank
page at the moment you can see that
there's no margin and padding if i were
to write in some text it's squished up
right against the edge as you can see
right there so that just goes to prove
that the little universal selector that
i have here so i'm on CSS current styles
all if you go to current styles you'll
see the asterisks is saying you know
HTML margin and padding 0 so here if I
go back to all you can see there's my
asterisks and there's my example of zero
margin and padding also take note of
this for those of you who are attempting
to do this outside of Dreamweaver notice
that what Dreamweaver did was to create
a link in the head section to the CSS
stylesheet so if you're following along
you can just type in this information
link href CSS style dot CSS style sheet
and the type is text / CSS so that's
something that you can ride along if
you're not following with dreamweaver
but nevertheless as you can see we've
got all of this information if we took a
look at our CSS page here we have this
information saying margin padding set to
zero asterisks is the universal selector
so let's go back to our source code and
see what our HTML page looks like
alright so now that we've described the
universal selector in the next video
we're going to talk about how to prepare
our body for a centering background or a
centering container div</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
