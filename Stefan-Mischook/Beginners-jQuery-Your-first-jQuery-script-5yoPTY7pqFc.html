covered some basic JavaScript let's dive
into jQuery and write our first jQuery
script in order to do that I need access
to the jQuery library so I visited
jQuery comm I'm going to click the
download section and you'll note that we
have two options here we have a CDN
hosted jQuery and a direct download to
jQuery and in this case I'm going to be
dealing with the direct download for the
most part and I'm going to be talking
about the CDN hosted version in a couple
of minutes now we have two different
versions we can choose from in the
direct download we have the production
version which is 32 KB and we have the
development version which is 247 KB and
basically the difference here is that a
production version has been compressed
which means as many of the tabs and as
much as the white space as possible has
been stripped out of those files
variable names have been shortened
basically they've done whatever they can
do to keep the file size down so if you
go to the development version and click
downloads you'll notice this is nice and
easily readable maybe you don't fully
understand it but at least you can go
through and have a rough idea of what's
going on if you take a look at the
production version however this is a lot
more complicated you'll notice there's
very little spaces in this file they've
shortened all the variable names down
this is the version of the file that
we're going to be using since it's much
a smaller file size but just keep that
in mind if you ever want to take a peek
into the actual jQuery library that's
where to do it so I'm going to click the
download button there and I'm going to
copy this entire file and I'm going to
switch over to my text editor and what
you see here is the template file that
we're going to be working with for most
of this course it's just a simple HTML
and CSS base template let me take a peek
of HTML as I said these files are
included with the source file so you
should be able to download those and
work directly from them but this is a
basic HTML file has an html5 doctype
and I'm going to be working with html5 a
little bit you don't really have to have
a strong understanding of that in order
to follow along in addition to this
there's also a CSS file that includes
all the basic styling that template
needs so now that we have that jQuery
file copied go ahead and create a new
file let me call it jQuery j/s and I'm
gonna paste it in place there we go
so I'm going to save this file and open
up my test dot HTML and down here within
this head section we need to link this
file into our HTML so I'm going to do
script SRC equals I'm gonna link in the
jQuery so jQuery j/s I'm gonna close out
the script tag and then one minor thing
to note in most cases you usually have a
type and usually that would be text CSS
or Tex JavaScript but since I'm dealing
with the html5 doctype and there's only
one type of script now I can actually
remove that and it'll be processed and
understood correctly one other thing
that I wanted to talk about let's go
back and talk about the CDN version of
jQuery here we go and CDN stands for
content delivery network basically what
this means is other websites have
offered to make this particular file
available and it allows you to link to
their files rather than having jQuery
embedded within your own website so for
example I can click on the jQuery CDN
minified version and I'll take this link
and then I would simply paste it into
this spot in my file for the sake of
this tutorial I'm gonna be working with
the actual jQuery file that's jQuery j/s
but keep that in mind the CDN version
might be an option for you there are a
couple of reasons why you might want to
use the CDN version the two things are
this is one less file for your visitors
to download from you
site saves you a little bit on bandwidth
and also it's possible whatever user is
visiting your site has visited another
site has already downloaded this file so
it's already cached on their computer
and they'll be a little bit of a faster
experience for them so keep that in mind
personally and most of my development
work I tend to use the CDN version I
tend to use the jquery's version here so
keep that in mind if you want to
experiment with this you're probably not
going to notice a huge amount of speed
difference between the two but I tend to
like to use to see the end version
myself so back to our text editor here
we now have included this jquery.js file
and please note that this file needs to
be included in your HTML wherever you
use jQuery without this library jQuery
code will not work so make sure you
include that now that we have a jQuery
library in place let's create a very
simple jQuery script so to do that I'm
gonna start with script tags like so and
in order for this script to run we need
to wait and make sure the entire page
has been loaded and is ready for us to
use so to explain that let me hop over
to my preview for a minute and like I
said this is the template page we're
working with and I'm going to open up
the inspector which is this is something
that's actually built into the Safari
browser but most other browsers have it
and I'm gonna be talking about that in a
future video however what I wanted to
show you is this Dom tree the dumb
document object model is how a browser
interprets an HTML web page basically as
a page downloads it gets parsed and
sorted into this tree like structure so
we have the main HTML tag that's where
the parent element and then inside that
we have head and body elements those
who've children of the hitch HTML and
then within the head we have items like
meta title and link and those are all
children of the head tag so we have a
structure basically a tree like
structure which contains both parents
and children
those parents in order for us to create
this jQuery script let's go back to the
HTML file we need to make sure that the
document is ready for us to work with
that everything's been downloaded and
then we're ready to go and do that we do
something like this you do a dollar sign
and this dollar sign is sort of the
shortcut to jQuery the jQuery library is
loaded into this dollar sign
automatically by jQuery and this is what
we use to refer to the jQuery object
then we need a selector so parentheses
and I'm going to put in a document and
then I'm going to put in dot ready like
so and what this is is this is a jQuery
event so basically this is a jQuery
object we're saying to that object we
want to attach an event to the document
in the main page and we want to say we
want waiting for when this document is
ready for us to work with when it's
ready for us to work with then we want
to add in some code and unfortunately we
can't do something like this so for this
example I want to pop up an alert every
time the user clicks his mouse on the
page we can't do something like this
alert sorry about that because what will
happen as you just saw is that
immediately when this page is first
loaded this alert is going to happen as
the page loads into the browser it's
going to be this code is going to run
automatically however we want to make
sure it waits until this document is
ready and to do that we use an anonymous
function so I want to add function to
parenthesis and an opening closing
brackets here so there we go
so what we're doing is we're waiting for
this document to be ready and then we're
calling our alert and this is an
anonymous function because it doesn't
have an actual name so there's no easy
way to call it but it's going to be
called automatically when this document
is ready for us
now if we take a look at our preview and
refresh the page we'll get an alert when
the page first loads so that's working
as it should but I want to modify this
so that when the page is actually
clicked on and the salute appears so
we're going to do something a little bit
similar
so like this line we're going to do the
dollar sign that refers to the jQuery
object we're going to do our parentheses
we want to select the HTML element on
the page so I'm going to do quotes HTML
and the way jQuery works is sort of like
CSS I'm going to be talking about
selectors in a later video but in this
area within the quotes here that's where
we can add for example classes IDs we
can select things sort of based on
standard CSS code so we're going to
select the HTML and we're going to do
dot click so we're waiting for a click
event and once the click event happens
we want to do anonymous function so
function like so and then once this is
an ominous function runs and we'll call
alert like so let's take a preview with
this refresh the page so anytime I click
on this page it'll pop up a JavaScript
alert for us so this is a pretty simple
example but it explains how jQuery works
sort of the basic syntax most of the
time you're going to be dealing with a
document dot ready so you want to make
sure that the document is ready for you
before you start issuing jQuery commands
then often you'll have some sort of
event that you want to wait for so in
this case we're looking for a click
event on the main HTML in our page and
at that point we're going to run this
code it calls an alert so hopefully
that's enough of a basic introduction
join me in the next video I'll be
talking a little bit about debugging and
how we go about selecting elements using
jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
