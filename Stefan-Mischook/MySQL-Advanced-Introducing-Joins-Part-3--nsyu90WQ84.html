our posts and do some very simple joints
so the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm insert into post this time we are
going to specify that we want the title
and a category ID and the values are
going to be I don't know let's say
there's a political posting and it will
have a category ID of one right because
we know that politics is one up here and
I'm just going to create a couple more
of these and then I'm going to create
another one and this is going to be more
politics so it's also going to have a
category of one and you're going to see
what I mean when I say one too many and
then there's going to be some kind of
international news which will of course
be category two and then we're going to
have something related to technology new
iphone apps could you need any more
iphone apps I don't think so but anyways
uh then we also want to have something
about entertainment I don't know Academy
award-winning movies let's try that for
and let's just put something in about
sports olympics 2010 and that should be
good we won't put anything in the other
category so at the top I did a drop
table now if I do drop table category
it'll say fine but then if i run it
again then it's going to say error you
know 1051 a gnome table category so in
order to get around this in order to be
able to easily paste in our SQL script
as we're building it i'm going to add if
exists to this wonderful call so it'll
say drop table if exists category and
drop table if exists
so now when I select all this and paste
it into the mysql command line and i do
a la select star on post i'm going to
have the various posts notice that the
content right now is null and it's going
to stay null until we start looking at
the mysql search engine at the end of
this series but you could basically put
anything you want in there so we have
the title we have the content we have
the category ID and then we have select
star from category and we have our six
categories now let's start looking at
how we can join the two pieces of data
together and this is where the one too
many thing becomes a little more
interesting so let's say I wanted to get
all of the politics postings right then
I could do something like I could do a
select star from let's see how we could
do this actually let's just start with
just a simple joint so if i wanted to
just join the posts to the categories
then it would be as simple as saying
select star from post p left join
category c on p category ID equals cid
now let me just explain this for a
second so the light select star from
post p i think we can I think you've
seen this before basically what we're
doing is we're just saying select every
column from the table post now this
little p here means that I want to
actually start referring to the post
table as just p it's an alias it's a
shortcut so that select star from post p
the left join is what we're going to be
doing where we're basically just taking
one table and then gluing it to another
table and we're going to be left joining
with the category table and it's going
to have a shortcut of c and we're going
to glue the two together using p
category ID
is the post categoryid when the post
category ID is equal to the category ID
so it's very important that the to line
up so if i hit enter then i'm going to
get essentially the join that i was
talking about where we have the
political postings and their category
name and we have international news and
it's got the international category and
we've got the new iphone apps and
they're in the technology section and
the academy award-winning movies and so
on and so forth so that's a just a quick
introduction into left joins we're going
to be looking at how they compare to
outer joins and or what what's called a
right join a left join has also called
an inner join in the next video and then
we're going to start looking at
constraints I'm John leben sold and
