playground video blog so in the
continued exploration of the Swift
language I'm going to look at some more
basics here so what we're going to talk
about in this video is something called
data types and data type conversion we
took all that casting in Java okay this
is all gibberish to you're going to
learn about in a second so before I get
into it in computer programming there's
this concept of the data type piece of
data could be a number it could be an
integer like 67 or it could be a float
like you know like you use in dollar
calculation so we have a decimal point
it could be a string like a string of
texts like Stefan is learning as we see
here on the screen so in some
programming languages like PHP and
JavaScript they basically take care of
all this data type stuff for you it's
all handled in the background so you can
do all kinds of stuff with all your data
in PHP and not have to explicitly not
have to handle data conversions you see
you can't mix and match data in certain
programming languages Java's one of them
and it seems that Swift is another
although Swift finds a nice compromise
and I'm going to get into that in a
second so why doesn't Swift do automatic
data type handling for you it has to do
with speed the less decisions that a
computer programming language has to
make the faster you can compute so
they've again they found a nice middle
ground here with Swift so let's just get
into a few examples and this will all
become clear so here I will start with
this constant I declared if you maybe I
didn't mention it the keyword le t let
is the key word in Swift to create a
constant you got constancy not variables
VAR is for variable
the difference being a constant and
variables and the variable you can
change the data through in your program
you can change the value so for instance
in this variable I have no Ruby and I've
given it a value which is a string we'd
also shrink us in these quotes here
right here excuse me so this could
change with programming I may change the
what the string is along the way whereas
when you have a constant like let it's
fixed in terms of your program and again
there are efficiency reasons for it and
data integrity reasons for using a
constant rather than a variable but we
won't get into that right now so let's
jump down to our constants here because
that's where I'm doing all this data
manipulation data type manipulation
excuse me so first of all so I a
declared a constant it's called an int
and I just gave it the value of 67 and
of course the playground gives us our
interactive response here and says okay
67 that's cool so this is where the
compromise in Swift comes into play see
at this point I didn't explicitly tell
Swift that this was an integer but
because it was really obvious to it it
knows that it's an integer and it didn't
give us an error so let's look at
another type of number and that's a
double now in this situation I declared
that explicitly that this value here was
a double and let me just get rid of this
error here because it's screwing up my
display okay so there we go so you see
here let explicit double so the name of
this constant is explicit double I use
this little colon here and that's code
that tells Swift that we're going to
make this particular value here a double
and you see it's a double cause you got
a period zero now and you tell it it's a
double by using the double keyword now
if I would use the end keyword watch
what happens interactive see it becomes
70 without 20
so I go back I go double back
and you see we got 70 so you see how
Swift is compromising here sometimes you
can make it a double explicitly
sometimes you don't have to declare it
but if I don't declare it if I just go
like this it's just going to assume that
it's an int there's no way for swift
anova this is a double so that's where
declaring things explicitly in terms of
your data types comes into play let's
move down here so here we go i
explicitly set this to a string I didn't
have to write but I did so I could have
could have just as easily done this and
still going to be seen as a string so
now let's look at a couple of errors so
well not a couple errors let's look at
how we can combine one data type with
another data type so in this situation I
got my variable explicit double and
exclusive double is a long in this case
it's not a double because we didn't we
declare it a hint here so let me just
make it a double see if this if it
figures it out yeah there we go so now
it sees it it's probably going to see
this as a double to seize the period so
let's say we got our variable double
explicit double and in this particular
situation here we're adding it to our
strengths exclusive exclusive string now
what I've done to make it work if I use
this method here string and this
basically converts this double into a
string right so it works very good now
let's look at this interactive
capability I'm just going to add some
spaces and watch how spaces are
reflected in our new constant called
together yeah so let's go back a couple
of spaces so let's take off this casting
this conversion and you see we got an
error now we click on
air could not find the overload for the
positive simple addition that accepts
the supplied argument so basically I
won't get into overload now see that's
an error because it doesn't it's not
able to combine them of course it
displays it properly you know Stefan
well not properly just displays one
after another because if you look here
see it doesn't display a space so it's
it's very friendly enough to the
playground to just display the value of
explicit string right afterwards we see
there's no space here now if I go back
and I convert explicit double to a
string so that we don't get our error so
it actually does the adding together of
the of our are constants also you see it
works see the space is now reflected but
we have here in this new constant
together so there you go you've learned
a little bit about data types data type
conversions and how Swift compromises in
that regard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
