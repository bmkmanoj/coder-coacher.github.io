sites course my name is Ben Faulk I'm a
web designer and developer from sunny
California who's been working in the web
field for about six years I'll be your
guide is I demonstrate how to build a
basic PHP and database based ecommerce
system that integrates with paypal to
handle payment processing this system
will include basic categorization of
products the ability to destroy details
about products like title description
price and a photo a cart system it'll
track which items are actually in a
visitor's cart and integration with
paypal so that visitors can purchase
items from the store I split this course
up into two main sections the first
section will handle everything you just
saw on this demonstration the front end
of the website whereas the second
section will focus on building an
administrative backend for the system so
an admin user can log into a password
protected area on the website and add
edit and delete products and categories
without manually needing to modify the
database along the way I'll be talking
about a variety of PHP related topics
and concepts including using object
oriented programming also called 00 p
the MVC a Model View controller design
pattern using coding style guides and
documenting your application if you're a
beginning or intermediate developer
who's interested to see what at MVC and
opie web application looks like this
would be a great cause for you let's
talk about what skills are required this
course is aimed at the beginner and
intermediate web designer and developer
I'm it's aimed primarily at someone
who's interested in learning more about
opee and MVC and while i'll do my best
to explain these concepts i do expect
you to have at least a basic
understanding what those are i also
expect that you will have beginners
understanding PHP HTML and CSS and how
to set up your computer to be able to
run PHP if you're missing any of those
skills I'd suggest you brush up a bit on
your knowledge and come back to this
course once you're ready to move ahead
let's talk about tools used in these
videos I'm going to be using a variety
of tools I'm going to be using mamp
which stands for mac patchy mysql and
PHP basically it's a Mac application
that allows me to run a web server on my
computer and also allows me to access a
database and use PHP scripts if you're
on a Windows machine I suggest you look
into using wamp or xampp which do the
same thing secondly at least for the
last video in the section you'll be
needing to have some sort of web hosting
available in the last video on replacing
a file live online and if you don't have
web posting you unfortunately won't be
able to follow that section of the video
not a huge deal it is an absolutely
required and you won't be missing out on
much if you don't have that but you
won't be able to follow along with my
description of paypal ipn without that
third for database work i'll be using
PHP myadmin to create and manage a
database this is included by default
with wamp and ma'am so you'll probably
have it and most web hoes offer it
within the site's hosting control panel
if you're working on a live server
rather than on your local computer
finally I'll be using a Mac text editor
called expresso to do my coding and to
test and demonstrate the application
this is simply the editor of my choice
but any text editor will work including
something super simple like notepad on
windows with text edit on Mac however I
would suggest that you at least find a
text editor that has basic syntax
highlighting to help you catch
misspellings and bugs in your code if
you're looking for something free I'd
suggest windows users look at notepad
plus plus and Mac users look at text
wrangler so let's get started thanks for
watching this course and I hope you find
it useful if you have any questions
about this course please feel free to
contact me either at my email which is
been at kellys XCOM or post a question
on the killer sites forums at killer
sites calm / community thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
