last little bits on my Python course and
I'm getting a little bit into the theory
of object-oriented programming I don't
want to go too deep because powerful
Python 3 the course is a beginners
course so I don't want to get too deep
down into that rabbit hole of
object-oriented theory trust me that
would not be good for beginners course
anyhow so I'll just going over things I
always do my research to make sure
everything is cool you see when you've
been doing something for as long as I
have I've been programming since the 90s
you take things for granted and
sometimes it's good to look around and
see how other people are characterizing
things to see how people might be
finding certain aspects of programming a
little confusing and so on because again
you lose you lose touch with that if
you've been doing it for so long so
that's what I do anyways so I was just
bouncing around checking stuff out so I
was on Wikipedia and for whatever
reasons I come across this this article
where they're looking at the
object-oriented programming and
specifically the criticisms of
object-oriented programming now don't
get me wrong I think object-oriented
programming is something you have to
learn it's something that's very useful
but I think that there are a lot of
mechanisms if you will in
object-oriented programming that should
only be used very sparingly if not at
all like I said I'm not a huge fan of
inheritance I'm not saying that you
shouldn't use inheritance I'm saying
that it should be used very very
sparingly only on base objects I've
talked about this in another video that
being said so I like this line here on
Wikipedia for this guy Steve Yaga have
no idea who this guy is but this just
made me laugh and if any of you have
done any extensive object-oriented
programming you will probably laugh at
this too knowing exactly what this guy
is talking about but it sounds funny so
let me read it
oops those the wrong quote here it is
right here
this is funny the problem with
object-oriented languages is that
they've got all this implicit
environment that they can carry around
with them you wanted a banana but what
you get was a gorilla holding the banana
and the entire jungle the nerd in me
finds us extremely funny and hilarious
again if you've done object-oriented
programming you know exactly what the
author's against this is Joe Armstrong
is trying to say here and I'll put it in
layman's terms just in case you guys are
not experts at object-oriented
programming the tendency in
object-oriented languages c-sharp Java
and many others is that they create
overly complex code bases and they try
to implement all kinds of different
aspects they being coders have a
tendency to want to implement or use all
kinds of capabilities are built into an
object-oriented language even if it's
not really necessary it reminds me of
something happened to be made years ago
eons ago when the dinosaurs roamed the
earth and I was called in by a client a
new client they wanted to update a web
app that they had and it was written in
PHP now this is old-school PHP dirty PHP
PHP that was just functional and had
very little to no object or to
capability in fact this was pre PHP for
peach before was the first step if you
will when PHP started becoming he wasn't
fully all at that point in peach before
the peach before had implemented a whole
bunch they added in a whole bunch of
object object-oriented capabilities
although wasn't fully old PHP didn't
become fully old until version 5 anyhow
so this was like a version 3 PHP app so
it's all just a bunch of functions and
so I come into the gig and they wanted
me to add to this app it wasn't a very
big apples a very complex but so
nonetheless being a Java guy I was like
no no no we should do this in Java but
we rewrite
job will be much better but the client
insisted that now now we already have
this in PHP there's no way we're going
to be start we're going to start
rewriting things in Java why spend the
money twice so whatever it was a good
gig I was making good money I said okay
I'll do in PHP at this point this is the
90s I had not written PHP yet so I said
whatever I'll just learn PHP so I
started learning PHP now as a Java
programmer fully immersed in
object-oriented programming paradigms
and so forth I was appalled I was
appalled at the simplicity and the lack
of bonus in PHP at the time and but I
pinched my nose and I went forward with
the project because I was getting paid
and that's what the client wanted so
whatever and I said to myself you know
what yeah learn PHP so I learned PHP and
I want to take I got useful and within a
few hours and though it was a primitive
language at that time don't get me wrong
PHP today is totally different PHP today
PHP 7 is very very very robust language
it's in my opinions right up there with
all the other object-oriented languages
so I was pretty syntactically as a
Python or Ruby but it's it's still a
very capable language in for web apps I
say go PHP that's my overall opinion
anyhow but at the time PHP 3 3 X sundar
oh it was it was just it was really
primitive was just a functional language
function space but here's the big story
after having made the mods and the
additions to the app that the client
wanted based on using PHP 3 it turned
out to be very very very illuminating if
you will for me it really taught me
something and what it taught me is that
don't get caught
thinking in one way functional
programming can be extremely effective
in that it's very very fast in the
writing because there's so much less
code
ok there's so much less code to write
that is the problem most part partly
profit Java
but object-oriented code by its very
nature is heavier you have a lot more
code to write to get the things done now
don't get me wrong you should still be
in my opinion using old quite a bit in
today but sometimes quick and dirty
functional programming like old-school
PHP just gets the job done quick and I
remember someone but my brother this was
a big Java programmer and he was
appalled as well and I said to him I
said buddy I said you know yeah it
doesn't have proper air trapping does
that a try-catch blocks PHP did it at
the time it does now but it didn't at
the time it was quite primitive in that
regard but you know what to get
something done it only takes five
hundred lines of code instead of ten
thousand lines of code so yeah I don't
have a sophisticated a code base as the
jabber version would be or c-sharp what
version would be but you know what
I have 10% less than 10% to code right I
like 5% 10% and something like to get
the same job done I remember the first
thing was illuminating at the time
together sent an email from Java Java
web using servlets you're looking at a
page of code to send an email and a
servlet is a specialized class as a
class a special class in Java
specifically designed to build web apps
anyhow so to write Java codes we have a
send an email at that time required
about a page covers PHP was one line so
I said to myself it's pretty easy to
debug one line of code versus 500 lines
right so anyway that's interesting so I
decide to do this log just because you
wanted a banana but what you got was a
gorilla holding the banana and the
entire jungle yep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
