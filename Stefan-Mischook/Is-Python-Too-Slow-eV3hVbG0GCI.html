answer a couple questions well at least
one question put to me on YouTube so so
many rights here I'll just highlight it
python is slower language if we compare
with others but in fact python is used
to build Instagram which is true which
the CEO of Instagram said guessing this
guy wrote this in hurry or English is
not his first language it's all good
anyways you said he gave prior to speed
and user experience what do you think
it's the fan well yes
Python code can be written so it gives
priority to speed and user experience no
question but which is also no question
is that Python does run slower and
things like Java PHP and Swift so does
that matter no not especially important
especially at first because the key
thing when you're building a new app is
to get it out into the public as quickly
as possible and since Python is a
dynamically typed language it's a
language basically that makes it easy to
get your apps out quickly kind of like
PHP kind of like Swift job on the other
hand is much more verbose meaning it
takes a lot more Java code to get
something done so if I today we're
writing a new app to get out into the
public I would choose the fastest to
write programming language in preference
than a speedy programming language at
runtime so what does that mean I would
go for a language that's easier to build
things with and I would deal with the
fact that it runs slower for now because
here's what you can do if your app
actually becomes a success
you could start optimizing your code for
speed you can in fact have a big part of
your app written Python as an example
and maybe write another part of it in
another language if that's much faster
for some of those areas where you need a
lot more speed if you couldn't address
the speed issues with faster servers or
more processors this is a very common
design pattern a design pattern is
basically just a way of designing your
apps in fact
many many many apps are written with
multiple languages whether it be web
apps of course web apps you've written
HTML and CSS HTML CSS or no programming
languages or markup languages but not
allowed to get HTML CSS and you have
JavaScript what you're going to use
JavaScript for any code that's gonna be
running inside a web browser and then on
the server end you could have PHP Python
you could have Java could have c-sharp
you kind of Ruby etc etc and even now
Swift so using more than one programming
language in an app web app is very
common and even in other types of apps
using multiple programming languages is
not anything special so don't worry
about that so yeah if you like Python
you want to get an app out quickly to
see whether or not it's gonna make any
money it's gonna actually gonna have any
success then write it in Python or
whatever other faster write language
that you choose and then you just take
it from there so yeah it's all cool it's
all cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
