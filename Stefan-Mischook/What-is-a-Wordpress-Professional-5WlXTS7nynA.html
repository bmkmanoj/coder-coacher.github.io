with in my car I got the Joby here on my
cell phone
Google pixel if you're interested try
something new so in this video we're
going to talk about WordPress
professionals what does that mean to be
a word press professional this is a kind
of like a subset or a specialization in
web design and web development something
I called you know I think in 2006 I
wrote a blog about it yeah I wrote a
blog about it seems B and I called these
professionals these WordPress these
WordPress professionals I call them
WordPress or web designers and I see
them as a special specialization within
web design development and it presents a
huge amount of opportunities why because
30% of the world's websites
approximately are wordpress based and I
would guess that a lot more endure as a
percentage of small business websites or
WordPress if you have a small business
there's a high probability that their
website is based on WordPress and what
that means is you have a huge market and
what that means is you have a huge
market in terms of potential clients
that are out there people who have
WordPress sites or they want WordPress
sites and they need to have them set up
or need some configurations done etc etc
etc etc the other reason there's such a
huge opportunity is because a lot of
developers and designers simply don't
want to work with WordPress they just
don't like it it's not very popular it's
kind of like plumbing WordPress is the
plumbing of the web design and
development industry plumbing you know
fixing the pipes and stuff plumbing is
people oak sort of like that I don't
want to plumbing so plumbers make a
fortune
plumbers make a fortune and they have
unlimited work because it's just there's
just so much so much work out there and
people
don't want to do it WordPress is in a
similar situation where there's tons of
work in WordPress and because there's
tons of work and because a lot of web
designers and what developers don't want
to do WordPress therein lies a huge
opportunity but for those professionals
who want to deal with that market
exclusively the other reason why it's
such a lucrative potentially lucrative
market to get into is because WordPress
is a it's it's a blog it's an app it's a
content management system a CMS and it's
also an ecosystem there are WordPress
theme providers there are WordPress
plugins there there's all kinds of
there's a whole world Oh in ecosystems
based around WordPress so one of the
roles as a wordpress professional is to
understand that ecosystem really well
and so that when a client comes to you
and needs to get a certain thing done
for their small business site or of
their business site which is based on
WordPress you will know how to approach
it best you will know what plugins are
out there which are safe which are not
safe what are the options what theme
providers are best to go to where to
pick up a theme that kind of thing this
is all part of being a wordpress
professional now in addition to
understanding the ecosystem of course
you have to understand the basics how to
install WordPress how to configure it
how to make sure it's locked down and
secure so you understand the user roles
this kind of thing and your job as a
wordpress professional well be to
educate your clients in terms of all
these things so in addition to that in
terms of skill sets you need to know of
course you've got to be comfortable with
your html5 your css3 you need these two
things so that you can edit and work
with themes and you need to know a touch
just a touch of JavaScript maybe a touch
of jQuery and a little bit of PHP all
these skills can be you can get these
skills in the studio web courses on HTML
CSS JavaScript PHP yes shameless plug
but you don't need to be a master
JavaScript
Kohner not even close to that to be a
wordpress professional you don't need to
be a master PHP developer to be a
wordpress professional you have to be a
script er that's that the terminology
but I would use you have to be a PHP
script er so PHP scripting or somebody
with knows their way around PHP is
comfortable with it can go in there you
know edit 20 lines of PHP maybe build a
simple plug-in not a full-blown app
developer so you have to have skills and
software development and coding but you
don't you're not a full-blown developer
so it's kind of like a middle ground
between a strictly web designer coder
and developer and you add in that your
WordPress skills or WordPress knowledge
that makes up the profession of the
WordPress developer or WordPress
professional and there's a huge amount
of money to be made the final point
about this is that because we're
processor is an ecosystem because
WordPress is a system you can develop
highly efficient workflows as a result
highly efficient workflows that will
allow you to get the jobs done them so
much more quickly than you would
otherwise so this means your per hour
rate could skyrocket once you really
solidify these workflows and that's
really one of the major keys to all this
you know so just just to recap number
one there's a huge demand because so
many small businesses work on WordPress
number two a lot of developers and
designers they don't want to work with
WordPress they don't like it or afraid
of it whatever it is and number three
because WordPress is a finite ecosystem
you will be able to put together in time
a nice efficient work flow that will
really maximize your time which means
will increase your profitability big
time
so yes WordPress professionals eyes I
did in a recent video I said should you
learn WordPress in 2017 my answers yes I
want to expand upon that what this meant
and anyway I hope you find this video
