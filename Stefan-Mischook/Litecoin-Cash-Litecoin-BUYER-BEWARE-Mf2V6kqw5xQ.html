coin cash and litecoin and how they're
absolutely not related at all the
founder of light coin just came out said
wobble we're not forking light coin so
be very careful this could be a scam
because net member bitcoin that you give
a Bitcoin you get 10 Bitcoin X or
whatever it was I forget the details and
you know what happened with bikal neg
like coin cash they were able to use the
name like coin because apparently it's
not trademarked I guess so like one cash
according to the founder of light coin
has nothing to do with like coin and
yeah if you buy like one cash it might
shoot up because a lot of people start
buying into it you don't know but it's
just some cryptocurrency you could come
up with your own cryptocurrency say hey
I'll call whatever I want you should
come up you know apples trademarks and
it wouldn't happen magic Apple Apple
coin right so what's the larger lesson
here we see that with the news of this
big like coin cash came out you had a
little story about it and how it's gonna
allow for faster processing etc etc so
what happens all the cryptocurrency
market goes a little crazy
everything shoots up 30% this is crazy
this is craziness where it's clear that
like coin caches I mean do a light coin
there's a founder of like when says it
has nothing to do a like line so we see
all these investors going nutso like
coin cash is gonna be better it's gonna
be a fork ten for one alright what's
called boom and they go in and it shows
a general ignorance of markets and and
and what this whole space is about but
if by the people who are involved in
this market not everybody would imagine
but seems like a lot of people and I
know a lot of people are ignorant
because I've talked to them I've seen
waiters and shirt sales bins and
and bus drivers who are involved in
buying cryptocurrencies investing these
are people have no knowledge of
financial markets have no knowledge
investing and no knowledge of technology
and they're in the game and one of the
oldest lessons investing as soon as you
have the general public involved in a
particular investment that usually means
that it's the top of the market it's a
good indicator at the top is near you
want to get into things that are not in
the in the news you want to get into
technologies or companies or businesses
or sectors that people are not talking
about if it's all over than you the
splash everywhere again that is a
classic top ask any experienced trader
will tie event it's one of the first
rules you look up trading for dummies
they say as soon as you see something
they're talking about it all the time in
the news chances are it's near its top
it's about to go down so you have to
look at the crypto space you see how
some silliness somebody says like coin
cash trading you're like on for 10 times
like coin cash like : cash is some
random cryptocurrency somebody just came
up with you can write a little bit oh so
it's this a bit of software and people
are going nuts it drives the price of
like coin up and it carries the market
this is a crazy market based on pure
motion nothing but that and of course
like any crazy crazy emotional market
they're gonna come up all the reasons
why it's actually going up the real
reason people are buying into these
things is because of FOMO fear of
missing out FOMO is a principle and only
driver of this market that's why
billionaires like Warren Buffett said
that this is gonna go to zero it's
craziness he's the most successful
investor all time oh maybe you know more
than Warren Buffett I don't know maybe
you know more than the third fourth
richest man and considered by everybody
to be the best investor of all time
maybe you know more than him I don't
know
but again sign of craziness Bitcoin cash
according to the founder not Bitcoin
cash like coin cash according to the
founder of light coin has nothing to do
with light coin nothing to do so you
decide what you're gonna do with this
information I talk about this again
because I'm here teaching not just cold
on teaching how to take you
coding skills how to monetize it whether
you get a job or if you become a
freelancer whether you start your own
SAS and a part of this is understanding
how money how finance works a part of
this is understanding how investments
work how business works and it's just
going to make you much give you much
better chances of being successful
whatever you approach at whatever you do
when you have a broader understanding of
all these things anyway that's it for
now ciao ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
