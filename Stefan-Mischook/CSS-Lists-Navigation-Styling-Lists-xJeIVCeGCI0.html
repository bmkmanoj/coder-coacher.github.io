with the formalities and taking care of
our files window as you can see here I
can actually even collapse that so you
can see this a little bit better well
what I've got here to begin with is a
simple list and what we're going to be
looking at right now in this tutorial is
how to style lists using CSS so let me
strip away anything that's extraneous at
the moment and I'll just keep things
nice and neat and as you can see here
I've got a very simple HTML unordered
list UL closed ul ul means of course
unordered list within that on our list
we have a number of list items and as
you can see open and close list items
inside of that list item we have an open
a tag and a closing a tag which produces
the links that we see here in our split
screen design and code views so in my
design view I can actually see these as
links they're not really going anywhere
you can see that the H ref is just
equaling the pound symbol or hash marks
or whatever you want to call that and
that's just a null link at the moment
doesn't go anywhere but it does
everything a link does like for example
if we switch on over to live view you
can see what your links look like and
you see up there it is it's given me the
finger very rude but it works it's a
link and you can see that list items
normally by default will have simple
bullet associated with it in this case
the default is just a simple circle well
I'm going to go back to my regular view
as you can see here and now I can select
these things and do whatever I want
alright so now we've done that the
simple thing is is it's time to style
this using CSS now this is something
that's really extremely simple to do
when you're working with CSS it's not
difficult at all first thing we're going
to do is you'll notice that everything
inside here is within a ul or unordered
list so why don't we define this new CSS
rule and we will go directly
to a HTML tag and that tag will be the
UL all right before we do anything else
let's just take note of this it's asking
me where do you want this rule to be
defined at the moment the default says
this document only however the vast
majority of times i would say 99 percent
of the time what i'm going to be doing
is creating a new style sheet if one
already doesn't exist if you have one
that does exist i would choose the
external stylesheet always before doing
it in this document only however here is
my exception i'm just showing you how to
work with just links as i mentioned
before and I don't want to get you
confused with any other HTML code so I'm
going to do it in this document only but
as I promised before the end of the
tutorial we'll take these links and
these ideas that we've implemented them
and we'll try to implement them rather
into the CSS layouts that we've defined
already so that liquid layout that fixed
layout will take a look at them we'll
see how they can work so as I mentioned
here is the unordered list and yes
reluctantly I'm saying this document
only so i click ok and we're going to
ask this document to do a number of
things well since I am not actually
inside of a CSS document that's
controlling the entire layout normally
as you saw if you did follow along with
the CSS layout tutorial you notice that
I like to tell all my students to use a
universal selector to put everything to
margin of 0 and padding of 0 however we
don't have the luxury of the universal
selector here so I'm just going to add
under the category of box margin of 0
same for all and a padding of 0 same for
all now before we do anything else like
I could apply this and as you can see
when you do apply it depending on where
you are you should see you know things
are really attempting to squeeze up
right against the edge of your browser
and my body actually does have a
a bit of padding on it that's why this
is not squished up right against it
however we still see a little bit of
those dots so what I'm going to ask you
to do is to go to the list category and
under list style type here we could have
said give me a disk give me a circle
give me a square lowercase Roman
numerals or uppercase whatever the case
may be however in this particular
instance i'm going to say none and if
you press apply you'll see that those
lists disappear those bullets
disappeared and all we have left now is
our links and that's our first step in
getting this to work you'll also notice
here that I've got the style tags inside
of my head tags of my HTML section and
that's because it's an example of an
internal CSS or remember please remember
this is not something i recommend you to
do on a regular basis I want you to
externalize your CSS I'm only doing it
this way just so you could see what's
happening not only in the CSS styles but
also in the HTML and this way we're not
going to be confused and at the end of
the video tutorial I'll be externalizing
all of this and we'll be placing these
inside of an actual layout all right
well that's really interesting I mean
there's nothing wrong with that however
what I may want to do in certain
instances is to add a background element
to this bulleted list well let's see
what I can do with that how would I go
about doing that well in this case I
want to be affecting the LI or list
items so let's come in here and let's
add a new HTML tag that will be
redefining and it's going to be the LI
yes this document only reluctantly and
once we're here what i want you to do is
first and foremost let's add a
background image so in the background
image i'm going to browse and you'll
notice that if you are working with the
files that were provided for you you'll
see that there's an images folder next
to your just links folder i'm going to
open that up and you'll see there's
something here called check
a little check mark or something so
let's say you didn't want to circle a
square or anything else like a lowercase
Roman numeral instead you wanted you
know your own graphic like this check
for example so I'll choose that graphic
now once that graphics chosen there's a
couple of things that are going to
happen let's take a look if I apply this
you can see whoa what in the world has
gone on well first of all a list item is
going to be all the way across why is
that because it's a block level element
as a block level element unless you
define its actual with it'll span the
entire area that it's that's containing
it so in other words in this case the
body contains it it's just going off
across well clearly that's not working
for us so here's what I'm going to ask
you to do we'll say background repeat no
repeat don't repeat this thing just give
me one of them all right great we're
making progress but it's still not where
we need it to be so let's take a look at
what else we can do well in the list
item we can also go to our box model and
since we are dealing with what's inside
of the list item I want to push things
off the edge by using padding so i could
say padding left and i know it's about
21 pixels across this check mark so if i
were to come in here i could say well
give me about like 30 pixels and if i
press apply perfect as you can see now
we've got some extra space in here no
problems now if you wanted to have more
space of course you could have you know
come in here added padding at the bottom
and you can see that they're much wider
apart it's really up to you if I just
leave that at the default it should be
just fine and as you can see it's got
all my elements in place my check mark
is here if you wanted to you could
reposition some of these elements then
simply by going to your list item and as
you can see in the background you know
you could define exactly where you want
the positioning to be I could say start
top left and that's pretty much what we
here you know but if I wanted to I could
have said on the bottom or on the right
or centered or whatever the case may be
but no real need to do that if you just
need it on the left hand side which is
the default so what's happening here is
we pushed it over by using padding and
we can now see these particular list
items with their own graphic if we were
to preview this in the browser let's
just do this in Firefox and as I wait
for that to approach you can see there's
my finger and it's telling me that I've
got a bunch of links here and they all
have their own little list item like I
said if you need a little bit more space
between them easy enough to do just by
adding some padding on the bottom so
that's a little bit about working with a
list item and how to add your own image
for the bullets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
