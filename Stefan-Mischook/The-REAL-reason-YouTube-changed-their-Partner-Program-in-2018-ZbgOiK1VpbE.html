YouTube Partner Program and the big
controversy I mean how people understand
why YouTube did what they did so just in
case you don't know YouTube has
basically raised the bar it's made it
harder for content creators like me to
monetize videos so now you need to have
a thousand subscribers and I believe
four thousand video hours viewed in the
last year before they can even allow you
to display ads so the reason they did
this is because they wanted to filter
out the videos that advertisers did not
want to put their ads beside you see
companies buy ads don't want to have
their as beside jihadist propaganda
videos or anything else that might
reflect badly on them
they really care about their image
that's why they spend a lot of money on
advertising now YouTube still does not
make any money
in fact YouTube loses two billion
dollars a year now I've been in the
video game for many many years and about
a year or so before YouTube I created a
YouTube like site and I built it up we
started getting it going
we had people putting on tutorials
putting on videos and I put on my little
nerd accounting hat and I did the
numbers and I said who this is not gonna
make any money so I shut the whole thing
down before I started spending huge
amounts of money to get this thing going
till this day YouTube loses Google about
two billion dollars a year two billion
dollars it's a huge money loser but
they've have so much invested in it it's
such an important piece of the internet
they're not gonna let it go right now
anyway so when you put your videos up on
YouTube and you don't have to pay for
bandwidth if you don't have to pay for
all the tools that come with YouTube
you're basically getting a free ride
from Google for YouTube again remember
they are losing two billion dollars
so with the recent problems with videos
put out by huge creators it creates a
bad smell advertisers like I don't know
if we want to be associated with YouTube
so YouTube had to come up with some some
ways to clean up the YouTube itself in
terms of the content and I guess what
they did this is my guess I was if I
owned YouTube of a software developer
for many years so I understand how
coders think what they would do is look
at the statistics and they probably saw
that a lot of the problem videos were in
videos that from channels that didn't
meet that threshold they didn't have
those files and subscribers they didn't
have those 4,000 hours so by just
putting that restriction on YouTube is
probably gonna cut away a lot of their
trouble so then they can go see the
advertisers and say look we are
filtering out the bad videos right off
the get-go with our new policy at the
end of the day YouTube is losing two
billion dollars a year and they need to
come up with a way to make some money so
this is one of the ways they're gonna do
it so the small creators are you know I
guess if I was a small creator depending
on you know 20 bucks a month from
YouTube as Apple's I was a kid I guess
it wouldn't matter but at the end of the
day you know YouTube is losing a ton of
money they got to do something about it
and I totally understand why they would
do it for business reasons another thing
you have to consider is the fact that if
you have I don't know what the numbers
are but if you have a million youtubers
who have tiny little channels and they
make twenty bucks a month those eyes are
being sucked away from people who work
full-time on producing YouTube content
and you see even with the biggest
YouTube creators they will have videos
where no ad appears why because there's
not unlimited ads the ads have to be
sold YouTube sales people have to go to
see compensation come buy ads put them
on YouTube don't worry we got rid of the
stupid content and they don't have
unlimited ads so
it kind of makes sense to me but YouTube
would want to help dedicated creators
people were willing to put the effort
into building the channel over time help
them by filtering out all the guys and
girls who might put up five ten videos
and then forget about it and and and
just lead off a hundred bucks or bleed
off five hundred bucks over two years
you see what I'm saying here so this is
a way for you to both to also help out
serious creators people who are looking
to actually put it put the effort put
the effort put the money into producing
really high quality content so from a
business perspective from from YouTube's
point of view this makes total sense
and this makes total sense actually for
serious creators who are putting in the
time or effort this I believe will
result in more revenue for your efforts
since a huge amount of ads won't be
going to people who may put up ten
videos and then disappear and who are
not dead dedicated to YouTube now bottom
line is I would not be investing all my
time into a YouTube career the
PewDiePie's and the rest of them out
there there are very rare rare
exceptions I use YouTube as a way for me
to practice my video conversations here
I use YouTube to talk about my own work
outside of YouTube I do make some
revenue on YouTube but it's more or less
a hobby for me but I because I enjoy it
because it's a hobby I've invested money
and time into it and it's just a lot of
fun for me but you should always
diversify off of YouTube you should
never be dependent on YouTube or any
other site whether it be YouTube
Facebook whatever you should always be
looking to diversify your position if
you want to get into any type of
business and if you become a content
creator you are getting into a business
so I hope this helps I hope this helps
you to understand why YouTube did this
they're not trying to smack down
creators they're trying to make their
business a business because I don't
think they can
go on forever losing two billion dollars
a year I hope that makes sense
