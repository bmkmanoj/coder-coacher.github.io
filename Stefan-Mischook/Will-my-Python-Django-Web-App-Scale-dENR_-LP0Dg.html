it a little milestone one of my videos
hit over half a million views just one
video from just a few months ago so
that's kind of cool anyway so this quick
vlog I'm gonna discuss something that
was put to me a question that was put to
me by somebody who was thinking about
building an app they would build a sass
if I recall and they started learning a
little bit of Django which is the web
framework for Python and they were
concerned that Python may not be able to
handle the server load that their
brand-new web app might get at some
point so it's part of programmers pain
if you will you're wondering about
whether your technology stack your
chosen technology whether it be Python
Django JavaScript node PHP laravel Java
spring etc etc you're wondering will it
actually step up to the plate will be
able to handle the load should your app
gain that kind of success so you have to
look at this from a business person's
perspective build the app with whatever
language and framework you're
comfortable with and I can tell you if
at any of these frameworks any of the
modern ones that are out but that have
been out for last several years they
will be more than able to handle just
about any apps requirements for at least
a while and I say that because computers
are so fast these days app frameworks
and programming languages are so
optimized these days so I wouldn't worry
too much about it
and if you ever find yourself at some
point where your app is under tremendous
load where you feel that you might need
to expand upon it you have the resources
at that time you will have the resources
at
time to be able to deal with it when
you're first building an app you can't
assume you're gonna be Facebook that's
one of the big mistakes that new
developers make they want to build in
all these capabilities and into their
new app that will be able to handle a
facebook level of traffic that's kind of
silly no no you start off small just get
it out quickly as possible the startup
community they call this MVP Minimum
Viable Minimum Viable Product any
entrepreneur knows you just get your
product out as quickly as possible use
the old Goodenough principle that
Microsoft made famous and just get it
out see what happens what you're gonna
find actually most web apps the
bottleneck is typically with the
database database interactions so one of
the first and the biggest ways to
optimize any codebase is to look at your
database look at the table structure
look at your indexes I've talked about
this in another video so again don't get
caught up in programmers pain thinking
that you have to choose the perfect
technology stack for your app at the end
of the day you could use five year old
technology and it'll be more of an able
to handle your business for a little
while at least and if it gets so
successful that you need to add on to it
you could there's all kinds of different
strategies you can use it or not too
expensive to expand on the scalability
meaning the power that your app needs to
be able to handle it'll client load but
let me tell you when you're about in
that situation where you find yourself
well you have an over load of clients
that's a fantastic position to peahen
right I wouldn't worry too much about it
what happened to us with Studio web
again fairly recently lost first started
a few years back and what we did is we
build we built a secondary app that used
a much more modern framework that
created a series of micro services that
fed into the older app to allow it to
handle an increased load
capacity it worked fine more recently
with the same app of course we I found
out through investigation it was just
this index is not being properly applied
to particular tables in fields within
the database and I was able to reduce
reduce my server load by 90 percent with
just you know two three hours of me
looking at things
okay identified the problem and
literally takes a minute or so to
implement and bing bang Bob's your uncle
problem solved and this is with a very
old code base so yes bottom line is if
and when you should reach that problem
that's a great problem to have and it'll
be many different solutions that you can
find to enable that your code base if it
ever gets overloaded will be able to
handle the increased load that's such a
big deal don't worry about it alright
that's enough for today's there tip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
