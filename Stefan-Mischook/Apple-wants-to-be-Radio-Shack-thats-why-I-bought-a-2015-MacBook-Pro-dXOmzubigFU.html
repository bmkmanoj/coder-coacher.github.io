brand new macbook pro 2015 15 inch
screen yes not the 2016 let me tell you
why because the macbook pro 2016 is not
a professional machine in my opinion let
me give you a couple reasons why I think
that first of all the touch bar at the
top is clearly not a professional users
tool because professional users do not
look at their keyboard I'm a developer I
do video work now I know my hotkeys like
this I don't look at the keyboard
because I'm not a beginner beginners
noobs people are not pros we'll look at
their keyboard all the time so that
strip at the top appeals to them now
when you're a pro user to look at the
keyboard slows down the flow of things
would have been a true pro touch feature
would have been a touch screen because a
pro user is using his tactile his or her
tactile feel of the keyboard to navigate
the keyboard using shortcut keys and so
forth and they're always have their I
you always have your eye on the screen
in front of you so having a touch screen
where you can close the window launch a
tab resize scrub a timeline if you're
doing video work this is where it's very
cool and i can tell you this now from
speculation but from actually using it I
went into Apple yesterday and I was
going to buy 2 2016 i figure i have also
get the 2016 i can't find a 2015 model
that's up to what i want so i go into
the mac store the apple store rather and
i try it out at keyboard whatever it's
fine i kind of like the keyboards okay I
i'm not too picky about the keyboard and
in a new Mac versus the old Mac and but
the touch bar came up it looks kind of
cool for about two seconds but then you
realize you don't look down you don't
want to look down and what happens
though something strange had happened to
me on two occasions without
thinking about it because I touched a
touch bar at the top I was immediately
wanting to wanting to touch the screen
itself I close that window or scrub a
lion or something and it's not just me
it happened to me twice or the cost is
not a touchscreen paddle one of the guys
at the apple store will say yeah I
happened to me too now I thought well
maybe it was just me because I use a
windows surface pro 4 that's my other
computer and I use the touch all the
time because it's such a great interface
to have but no no it's not just me so
Apple I think is going to see that a lot
actually some saw some people vlogging
about that as well where they were
reaching up going to touch the screen
that's what I think what that touch bar
is going to do it's going to invite
people to want to touch the screen
because actually that's the better way
to implement touch not a bar at the top
so again the macbook pro 2016 touch bar
is not a professional tool it is a tool
for noobs because professionals know the
keyboard really well and know all the
hotkeys they don't need to have a
context-sensitive touch bar they can all
do from hotkeys real quick pop up a boo
another thing professionals a lot of
times we'll hook up their laptop to an
external display I even did a video
about this in 2012 or 11 talking about
the ideal developer setup and that was
having a SSD based laptop connected to
external displays and Bluetooth keyboard
and mouse and that's what I do my mac i
have now i have a 2012 macbook retina
and it's getting a little long in the
tooth in terms of what i needed to do so
i said i got upgraded now and i hardly
ever use its keyboard in fact it's
usually has the lid shut sitting on the
side behind my big thunder both display
and a 1080 on the side as well so I
never touch the keyboard I'll never use
the touch bar so many professional users
will not use a touch bar because half
the time they'll have their mac if not
more connected to an external display
using a bluetooth keyboard and finally
the dongles the fact that removes all
these ports this there's people are
saying well to transition blah blah blah
blah so people have invested all this
money at all these peripherals I don't
know how they're going to transition
from an SD card if you're using a using
a camera they all have SD cards so I'm
not sure how you're going to transition
the SD card into his new macbook you
always better need a dongle but with
2015 you have an SD card slot boom with
the surface surface book SD card book
Canada's vaio z boom Dell a boom they
always super thin and ultra-modern and
far more capable laptops out there and
convertibles they all seem dinner
ultra-thin they all seem to been able to
find space for USB 3 SD cards and they
have also the new the new connecting
time to Thunderbolt 3 winner USB type-c
excuse me so I don't understand anyway
whatever it is what it is so again not
having these ports that are easily
accessible so that the professional
creator can go boom shriven SD card or
just put it in boom a USB thumb drive or
connect a external HDMI display boom or
a mini DisplayPort display boom no
toggle is required with this 2015 model
and finally people going to say speed
speed speed the fact of the matter is at
the end of the day Apple uses Intel
chips and Intel for last few years has
been creating chips better not so much
faster although they're a little bit
faster over here maybe five percent ten
percent and eight percent faster every
year there are more about reducing power
consumption and running
so the 2015 macbook pro might be a
little bit slower yeah I'll take 10
minutes it will take 12 minutes to
render a video instead of 10 minutes
whatever as long as what I'm using it it
works really fine it flows it's nice as
slick so that's it so up here in canada
i bought i had to get a new macbook
because i have certain apps that are mac
only and i need to keep that workflow in
place so i bought that last year's model
saved about eight hundred dollars but it
was much more of all those other factors
like i said i wanted my ports i didn't
have to buy one hundred fifty dollars
and dongles and deal with all these
headaches and the fact of the matter is
the touch bar yeah a little bit of speed
boost in the new 2016 mac pro was not
compelling and i'm actually looking to
fade out my use of mac products because
clearly they're discontinuing of their
support for Pro users which are due back
for pro they don't do any monitors
anymore they're getting rid of their
their hubs with regards to network hubs
and so they're they're basically going
full consumer rather not pro and you see
the innovation strangely enough on the
windows side on the windows side surface
pro has so many features at the
touchscreen is detachable pen support it
has USB as SD USB see mini display and
you look at Dells doing say you know all
the innovation the power for power users
is on the windows side of things Mac
they're going for consumer end and
consumer products it seems to be the
case anyway who knows well that's what
it is ChaCha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
