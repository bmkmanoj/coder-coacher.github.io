what we're going to be starting to
implement are the pictures that we
wanted to have here if you remember in
our final design we had some pictures
integrated into the look of our work and
we're going to attempt to do the same
thing here now sometimes when you're in
this development stage you may or may
not have the image is actually available
at the time of your design and that's
okay because part of what you want to be
doing when you're designing is now
anticipating for an area that might be
used for a graphic or a picture but you
may not actually have that picture ready
so what we're going to be doing first
and foremost is to integrate a couple of
shape layers and those shape layers
would just be color coded initially and
will eventually be doing something with
it and integrating it into some pictures
so let's just go about making some
placeholders for ourselves right now and
you'll notice I'm pointing to the vector
based bad shapes that are here starts
off with the rectangle tool just perfect
exactly what we want let me just draw
your attention up to the top here for a
second and notice that I'm making with
these vector tools a shape layer not
making a path and we're certainly not
making fill pixels so it's a shape layer
that I want you to integrate now don't
worry so much about the colors because
we can change those colors a little bit
later on so as I draw this out and
you'll notice you know as I'm slowing
down here you can see how the object is
snapping to our guides it's one of the
big reasons that we're integrating those
guidelines in here not only for our
graphic design layout but we're also
doing this just with regards to what we
want to have happen here inside of our
design so with all of these the things
absolutely matched out we know we've
measured and we've calculated that each
one of these are two hundred and sixty
pixels wide and that's perfectly fine so
you can see them here shape one two and
three and if I wanted to I could also
double click any one of these and
choose a color remember we used some
Adobe swatch exchange options last time
in the last video so I could come in
here and I could choose any number of
different colors and click OK and notice
very easy for us to change what those
colors actually are and we do that just
simply by you know talking about which
colors were using in which space and
just by double clicking on these here we
can see that it's very simple to go in
and change some colors and do different
things to it so now we've got those
three styles these shapes right here and
there's three separate shapes so
technically speaking if we didn't have
our pictures ready these would be
perfect place holders however we're
going to be doing something with
pictures in the next video and will
still continue using these three as we
go along but before we continue let me
just take note of what's happening here
inside of the layer palette everything
seems pretty manageable because we only
have about six layers but soon enough
things will start to get a lot more
complex and there's going to be a lot
more layers in here so one of the things
I want to do is to organize these layers
much better and we can do that by
putting them inside of these groups
these little folders here that you can
create so I selected the top layer of
the type here so that the group would be
right on top of it doesn't really matter
because we can move them around at any
given point so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to put all of our type which
belongs in the header graphic into group
number one which I will now double click
and rename header now after we've done
that that's fine and we could stop right
here but let me show you something else
that's advantageous when you're working
with a lot of layers you can also color
code the specific layer so check it out
you can collapse that folder so that
makes it a little bit more manageable
you can expand that layer and when you
do all the color coding is there so it
shows you this belongs to the header
folder let's do the same thing with
these since they will in fact be used
where the pictures will be I'll select
the top layer and i will then click
my group and will rename this one if you
click right on the text you can rename
it directly and will rename this one
pictures and then once that's done I
could also double click it out here not
on the text but out here and we could
choose a color for this as well so as
you can see here I've made them red now
all we got to do is drag our objects
inside of this and when we do that they
also become red as well so we can
collapse those elements everything seems
to be in order and seems to be ready for
us to now integrate our pictures which
we'll do in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
