couple of different things first of all
let's talk about long-term implications
or long-term issues you're gonna have
when you run a SAS software as-a-service
so I have studio web comm which is a
software as-a-service basically it's a
website that schools use to help teach
kids had a cold so I have schools over
the US no over the world really and so
yesterday I got a tech support request
from a particular district it has many
schools and they were having trouble
accessing studia web the response time
was really really slow and they said
that they had checked logging into
Google check logging into some other
site and it was very fast but what's to
do well is super slow so I assumed right
off the bat I said it's got to be our
servers as we've had an influx of a lot
of brand-new schools this year and the
old studio web app is shall we say it's
seven year old that's using old arm
technology he's got a very inefficient
database structure the code base is just
you know after seven years many
developers it was built on a neat - nerd
basis it's a bit of a mess so that's why
we're rewriting studi web 4 from scratch
is almost ready to go in fact it's so
much faster in so many respects that I
can get into details about how we made
it so much faster than later on well
better or better database structure
cleaner code
there you go so anyway so I assume right
off the top of the head all right off
the top when I got the tetris board
since they said they're able to access
other sites no problem it's going to be
our server so I'll go check the server
and the CPU utilization was pretty high
there around 45 50 percent but not much
higher when you got 50 percent CPU
utilization yes it's gonna be a little
bit slower there's no question about
that but - it to a screeching halt mmm
anyway so what I did is because I want a
virtual private server I can click click
click and within a few minutes you can
add as much RAM and CPU as you want so I
increase the CPU and a ram capacity by
50% and
and I did a few other optimizations
quick ones in the database to see if I
could solve the problem cuz basically
still your web 3 codebase being seven
years old
it's basically end of life it's kind of
like when the Python guys basically
stopped development of Python 2 and
started Python 3 because there were some
fundamental problems with Python 2 I
imagine and it couldn't be really fixed
so I said okay we're just gonna do it
I'm gonna do Python 3 and that's what
we're doing with studio web for studio 4
is a fundamental total rewrite
fundamental change in architectures and
so forth from c1 3 because 3 1 3 is code
base is just you know too much legacy at
some point you got to drop the code you
got to move on and start over again and
take advantage of new technologies and
and also when you understand exactly
what you need in your app it's a lot
easier to write clean code as opposed
when you're first developing the concept
of your app when you're not quite sure
what this client will need so the code
could meander in all kinds of different
directions but here's the interesting
thing after I took responsibility for
slowness in the studio of software I
went on TechCrunch and I found out that
apparently one of the major service
providers in the US was having major
disruptions and as was indicated in the
TechCrunch article they were saying that
you would go to some sites and it would
load fast no problem but did you go to
like Facebook or something they
mentioned Facebook and others big sites
and wouldn't load at all you just get a
good a blank page sort of request so and
they had a map a heat map if you will
over to us showing the areas where the
service outage is the service outages
were concentrated and as it turns out
one of the main areas is where my
particular district was having problems
here's the thing I didn't have any other
schools complaining about the system
being slow so I have a feeling it had
much more to do
my slowness in the studio I bad I had a
lot more to do with the service provider
having
their connectivity we shall see now this
is the next day and they're on it right
now
the schools are and I was you know I'm
waiting to see what the responses today
from the administrators and so forth and
that's the thing when you're dealing
with larger clients and you have
responsibilities with tons and tons of
people using your system it's a lot more
nerve-wracking when you're deploying you
know what I mean especially stuff where
the data is critical and uptime is
critical other types of businesses where
you have a lot it's not so critical
these things they have a lot more leeway
in terms of you know in terms of whether
the apps are down apps a little slow
excite or eccentric cetera not to save
it you can allow apps to be down but
there's different levels of pressure
right there's different levels of
pressure yeah that's about it
so let me close off this video by
pointing out that I finalized the
structure for my business course I'm
calling it the business battle plan I
did a vote we've got over thirty forty
votes more than sixty percent voted for
business battle plan I think it's good
because when you're in business
it is competition it's like getting on
the field and you're competing and you
gotta have that game plan that battle
plan to win in the space but at the same
time when you're in business your job
whether you provide a product or service
is to basically partner with your
clients to help them achieve whatever
goals they want to achieve so when
you're in business it's not just about
bottling it's not just about competition
it's also about creating relationships
and long-term relationships are best of
course and it's about cooperating and
being an empathetic if you went on to
that's the right word to have empathy
for your market for your clients so that
you can make their lives easier in
whatever it is that you're trying to
help them with anyway I'll stop there so
this business course is barri any and it
for
events I'm shooting now and I think it
you might see some stuff up at the end
of the week and the model is going to be
instead of a course that you pay 50
bucks or whatever is a hundred bucks for
to download it I decided to make it much
more interesting for people it's going
to be subscription-based I believe and
then every week I'll be uploading to new
course courses from or to new lessons
from the course and also responding to
user input in questions so it's going to
be a virtual mentoring type of situation
where you're gonna have the core course
both in video and podcast format so the
videos will be embedded within the
subscription area but I'll also give you
access to be able to download the audio
files the mp3 files for all the lessons
that are release and this will be an
ongoing thing based on QA based on the
course structure but I've mapped out the
first 17 chapters of this course and I
think I'll be launching with maybe five
or six chapters up and then releasing
new chapters over subsequent to a month
or so and it's gonna be inexpensive
monthly subscription I think it's gonna
be maybe ten dollars basically buy me a
beer maybe a couple coffees every month
and you have access to all the material
and new material on an ongoing basis and
it's going to be entrepreneurial
business mentoring private form we're
just working on some of the final
details with my Tech's and that's about
it all right if you heard the drilling
my apologies there's doing some
construction and I started recording
this as they were starting to drill so
alright we'll talk some - shell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
