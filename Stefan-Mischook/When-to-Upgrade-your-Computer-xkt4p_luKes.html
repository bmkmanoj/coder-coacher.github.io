upgrade your equipment this is something
I've been struggling with for a couple
months now where I updated a four year
old almost a five year old Windows
laptop it was a really beautiful laptop
it was a samsung series 9 I need to call
it Eve books now that line of notebooks
anyhow so it was one of the first SSD
based laptops out there one of these
ultra books great device and I recently
upgraded it because it just couldn't
handle editing videos over 720p even
720p videos I was having a difficult
time with so I was able to sell the
laptop for about 25 percent of what I
paid for it but you know considering was
a four or five year old laptop not bad
to be honest with you I'm quite amazed
that these days you can keep your
laptops and your computers were bad long
I remember back many years ago when I
would update my computer's every two
years religiously because computers were
advancing so quickly and you did see
significant performance gains even
yearly sometimes but nowadays computers
are so fast for most work that you do
you don't really need to upgrade so
often especially if you're doing coding
and stuff unless you're getting deep
into creating virtual machines maybe
doing some heavy compiling you probably
don't need to upgrade your laptop or
your computer very often at all you
could be a great professional developer
with a four-year old laptop you'll be
fine unfortunately for me a big part of
my work these days is in presentations
and in videos so I do lots of live
webinars presenting my products and so a
lot of video streaming and my 2012
MacBook Pro is this like it's just like
overheats all the time it's got all
kinds of problems but I'm powerless of
powering a 1080p and a 2k display and it
just gets pretty slaggy when I have more
than two or two or three people in a
video conference that's a problem now
I'm also having problems editing some
videos like I can do it if I have no
other apps open but since I haven't a
couple browsers open or something I'm
trying to edit 1080p forget about 4k
that's not going to happen but at 1080p
it causes me a problem so I talked about
this before I'm kind of reluctant to
upgrade to the new MacBook Pros because
they're so expensive they got a poor
it's gone but I may have to bite the
bullet on that I'm not sure yet I'm
looking at other options and for me
specifically it's just that because of
the type of work I do I have really
heavy requirements with regards to my
computer needs that said the good thing
about computers these days when you buy
one whatever you buy whatever type of
computer buy today whether it be a Mac
or a Windows machine they are so
powerful these days you can probably
expect to keep them at least four years
unless you're like a mega power user but
beyond that so I had my MacBook I have
it still my 2012 MacBook Pro and we're
almost in 27th set in 2017 so it's not
bad so four and a half years or gonna
hit about in January so it's pretty good
and so the new MacBook Pro for the
configuration I want very expensive but
if you figure you're gonna keep it for
four years five years not so bad perhaps
I we have to look at that
you know when should you upgrade I think
you should upgrade when you see that
your computer is starting to give you
consistent problems in terms of your
work for instance with me
the reason I'm even considering
upgrading after four years is because I
was doing webinars and it kept tanky and
kept tanking you had to restart and I
fortunately have my windows surface pro
4 which is a fantastic computer and it
was able to handle it no problem you
know it's a brand new computers only a
year old so I plugged keeping at least a
couple more years so that's what I'm
faced with now and also people who
critical well why should you upgrade
everybody is different everybody has a
different need for me the main benchmark
is when your computer starts getting in
the way of your work starts causing
frustration especially if you're doing
creative work where you have to be in
good mindset to actually create then
it's time to look at upgrading so that's
my criteria on that so there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
