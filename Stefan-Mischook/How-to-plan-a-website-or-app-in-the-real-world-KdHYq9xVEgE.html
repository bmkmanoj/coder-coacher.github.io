sites and studio web amongst other sites
so a question that was put to me
recently how do you plan out how do you
go about building an app or a website
what's the process that you use so you
had somebody who knows how to code but
they're not sure how to proceed with
actually building a project so let me
give you my two cents so I've been
coding since 1994 or I've done a lot of
projects including projects for publicly
traded companies and tons of small and
medium sized businesses as well so the
way I approach it is to start with the
screens the actual views that you see in
an app or in a website or in a web app
so if it was an a web app for instance
if I was building a shopping cart system
I would have like the main shot the main
page but people hit when they first hit
the shopping cart probably with some
products I have the you know if you cart
button and a list of products that they
have in your cart etc etc now that would
diagram out which pages people actually
see when you're using app they would
have the main cart page maybe product
catalog page maybe a checkout page a
login page you get the idea so you have
to map out your pages and the reason I
start with the pages is because that's
what your client is going to see now the
client could be you so we'll help you
visualize what exactly you know how the
app is going to work or the client could
be another person and so that's the best
way of doing it because they can
actually see the app in front of them so
what I would do with the web for
instance I would just use very simple
HTML I pull out like some WYSIWYG apps
some app that made it easy to just lay
down coat real quick and I would just do
it very simply you know I would just
sketch it out one column you know one
column blah blah add the components add
the pages so that the client could see
what is actually in the pages now this
is not for of a design this is not for
the aesthetic this is just a shoulder
what
is there what information is being
presented that's all now before you get
too sweet of course you should talk to a
client sort of take down notes what do
you want what do you want you have to do
what you know and write it all this down
and then the next step is screen so step
one interview the client that kind of
could be you or somebody else find out
what they want what they have to what
they what they have to do with basic
features they want step to build the
screens and again it's just dummy
screens very quick so the client can see
what it is is going to appear on the
page so it's not about design at this
point it's not about making it look good
it's not about usability it's not about
aesthetics it's just about what's there
and then from there once you get the ALK
on that and it looks pretty good then
the next thing I would do is look at the
database so look at designing the
database based on the information that
we're holding and tracking and grabbing
with the screens right because the
screens show you it shows you basically
what the data is going to be so the next
thing is you build your database now
most of the time rather be using
relational databases or as others might
call it SQL databases MySQL very popular
line most popular you get post-grad
another very popular and so on and so
forth so that's the next step so first
step interview the client find out what
they want the project to do this is
whether it be a website a web app an iOS
app doesn't matter it's same thing next
thing you do is you build some screens
shown what's what are each of the views
that they see the login page the view
cart page a checkout page etc etc right
so you got that step two then once
that's done then step three is to build
your database to structure your database
and you look at you know step two you
look at your screens to figure out
what's going to be in the database which
has what has to be held in the database
and what's the best way to design the
database to hold that information
efficiently and then step four is to
start writing basic code that stitches
the views all the screens to your
database makes that connection and why
do I say basic code you
it's not a good idea to write rock-solid
code when you first start a project
because you're not gonna really know
what the project ultimately has to have
what needs to be there the first time
you put it out the client's won't know
you won't know so the trick is is to
write really quick and dirty code
rapidly get it out the door you know so
it kind of works will be bugs things
will break here and there so I'm gonna
be to clean his code but you're gonna
get something in the hands of your
client or yourself as quickly as
possible leave so you can start really
figuring out what needs to be there
because what you'll find you may have to
add change you're gonna change a lot of
things about the screens for sure you
may have to put move you know we want
this display here we like to grab this
type of information about the client and
so on so forth and this will of course
affect your database and this will of
course affect all the code that creates
the connection between your screens and
your database now this will apply more
or less to any type of app or web site
so even if you're building iOS app you
know again there's there's that that
brokering of which is what you're saving
in terms of data in terms of information
versus the screens and how it's
displayed so that's the process number
one interview client get basic
requirements number two build-out screen
so you could show the client because
they won't really understand if you just
give them a list of bullets they really
understand when they see the screens
number three builds your database number
for those very quick code dirty code to
connect them all and when you got
something where there's the client or
you solve you kind of like how the app
works and so on then you clean up all
that code you clean up the UI so
everything is structured properly you
clean up your database and then you go
back again it's like a psycho cyclical
process it refers round very basic
sector and polish their rounds nicely
polished and then at the end once you
know where everything is place you said
how the app works then you get in the UX
guy come and make it usable you get in
the designer guy or yourself make it
look pretty and that's pretty much how I
would go about
building these type of projects there's
another school thought which was very
popular in the late 90s and early 2000s
I'm frankly I'm not sure how popular it
is today I'm sure it's being used still
is that they would think about art
projects they would interviewed a client
and then they would start writing all
their code or object code it was
object-oriented program which which most
of the time it is today so you write all
the code and then from now they would
generate databases and and their UX
which to me is the wrong approach so
again one interview client number two
screams number three database and or
four code to connect it all together all
very rough quick and dirty just to get
it out kind of hobble in working and
then once you you you're pretty secure
about what it is what you're building
you know then you just reiterate polish
Polish polish so you got a nice app and
that's the way to go about building
projects in a most efficient manner this
is more or less a rad approach rapid
application development approach and
that's what I subscribe to thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
