basic business principle that is
important to learn even if you're not
going to get into business
what is this principle it's called the
barrier to entry as in a barrier a wall
to entry the higher the barrier to entry
the harder it is to get over that wall
the higher the harder it is to get into
a particular area so let me give me an
example let's say you want to learn how
to program programmers make more money
than just typical classic web designers
who don't know programming because the
barrier to entry to learning to program
is higher meaning it's more difficult to
become a programmer than it is to become
a web designer as such the value of
programmers are higher because they're
less of them and because there are less
of them there's more of a demand and
also because you need a lot of
programmers these days to get anything
done almost every business these days
requires some sort of use of software
many times some sort of customized
software so when you're looking at
anything that you're going to approach
in your career whether you're looking to
get a job whether you're looking to be a
freelancer whether you're looking to
start a business one of the things you
have to consider is the barrier to entry
so if the barrier of entry is high
meaning it's difficult to learn those
skills to acquire those skills to do
that thing then the value of whatever it
is you're providing the value of that
product of failure that service goes up
accordingly if the barrier of entry is
low meaning it's easy to acquire those
skills then the valuable skills are very
low because everybody's doing it another
factor that plays into this is how
glamorous the particular profession is
how glamorous how fun well at least help
perceives how fun the particular job is
so for example this is outside of tech
but it's applicable to this lesson if
you were looking at become
a plumber a plumber is not a glamorous
job because it's a dirty job many times
and it takes a few years of training and
it's creates a barrier to entry takes
few years of training you got to get
licensed you're gonna get these seals
these red seals I think it's called and
so before you can even start plumbing
you're gonna have a few years of
investment in education and then it's a
dirty tough job but as a result plumbers
have unlimited work and plumbers make a
lot of money for their time especially
once you become a master plumber or you
can hire junior plumbers on top of you
these guys can be making two three
hundred thousand dollars a year or more
so as an example of where you have a
gel-like plumbing a lot of people don't
want to go there because you know you're
dealing with crap literally and it's
hard work and there's a barrier to entry
meaning you can't just become a plumber
you have to study you have to train you
have to go to school you gotta pass on
the other hand if you want to get into
the vlogging business where you create
vlogs for a living on YouTube a lot of
people are into vlogging the barrier to
entry is very very very very low all you
need is your smartphone you get your
iPhone or your pixel or whatever any
smartphone these days can produce pretty
good-looking video in the right lighting
so you don't need to buy a fancy camera
like mine you don't need any of that and
you can just start vlogging you've you
shoot you edit you upload and that's it
barrier of entry very low anybody can do
it twelve-year-old kid kid kids can do
it but as a result you have a lot of
people who are entering that market so
it's very difficult to make any money
with it because this is so much
competition why because the barrier of
entry is low and because it's perceived
as being fun right who would route what
would you rather do would you rather
make videos or you guys running around
the skateboard skateboard logging about
nothing really and I'm gonna get a juice
today you know and that's their vlog and
they make a lot of views and they make a
lot of money as a result would you
rather do you
do that you want to skateboard for
living or do you want to go to school
for four years learn to be a plumber and
then have to do dirty messy work if you
become a plumber you're guaranteed to
make good money or great money
guaranteed you become a vlogger the
chances of you actually making money
with that are very very very very low
it's probably less than 1% I haven't
done the actual math probably is let's
talk about programming now programming
again is one of those areas where if you
become a programmer you're almost
guaranteed to make really good money you
become a freelancer you can make sick
sick amounts of money especially if you
learn the right programming languages
and you learn to structure your
freelance business properly so you know
but you got to train you know it's not
like vlogging we just got to take your
iPhone and film yourself buying a latte
or buying a smoothie and skateboarding
somewhere so a lot more work to learn
how to programs a lot more brain power
but again if you do it you put into work
you put into time you're almost
guaranteed you're gonna do very well
financially so there you go that's the
business lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
