this is what I hear on a regular basis
somebody's learning to write code and
when you first learn to write code it
looks like something like this maybe
looks like gibberish to you but
gradually day by day as you work through
it
your mind will slowly start being able
to read this and this code will start
reading like your first language for me
it's English so I'm going to put some
English here this is normal and I call
those the nerd eyes the eyes those being
the eyes that allow you to read code
like you would read your first language
for me it's English so could be you
French could be whatever Saints Sanskrit
who knows if you're elvish
maybe it's elvish anyhow so when you're
learning to code a lot of times what you
find is that you hit something and you
write the code out it just won't work
and you're reading it and you're going I
can't see the mistake I can't see maybe
there's a bug in the software it's not
likely right so what's more likely is
that you're learning and you haven't
developed those nerd eyes and still and
because you don't have the nerd eyes
you're not able to see the code as
clearly as you will once you developed a
nerd eyes so how you develop a nerd eyes
your right code and you do it frequently
so you write some code and you find
yourself I can't read I can't find a
mistake that's when it's time to walk
away from that go do something that's
the opposite of coding go for a run go
for some exercise go read a bit go watch
TV whatever come back to it four hours
later the next day and oftentimes what
happened you can look at the code you go
ah now I understand I had cancer I kind
of said why I didn't see this guess what
it happens to even the best coders in
the world even after they know their
stuff really well that's why the
development world in the late 90s to
develop something called paired
programming where you have one coder
who's off to actively coding and you
know the other coder beside him and her
and just watching why did they do this
she figured why did you why of what to
coders
doing this isn't that a way shouldn't
you have each coated Cody know what they
found is that having that second coat or
watching and playing like the winged
wingman to the main coder you know
allowed for a lot more productivity
because as you're coding you get into it
and your brains is gonna miss things but
somebody's sitting beside you the brain
won't be as fatigued and they'll see
things that you won't see and as a
result the code comes out quicker
quicker
it comes out cleaner again it's because
sometimes what's not obvious to you
right away will be obvious to you the
next day or will be obvious to somebody
is just fresh fresh minded so you may be
coding and you won't see the error even
though it's a simple error but the guy
beside you comes in and a girl beside
you says hey it's just there it's you're
just gonna fix that there ah that's what
happened
this happens all time now the guy who
didn't see that little mistake it's not
because he's dumb or she's dumb but it's
not because they're dirty incompetent it
just happens it happens it could be a
junior you could be a master coder test
a green coder
black belt and you'll miss something and
some junior walk-in who's have who has
fresh eyes just you know not fatigue no
god no you just you just you you you use
the a capital uppercase here the
lowercase oh geez
when you fix it you're done so it's even
more pronounced when you're beginning
because you still haven't developed the
nerd eyes the coders eyes and so things
will look kind of gibberish to you at
first but again if you find yourself
hitting the wall that way you just can't
figure something out that's when you
walk away come back next day four hours
later whatever get your mind off it a
lot of times behind the scenes you're
super powerful monkey lizard brain we'll
we'll be working out the details and you
sit down you go oh there's the answer
boom bun that's it so there you go when
you have problems you're not seeing the
code the code is cloudy chances are is
just something like that so chances are
all you have to do is just take a step
back
back to it and the answer will come to
you that's why I say to you and I said
in other videos the key to learning
anything quickly is about frequency of
exposure not generation meaning 10
minutes every day is better than sitting
down once for 30 minutes you actually
learn more quickly
anyway the brain needs a little rest in
between right just like when you work
what you're working out you need to give
your body a rest bodybuilders to talk
about that the resting period is just as
important as the actual workout because
you need you need to give your body a
chance to recover and when you're
learning something new the brain is
literally creating new pathways is
actually restructuring itself it needs
time to do that so when you're learning
drink lots of water drink some coffee
drink lots of water some coffee actually
fasting will help you with your thinking
as well because it just it released Wow
somebody explained in a YouTube they
said it causes the body go to fat the
fat has nutrients that the brain needs
helps it to do its thing that's why when
you you fast it actually helps with your
cognitive capabilities anyway there we
go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
