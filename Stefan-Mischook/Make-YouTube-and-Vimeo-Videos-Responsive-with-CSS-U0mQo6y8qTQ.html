with some video embeds from YouTube and
Vimeo I was rescanning a part of Steel
comm and these videos here I wanted them
to be responsive so there's a couple
ways of approaching this and a website
you could use jQuery or you could just
use some basic CSS to do it so what I
did is I first got a video from Vimeo
and I got a video from YouTube and they
both use iframes and review page source
so they both use iframes where they are
to embed the video and you see that the
width and the height of videos are
specified in both famille and in YouTube
so the top one is a Vimeo video the
bottom one is a YouTube video so the
problem with that is that well here's a
problem see it's it's not responsive no
good so how do we fix that I use bit of
CSS so let me just launch up I sublime
text here and here is the page and you
see at the top I got my style block and
this is the code that you have to enter
into here and yeah so here it is now
it's not working now because I commented
it out so let me uncomment this so we
can activate our CSS so I save that
refresh blam and we see now both our
videos are responsive whether they be a
Vimeo video at the top or a YouTube
video at the bottom so that is one way
in which you can turn unresponsive
videos into responsive videos which is a
very simple bit of CSS code now what you
have to do is you have to put a
container wrapper around your iframe and
you tag it with responsive container
this code right here so you can just
pause the video can copy the code and
yeah those position is relative that's
one thing you have to look at and then
you look at the iframe now this
particular class target specifically the
iframe
you know that because of that little
snippet of code right there so and what
we do is we set the height and the width
of the video with this particular bit of
CSS that's pretty much it
simple quick now you got responsive
videos in your web pages with a new
problemo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
