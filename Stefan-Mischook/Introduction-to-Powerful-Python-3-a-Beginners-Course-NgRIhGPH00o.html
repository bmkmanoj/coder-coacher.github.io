this is a course designed for total
beginners to programming so we're going
to go everything step by steps make sure
that you understand everything Python is
a great first programming language to
learn for many reasons first of all -
code is very very readable we're giving
an example so here is a sample of Java
code Java is a very popular programming
language that's used to create Android
apps amongst other things so here's a
sample of Java code now here's a sample
of Python code but does the exact same
thing Java Python which code is easier
to read another thing that makes Python
easier it's that it's a very expressive
language it's a language where you can
write very little Python code and can
get a lot done so now other reasons too
but Python is basically an easy language
to approach and learn so it's a great
first programming language on top of
that Python doesn't sacrifice power it's
easy to write Python it's an intuitive
language it's easy to read python but
it's still very powerful python is used
in many different industries many
different types of businesses it's used
to control robots it's used in IOT
Internet of Things Python is even used
in artificial intelligence AI Python is
key to that so it's likely that our
future overlords the AI will be written
in Python so that's one reason to learn
Python Python is actually used in gaming
as well it's used to create games it's
used to manage and control very complex
rendering apps rendering apps or apps
that process video that process 3d
animation it's used in movies and video
games Python is used to control these
apps because these rendering apps can be
very very complicated and it can be many
steps that they have to
configure so it's just easier to write
it to control these apps with Python
code Python is also used to create web
apps the biggest one I know of is
Instagram so Instagram was created with
Python so python is a great all-around
language easy to learn easy to read easy
to write it's using industry it's also
using science using science a lot of
scientists will use Python to process
all the information they get from all
their experiments so you can see when
you learn Python you'll be opening up
yourself to a whole range of
possibilities about what you can do with
these Python skills so this isn't just
not a programming language you learn in
school or you learn here and you'll
never use anywhere else in fact many
uses on top of that Python is from a
family of languages where it shares many
of the same principles and basic
techniques so when you learn how to do
things with Python you're going to learn
a lot about how to do those same things
in JavaScript and Java is Swift in
c-sharp and many other languages so the
great thing about learning Python you're
going to be learning a lot by default
about these other languages so that's
quite the reason to learn Python alright
that's enough for now in the next video
I'm going to give you even more details
about Python so we can start learning
this language quickly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
