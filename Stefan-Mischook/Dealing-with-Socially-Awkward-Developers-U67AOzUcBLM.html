answer question was put to me so you
have this guy who's got a computer
science degree it's been working in
industry for a couple years now and he's
frustrated because all his co-workers
are hardcore nerds who don't have
communication skills at least the
programmers around him I still let me
address this yes a lot of people who are
not necessarily the best communicators
very good at programming they're
attracted to that field so you're gonna
find a lot of these socially awkward
people because that's the way their
brains are made up there they're much
more inclined to programming and coding
than they are to social interactions
it's two different skill sets it's
interesting a friend of mine his kid has
autism and he's just like that he's
really good at math and numbers and
logic and he taught himself how to how
to do math at like 3 years old or
something and accelerator so he's really
good with that kind of work but he has a
lot of difficulty with just basic social
interactions that a lot of us take for
granted like knowing what they say he or
she knowing how to say hello and how to
greet people these are difficult things
for him he has to think about it I think
yes they consider it much in the same
way is the average Joe or Jane when
they're learning when you're writing
code they have to really think hard
about how do you approach this what do
you do because their brains again
they're not aligned towards coding and
people who are you know I hate the use
of it we're an autistic but at least in
that on that side of the fence if you
will on the autistic spectrum if you
will in a non-technical way they have
difficulty with communication so it's
very famous like an old skit in Saturday
Night Live very famous skit where the
Nerds are just really real really
really rude they don't necessarily mean
to be sometimes but they don't quite
understand it now this gets amplified
this gets amped up as nerds realize that
they have power because if you're really
the programmer you have a lot of power
within our organization so some of these
programmers will start to abuse it and
they'll start becoming even bigger well
I won't say a word but to become even
less socially capable if you will
because they know they have the power so
you have this guy who's got a brought
background on computer science but he's
considering do I really want to do this
do I want to hang out these people who
wants to have conversations with them
they they're not very good so my joke to
him was you have to talk about Star Wars
Star Trek and video games and Dungeons &amp;amp;
Dragons I hear you might you might
bridge some gaps test jogini aside she's
worrying about his career is wondering
maybe I can go to freelancing am I ready
to be a freelancer or for two years
experiences as a developer short answer
is probably you're probably more than
ready again the steps to becoming a
freelancer i've described before it
basically set up a website do some
projects freebies to get a track record
as our independent freelancer you're
likely gonna be working for small and
medium sized businesses which means
they're gonna be looking at your track
record now I assume that this guy who
emailed me a question with his
frustrations about dealing with the uber
nerds I assume that he's got decent
human occasion skills since he was
telling me how bad their skills were so
that's very good for a freelancer as
I've emphasized whether it be freelancer
or not but especially as a freelancer
one of the most important things you're
gonna have to develop is your ability to
communicate with people because you're
going to be communicating with people
were not developers or not coders so
you're gonna have to speak non nerd to
them within the context of working for
large organizations those people who can
who understand code and programming and
who can also communicate
they're rare individuals and you can
make really good money working within a
company being that person who basically
provides the interface who provides the
bridge of communication between the
Nerds and the suits the suits are the
business people so good friend of mine
works for one of the larger software
manufacturers in the world and that's
what he does he has a background in
software development he's a good
communicator so what he does is he
essentially sees the clients guess the
requirements figures out what they need
and he goes back to the software team
communicates those requirements in nerd
so that the Nerds can understand and he
provides that bridge communications
because if you had a hard core
programmers who have bad communication
skills and are rude you don't want to
put them in front of the client it's
right that could cause some problems so
that person who knows both worlds who
has both skill sets even if they're
moderate that important bridge between
the two worlds is a very valuable
position to be in so you might want to
consider that as well so yep some
software developers can have can be very
awkward happens quite a bit that it's
just that happens to be the way their
brain has developed that's why their
software developers likely if your
software developer a couple years
experience can you go freelance without
a doubt without a doubt and if you have
good communication skills even better as
a freelancer because so important I have
to tell you in terms of my mentors in
business I'll tell you something else
guys were fifty million hundred million
so forth
one consistency that they have is they
were very good communicators they are
always very good communicators different
styles but still very engaging so that's
an important skill as I said in other
videos in the world of IT as a developer
programmer coder you have to have your
chops as a coder but you also have to
have really good communication skills
verbal written ability to listen the
ability to to be humble in your
positions and that will take you
way in terms of your career I hope this
helps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
