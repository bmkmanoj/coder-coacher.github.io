the problem with web development in 2017
fortunately I have the experience of
experience going back to the 90s and the
problem today with web development is
the same problem we had in the 1990s
with Java so the problem is over
complexity we have people now coming up
with overly complex web frameworks or
app frameworks or app structures overly
complex server deployments overly
complex database design like for example
people are going oh my SQL is no good it
sucks we have can't use MySQL because we
have hundred thousand records a hundred
thousand records we cannot possibly use
MySQL it sucks
well first launch of thousand records is
like nothing nothing
second of all Facebook uses MySQL I
believe and then they'll go yeah the
Facebook does special things with MySQL
well you don't have Facebook right I
have been using MySQL of course they
used to use sequel server mysql Firebird
hours of fire basement so long and a few
others as well and guess what
unless you have one of these crazily
crazily successful apps that have huge
amount of users and a huge amount of
data or a huge amount of data you're not
going to need anything special in terms
of a database so when you are a
developer who is creating
the extra overhead of overly complex
structures in your data store in your
applications with this idea of some but
some spectacular growth will occur or
whatnot
you're just adding a huge amount of time
and headache
expensive the project that need not be
there because because if the company
starts to really grow and there's a lot
of demand then you will find me a time
and you have the ability to make the
switch over if you design your apps
properly from the beginning you won't
have a huge difficulty in swapping out
an aspect of your app that is not
performant enough given your needs but
guess what I am convinced that
99.999999% of the apps that you're going
to create will never come close to
stressing a basic PHP 7 MySQL server
combination on a shared hosting program
at $5.99 a month $5.99 a month so that's
pretty much it ciao oh one last thing
Montreal is now in early March minus 22
degrees out there with the wind shield
let me tell you California seems very
attractive to me right now
just saying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
