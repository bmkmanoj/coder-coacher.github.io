what we're doing is we're just building
up a very simple wordpress template from
scratch so far we've only got two very
simple files if I go to the file system
here I'm using my finder and I go to
WordPress and I go to WP content under
themes my template you'll see that we
just have a style dot CSS file and an
index dot PHP file and with those two
files we've managed to create all this
and we've got an older entry section so
we've got a proper loop with different
levels of pages we've got top-level
navigation and we've got ourselves a
nice little sidebar which we did in the
last video so the next step is going to
be to separate this out and to clean up
our files a little bit and make that
index dot PHP file a little less scary
because right now it's getting a little
large it's almost 81 lines of code so we
can actually trim this down first thing
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a new
file and I'm gonna hit save so I did
file new text document and I'm just
gonna hit save and then in my template
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna write
header.php now WordPress knows that
header got pH P corresponds with the
header next thing I'm gonna do is I'm
going to take the index.php file and i'm
gonna take everything in the header tag
and op so all of this everything after
the navigation and the closing div of
header and I'm just gonna hit cut and
then I'm going to paste it into here and
I'm gonna hit save and I'm gonna hit
save here now if i refresh this page I'm
gonna lose everything in my header but
don't worry we can get it back by just
going and creating a new PHP tag here
and saying get underscore header and
then the closing PHP tag and then
WordPress knows that it's looking for a
header dot PHP and it'll find it
and there you go the next thing I want
to do is I want to pull out this sidebar
so to do that again I'm just gonna hit
cut and I'm gonna open another PHP tag
and I'm gonna say get underscore sidebar
and I'm gonna close my PHP tag and hit
save then I'm gonna create a new file
and then paste in my sidebar make sure
it's properly indented and hit save and
I'm gonna call this sidebar dot PHP and
if i refresh this nothing should happen
but if I go back to my index dot PHP
file it's starting to look a lot cleaner
all we have now is the content and the
footer well we don't have much of a
footer yet but now I'm much more
inclined to create a footer because
everything else is a lot less
complicated I'm also going to change my
indenting a little bit but we'll get the
footer in first so as part of the footer
I'm just gonna say create a new div and
I'm gonna call this class footer and you
can do a lot with a footer but in our
purpose for our purposes I'm just going
to say in small text this theme was made
by me and a paragraph tag and if i
refresh it at the bottom it just says it
up very simply we also might want to
give a little bit of credit to the fine
folks at WordPress that have built this
wonderful blogging and content
management system so I'm going to create
another paragraph here with a class and
I'm gonna call this Thanks and here I'm
just going to say that
this vlog is proudly powered by
WordPress
and if you wanted to thank me
you could also do that here but anyways
so now if I hit save and i refresh it
we've got this blog is proudly powered
by WordPress and this theme was made by
me we don't want we don't want these
things necessarily to be very large but
we can just style them very easily
first off by giving our footer a height
let's say 70 pixels
we'll give this maybe a dark gray will
specify a certain color and I'm gonna
say that the footer paragraphs should be
eight-point and lastly that there should
be a padding of maybe 20 pixels maybe 20
pixels too much 10 pixels and that links
should be also white and I don't think
we need that small tag so I'm gonna get
rid of that since we're already styling
it using CSS and you could put any other
kind of information that you wanted here
of course great I'm just going to
combine these two
and the last thing I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna Center my text so in my
paragraph here I'm gonna say
text-align:center great that looks like
a footer now just like we removed our
sidebar and we removed our header I'm
gonna take this section and everything
at the bottom I'm just gonna hit cut I'm
gonna open another PHP tag and I'm gonna
say get footer hit save create a new
file paste it in hit save and footer dot
PHP so we've gone from two files to five
files we've got our header our footer
our index our sidebar and our style and
if i go back and i refresh nothing has
changed however we've separated things
out so they're very clean and they're
easily available to wordpress the other
advantage is that if i go to design now
and I go to my theme editor I can see
that the footer and the header are all
readily available to make changes
personally I wouldn't make changes this
way since sometimes the formatting
doesn't necessarily work out and all of
that
however it's refreshing that you can
easily direct your clients or if you
need a last-minute change to be made you
can just direct them to this page and
they can edit it using the theme editor
in the next video we're gonna be looking
at how we can create specialized pages
for things like the page versus the post
so when I click on about I might not
want it to be styled the same way as a
blog post we're gonna do that thanks a
lot for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
