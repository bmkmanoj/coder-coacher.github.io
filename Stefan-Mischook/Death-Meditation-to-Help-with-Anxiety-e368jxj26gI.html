authors we studied I was a major in
psychology also the University excuse me
it was this guy named Becker it was an
important book to me because it talked
about this theory where the author put
forth the idea that all fears all
anxieties actually are rooted in our
fear of our rather fear of death but
when it comes down to is if you can at
least reduce your fear of dying a little
bit for a lot because it's something
happens to everybody what will happen is
a kind of it will free you of emotional
hang-ups it will make you more confident
more relaxed in your day to day life
because ultimately if you're not too
scared of dying then you know public
speaking or going for a job or starting
a business or learning how to code all
these things become pretty pretty easy
they become pretty trivial I went
through this when I was about 18 or 19
where I got a blood disease and it
almost killed me and I was on heavy
heavy medications and steroids for about
a year over a year so it was always
looming over me this idea where I could
spontaneously bleed in a brain or
something and you go through all those
psychological steps especially when
you're 18 and 19 but what that did is
that I don't really have much of a fear
of dying today and so I'm pretty relaxed
about just about anything I do wake up
if you I do have some anxieties here and
there but much much much much much less
and I used to have that's for sure
we can't all go through life-threatening
experiences of course but there is
something in Buddhism and it's called
the death meditation de ATH meditation
and what it is is a very deep meditation
where you go into your mind and you
imagine your own death it sounds really
freaked out but what this does is it
slowly slowly slowly of every meditation
it gets you used to the idea and it's
more better and I must say we're looking
forward to it or anything but what it
does is it helps to slowly reduce your
stress and that's the whole point the
whole point of it is to try to reduce
your the underlying root of all your
anxieties if you can get rid of this
according to Becker if you hear it is a
lot of your fears will just fade or at
least diminish quite a bit so it's
something to consider I know it's weird
for a tech channel and a business
channel being in emotional control it's
a very important part about being
successful in career and business and in
life and if you can eliminate fears and
anxieties that many times are just
irrational then you'd be much better off
you'll be much more effective as a
developer to be much more effective as a
negotiator you'd be much more effective
in your day to day life so works for me
