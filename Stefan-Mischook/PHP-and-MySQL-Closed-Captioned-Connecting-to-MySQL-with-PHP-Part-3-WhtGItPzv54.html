so let's look at the next line of this
so we have an if statement here and
again we use the my connection here and
what this if statement does is allow us
to check whether or not we've
successfully connect to the database so
we can see whether or not we need we
want to proceed so I use the not
operator here ! so basically this if
statement saying if not my connection
this is probably returning true or false
oh this is false if for some reason
mysql and PHP rather was not able to
connect to mysql but I perhaps you had a
long wrong address or password or
username whatever if this is turns out
to be the fact what you were not able to
connect the dye function will be called
now the dye function basically just
stops the PHP script in its tracks none
of this stuff will get processed so
that's what diet does shuts everything
down and then this first argument of die
basically sends a message to the page it
princess to the page and then you have
the MySQL error this is another function
that basically calls the last error that
PHP has fired off to us so in this case
it would be some error with regards to
why we weren't able to connect so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to change
the user to ruta because I know about
user doesn't exist and we're going to
launch the script and we're going to
watch the error we're going to see the
dye work and we're going to see what the
error is
and here we go morning mysql underscore
connect error access denied for user
root of MU cohoes password no ok so let
me explain access denied I think that's
pretty obvious and saying for user
saying we're trying to use the root user
Ruta from the local host right we
specified localhost here right and
Edward this is an interesting one right
rather using password no this is
basically telling us that we're not
actually using a password and that's why
it says know if for instance I go here
and I put a password like this just a
fake password a tree lodge using
password yes so this is this PHP telling
us that we attempted to use a password
that's all that is if we go back to our
code we take out the password say that
refresh using password del the reason
I'm I'm paying attention to this i'm
pointing themselves because I can
guarantee you that when you get into
your actual PHP work and you're
connecting to databases you're going to
get errors and this is one of the errors
one of the things and the errors you're
going to get and now you know what it
means so all this stuff again this
repetative tells you where this is
happening on what line and tells us the
message here again and again the reasons
not able to can actually could not
connect access denied so that basically
tells us we did talk to the mysql
database the mysql database is ok what
user we said user Ruta and mysql set now
we deny that user access why we know why
because there's no root user come see
there is no root user so we go back i
change this to root i press save go back
to the page we refresh and we can see
the message is connected successfully so
let me go back to code so you can take
another look at that
so if we go back to our if contar if
statement so if we didn't get a
connection the dye error comes up dye is
called it means the script is not
processed could not connect my school
error is generated using this function
of course otherwise if this is false
this gets skipped and we echo out
connected successfully and then finally
we close the connection and that's what
we have here
one thing I want to point out actually
so let me let me make that mistake again
i was called routine now i want to show
it i want to demonstrate how if you look
at our page here you see how all this
Texas print print it out and if we go
back to our page you know this is all
the text right in the body now let's
demonstrate once again how'd I stops the
page from being processed so I'll just I
switch this user name to rooty again so
we have an error now let me just refresh
you notice we have the error but we've
got no other text in the page so
effectively as we would expect PHP
killed the page with the die here so
none of this stuff got printed out so
think about that when you're using die
you don't have to use just you could use
die not just with database stuff you can
do it all over the place if you want
it's just it's a way to terminate the
script from being process if some error
should occur
one last thing I want to do is I want to
show you a different error message and
the reason I want to show you a
different error message because when
you're learning to program it's always
important to pay attention to error
messages so especially in the early days
when you learning to do stuff and you
get stuff working i would suggest
breaking things once in a while breaking
the code just to see if the error
messages because after a while knowing
and understanding error messages will
play a big role in terms of you being
able to debug thing because you're going
to start getting an intuition about it
you're going to get experience you're
going to read these cryptic error
messages and if you've seen them before
it would be a lot easier for you to
track down your problems so let's now
change the address and see if anything
else happens to be honest if I forget if
we get a different error message as you
can see here we got a different error
message unknown mysql server host
localhost p right i change the you
recall the script here i change the
address right and of course our message
has changed could not connect unknown
mysql server and this is the host
meaning the address so basically this
error message is telling us that well we
weren't even able to find the mysql
server so you can see how we have had
two different error messages as a result
or two different problems right the
first problems that we we actually just
put in the wrong username and the second
problem we just saw is we put in the
wrong address so we can see the first I
registers you got a bad user name the
second error message was we can't even
find your server so this could be very
important to understand these things so
that when you're debugging things you
know where to go in terms of how to fix
your problem
okay so far we've connected to the
database we put in some error handling
here meaning we've caught any errors
that might occur this is sort of a
standard affair and all this kind of
stuff and we've closed the connection
but we haven't really done anything with
the connections we connected to the
database itself so we've connected to
the database on our local host the PHP
my admin not scuze me database and
locals but we haven't connected to the
actual database itself so let me back up
we've connected to the database server
on the locals remember my SQL server has
a whole bunch of databases in it where
we can put as many as we want that's
called a database server so the code
that we've seen here is basically
connecting us to that server on the
local host but we haven't really
connected to any particular database and
in this case we want to connect a killer
so once again MySQL excuse me PHP
provides code that allows us to connect
to a database and that code is of course
this function MySQL select DB it has one
argument and that's the name of the
database you want to connect to and
since we want to connect a killer killer
we just specify that in the function
again we're not going to see anything
but I just say that and we're not going
to see any errors but we just run it
anyway and we've connected successfully
and we've connected of course we've we
selected the database a killer so now
with all this said and done we can be
ready now to insert in here our actual
code that will interact with the
database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
