footer and how we can get this value to
look the way we wanted to and get our
rapper to wrap around everything inside
here so in essence what we'll need to do
is return to our CSS style sheet and
just going to clean this a little bit
and what we're going to do is to
introduce our selector called footer and
with this selector in place we will now
be able to come in here and add some
information that will help us the first
thing we need to do is to well maybe
I'll copy the background color that we
were using inside the header so I'll
just come in here and will say yes use
the same one do I need to give it a
value in terms of width no it's block
level elements so it's going to stretch
out for the exact 960 of the container
so that's perfect we don't need to worry
about that if you had some kind of
background image that you wanted to
introduce that was a specific height
then certainly yes you could give it a
height value but in this case I don't
really need any of that information so
I'm going to keep it pretty simple the
only other thing that I do want to be
doing is probably the most important and
that is to get it so that it's always
underneath the two floating elements
that are above it and the means of doing
so is by coming in here and introducing
clear both and basically what that does
is exactly what you would imagine it
clears both of the floating elements on
top forcing the footer always underneath
it so let's command s and save this and
now when we go back to Safari and
refresh our browser aha there you go
we've got the color on the footer so
that you could see exactly what it is
and where it is and you can see that
that's working out just fine and our
rapper now contains everything we've got
white in the areas where we need white
and this is pretty much exactly the way
I would have wanted it to look so we've
got our footer in place we've got all of
our other
and other elements in place as well now
let's go about styling the information
so that it looks a little bit better and
can actually be used in an in a real
world situation and scenario the only
other thing that I would need to also
explain to you is how if we wanted to
introduce a yet another value over here
another column turn this two column
layout into say a three-column layout
then we would do so just quite simply by
introducing another div in this area and
we would be floating that information on
the right-hand side now in order to show
you that I think I'll just run through a
little bit of that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
