killer sites calm that's it's me right
here if you want to know uh I was
recently emailed a question people are
asking about joomla and drupal and
they're seeing you know the basic
question rather was what's the future of
dreamweaver you know and the implication
was well drupal and dreamweaver and
other CMS's and blog software make web
design software like dreamweaver you
know out of date will these things
become unimportant it's pretty good
question because a lot of web
development these days is being done
with blogs of CMS is because of all the
advantages and I've if you've been
following me I've been a big proponent
of WordPress based web design you know
you can apply that to any blog really if
you choose to prefer joomla go joomla of
your preferred roopal go with true pal i
happen to be a wordpress guy simply
because of you know it's ubiquitous it
everywhere are tons of themes out there
and tons of plugins but that's another
video so the big question is is a web
designer software web design software
like dreamweaver are these things going
the way of the wagon wheel because of
blogs I think not I think they're less
important than they used to be in the
90s and that has a lot to do with the
fact that the web design technology out
there the basic stuff the HTML and the
CSS and the JavaScript has become much
more sophisticated much more refined and
easier to work with you see the old web
design software lecturing Weaver really
made it easy to deal with all the
headaches in the lack of efficiency if
you will in you know HTML as it was the
three-point old days and old CSS and so
on where you have to do table based
design
kind of stuff which was really a code
heavy these days web design is much less
heavy on code and images and much
heavier on tour in terms of
sophistication in terms of understanding
of the technologies these days web
designers have to spend more time
understanding the underlying principles
of what makes a web page that means
understanding HTML well understanding
CSS well understanding a little bit of
PHP a little bit of JavaScript so a lot
of the heavy lifting but we need a
dreamweaver to do another web design
software is now gone that said there's
still place for Dreamweaver if you like
that kind of stuff the WYSIWYG software
which is what you see is what you get
that's what that's what was he week
stands for firms for information for
instance the cs5 or version of
dreamweaver actually does contain a lot
of tools built into it specifically for
wordpress editing and i think in our
video store here we have it yet
dreamweaver in wordpress so we have an
actual course it teaches that and you
see it provides a lot of functionality
again it speeds up the process makes it
easier for you to build out weird
wordpress themes when you use
dreamweaver cs5 is it absolutely
necessary no this is speed things up yes
and this goes with everything else will
you be writing your straight static web
pages meaning pages that you know are
HTML pages i don't have dynamic elements
to it or you're writing are you building
out drupal or joomla based sites and
wordpress of course so this dream weaver
finish is Drupal and Joomla a future and
Dreamweaver the past not so much
although I do sing think though that you
know modern web design is going to be
it's going to lean towards eventually
95% if not higher
of all websites are going to be based on
a blog or a or a CMS a content
management basis of my drupal joomla so
you know when I concentrate on learning
dreamweaver or learning drupal you know
again dreamweaver could be a good way to
deepen your knowledge and understanding
of web design in general because of all
the tips and and automation tools that
they provide but it's you know again
it's not absolutely necessary well
during weaver be replaced finally
because everybody's using blogs and CMS
is no not totally replaced but greatly
diminished I believe greatly diminished
so it really depends on the type of work
you want to do and it depends on what
skill level you're at if you're less
skilled you have less of a knowledge in
the basics of web design again as HTML
CSS JavaScript PHP or even you have very
little knowledge or less of a knowledge
of WordPress something like dreamweaver
cs5 and up I would imagine will speed up
the process for you and help you to
build better sites in the end but again
like anybody else as you become more of
an expert in the field it will lose its
status to a certain extent that's it
this is my screencast and I hope you
found it useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
