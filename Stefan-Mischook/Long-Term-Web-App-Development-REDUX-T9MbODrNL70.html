maintaining and developing an app for
the long term this is something I
believe a lot of developers are not
involved with they may build something
and walk away or they may be dropped
into something and work on it for a
short period of time well let's talk
about developing an app for the long
term where you first conceived of the
idea of your app and I'm gonna talk
about Web Apps but it goes with any type
of app really so you first come up with
the big idea and you start the
implementation of that idea so you put
it out there you build your app and if
you're a smart developer you put it out
there very quickly Minimum Viable
Product as they say in the startup
community of course any entrepreneur
with any experience going back well me
it's you know 25 30 years ago will tell
you MVP Minimum Viable Product is the
new buzz word used in the startup
community but any experienced business
person will know that that's how you get
a product out as quickly and as cheaply
as possible to see whether or not it's
gonna work so you get your product out
and lo and behold you find out you know
what there's something here we're
getting some interest we're getting a
couple clients people are signing up but
what you're also going to find out is
that you can have a lot of work to do in
terms of refinement so you you find out
that your core idea this is a success
your core idea for your app is actually
viable it works but what you're going to
find out is there's all kinds of things
about it need to be changed
updated replaced etc etc so as the
lifespan of your app your service
continues as it continues to develop
what you're going to likely be doing is
removing features on a regular basis
adding new features refining features
there's going to be a lot of work in
terms of UX and maybe UI as well but UX
user experience in terms of how the app
flows so you
you have to have in place from the
get-go a very light wake a very light
weight UX framework something that is
not bound and not hard to update so
that's a key thing about that you have
to expect you're going to be making many
many changes because as your users start
using your app or your service they're
going to give you valuable feedback and
you're going to find out all the things
that were wrong and I've been through
this process a few times in my career
with my own apps where that exactly this
exactly happened didn't happen just once
it happened three or four times so I can
tell you from experience but this is the
way it goes
it's a constant process of refinement
it's a constant process of being willing
to forego let go of ideas that you
thought were great and then adopting new
ideas based on a consensus view from
your user base you have to be careful to
not jump every time a user would like
something if you do that it's going to
be like a homer mobile meaning you're
going to have an app with so many
features and they're gonna be such a
mess and that nobody is gonna want to
use it but if you find you're getting
consensus from several of your users
especially important users then you can
make those wise decisions about what to
implement and when so a big part of this
process is to have somebody at the helm
if you will somebody who's not deep in
the code but understands code an
architect somebody who can step back and
look at the big picture this is a very
important thing when you don't have
somebody at the helm that captain
steering that ships during the
development of your app ship it's gonna
go all over the place it's gonna be a
mess I can tell you that from experience
so when you first develop your app and
you get it out there and you get good
reaction from people and it starts
building and when you can you got it if
you can you have to extricate yourself
from the daily daily coding because the
daily coding makes you very myopic like
with the blinders and here's gonna be
hard for you to see that big picture and
to be able to look at it dispassionately
and I think that's one of the reasons
why Steve Jobs are effective with his
product development because he wasn't a
coder and he had just a superficial
understanding of the technology but as a
result of that he was able to look at
the product with non nerd eyes he was
able to look at it from a user who was
not a nerd because when your nerd or
your deep in the code or deep into the
engineering of an app you kind of lose
touch with that ease-of-use aspect or
you know you kind of lose touch with the
app from the point of view of the user
and you get into it too deep and you're
in you're you're you're not a good judge
about what will make the app I'm good
from users point of view so again that's
why it's important about you as a
product owner you have to detach
yourself from the development process I
mean getting deep into the code once in
a while I will do it just to make sure
everything is cool and there's a balance
there to be had I suppose but at the end
of the day it's been super valuable for
me to pull back and just concentrate in
terms of user point of view and also
general architecture because when you
start understanding how your users are
going to use your app and if you
understand code you understand
architecture you will be able to predict
more accurately how the main
infrastructure of your app will have to
be developed and terms of database
structures in terms of arm layers and so
forth based on how you see or how you
perceive the app will be used in the
future by a lot of users all right I
hope this is makes some sense you guys
this is a high level coders of vlog if
you will where I'm leaning on you know
I've been doing this since the nineties
so I'm giving you some insight here in
terms of what I've learned over last two
over two decades I guess and it's not
just my own experience experience of
many of my friends
and so people I know and people have met
and even people like for instance I
first experienced not not first but I
remember speaking to somebody at a
wedding who happen to work at Microsoft
and he was one of the programmers on the
word project Microsoft Word and he was
telling me about what they were doing
internally it was really interesting
because word is such a huge program and
I was asking him you know why is word
you know mm you know five times the
sizes word 1995 envelope of features and
the capabilities of the app or you know
pretty similar and he got into all that
and he was telling me about how these
things were developed as fascinating to
QV stores but I'm gonna have to leave
that to another vlog if people ask work
alright bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
