this vlog I just want to quickly talk
about code editors code editors which
are the key tools of any developer
regardless of the language PHP or web
stack HTML CSS JavaScript Python Java
whatnot at some point you're gonna have
to get into a code editor in the code of
terror the code editor is something you
should learn after you've done your
basic so if you've done my baek's of
course on PHP or JavaScript or whatever
once you've done the very basics you see
you got your head wrapped around the
base of concepts then it's time to look
at a proper code editor for whatever
language you happen to want to
specialize in at that time so I'm gonna
offer some suggestions which I think are
the best in the these various languages
now depending on what coder you speak to
you're going to get different opinions
but this is just my opinion you could
check it out a lot of the chlorinators
is really good but some are really
exceptional though okay so if you're
getting into the web stack HTML and CSS
and JavaScript my choice would be
sublime text sublime text you there is a
nag where version where you can use it
for free but every five or six save or
something every time you save it will
say you should buy it I mean you just
press ok or to cancel and you just keep
going but at some point if you become a
professional developer you get your
first gig you should buy it I think it's
like 50 bucks or something it's really
worth it it's a it's a bit a little bit
to learn sublime it's not super obvious
so you have to lose some tutorials or
something or just read the dachshund but
it's really designed by developers who
will want to be very productive it's
going to help you to write code so much
more quickly and easily it's going to
correct things for you it's really good
in terms of Python programming
I would suggest pycharm by JetBrains now
there are others out there but jetbrains
is accompanying I know from the past I
first learned of them back in I guess
late 90s or early 2000s I think a late
90s
with a product called IntelliJ for Java
which was a killer a killer Java editor
and prior to that I forget what I was
using but I remember in my Java career I
was one of these pure so would just
write my Java code and no Pat and I
think I was tough you know all right I'm
doing a notepad and I didn't it was fine
and I did for a few years and notepad
but then I finally broke down so okay
I'm gonna try developer tools and I
ended up with IntelliJ by JetBrains for
Java and it was huge because it does the
code completion and refactoring support
it just speeds up the whole thing it
reduces bugs it just it's such an
important tool and especially once you
have your basics down you can write code
whatever the language products I can
tell a Jake they have cool completions
and hinting so they'll be able to help
you learn the language as you go along
because they're going to point you to
libraries and correct you along the way
to a certain extent it's kind of like
having a tutor to a certain extent so
it's really really a good tool so for
Java IntelliJ tell Agyei this by
jetbrains for python IntelliJ as well
PyCharm highly regarded for PHP again
intelligent again I would go with that
what do they call phpstorm bye-bye
IntelliJ now sublime text as I mentioned
before for the web stack they can do
Python and PHP and I believe Java as
well and they could do it pretty good
but not like you know code editors and
full-blown IDE integrated development
environments like like intelligent
provides for Java Python PHP it's a
whole different level it's a whole
different level so I highly recommend I
know that IntelliJ and I'm not it's not
sponsored posts I don't talk to these
guys I don't know these guys so this is
not a sponsored post I don't know these
guys I'm gonna talk to these guys but
it's just great products I have to I
have to give my thumbs up it's more it's
for you guys that's supporting them and
supporting you guys I want you guys to
be able to
- do you have a cold effectively they
just make really good products and other
other ones out there pretty cool but
those as far as I understand from my own
experience or that they were the best
and for my hair there's still the best
so it's up to you sorry for the exposure
changes the brightness of the video
because the Sun keeps coming in and out
and I want to punch the Sun but anyway
that's it for this vlog ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
