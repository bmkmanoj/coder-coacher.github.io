killer or sites calm in this quick
little video blog I want to just give
you heads up on my new web developer of
scratch video tutorial course you can
check it out at killer video store com
web developer and what's significant
about this course is that it basically
provides everything that you need in a
nice package to learn how to become a
productive commercial web developer or
another words web programmer it has over
sixty three hours of training video and
actually combines the content from two
other packages that I have at our very
popular the complete web designer and
the complete web programmer so in the
web developer from scratch you have both
packages combined into one mega package
and you get a nice discount with it and
there you go simple video this is what
are very few and rare commercial videos
I'm doing video blogs I I apologize but
I some people might be interested it's a
great price it's a great deal here's a
couple of little screenshots apples and
some of the things you were building in
the web designer package and so you got
you know cover all kinds of stuff from
beginners web design and html5 css3
jquery dreamweaver cs6 CSS layout slew
CSS liz photoshop for the web HTML forms
each to our list horizontal list with
CSS sprites then you learn PHP mysql and
PHP and you learn to build petrie my
shopping cart with although p and then
we have beginners javascript because
jquery PHP cruddud pagination PHP login
system these are some of the project
based courses so you were now to be able
to how to do PHP crud operations and
here's the PHP login project the PHP tag
cloud PHP olpe discussions PHP login
using old p and n
and you get the idea so there's a lot of
content like I said 63 hours nearly
sixty four hours of content and it's all
in a big package a great thing about the
package it's ordered and structured for
you so it makes it easy to learn this
stuff and if you have any questions you
can always reach out to me and we have
our web developer forms as well so you
can also use that that's pretty much it
I've that's it that's it for now and if
you have the questions feel free to ask
I'm gonna have a little bit more
commentary more video blogs I'm just
busy with new content and muscle I'm
actually writing a book now so for a
major publisher so halfway done so
that's been taking up a lot of my time
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
