killer sights killer PHP and other sites
in this video tutorial I'm going to
answer a question that was recently put
to me what is the best type of computer
setup for web design and web programming
so let's cut to the chase I think the
best way to go is to get an SSD laptop
that's a solid state drive laptop and if
you can afford it then you get yourself
an external monitor so as an example we
just launched this particular photo so
if somebody picked up now you don't have
to go Mac a little Mac is pretty cool
but here you see external monitor and
you got your laptop so why do you want
to have a laptop an external monitor why
not you get a desktop well because you
want that flexibility with the external
monitor especially if you get a high res
monitor like a 2k display now and we're
now April 2014 salvos will go PS six to
eight hundred dollars depending on
particular version a lot of Mac ones
going to be about a thousand yeah the
reason you want big 2k display that you
can connect your laptop to is that you
get that huge screen real estate which
is really nice to work with on top of
that you can unlike in this photo you
can actually open up this laptop screen
and have two screens going and that's
very very useful when you're doing any
type of web design or programming work
it's very useful when you're doing
spreadsheet work it's just great any
other reason you want the laptop is
because just in case if you're a
contractor you can go see clients with
it if you don't feel like working in a
particular room you can move to another
room this is so flexible so why SSD
drive these days that's the bottleneck
in computer speed the drive the hard
drive not too CPU everybody talks about
processor and CPU let me say you know
how fastest is the CPU well when it
comes to web design programming
and 99% of computer work CPUs are so
fast today that you shouldn't really
take a sec you don't I don't ever take a
look at them to be honest with you
they're just so fast these days so even
a moderate weak wimpy CPU is going to be
plenty fast for your web design and
programming needs even for a lot of your
Photoshop works because when you're
doing Photoshop work for a web for
screen graphics you don't need much
horsepower because screen images are
very light right there are only you know
72 dpi they're not these big 300 dpi
images that you need for printing so
yeah so the key to speed in modern
computers is the SSD drive and in fact
I'll never go back to a non SSD drive
now but I switched over a few years ago
I initially did it with the MacBook Air
I think that's one right here in the
picture and then I got a windows-based
SSD Drive I'll show you in a second
oh yeah this is it this is actually a
couple years old I don't know if you can
see the screen look how thin it is and
this is a Windows 7 machine and this is
a couple years old I bought this 2012
2011 it's a great computer it's a great
computer but the newer ones are even
greater now besides the fact that
they're super thin and look good in your
life easy and move around because it's
SSD drive solid-state drive it's super
fast and that's something a lot of
people are not aware of in terms of your
day-to-day operations of your computer
again the bottleneck is the hard drive
because the computer is always seeking
information your hard drive opening
emails it's going a hard drive you're
opening up a web page it's going a hard
drive you're opening up a text file it's
going to hard drive you're opening up an
application it's going a hard drive hard
drive writing and reading that's called
the the i/o is constant when you're
using a computer so the SSD drivers is
something like ten thousand times faster
in terms of its initial read and write
its reading
of information from disk so it just
makes the computer so much faster than
zip here and the boot time is incredibly
fast even with my two year old Samsung
SSD based computer the laptop it boots
in Windows seven and nine seconds
code it's super fast it restarts in you
know eight seconds or seven seconds I
haven't time to recently so that ability
of the computer to move super quickly is
you're going to love it you're going to
love it so yeah so if you get the SSD
based laptop an external monitor to hook
it up so you get that big presence
that's the ideal computer setup for web
programming and web design I hope you
found it useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
