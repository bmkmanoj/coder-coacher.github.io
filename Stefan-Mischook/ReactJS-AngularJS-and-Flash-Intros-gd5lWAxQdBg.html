with killer sites amongst other sites so
this V blog is going to get many nerds
at least summoners kind of angry and
it's called angularjs react yes and
flash intros so let me give you a bit of
history so everybody remembers flash
maybe flash was you know animation
technology you would do flash apps and
you slash leave via on the web and in
2000 and I don't know what it was eight
or something or seven Steve Jobs
effectively killed flash and Flash's
pretty much no more but let me roll back
many many many years back in the late
90s when flash really got really popular
for a while well got popular for a long
while but that's where it really jumped
ahead and in the old days something
became very popular flash something
called the flash intro and what it was
is just when you hit a website you would
have this big flash movie or
presentation would appear with
animations all those kind of stuff just
kind of like a an opening credits or
opening television commercial type of
deal and that was what a flash intro was
not a problem with the flash intro is
that everybody just decided that you
know we need a flash intro so when I was
at that point with Studio web at that
time this is like in 98 or 97 or
something like that maybe 99 anyway
everybody was doing flash intros nobody
knew exactly why you should do flash
intros they all said well that's what
you need you need a flash intro that's
what everybody said and so when I would
I had my web development studio and I
would approach clients and they say okay
we gotta put in a flashy intro and again
the clients would go what's that and I
said well I explained what it wise no
okay I guess that's what we do that's
what you do you put in a flash intro so
every website in the world and everybody
amount of websites out there had
flashing chills because that's what you
have to have you have to have flash
intros and that's for like a couple
years something like that
and
then what people started discovering is
that nobody really liked flashing trolls
in terms of people videos visiting
websites and there's the second most
clicked button on the web was skip intro
that's what you always had I was like
the design pattern you would have your
flash intro and you have the ability to
skip intro you click a button and you
would pass all the stupid animations and
you go to the real site and so but we
discovered again in time but the skip
intro button was the second most click
button on the web the number one button
was the back button on the browser
number two was to skip intro so you know
slowly slowly everybody start realizing
but the flash intro was just a big waste
of time and money since nobody wanted to
watch flash intros so let's fast-forward
to react Jas and angularjs now I'm not
saying react and angularjs are as bad as
flash intros actually they could be very
useful tools all trying to say is that
before you jump into using flash react
GS or angular really decide if you
really need it if it serves a purpose to
go through the trouble of using react or
using angular remember these tools were
designed for specific purposes and the
first is with react yes it was designed
by Facebook because of what Facebook
needed to do on their site what they
needed to do on Facebook does that mean
that you need to do all that kind of
stuff on Facebook consider that before
you get into the extra work and headache
of putting in and learning react Jaya
same thing with angular do you mean do
you really need angularjs for your site
to work well you know this is a big
question that you're gonna ask yourself
with any technology you should ask
yourself do you need it for your site or
are you just putting in because you're
told you've been told by the Nerds out
there that you're needed this is again
this is something I've seen over and
over again I've been coding since 1994
you have to think about whether or not
you need
technology because you're going to
remember whether it be a programming
language or a JavaScript library like
react and an angular or anything you
have to think about whether or not you
need it to get the job of the site done
because you always want to stress
simplicity in your website your web apps
and your mobile apps go for simplicity
that is the difference the big
difference one of the big differences
between a great coder and a coder is is
the great coder strips out all the
unnecessary stuff and concentrates on
delivering a product that works and it's
extremely simple in terms of its code
base extremely simple in terms of how it
works and how easy it is it is to use
let me tell you whether it be writing a
book or writing magazine articles which
I've done both whether it be a coding
design whether you know designing
beautiful pages and layouts and UIs or
whether it be martial arts which I did
for 25 30 years simplicity is the hard
part that's what separates the true
masters from the pretenders the Masters
can get the job done very quickly very
easily and very simply the best coders
when I look at code the best coder
produce simple easy to understand code
when I have when I'm mentoring my coders
up and getting them up in terms of their
skillset
I'm always stressing that simplify that
called simplify that function simplify
that object simplify that method
simplify simplify and you should be able
to look at a page of code should look at
a structure of your app and she better
just visually check it out and you
should be able to figure out what's
going on pretty quickly without having
to dig if your code is so complex that
you can't remember what you're doing six
months later or you get a guy who's
pretty good coder and he can't figure
out or she can't figure out what you
were trying to do and how you were
trying to do it with relative ease then
your code needs work that's all I gotta
say so there you go the whole point
about
mentioning Flash intros is we're talking
about not introducing technology not
introducing elements into your sites
into your apps unless they're necessary
that's my tip for today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
