into code and we're going to learn a
little bit more about functions we're
going to get deeper into functions and
well but will get the covers I have some
notes here we're going to learn about
creating our own custom functions we're
going to learn how it functions hold
code in stasis until we activate it and
that the process of activating a
function if you will is called calling
functions we're going to matter it's
it's it sounds more complex than it
really is we're going to look at
function returns and how to pass data
from one function to another basically
passing data has to do with function
arguments I think we've we've looked at
that in the past so we're going to learn
how to do this with our own custom
functions and we're going to get a
better idea of what it's all about
really and finally we're going to look
at variables and functions scope this is
something we have not discussed before
and it's kind of important to understand
along the way we'll probably learn a few
more things and yeah so break out your
text editor and get ready to write some
JavaScript code
so we are looking at our very familiar
script here I think I think we did this
in the arrays videos any help so we've
seen this before and these source files
of course are included in the source
files directory if you're looking for it
so the first thing I want to teach you
is the idea of separating your
JavaScript code from your body code the
body code meaning the code in between
the body and the body tags at the bottom
of the page here let me just get that
interview so the idea here is to you
want to remove and separate your
JavaScript from your main body code so
I'm just going to copy that out and you
want to put it in the head here there
you go and the reason you want to do
this it's always just a good idea to
keep your JavaScript outside of the main
action here in the body this is a lot
like CSS where you don't want to have
your JavaScript code in the body of your
web page and like CSS you can insert it
up here in between your head tags or you
can actually link to an external
javascript file just like you would
explain to an external CSS document I'm
going to show you how to do that later
on but for now just keep that in mind
you want to keep your JavaScript code as
much as possible separate from your HTML
code that you see in the body here
so the first thing we're going to do
we're going to create a custom function
for itself and that's that's pretty easy
so I'm just going to take this i'm going
to dent it a little bit make it cleaner
i'm going to just write the work
function i'm going to give it in a name
i want to call it products array all
right yeah i'll give it a better name
i'll call product list that's a little
bit more user-friendly so you got the
two round rackets and we get to curly so
i'm going to take the curlies just like
in his statement or a loop take one put
on the bottom here so this curly brace
and this curly brace de marks the
beginning in the end of this particular
function and the function packages up
all this javascript code and one neat
package so now we could use this code
over and over again by simply calling
this function so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to show you how to call
functions but before we do that let me
just say that I'm a load up the page now
here is our page load it up pre pre
functionalizing it so what I mean by
functionalizing is sticking it in a
function this is how our code if you
loaded up the page it immediately print
up the array right because when you have
this Co floating around this for loop
printed up whatever was in this array we
got it here but by sticking it in a
function now now that is in a function
this code will not be activated will not
be fired off by the web browser until we
specifically say run this function
product underscore list
so now let's look at the code as it is
now where the function is not being
called but we've encapsulated we've
wrapped up all this code inside the
function see what happens well what's
going to happen what we should see what
happens we won't see anything printed
here so let's just load this up and of
course nothing is printed right because
the function now basically pose all this
code here out of the game it will not be
fired off by the browser until we
actually tell it to run this function so
how do we do about how we run this
function one of the easy ways is to use
an event handler so let's do that so on
the title I'm going to create a new new
tag here i'm going to put an h 3
complete that and i say show list so
this is our cheap little button so i'm
going to show list and then we're going
to go make it like this so we're going
to do it at our event however so i'm
going to go on click we've seen this
before i'm gonna say product list so
that's our name of our function right
product list so this basically tells us
when we click on this show list text
this tag run the product underscore list
function so let's take a look at that so
let me reload the page show list let's
click it and here we go you see how it
works our array is printed out so do it
again bang
so there you go here's a simple example
where we've taken our code we've wrapped
it in a custom function I just gave the
name product list like call whatever you
want and behavior that you should
understand from this is that once your
code is wrapped inside of a function as
we did here the code will no longer run
automatically as it did before it has to
be called explicitly by us we have to
say a run this particular function
so now you see what I was talking about
when I said that right here when I said
that functions whole code in stasis
until we activated and we activated by
calling a function calling functions
like doing what we did here with the on
click we called the product list
function you can think of it as calling
as you know calling somebody over it's a
you know nerds when they've put together
programming languages and so forth they
they use they come up with these terms
and for whatever reasons so I'm just
trying to help you understand why they
use certain terms like why did they say
call a function as opposed to activate I
don't know but you know what calling
function is now you understand the
stasis idea of code until it's called if
you have it in a function and you
understand when we took this out of a
function we went like this now the code
is is sitting there but reload the page
it will print it out right away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
