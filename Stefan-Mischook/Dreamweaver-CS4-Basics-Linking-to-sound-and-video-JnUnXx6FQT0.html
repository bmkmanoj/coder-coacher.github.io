going to show you how to quickly link to
mp3 files this could be also be used to
click to any media file types could be
mp3s could be waves it could be video
files like QuickTime files like h.264
files what have you doesn't really
matter this is not for playing in your
web browser but it just gives a quick
way for people to be able to watch the
content you'll send to them so I've
opened up the products page and if just
wrote this text click the download very
way parody mp3 and that's what it is I
want the code with you so we actually
did this internally here at killer sites
but it's cited you know I can't play it
because you know copyright issues anyway
so if you go down into the properties
bar here and you get make sure you get
the HTML selected and just click this
link wheel click and hold see I'm
holding and use this mouse over the file
you want to link to in this case I want
to code with you just let go and you see
the Dreamweaver automatically creates
our link for us so I'm going to control
and save this page and you know I want
to preview this in a browser but just in
case you haven't said a browser preview
dreamweaver has this great feature where
if you just hit the f12 key the default
browser will appear with this page now
he say to yourself well why do you have
to do it you can see here in design view
well design view of those pretty good
approximation of what you're going to
see in a web browser it isn't really a
web browser so what you wanna do is you
wanna hit f12 and you can see your
default browser or launch with the page
that you just created so if it doesn't
what you want to do is you want to go
into edit preferences preview in browser
under category and you want to select
the browser that you want to use as a
preview now you can select multiple
browsers and put them in order so this
is my default browser you know with
firefox was an alternate browser so a
secondary brazos clicks
your browser and that would be control
f12 right so if I hit f12 key on the
keyboard Firefox will launch if I
because I selected primary processor but
now I selected IE Explorer and because
they said make it the secondary browser
I have to hit ctrl and f 12 to launch at
now how do you out these browser if you
don't have browsers here you can go to
the plus symbol you can give it a name
so let me go call it google chrome so
assume ahead chrome installed on this so
as to look at my program files I would
have to find a browser is executable
file and then select that so if i go
into where would that be internet
explorer see if it was in turn explore
again i'll just select this hit open and
i would tell a primary or secondary
whatever i want and i hit ok and it
would appear in this list so that's how
you do it if you want to add a default
browser if you hit have 12 and your
browser doesn't pop up then you just go
in here and you can set this up for
yourself so let's go back into that
browser preview and here it is so I've
linked to the mp3 file so just going to
click it and you can see in Windows this
dialog box is going to pop up and it's
going to ask you do you want to open it
with your default media player and a lot
of people just go okay and the media
player will launch and the mp3 file will
begin to play so here you go see I want
to go with you and we're ready to go
the other option if somebody clicks they
can actually save the file to disk and
then listen to it anytime they want
again this is not necessarily the most
elegant way but other times it's very
useful sometimes people if you're
distributing a podcast it's just easier
for everybody concerned not just you but
your web visitors just linked to your
mp3 file and then they can just download
it themselves you know you don't
necessarily need to have a in window
audio or video player and as I said
before this works just as easily with
movie or video files as it does with mp3
files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
