overview the web Bradley hasn't been
around that long while it started out is
something that was only accessible via
desktop computer one more devices are
becoming web-enabled smartphones and
tablets obviously but things like TVs
cars and even devices like a
refrigerator responsive design aims to
create websites that provide an optimal
viewing experience using things like
liquid layouts fluid grids flexible
images and css3 media queries that
adjust the page to give you a short
history ethan marcotte first coined the
term responsive web design in a list of
part article written in mid-2010 he
demonstrated how to use css3 media
queries to change liquid layout to be
better suited to smaller displays since
then this trend has really taken off and
more and more sites have embraced this
approach for a responsive web design
example let's take a look at the Boston
Globe you can see if you're on my screen
in the Chrome web browser and you'll
note that as I shift the width of the
site how they say it actually adapts to
that change will notice the columns
getting smaller eventually shift down to
a two column layout and all the way down
to one column layout when it's
especially small so this gives a
slightly different layout for different
devices so for example my browser is set
to 1024 x 768 that's the standard ipad
resolution so if I shift it I do it full
screen this is what the ipad would see
and then as you work through and perhaps
you're just viewing this website on a
smaller device maybe a smaller tablet
maybe even something like an iphone
it'll actually shift down and present a
optimized layout specifically for that
device so that's what i'm going to be
talking about in the next couple videos
and i'll be actually demonstrating how
to do some of these techniques in these
next videos that's not the only example
that I can present
I've included a text document included
with the source files for this course
that includes quite a few different
alternative examples additional sites
that use responsive web design and also
some additional resources and tools for
learning about responsive web design
what you see here and what the globe
website does is an example of what I'm
going to be demonstrating in the next
couple videos working with things like
fluid grids m's css3 media queries and
that sort of thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
