calm welcome to a brand new series on
object-oriented PHP seems like there's a
bit of a need for something on the
intermediate level it's a step above the
object-oriented PHP course that stuff on
did at AOA PHP comm
slash object-oriented PHP but it's a
little bit of a step below the advanced
PHP course which you can find here which
talks about significantly more advanced
subjects so what I'm going to be doing
today is I'm going to be focusing on
practical examples something that you
can use in your everyday life or at the
very least apply in your everyday
programming so let me give you a glance
at what we're going to be building today
we're going to be building a basic login
system using object-oriented PHP
functionality-wise
you'll notice this particular course is
not all that different from my previous
PHP login series at least for the moment
with the videos I'm going to be talking
about today
however keep in mind that the back end
the code itself is significantly
different we're going to be using
entirely object-oriented programming for
this particular course so the
functionality may look similar but the
actual code that produces it is quite
different my goal is not to duplicate
all of the functionality that's
available in the other course I'm going
to be focusing primarily on the simple
basic functionality someone being able
to log in and log out so as an example
see I have the website open you can go
in you can hit fill in the username and
password hit submit and it tells you
you've successfully entered the members
area and you can log out so I'm keeping
this pretty simple I'm trying to do the
absolute basics because I don't want to
confuse people too much we're going to
be focusing on building two main objects
we're going to be building an
authorization object which is going to
handle the tasks involved with
querying a database checking if users
are logged in checking users author you
know username and password to make sure
it matches the database those who are
the tasks and we're also going to be
building a basic template 'im which
makes it easy for you to load your views
display certain information in those
views and I'll be explaining that
step-by-step to follow along with this
course you're going to need a couple
things you're going to need a computer
with PHP setup I'm assuming that you
should have this in place already
because I'm also assuming that you've
worked through Stefan's object-oriented
PHP series the beginners course so
obviously need that you can you need a
basic text editor I mean even notepad or
something simple will work I'm a fan of
coda and you also need a computer that
has PHP 5 set up and you can briefly
check that assuming you're using
something like mam or WAMP
it should be up-to-date you should be
running PHP 5 by now and I would say 90%
of all hosts should be running PHP 5 as
well it's been out for several years so
if you want to check that briefly I have
a file setup and that file looks like
this as the PHP info function and it
tells you the version in the header one
final note as this video wrapped up I do
want to be clear that while I am trying
to keep this as an intermediate level
course as much as possible some of the
stuff we will be going over is
complicated it is a little bit confusing
as you first get started to realize how
all the different files interact and how
they interconnect and it's something
that I had struggled with when I first
got started with object-oriented PHP so
keep that in mind if you do run into
challenges I would suggest watching the
video more than once
may want to try experimenting on your
own a little bit sometimes
doing it yourself helps things click and
feel free to post on the killer sites
forums if you need any help I'm always
around I'm always happy to help out with
questions so like I said you have some
resources available to you if you have
issues well that brings this video to a
close thanks for following along and
definitely check out part 2 I'm going to
be talking a little bit about object
oriented PHP and MVC theory just a
little bit enough to get you started and
how to set up the database in your files
so you can follow along with this course
