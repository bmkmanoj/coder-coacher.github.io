bit deeper into hyperlinks and at the
same time we'll learn a few more things
so what I did for you guys was to make
some changes to the pages off videos
since you already know how to use
paragraphs and you know links and we're
gonna go over things that I did very
quickly so I don't put you guys to sleep
so I've opened up the my website folder
and you can even see in Windows that
even recognizes since I put dot HTML in
the file names and since the Chrome web
browser on my computer was set to be the
default app used to open up HTML pages
to open up web pages it says window says
that this is a chrome HTML document now
if I were to set up windows to make
Firefox the default browser then it
would say Firefox HTML document just a
little nerd information for you so let
me select all the files here but right
click open with sublime text see we
don't have to open each one now each
file is opened up in sublime text in its
own little tab here so you see I've
changed the pages a little bit so what
I've done is I've given each page its
own title so on the index page because
the index page is also known as the home
page I called it the home page
my friends page is friends page the my -
plans IDs channel page I called it the
plans page and same thing of course of
my work another thing that I've done as
each page has four paragraphs and why
four just so that each page has a link
to all the other pages on the site so
let's launch this in a browser and here
you go pretty simple page that's for
sure so this is the the home page
welcome to my personal home page and
that I always take us back to the home
page which is actually our index doggie
Gmail page so we click on friends you
see the title changes right up here in
the tab friends plans might work so it's
pretty simple things one problem with
this page is that it's hard to know what
page really on you know not most people
are not looking at the tab here for the
name of a page so what we're gonna do is
I'm going to introduce you to a new tag
that's gonna separate these paragraphs
here from this homepage paragraph so
let's jump into some code so here I am
in the index and in between our
paragraphs were gonna put something in
called and each are each are is short
for a horizontal rule and what that does
it's actually one of the oldest tags in
HTML and it just creates a simple line
in between other elements elements is
another word for tags so it creates a
simple line between this paragraph here
and these paragraphs here so let's take
a look at what that looks like and here
we go I see a nice simple line like with
paragraph tags a horizontal rule tag
here inserts a line break before and
after it see see how there's a nice
space here so it's a nice clean
separation between our homepage button
and our various sub pages that's pretty
cool but we still don't know which page
were on there's many ways you can handle
this there's different tags you can use
so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna introduce
you to the basics of a new tag called
the heading tag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
