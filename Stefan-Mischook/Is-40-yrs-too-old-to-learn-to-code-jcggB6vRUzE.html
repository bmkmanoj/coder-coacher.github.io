killer sites coding at 40 is the topic
of today's vlog I'm shooting this from
my place got a nice view of the mountain
here so I figured some people might like
a different backdrop anyhow so I get
this question once in a while so I
figured I put it on a video quick video
Bob moves if you're in your late 30s
your early 40s or even older and you
want to get into coding is it worth it
short answer is yes because in general
not in general it's always better to
learn new things all the time makes
sense
it just helps your career helps your
brain it's just a better overall but
learning to code I believe should be
something that everybody should learn
whether they be young kids to
grandparents and actually I've had
people in their 80s learn coding from me
in the past so if 80 year olds can learn
how to code you and your 40s or 50s can
learn how to code now coding goes way
beyond simple app development in terms
of its benefits you could use coding all
kinds of different things you can use it
to build websites web apps mobile apps
for iOS iPad Android any type of thing
but you can also use to do things like
automating google docs so whether it be
automating spreadsheet functionality or
word functionality that's an option for
you as well so even if you don't intend
to become a coder if you're a
professional if you're going to become
accountant or you're a lawyer and so
forth you might be out you might find
coding very valuable for you in terms of
just automating common office tasks so
that's kind of cool there's a lot of
power and learning to code that goes way
beyond your typical careers so maybe you
might be somebody who's looking at
retirement and you're looking at some
sort of hobby believe it or not a coding
could be a lot of fun in terms of a
hobby give you some something to occupy
your mind something to strengthen the
brain cells if you will also might give
you opportunity to pick up some
freelance work here and there
helping accounting firm automate their
spreadsheets maybe build their website
helping you know any type of small
business do different things it's there
for you now if you're in your late 30s
or 40s and you're looking for a career
in coding as a freelancer it's not a
problem or you know what you'll learn
how to code we talked to I talked about
this in other videos you can get into a
whole bunch of other avenues in terms of
careers whether you you're freelancing
whether you go work for a small company
or medium-sized company or even a big
company as I've mentioned I think image
in another video a lot of times when
people are looking at coders they're
looking to see what other skills they
may have so if you are let's say you're
a lawyer retiring or somebody just got a
trained biologist and you learn to code
you be you could be very valuable to
companies who want to code software for
firms that handle deal in biology in
some way or another because what you're
going to have in that situation it may
be somebody who has domain knowledge
domain knowledge so if you have
knowledge of biology you have domain
knowledge you if you're you've done you
have a law degree if you study law for a
few years you have domain knowledge of
law etc etc etc so coders with good
domain knowledge are very valuable to
firms because that combination is very
very very very effective in terms of
building apps and building solutions
because the biggest problems but a lot
of coders have is that they don't
understand the domain that they're
coding for so it's hard for them to to
predict what the attribute and how it
should work but if you understand with
the professionals in a particular domain
your writing software for what they're
looking for and how they work then your
your apps will be better as a result of
that so keep that in mind so yes coding
in your 40s why not
it may take you if you're in your 40s or
50s maybe it'll take you longer than a
20 year old to learn stuff but who cares
once you get there whether it takes you
a month
or two months big deal you know in terms
of learning something it's going to take
more for two months become a
professional coder but nonetheless if it
takes you a little longer because your
brain is not as pliable as a 20 year old
whatever you just pick it up and it will
come it will come it will come
one thing older people have they have
patience and that's a virtue alright I
hope you found this useful touch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
