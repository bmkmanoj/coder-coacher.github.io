session theory in the first video in
this video we're actually going to use
sessions and see how it actually works
so what I've done is I've created two
basic pages basic PHP pages and I filled
in a little bit cold special one session
page 1 page 2 so let's look at the first
thing we need to do
to enable sessions in PHP you have to
call a session function and that session
function is called session start this
basically tells the PHP engine that we
want to use session on this page to be
clear sessions are essentially it's an
all it's an auto global array and if you
go back to our videos on associative
arrays that that essentially what a
session is it's an associative array and
it has some extra capabilities as well
so by calling this function in PHP
session underscore start we're telling
PHP that we want to use session on this
page you need to call session not start
at the top of your page for it to work
properly let me demonstrate
so I've launched a browser window and
you see that everything works welcome to
killer PHP it's very simple welcome to
killer PHP I'm not actually doing
anything with the session object here
all I'm doing is telling PHP we want to
use session and session is now available
on this page and we get a lot of paid or
thing works now look what happens if I
insert a blank space here and it let's
reload the page you see I get this PHP
error cannot send session cache limiter
headers already sent so what that tells
us is that when you're calling the
session has to be the very first thing
on your page even a blank space like
this is enough to cause a session to
malfunction on your page I don't want to
get into all the nerdy details why this
is a case when it comes down to is that
session information has to be sent in
the header as opposed to the body it's
the way in which web pages are sent down
to the browser from the web server first
they said the header and number two they
send the body this would be the body of
course all this stuff so if you don't
set your session start at the very head
of your page you're going to have this
error damn here I set it back again and
if i press refresh you see session is
now operating correctly on the page
like any other arrays sessions have to
be given values so let's do that up here
and I'm just going to cut and paste this
into place and what I've done is I
basically called the session auto global
we know it's an auto global because we
have the dollar underscore in session we
seen these type of auto Global's or
super Global's when we were processing
forms it's the same type of thing
session auto Global's are accessible on
any page in your PHP site as long as you
have a session start called at the top
of your page so I have a set up a
session auto global variable i called it
time and i've signed it the value of
date now this is a date function and
this date this is the argument we talked
about functions in a previous video it
tells basically to date function how to
format the date information so I've
inserted this date information into
session so let's see what happens when
we load our page and nothing should
change for us visually because we
haven't actually told a PHP to do
anything visually so now that this value
the date is in our session time we
should be able to access this value in
any session enabled page so let's go to
session PHP and you see I've already
enabled the session here and I'm just
going to now access that session value
the shortcut way to do this is just to
call the session function seems we've
just to echo out the session value again
it's a super global array it's an auto
global array and if you recall back when
I did the arrays videos I was talking
about how arrays were used everywhere in
PHP how we use informed processing and
this is another example how we're using
arrays or knowledge of arrays in this
case associative arrays in with session
so here we go work we're just echoing
out the value of whatever's held in
session time so let's just save that and
let's actually test this out so you see
in our first page where we actually set
the session value right we've assigned
time of value and then down here but
we've done nothing else we just have a
link linking to our second page so let's
actually try this out in the browser
here we go again let me just refresh so
when i first hit this page the first
page it sets the session value which is
the time vias now i'm going to go to
that second page and we see sure enough
the value is held here which is the
current time all the time at which we
actually set to buy it now when we
refresh this you notice the time is not
changing the reason the time is not
changing is because we set the value for
session time right we're calling it here
in the first page so at the moment that
the script is processed it gets the time
it puts it in session and it holds this
value so this won't change unless we go
back to the first page the index page
and this will reset so they go back
again I click through now you've seen it
it's changed for us again that's because
session value is getting set only on
this page and on the second page it's
being read does that make sense
okay let's add another value to our
session auto global so I'm just going to
cut and paste this into make our life
easier so I created another session of
variable and i called it browser and now
i'm using the server auto global again
we know it's an auto global because we
got the dollar and the underscore and
all caps server and we're asking the
server auto global to give us the HTTP
server user agent basically that's the
browser particular user is using so
let's save that I saved that already so
let's make sure everything's cool reload
okay no errors so now we know that
session browser has a value now so let's
call session browser inside of our next
page so I'm just going to copy that put
another paragraph and I'll echo that out
PHP makes it kind of simple for me so
well okay I didn't have to do that let's
do that so I'll just going to change
this to browser so let's see how that
works out for us so I reloaded paid
alright so you see that indeed the
session has now been loaded up with the
two values that we see here the time and
the browser used so we have two session
variables we have time and we have
session variable browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
