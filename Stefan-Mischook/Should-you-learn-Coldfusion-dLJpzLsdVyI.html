PHP killer sighs calm killer video store
calm in this V blog we're gonna talk
about a few things disparate things
first of all a question that was put to
me recently is should I learn cold
fusion just in case you guys don't know
cold fusion is basically server-side
programming I hesitate to call it a
language and you learn why but anyway
it's a server-side technology that
competes with PHP Ruby Java dot that so
on should you learn it I would say
probably not if you're looking to get
independent work in you know web app web
application development and the reason I
don't think you should is because I you
know for every ColdFusion job that's
available there's probably 10,000 PHP
jobs and 7,000 Ruby jobs and 10,000 Java
jobs you get the idea
coach fusion is a niche technology it's
it had it today back in the late 90s but
at this point in time that the man is
just not there first of all it's a
commercial product you have to pay for
it it's not too expensive I haven't
looked at you know cold fusion years to
be honest with you but a license for a
cold fusion server so you could actually
run your cold fusion code on a live
website if you have to buy the servers
at a grand or so server software but you
can find cold fusion the whole state
which is not too expensive but it is
specialized so what was the the whole
point of cold fusion versus PHP and the
other languages out there essentially it
was set up to be very friendly for web
designers because all the code it looks
like tags they you know they're actually
structured like very much like SEO HTML
tags we have
brackets and text in there instead
instead of saying image you might say
you know connect to database tag and so
they wanted to make it look you know
like HTML so it was more friendly for
web designer types and it was a great
way for these types for these non
programmers to put up simple web
applications very quickly the other
advantage of ColdFusion over competing
technologies was that it provided a lot
of turnkey solution to out-of-the-box
solutions so if you want to generate a
graph you didn't have to go searching
for a special libraries that to present
grass dynamic charts or something you
just drop in the ColdFusion object and
boom boom the grab data from your
database it created pretty charts and
stuff like that so I'm sure they have a
bunch of prepackaged ready to golf
functionalities if you will when you get
the ColdFusion so that's one of the
other advantages that's the two
advantages that said I think these
advantages have to finish quite a bit
because the other languages the other
environments like Ruby's the pure Java
PHP of course these things are have been
put out there by independent open-source
people and otherwise now
ColdFusion was actually originally
written in C and had its own tag based
library it was ported at some point I'm
not sure what the date anyway it was
poured at some point it's now basically
Co few just basically a Java to EE
container so what does that mean
basically Co Fusion is just a Java it's
just made with Java that's all it is and
it's something and it's actually just a
tag lib tag lives are basically Java's
way make it as a rather
but allows anybody to create any tag and
then have the Java server engine read
those tags on the stand with two tag
means if you don't understand that it
doesn't really matter in Michigan to
hold a java thing so just understand
that number one cold fusion looks like
tags to make it easier for web designer
types number two it has prepackaged
widgets and capability make it a little
bit easier to do certain things and when
you would say to other languages of
course as I said I think that that gap
has been narrowed quite a bit and there
were three Co fusions really just a Java
implementation as I say it's a java
application here's the thing when it
comes to programming any type of
application whether it be web apps or
whatnot the understanding of the
language is actually the easy part
I know somewhat desire types of Oh No
but actually you know do up our videos
on basic PHP JavaScript all the stuff
that could be pretty easy quickly that's
it
yeah again what's hard about developing
good applications is good application
design and now what I'm saying desire
I'm not talking about the way it looks
I'm talking about how you structure your
code how you structure your application
your algorithms these sorts of things
and whether you're using ColdFusion tag
based system or using PHP Ruby or
whatnot you're still gonna have those
issues to contend with and in fact the
tag based paradigm for building sites
which code you fusion obviously uses
does have its limitations as the site
gets a more complex although again to be
fair to Co fusion I haven't looked at it
in years
so perhaps they've improved upon that
especially since they space we stuck
coefficient on top of Java and Java
tends to be sophisticated actually it's
it's too sophisticated
spec's but that's I discussed that in
another video so there you go if you
want to learn ColdFusion understand that
you're gonna have very limited job
prospects understand that the many of
the advantages of that once ColdFusion
had are gone and ultimately you're gonna
have to learn and understand programming
concepts and architectural concepts if
you want to be a successful web
programmer final note though if you
decide you're gonna become a freelancer
you gonna you're gonna control the whole
process when you deal with clients and
you just want to be able to bang out
sites real quickly
simple things like simple shopping cart
systems or simple contact systems you
may you may want to go to co-efficient
but because you have total control and
you just want to bang out things quickly
see that's that's a big part of being
successful as a web designer developer
is to be able to produce good product
good good dynamic sites quicker than the
next guy it's gonna go a long way to
getting more contracts and it's going to
go a long way to be profitable and again
I've discussed this in other videos
about and podcast about you know
structuring your web development process
the the water flow so that it's quick
and efficient so you can pop up good
quality stuff very quickly and yeah
there you go so that's it for this video
blog I will cover that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
