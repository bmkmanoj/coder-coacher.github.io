you need to start a business depends on
the day of a business that you're
running my suggestion to you that when
you are starting your very first
business you start with very little
money as possible because when you're
starting anything new first time you got
it in a ring if you were a fighter first
time you got in a ring took a beating
right first time you do anything you
don't typically do a very good job at it
the occasion no hit happens the
occasional person gets lucky and they do
really well but typically speaking most
entrepreneurs will have several failures
before they actually make it so my
suggestion to you is that you fail
quickly and you fail with very little
money so what I would be doing is I have
been looking for business opportunities
that you can pursue with very little
cash and you can get it off the ground
makes a little bit harder you know you
set up a restaurant you know it's it's
an easier path right you said you rent
the place you create your menu you
create a name and you put it all
together and you see what happens
restaurant high-risk business of course
you got to put a lot of money in there
before you see any return coffee-shop
whatever I'm just coming up with some
ideas here point being is that you don't
need a huge amount of money to start
certain types of businesses whereas
other types of businesses will require a
lot of money and my advice is that if
you're new at business and I'm assuming
you're new at business you're watching
this video I can tell you from
experience going back 28 years I know
I'm a little bit older than you might
think going back a long time most people
will have a heck of a hard time at
succeeding with their first business I
think the statistic is eighty
eighty-five percent of first business
ideas fail don't let that dissuade you
don't let that put you off I'm not
trying to do that I think you should
pursue it for sure but I'm giving you
the roadmap on how to pursue it and to
be successful in business it's not a
question
a magic formula it's a question of
understanding the process and then
taking the right tactics and utilizing
light or the right strategies to make it
successful your business career
successful so you might may not make it
with the first idea or maybe the fifth
idea but if you implement the strategy
properly and use the right tactics you
will eventually make it as long as you
implement those tactics now the first
thing is to not spend a huge amount of
money especially on your first couple of
businesses try to pursue business with
very little money and this way you can
learn and not lose too much now you may
be lucky you may hit it and how do you
know when you hit it well when you start
seeing sales you start seeing activity
and when you do then you can start
backing it up with more money at that
particular point now this is a very
Vegas is it's a vlog so to answer the
question again do you need a lot of
money to start a business depends on the
type of business you can do it with very
little money or no money especially
technology oriented businesses though
the SAS start to start with a consulting
business you know consulting is could be
a freelance web designer freelance web
developer what have you you know Asajj
therapist cheap businesses start right
and start with a cheap business just
learn about business learn the process
learn how you handle things learn the
psychology of it all and then let let
the market help you decide how to pursue
your business opportunities and fail
with minimal losses if you do fail
that's my advice to you so yeah very
little money is required don't get into
those businesses especially your first
one unless you have very experienced
partners don't go in with some risky
very expensive business because you
don't want to lose a ton of money you
know you don't want to bet a ton of
money rather on your very first attempt
like I wouldn't step in the ring for the
first time with Conor McGregor or Mike
Tyson I like to try easier opponents at
first because I don't want to you know
I want to rearrange my face too quickly
same thing with business go in there
quick
don't don't risk too much money because
you're a new your beginner right take
your time it will come I hope this helps
