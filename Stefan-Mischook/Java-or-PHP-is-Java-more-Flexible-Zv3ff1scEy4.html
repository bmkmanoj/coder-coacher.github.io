a question that was put to me just today
by somebody on YouTube and first of all
let me just say ask questions I don't
mind you asking questions if you
disagree with a point of view about I
may have feel free to ask feel free to
challenge me I have no problem with that
in fact that's how you learn by people
challenging your ideas and in fact in my
my career as a developer in business and
in martial arts that's where I first
learned it be honest with you you have
to continuously accept the possibility
you have to continuously accept the
possibility that you could be wrong
about things I first learnt this lesson
in martial arts where how did he learn
it it was in the eighth grade I had done
a little I'd done judo for a year so I
had done some mark Taekwondo and karate
and so I got into a bit of a street
fight and at the time I was doing
Taekwondo and I loved Taekwondo and
loved to kick and when I was fighting a
guy I was kicking him but I wasn't
penetrating him with my kicks I was just
touching him with my kicks in the fight
and thankfully because I had done judo
for a year or two I figured the time was
I had just at this point we had an
orange about in judo but still had done
competition
lots of sparring in judo if you've ever
done judo and so thankfully I was able
to get out of the fight unscathed not
because of the Taekwondo and I'm not
dissing Taekwondo but because of Judo
because of actual grappling you're
grabbing and when I learned from that
experience was that with Taekwondo
because I was kicking and touching in
class when I was under a high pressure
situation with a street fight even as a
young kid in the 8th grade I was doing
the exact same thing I was doing in
class I was doing in real world under
pressure see a lot of martial artists
would fool themselves to believe that if
no they would train a certain way but in
a street
they would change it and do something
else that's not true because when you
are under pressure you resort back to
your habit you resort back to what you
do on a regular basis so in class if you
were just touching people in your
sparring that's what you're going to do
in a fight and that's what happened to
me so I was forced in that situation to
realize that there were some flaws with
the style of martial art that I was
taking at the time and so I switch to
something else and again not a diss
towards Taekwondo or anything it was
just not what I was looking for at that
time so the question was I'm Pro PHP but
what about Java isn't Java more flexible
language a more powerful language so the
answer that question is you have a more
flexible yes of course
Java is used all over the place it's
used for web app development it is used
for mobile app development and basically
native Android is all Java it's used all
kinds of different places at least you
could do for desktop and some people do
some apps in Java like I think and
NetBeans is Java amongst other apps but
and generally speaking Java is used for
server-side coding these days the most
popular Java framework for the server
size is a spring the spring framework a
guy named rod Johnson put this together
and he was basically when he he wrote a
book I think it was called lighter
smaller faster Java something like that
I bought the book actually and in that
book he it was it was basically his
argument against a monolithic j2ee
Java frameworks out there they were just
massive and he was basically saying it's
silly to have such heavyweight
frameworks so he in that book he sort of
began what became the Spring Framework
which was a much more nimble framework
nimble in Java terms relative to
relative to PHP or relative to PHP
laravel or peach be Zen PHP Symphony
these are all web frameworks and PHP and
relative to other languages with Python
and so on Java is still pretty
heavy-duty but yes Java is much more
flexible because Java is also the native
language for Android development as well
the thing about Java though it is a very
verbose language it's a language that
takes a lot of code to get anything done
you can do something with much less code
in PHP world and I would imagine the
rails world
I might imagine a Python Django world
than you do with Java
now JavaScript on the server with node
and Express as far as I know I haven't
done any myself but I poked around it
and I have a friend who wrote a
synchronous app using node he says that
a lot of it's still immature so a lot of
stuff you have to do it's not as as
mature as PHP back-end or rails or
probably jangle I haven't looked at
Django myself anyway
again I'm not dissing JavaScript it's
just every environment every framework
every language goes to us you know these
stages of development
javascript is of course it's the Masters
the only game in town when it comes to
client-side web development and it is
now becoming a more and more important
aspect of server-side development with
with nodejs and Express and big
companies like Netflix comes to mind
used node on their main app that said
back to Java yeah Java is much more
flexible in terms of peach because all
you do with PHP is create web apps but
PHP was develop from the ground up from
the ground up for web app so it's kind
of easy to get going like and nobody
will argue even Ruby rails guys who
likes a little piss all over PHP they
will acknowledge anyone any of them who
have actually looked at PHP they'll
acknowledge but yes you can get up and
running in PHP it's much easier to learn
so much easier to pick up than rails
that's for sure
and again it's not an attack on Rails
just the nature of the game PHP was
designed specifically for dynamic
websites and its original name was
personal homepage right and that was the
route that was told that was that's what
PHP stood for personal homepage so you
know and Java was designed to be a
general-purpose language and then they
put on top of it layers layers to make
it web enabled and it's servlets was the
first thing and then you had GS PS which
was kind of like javis answer to ASP
which was active server pages and JSP is
basically the view layer and it's gotten
much more sophisticated since then again
whether you choose PHP Python Java C
sharp it really depends on the type of
work you want to do and I've said that
before my vlog is really geared towards
people who more or less I don't know
freelancers I would say and if you're
getting into freelance work and you may
not have a university degree then the
better choice by far is PHP and I would
say second to that would be JavaScript
and then third to that would be Python
not because these languages are better
than the other languages it's just it's
in terms of that context if you want to
go work for a larger company or you want
to go work for a company that's doing
Android development then of course
you're going to learn Java in that
situation so all these language choices
that I make have to be taken into you
have to take into account to context in
which I'm talking about things and I'm
biased for Java I really I wrote more
lines of Java code than any other
language easily maybe partly because
Java is such a firm post language but
you know I've done more projects in Java
than anything else I really liked the
language it's it's very dependable is
very consistent the syntax is very clean
when you do something in Java it works
when I found that other environments
wasn't necessarily the case so that
consistency that dependability in terms
of
is something to be commended for sure
but I think though you know the mojo is
moving away from Java unless you want to
get into Android development native
Android development and enterprise
server-side development I've never been
a big fan of the enterprise which is
huge huge app development I'm much more
inclined towards small medium sized type
of apps and in those cases more nimble
languages like PHP Wolff a laravel or
Python with a Django or JavaScript with
known and expressed J s would be my
inclination just because they're more
nimble but if Java is what you like then
go for it because if you get good at
Java you will find work and you will
find high-paying work for years and
years to come because it's got such a
huge base now but understand the type of
work you're probably gonna end up doing
with Java so that's it I hope this vlog
was useful and again if you have
questions you don't agree with some of
my opinions voice them that I won't take
it I don't take it personally show me
where I'm wrong and that means I've
learned something new when you learn
something new it's good I gained so
that's cool all right that's it for
today bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
