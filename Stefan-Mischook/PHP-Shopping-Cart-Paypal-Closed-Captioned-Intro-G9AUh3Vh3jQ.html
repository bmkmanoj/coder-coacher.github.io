I'm going to be showing you how to set
up a paypal shopping cart this first
video is going to discuss some of the I
guess Oh underlying technologies very
briefly and also what that shopping cart
looks like and what we should end up
with at the end of this series we're
going to be using PHP with XML to store
our shopping cart and we're going to be
doing this with paypal and paypal offers
a whole suite of different tools to
interface your web application your
shopping cart with their services
however we're going to be using the
simplest one since the goal of this
video is essentially or this video
package is just to provide you with the
tools to create a simple shopping cart
so what we see here is we've got
essentially three pages we've got view
cart view store and clear cart if I view
my cart right now I've got two cans of
tomato soup and one bag of pasta we are
also using the shipping and we're also
calculating totals I can clear my cart
right here and if I go back I can also
add another can of tomato soup to my
cart I can buy it there or I can go back
to the store and add some fresh cumin as
well and maybe I'll add two more orders
of pasta as well so obviously this
interface could be in built upon and you
could add some more functionality
however by the end of this video series
you'll understand the underlying
structure well enough to be able to do
that on your own we're also using the
PayPal sandbox so if I hit by now I'm
going to be taken right now initially to
the sandbox server for paypal however we
can very easily flip that on to the
production paypal server for moving our
website from the sandbox where fake
transactions occur and fake emails are
sent to the production server where real
transactions occur and real money is
so at the top here you can see that
paypal has recognized the different
products and their quantities including
the shipping and handling which we're
also going to be covering in this video
and i'm just going to log in as a dummy
user now normally any regular paypal
user would be able to log in and they
would see this which is essentially
their bill and i've got a fake credit
card here so i'll hit pay now and once
the transaction has been completed if i
go to the paypal development center
which we're also going to cover we're
going to set up a paypal user developers
account so that we can do all this kind
of testing and I go to the test email
page will see the transaction that's
just occurred and that information gets
communicated both to the seller end to
the buyer and if I go back to the test
accounts page I can actually log in to
what is essentially a duplicate of the
paypal website but it's just for doing
development testing so i'm going to log
in now as a business user which is BBB
and you'll see that I've got a nice
balance here which is from all the fake
transactions that have occurred and this
way you don't need to set up all of the
regular business information to set up
the shopping cart that you want to
integrate into the paypal services so
that's a quick overview of what we're
going to accomplish in this video series
in the next video I'm going to talk a
little more about the terminology we're
going to talk about what XML is what
refactoring is and you might hear me
throw that term around a little we're
going to talk about an IDE and eclipse
and why we're using Eclipse to get this
job done as opposed to something like
Dreamweaver or some basic text editor
and and that should be about it I'm John
