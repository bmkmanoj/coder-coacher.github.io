getting this really strange behavior
where you know string index of hello
which should return one right because
age right that's the first things first
letter in a string at sea so it will
give you will give you zero and it will
still give me true I was like class has
given me true makes no sense I thought
did I forget something about JavaScript
see it's it's a it's true right ouch
ouch even though and I'm saying and then
I said okay what's console.log daft to
confirm sodastream dot index of hello
right hello spring hello and it should
it should be we should get zero right
because disappeared right or I'll just
make it simple as go ahead love H so we
know that in string we have h and it
should work right so we go back here
yeah why is it give me a lot- wins
according to index of H doesn't exist in
this string but it does and you can see
how the console can come in handy when
you're debugging so there's a little bug
here i'm wondering what the buggies and
then i just remember to look at this one
here right we changed it to uppercase c
string is equal string down uppercase so
now it's not hello it's actually all
uppercase so doesn't make sense so if I
make this uppercase age then watch what
happens now we get 0 right position 0 so
here we go so that was the key right so
what I'm going to do you go back to
North lower case i'm going to show you
something called a comment no comment is
this something you create a java script
by credit putting two slashes in front
of your code to forward slash slashes
it's called a ford / cause it's kind of
leaning forward think of somebody
standing lean forward to for slashes and
you see the text editor here that's
JavaScript's ave Nils that this is a
comment so graze it out for us what this
basically does when you have two slashes
like that it tells JavaScript to skip
this line of code here and don't process
it
so now that I've done this this should
work out as we expect so string that
index of hello we know there is a value
of s of this it's not equal to minus one
so we should see ouch see what happens
there we go ouch and refreshes again oh
I go save excuse me let me try it again
okay that makes x0 right string right
buyers at 0 because it's not equal to
minus 1 so we should not see how trite
so that makes sense as you can see
sometimes when doing the videos i even
get confused with the logic here i'm not
a very logical guy but you can see that
things are working now so it's a it's
pretty cool so index of h console dot
log do we get its get positioned 0 and
this didn't appear because this of
course was minus one was not equal to
this is going to help put in this one
output 0 of course how about we say put
the exclamation point here and this is
not this means not equal to biz this is
like a shorthand saying saying not equal
to so double review that double equals
is is this equal to this right this is a
comparison operator or comparison we're
comparing rather and then if you put a
little ! in front this is comparing
negatively basically we're saying is
this not equal to this and if it turns
out that this is not equal to this then
this will evaluate the javascript will
call that true right because we're
looking to see if it's not equal so this
is not equal to that if minus 1 is not
equal to this then it's actually true
and this should far off here see what
happens let me just say that launched
the page see it fires off because this
becomes true
I hope that makes sense it's a I'm just
curious so you guys see what's going on
here what's going to grab this copy that
and you'll see if the log spits out so
we'll see what the logs bit self and it
turns a result of this and that should
be interesting see it outputs true right
console dot log and we have you can do a
couple consoles will do another console
here also got log so the answer now I
have synthesis text I wanted to be text
I have to put it in quotes of course
right so let's let's try that now answer
is true there we go so we know that this
returns true now if I go like this and
ago equals so now we're just comparing
if this is actually equal to this and
this being they return result of what
index of will find and will pull out of
the string variable I hope this is
making sense if not go over again go in
previous videos where I talk about the
the index of function that's built into
JavaScript and of course we see false
right so as you can see the if statement
is a very first conditional statement
that we've looked at so far let me just
save this and in the if statement we're
able to check to see if something is
true or false sometimes true or false
can be in the form of the actual true or
false the words sometimes it could be 0
or 1 it really depends on the specifics
and again I know this is hazy the coin
here just to get the basic idea of the
if statement and if it's used all over
the place and it's probably the most
used control flow statement
that's what they call it our conditional
statement rather in JavaScript and it's
used in many other languages as well I
hope you got something out of this and
in the next video we're going to get a
little bit deeper into it look at some
more examples</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
