quick little video blog I'm going to
give you my top three web programming
learning tips so let's jump right to it
number one you want to jump into the
cold writing as soon as you possibly can
you don't want to get caught up reading
too much theory or sitting around
watching the videos forever you should
actually write code quickly and I know I
let's say you're a beginner total
beginner to web design web programming
that means writing HTML CSS of course if
you know your HTML CSS that means you
should be readying your server side code
now I assume most of you are going to be
learning PHP Ruby is also very good
alternative nerves of course Java etc
the two though I will suggest that you
go after by the way is PHP or ruby
anyhow whatever back-end server side
language you're going to be learning PHP
et cetera you should be writing the code
as quickly as possible because and this
goes for JavaScript another language you
have to learn those are the four things
we have to learn HTML CSS PHP jobs with
these are for that I recommend and when
you're learning these to become a web
programmer web developer you should be
writing code as quickly as possible and
the reason you want start writing code
as quickly as possible because you're
not going to really develop a real
understanding of code until you you
write it and you start making all kinds
of mistakes that's just the way it goes
you don't want to be a theoretical
expert and then when you sit in front of
the keyboard you actually try to write
something I guarantee you're going to be
just lost so just write code as quickly
as possible another thing you should do
is between early stages is be very
careful to understand basic concepts of
code so if you're into PHP for instance
understand the basic mechanisms of the
language so
variables functions and the subtleties
of the language again by doing the code
and doing some good tutorials you you'll
get this but a lot of people will want
to skip over the basics hoping that
things will come together and then they
get lost in the process and many a times
mistakes that you run into is because of
some lack of understanding in the basic
so be very careful about the basics and
it will make your whole learning to
program much easier as you go forward
finally once you're comfortable with the
basic concepts and you can write and
read basic code you want to start
building little mini projects as quickly
as possible so for instance you know we
do that in our course packages you can
have so for instance we do this in our
course packages we teach like how to
create a tag cloud in PHP or how to
create a very simple shopping cart or
even something as simple as crud
operations crud is short for create
write update and delete this is
basically interacting with a SQL
database using PHP and being able to
communicate between PHP and your SQL
database and usually the SQL database
which you use is MySQL so there you go
those are my top three web programming
learning tips and yeah you know one of
the things have been doing I'm just
going to close off here a little off
topic because I i I've been really busy
with other work as I mentioned in a
recent video so you haven't been seen in
you updates blog updates recently you
know we got a pretty big collection and
it's over 600 videos that we put out on
YouTube covering all kinds of subjects
and what we're always trying to do here
well what I'm trying to do is
concentrate on the key technologies the
key languages that every web programmer
has to learn we're in the PHP camp
versus Ruby or others for reasons
we'll get into here so we concentrate on
PHP as far as the server side the server
programming language but beyond that
because we want to concentrate and
refine what we do in terms of debate the
core languages and core technologies and
core techniques you don't see too many
videos on strange stuff that you rather
but you're going to rarely use and I
think going forward is going to be
consistent that way although I may come
out with some some more advanced stuff
in in the terms of in terms of PHP
frameworks or something i'm not sure but
anyway so there you go i just want to
give you a quick update about what's
going on on this youtube channel and if
you do like these type of video blogs or
i'm giving these learning tips or
business tips or whatnot comment in the
video let me know vote me up and I sort
of look at how many views I'm getting on
a video to decide in in the comments
make a lot of comments etc I try to
produce more videos of that that type
you guys play a big role in determining
what I'm going to cover so there you go
and we'll talk some about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
