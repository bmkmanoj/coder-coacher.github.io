in public so I figured it might be a
good video shirt
anyhow so in this video I'm actually
using a stereo mic a different type of
mic when I typically use so tell me if
you prefer this sound versus the video
sound that you saw in the last video so
you let me know somebody mentioned it
personally yeah I'm ambivalent
but here's see what the what you guys
think so
I'm just going to do a quick little
video here I want to answer a question
people put to me they put you know Java
versus PHP what should I learn what
should I learn let me emphasize this
when I choose a technology I'm always
looking at the business implications of
the technology so let's look at
programming languages like Java PHP
Python Ruby a c-sharp etc JavaScript so
when I look at these languages I'm not
so much looking at and I'm giving advice
I'm looking at their technology the
technology in of itself I'm looking at
the individual languages but I'm very
much considering the business
implications of languages so for
instance with Java you are looking at
probably getting work you know I'm
talking about web development here Java
web you're looking at work for very
large organizations they call that the
enterprise and if you want to go work
for a very large organization where
you're gonna have HR departments where
they're probably going to want you to
have a degree not necessarily in coding
but just a degree in something another
some bachelor's or something and on top
of that some coding experience then Java
is a better choice Java or C sharp if
you want to get into the freelance world
than perhaps JavaScript Python or Ruby
to a certain extent as well those might
be a better choices although there there
are there vc-backed there are startups
that will use Java Java though you see
sharp they'll use PHP as well but for
what I understand in the startup
community you're looking at pi
on JavaScript that tends to be where
they are going that's if you want to go
work for start-up so what happens if you
want to get into freelance web design
and development well then you're looking
at PHP is by far and away the king why
not answer because PHP is the best
language of all of them although it's a
it's a very strong contender it's
because of the business implications
because small medium-sized businesses
tend to use PHP for many different
reasons what our reasons is why is
because WordPress Joomla Joomla and
Drupal are built with PHP and a lot of
small medium-sized business websites are
built with PHP so it kind of makes sense
what they're gonna hire PHP guys to
modify these content management systems
beyond that it's just PHP is just an
easy language to learn it's easier to
pick up in terms of the web space in
terms of web development than Python
Django or Ruby rails simply because you
can get into creating dynamic websites
with PHP very easily without needing to
learn big framework again that would
only be something you would use
therefore for very small projects but
nonetheless it's approachable if you're
gonna be doing PHP in the real world
especially for serious apps chances are
you're gonna be using laravel which is
the most popular now and perhaps symfony
maybe the Zen framework you know but
these days I think if you're getting
into PHP web you would want to get into
laravel again the languages in of
themselves Python JavaScript Ruby Java
c-sharp PHP you're gonna get nerds who
will argue that this one is better than
that and vice-versa whatever I can tell
you from my experience over the years
that these languages are now neck and
neck in terms of capabilities yes there
are nice things about Python there are
nice things about Ruby but you don't see
in PHP and vice-versa there's nice
things in Java you know yeah the idea
nothing is perfect nothing is
totally amazing it largely comes down to
taste many of times and also comes down
to job prospects again so consider the
type of work that you want to do then
you choose your your language your
environment your framework that's again
again PHP freelance Python Ruby Java
perhaps for startups and for large
organizations you're looking at Java
Enterprise enterprise work it you're
looking at Java you're looking at
c-sharp but typically when you go work
for a very large organization you're
going to need some sort of college
degree it's just the way the HR
departments work but for startups they
don't really care and of course if
you're going in there as a freelancer
which could be very lucrative they
definitely don't care I was I was a bit
of freelancer I was a freelancer for
many many many years not once has a
client ever asked me what degrees or
what diplomas or what certification I
had they don't care in the business
world certifications are not something
they care about they care about whether
or not you have the chops and you prove
you have the chops
we have strong portfolio you can show
the work you've done now that's pretty
much it
so let me know what you think of this
video let me know what you think of this
new mic I've had it for a while whether
or not you prefer this sound versus the
other I don't want to spend too much
time on it because you know very few
people are going to complain about sound
quality but again these videos are for
you guys these videos are there to help
you in your careers or your coding
ambitions whatever they may be and I
just want to make it as pleasant a video
experiences as it can be for you and but
at the same time I don't want to go
crazy with production
work you know you can spend trust me
hours trying to tink around what's sound
quality or video quality and lighting
and so on I hope you enjoy to child</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
