CSS website finished let's move on to
building out the actual content
management system at the core of this
system is a couple basic objects that we
need to create we need some sort of
authorization object that controls
logging in and logging out and we need
some sort of template object which
controls what's displayed on the screen
so rather than repeating myself I've
done is I've rebranded the series that I
did earlier on PHP login using Opie and
MVC and I've included those videos in
this series so the next 10 videos come
directly from that series and they'll
give us the files and the base that we
need to build a content management
system on if you've already watched that
series you may not need to repeat it
however keep in mind that we will be
using the files that come from that
series so either follow along and a
program along with me as I code through
those 10 lessons or download the source
files from the Kabul sites fi do
tutorial library I've included a zip
file after lesson 14 and make sure you
have those available when we start back
up again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
