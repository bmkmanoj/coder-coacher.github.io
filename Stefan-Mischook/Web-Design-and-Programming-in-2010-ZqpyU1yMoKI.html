and I just want to wish you all a Happy
New Year and if it's applicable I guess
a late Merry Christmas
I'm excited about 2010 because I think
there's a lot of opportunity for web
programmers and web designers looking
forward economic turmoil like we've seen
that just in the last couple years
usually allows for a huge amount of new
changes to occur and new opportunity so
what you're going to see over the next
year or two
are a lot of new businesses being formed
a lot of new small businesses and as you
all know every small business every
every business really needs websites or
needs their websites updated so if
you're a web professional there's
tremendous opportunity looking forward
so it should be it should be pretty cool
personally I have a huge amount of
changes or gonna be taking place over
the next several months you can see a
lot more video content you're gonna see
more podcast content and we're doing
major revamps of our own sites so it
should be a pretty exciting year and so
I hope you join me and we'll talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
