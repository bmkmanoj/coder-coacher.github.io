about another selector type something
called the i.d selector before we get
into that which just review what a
selector is a selector is almost give
you a couple examples this is a tag
selector this whole thing is called a
declaration block you know this is the
beginning of the block this is the end
of the block and all this CSS in here
gets applied to the H once all the CSS
in here gets applied to the h2s etc
these are tagged selectors this is a
class selector we know it's a class
selector because it's got a period here
and we apply class selectors by going to
whatever tag we want to apply to so for
instance we want to apply the super h
one class to visit one tag here we have
to use the tag attribute class and you
know we you know we just write it out
like this just to recap this whole thing
is called a declaration block in each of
these are called declarations so we're
declaring but the inside of our P tags
the text color is gray and so this is a
declaration this is the property and
this is the value this is another
property this is the value in between
the property and the value you have a
colon and in between each declaration
you have a semicolon so this is
basically I give you a bunch of nerd
talk when it comes down to is this you
wanna say I want to change the color to
gray and then you're going to put this
semicolon here to sort of it to end it
then you say I want to set the font to
to the font weight scuze me to 200 or up
here you want to set the text alignment
to left anyway that reviews that so
let's create an ID
tough age so to create an ID you have to
start with this number symbol or some
people might call it the hash this is on
top of the three it's on the same key on
your keyboard as the three as the number
three and this tells CSS that this is an
ID selector so just like the class use
instead of writing class you just put ID
and in this case would be topped h/h now
you notice with the class and with the
ID selectors you notice I didn't include
in the case of the ID I did not include
the number symbol I just put the name of
the ID and in the case of the class I
did not include the period I just put
the name of the class right this symbol
here and this symbol here while the
period in the number symbol are used by
CSS to identify that this is a ID and in
this case this is a class but in our
HTML here we tell the web browser that
we're selecting the ID by using this tag
attribute here the ID attribute in a
case of a class of course we're using
the class attribute and that's hope that
makes sense so I wait let's back it up
to create an ID in your page in the CSS
use the number sign and use the name of
the ID what you want to use and then
what you got to do is you got to tag
your particular tag with the ID
attribute as I did here so that the
browser knows which tag in your page has
the idea of top H in this situation just
like we added the class attribute as in
this example on the paragraph tag to
tell the web browser which tags had the
super each one class so what's the
difference between an ID versus a class
well a class can be applied to many
different tags on the same page so you
could have
many tags but has a class a super h1 i
can add it here i can add it here i
could even add it here if I wanted to
classes can be added to the page
multiple times whereas IDs are meant to
be added to the page once so for
instance I have the ID of top h this
should only be added to the page once in
other words there should be only one tag
in the entire page that has an ID of top
h that's the rule now the web browser if
you did this if you just said this is
also top page this ward you know in fact
the CSS rules that you've created here
in this declaration block would apply to
both this h1 with the ID of top page in
this paragraph with the ID of top age
but that's frowned upon you're not
supposed to do that you're supposed to
only use an ID once in a page and the
reason why is because when you are
writing your code you want to be able to
identify sometimes certain tags and your
page you want to make your certain
certain tags and your page special
unique to the page and you do that by
giving these tags and ID that's all it
is so this comes into play especially
when you get into javascript programming
as well as CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
