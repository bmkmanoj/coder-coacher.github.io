do some CSS
so what I have here in front of us oh
that is introduction chapter 1 all
prepared for staff which makes my life
happy so what we're gonna do here is
we're going to learn how to style this
very simple web page where we have a
couple headers we got a header ones we
have two header ones we have a head of
two two paragraphs we've seen this
before because we know our HTML our HTML
excuse me and we're ready to go so here
is the CSS code right up here there are
a few ways but you can add CSS to a web
page for now we're going to use this way
here we're inside of our head tags we
add the CSS style block opening tag
closing tag I call it a block cuz it's a
block of code just like the head here is
a head block to block a code this is not
exactly a block but yeah you get the
idea
so yeah opening closing we know it's
closing because of the forward slash of
course we've seen this before
so all this gold here is CSS it's not
HTML you may think it's a type of HTML
but it's not you may think because it
has HTML tags here h1 h2 paragraph tag
which is appears for paragraph as you
know these are not HTML tags this is not
HTML and you know it first of all
because it's in between style tags
anything in between this and this is
going to be read by the browser as being
CSS code it's gonna say up this has to
be CSS code because we're in between
these two things here another thing that
will point out that this is not HTML up
here is that because we don't have our
angled brackets around our tag names so
for instance if you look at each one you
look down here we know this is HTML
because you got our little angle
brackets like this right also we know
it's proper HTML because we also have
the proper closing tag there you go
whereas this is CSS cuz it just
name's the tag here so what are we doing
here in our CSS basically we're using
these tag names to select the tags in
the page another word for select is to
choose so we could say that we're using
these tag names to choose the tags in
our page so what we're saying here is
for all the h1 tags in our page make the
color orange now the color we're talking
about here is the text color in CSS
instead of writing text - color which
doesn't exist they said well we'll just
make it simple and we're gonna make it
color equals orange so once again we're
using this CSS code to select the h1
tags in our page to make the text color
orange with this CSS code we're
selecting h2 tags and making h2 text
blue and finally with this CSS code here
we are selecting B paragraph tags the P
tags and our page and we're making the
text gray let's take a look at that in
real life let me sizes so it's all
fits in the window as you can see the
two header ones is orange paragraph text
is gray and the header two is blue let's
view that with the cold side by side and
here we go each one make it Orange you
notice we have two h1 tags down here I
just wanted to make a point about when
you use CSS to select a tag the style in
this case we selected each one here it
selects all each ones in the page not
just one so even though we have two each
one's in our page here in our body in
our HTML this CSS selects all the H ones
not just one h1 that's why I want to
that's why I put two kind of crazy h1
tags here and you wouldn't have the same
header twice you know underneath each
other in a real website anyway there we
go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
