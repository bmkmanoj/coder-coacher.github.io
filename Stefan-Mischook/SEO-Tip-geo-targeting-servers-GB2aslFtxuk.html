sites calm in this quick little video
blog I'm going to give you a little bit
of a SEO search engine optimization tip
I'm calling it an SEO tip but there's a
lot of things that have tremendous
impact on a site traffic and visibility
on the search engines but don't really
fall into SEO specific techniques if you
will so here's one example something I
discovered through unfortunately trial
and error so I'm going to save you a
problem geo-targeting of the server's IP
where your website happens to be sitting
has a major effect on your traffic let
me explain I recently discovered this I
recently moved killer sites calm from a
US server of hatim on us servers forever
to a canadian-based server because I
have dedicated servers in Canada so it's
the sort of thing consolidate and in so
doing I found that my traffic had
dropped fifteen percent or so and I
thought it was because we had some
problems technical problems with one of
her forums I thought would come back but
since it's been months now many six
seven months it has not come back for
some reason and I just discovered google
put out something and they definitely
geo-target so if your website is being
hosted in the US for instance your
result your search engine results will
improve for people who are searching
from the US you will get more or high
results rather in the US and you would
in canada or rest the world and vice
versa now that my servers and my website
are in canada i get superior results
from canadian searches than I do from
the American searches when I was in the
US here's the problem though if your
market is in the US you're crazy to have
your servers outside of the US and
Latino or vice versa if
business is primarily in Canada and your
server should be in Canada so that's a
very important SEO tip that has really
nothing to do with you know optimizing
your site has everything to do with
understanding how the search engines
think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
