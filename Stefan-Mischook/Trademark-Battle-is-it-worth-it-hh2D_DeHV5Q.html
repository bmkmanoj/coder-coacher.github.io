had a real interesting experience happen
to me just recently I ran into a bit of
a copyright issue so let me just get
into the story so I was about to launch
something with a particular name and as
it turned out that this name was
copyrighted
now it wasn't finalized the copyright
wasn't finalized and I just had a
process if you will I decided you know I
should just make sure it's not
copyrighted and as I did a check and you
just go online you go to the US
government is typing copyright search
and you can search for free and it turns
out that this very particular name was
actually in the final stages of being
copyrighted it wasn't copyrighted yet it
was at a stage where you can contest it
so the way it works with copyrights is
that you submit your application to
copyright whatever name you want to
copyright and then the US government or
again government or whatever government
you go through they go through the
process now I know how works in US and
Canada so you go you submit it the
government you have to pay a fee the
government examiners check it out make
sure everything's cool it goes through
these stages and it could take a year or
two and it gets to the final stage where
it's put out there for public review and
what it's put out for public review it's
up to the public to say hey you can't
copyright this name because of X Y
instead now I'm not a lawyer I don't
know all the details but as far as I
understand at least on a basic principle
we have to show to the government that
if you give this person the copy writer
this business of copyright it will
infringe on your rights you say why I've
been using this name here and there or
it's too generic bla bla bla again you
got to talk to a copyright lawyer that's
not the point of this video the point of
his vlog was to tell your story so this
happened just as in the last week so I
saw that it was up for contestation I
think it is where I can contestant say
whoa whoa whoa this is not legitimate
that they should be copyrighted
and so you could submit this yourself
but probably if you do it yourself
you're not going to do a very good job
should get a lawyer to do it but then I
cost money so I decided what to do is I
contacted the owner of the copyright and
I said hey listen you know this this is
generic I'm thinking of contesting this
can you just give me a waiver and say
this is for you for this guy here for
this situation I'm not going to I'm not
going to feel that he's infringing on my
copyright if I have to copyright I
roasted a person of course the person
said well now I got to talk to my lawyer
about this blah blah blah clearly this
is going to quickly escalate into a
legal dispute it could have been a very
minor dispute it could have been a big
personal but at the end of the day I
said to myself as a business owner I
said okay the best-case scenario with
the situation I go through a rigmarole
on a process hire lawyers spend hundreds
of dollars in the minimum and what I do
is I block this person from getting the
copyright that's the best-case scenario
so I blocked a person so that means he
can't copyright this term but I'm not
protecting the term from anybody can use
a term that it has no real advantage for
me because I'm not securing the rights
to the term the name and so why am I
doing this it's why am I doing this so
that you know strike number one against
it I'm basically putting money and
effort to basically just keep it from
being blocked off for me resident public
and the other thing I had to consider is
that how important was this name is a
catchy name but it's going to really
make much of a difference yeah I don't
think so so I had to make the executive
decision say you know what even though
my instinct is to fight because I'm the
fighter I decided to just let it go
because you know what it's not worth
legal problems the battles the risk
excuse me to gain
the potential gain versus the cost some
people might call risk reward is not
nearly enough for me to justify the
headaches and the expenses the expense
of trying to dispute this again try to
dispute a copyright not that I can
secure the copyright just so that
somebody else can secure it so I just
couldn't leaves it open no advantage so
what did I do I said I wrote to the
owner of the copier I said don't worry
about it I decided not to contest it
have fun with your copyright and that's
