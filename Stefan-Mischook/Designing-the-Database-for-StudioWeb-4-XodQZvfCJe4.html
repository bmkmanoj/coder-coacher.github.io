I actually actually have to force it I
have to force myself to speak louder so
I have to push more air through my my
larynx I guess it's called in fact when
you whisper you're actually damaging
your vocal cords you're straining and
more than if you just talk normally so
when you lose your voice your instinct
is to whisper which is actually
interestingly enough the opposite thing
you should do which my camera here it is
yes very quick studio web for is we're
just starting to architect that and I'm
saying that to developers we're going to
be designing the new database and the
database is going to be designed first
of all based on the current studio web
three structure because studio web three
is pretty much a bug free app now looks
really good but we're updating we're
rewriting from scratch rather because I
want to take advantage of new frameworks
and of course a 67 year old code base to
the web is 67 year old now you know it's
a little long in the tooth several
developers have worked on it of course
and so it's a little messy and it's time
to once in a while to rebuild anyway so
Ian we're going to be designing the
database this weekend at least the first
draft and the first job is going to of
the new database for suitable for is
going to take into account some of the
things that we noticed some of the flaws
the database and studio by three in
terms of its architecture so we're going
to we're going to mitigate for that
remain or in other words we're going to
make changes to the database structure
instead he went four to six a couple
little inefficiencies that we saw see
web three which of course those
inefficiencies are totally my fault
we're paying close attention when the
when the original app was built another
thing we're going to do is we're going
to be mindful of the new features that I
see coming down a line with regards to
do web so the database that it is going
to be designed mindful of those new
features so that it's efficient that
said with the rewrite we're first going
to rewrite the app replicating all the
features that it currently has and lock
that down before we actually add any new
features that's a that's a way to chunk
the work anyway that's it these vlogs
i'm going to try keeping pretty short
but we'll see what happens and what's up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
