days off from making YouTube videos
because I was finishing off my Python
course I'm happy to report that today
was a Tuesday Monday Tuesday I've lost
track today I finally finished the
Python course at least the principal
part of it what I've been working on the
last few days has been the quiz
questions writing quiz questions is like
pulling your teeth it is the most
draining and tedious part about course
creation so what's the subject of this
particular fact I'm very much relieved
that this pretty much done its way from
editor to give me the final due to final
edits and so forth and then I just go
click and I press live and the Python
course will be live on a studio web
fantastic room it has to do with the
distribution of the tedious work we all
run into this whether we're developers
or whether whatever professionally
happen to be in there's always these
elements of tedium these these things
things that has to have to be done but
important but they're really boring and
really hard to do mentally like to do
quiz questions let me tell you I can
only do an owl at a shot and I have to
go take a break for 20 minutes half an
hour because it's just so mentally
draining I'd rather be writing a rabbit
writing object-oriented code threading
code in Java so if anybody's ever done
threading in Java or anything anywhere
you know how that's what's that's like
so you get the idea so when you have
really tedious tasks you have to handle
the key to doing it is just to just
start doing a little bit every day a
little bit every day just to get it done
and because if you keep pushing at all
pushing it off until you have a huge
amount of work to do and it's pure
tedious work and you have a tight
deadline you're going to be in for
some hell they're gonna be instrumental
for some house so my Python course has
to be ready had to be very rather for
mid-august so I come hell or high water
is pushing it through now that's one of
the reasons by the way I made the
announcement on YouTube I use YouTube as
a pressure I said coming out with this
course so pre selling it so that gave me
more fire to want to do that tedious
quiz quick quiz question building and so
we started tackling it myself and my
editor and it really forced us to push
it out it's one of tricks in terms of
motivation is to let the public know
what you're doing and then public
notifications you know this pressure is
pressure on you to come through in terms
of what you said you're going to do so
that's what we did here yeah so to
summarize you have a tedious task ahead
of you just start tackling it do a
little bit every day ten minutes a day
half an hour a day whatever it is just
start tackling every day so it's you
don't have this wall of crap you're
going to have to deal with with tight
tight deadlines
so going forward I'm just waiting for as
I said my editor to finish with the
edits and then from there yeah from
there it's going to be much smoother
sailing because I did the huge server
move today also ironic not ironically
but interestingly enough the old last of
my dedicated servers the old one went
offline
today I had done the transferred two
weeks ago to the VPS virtual private
server the new one and but I wanted to
give myself again
a runway just in case something went
wrong with the VPS VPS is knock on
plastic is working fine fantastic so the
Oh sir is no more today kind of a
bittersweet moment because I had been
using dedicated physical David dedicated
servers for 10 15 years and I've been
using the same company
I guess 10 12 years so bittersweet to
suppose but it's a good move I feel much
better being totally virtualized
balancers in my hosting and that's kind
of cool and so going forward I'm gonna
have much more time for vlogging much
more time for little mini courses so as
I said in other vlogs my goal going
forward with the YouTube channel is to
get deeper into the business end and the
baby the marketing end but the business
more of the business and being a
developer but just even a business owner
and a small business startup dude I've
been coding since 94 but I've been in
business for long or a few years longer
than that and I've had businesses in
many different most several different
sectors and so I'm gonna start talking
about that giving you my perspective
from a guy middle-aged guy who's had
some success there anyway I thought is
done
ah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
