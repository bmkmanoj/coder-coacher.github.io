and JavaScript based form validation in
part one we set up a basic form template
I'm going to go ahead and show you how
to use the JavaScript validate plug-in
and how simple it is to add basic
JavaScript validation to your pages so
to briefly go over this again we've
included jquery and the validate plugin
and we have our form all set up now just
a matter of telling jquery which forms
we want to be required you know that
what validation rules do we need to
apply and this particular plug-in makes
it pretty simple we can just add a
couple of CSS classes and the JavaScript
plug-in will figure out automatically
what needs to be done with each of the
inputs so let me go ahead and add a
couple classes I'm just going to keep
things simple for the sake of this
tutorial I'm gonna just add a class
required to the name for the phone let's
do the same thing class required for fax
I'll just leave that alone for email
it's also make that required but we also
want to specify that it's an email and
get it validated as such so I think that
should do it for now so I'm going to go
ahead and save that and then all you
need to do is add that class and a
little bit of JavaScript here and we
start with a standard document dot ready
like so that's just standard jquery and
then all we need to do is go as such
form i need to put it this in quotes and
this form obviously refers to the ID of
the form that's such and dot validate
that's simply all we need to do one
thing i noticed just left over you can
clear this action attribute i'll
probably remove that from the source
files okay so let me go ahead and
preview us and see what we have so far
okay so that looks good
ah sorry it's validate not validated
there we go so it's working as it should
always specified is that the name phone
and email fields she'll be required so
you'll notice if they aren't fill in
filled in will give us an error message
so I'm just going to go ahead and fill
that in as such and then let's see looks
like we need to enter a valid address
and submit and looks like that's working
perfectly so obviously this particular
plug-in has a wide range of options so
feel free to look at that either in the
jQuery documents or if ice go back here
on this website vass ist a nce de and it
seems that pretty good documentation and
it's quite expandable so the last thing
you want to do to discuss
javascript-based validation with this
particular plugin so i want to show you
how to extend this plugin to add
additional rules i should note that if
you download the file this is a zip
archive it comes with a wide range not
just only the plug-in itself but also
demo files additional additional
validation rules etc so it's quite
useful and pretty well documented so
what I want to do is I want to go ahead
and add some validation for that
telephone number field so I did notice
if you check the plugins validation page
on the jQuery site they actually talk a
little bit about it
so let me just find the section on the
page me one minute let me find what
exactly it is
that's right here okay um so pretty
simple this is what I was looking for
all I need to set this up is this
section of code right here so i just
need to place that within the document
ready section
let me guess okay and you'll notice we
have a regular expression here which is
checks that's how it figures out whether
the phone number is valid or not and
then also the message so you can easily
edit it if you want to change and have a
different message display if the user
needs to correct this field and so this
particular method is called phone us
with uppercase you and s4 obviously
United States style phone number so to
go ahead and add this validation rule to
our form just go ahead select the phone
and underclass required we're going to
put phone us like so let's go ahead and
test this and see where we are
yep and it seems to working fine asks us
to specify a valid phone number if I
enter in some something invalid and
you'll notice the error message goes
away if we enter in the correct value
okay so that about covers it for the
JavaScript section as I said earlier
this particular plug-in that I'm using
is quite powerful has a wide range of
rules that you can use as a full list
here I'm acquired you can add a minimum
a maximum length you can have a range
email date URL etc so it allows you a
lot of different rules to excuse me it
allows you to validate against a wide
variety of rules and makes your life
just a whole lot easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
