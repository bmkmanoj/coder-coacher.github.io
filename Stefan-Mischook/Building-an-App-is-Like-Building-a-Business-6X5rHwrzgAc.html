like building a business you first come
up with the basic idea for your app or
for your business then you build it once
you've made your app life or you got
your business up and running you're
going to get user response and then when
you get your user response which
inevitably is going to happen whether
it's an app or business you're going to
have to pivot you're going to have to
update according to that user response
it's really rare the your first
iteration of the app or your first
iteration of the business is going to be
the one that works in fact it hardly
ever happens it's a myth it's a myth
that when you come up with a business
you're going to come up with the
original idea and go this it is perfect
it's like Facebook Zuckerberg himself
said that in his development of the
Facebook app it went through many
iterations many changes and he had no
idea what the end product was going to
look like he never did
you never do I've seen outside of app
developers who I've seen in my non tech
businesses where I had an array of
products several different products and
I know and then you would think that
product a was going to sell really well
it turns out it's product D that sells
really well in product a doesn't sell at
all you never know that's the thing
expression I came up with when I was
like 22 I used to tell people but I'm a
hundred percent sure that this business
idea is going to do well I figure my
real chances are about 10 percent what
I'm a hundred percent sure I probably
got up 10 percent chance and you're
going to see that with apps as well when
you first deploy an app a website and
you start getting user response to it if
you're on the right track you get some
sort of response then you're gonna have
to make tons of changes to do web
my interactive training app is very very
very very different from what it was
originally conceived to be and in fact
it's got so much legacy code in there
but it's not being used anymore
that for city what for which we're
working on now it is a total rewrite
from scratch because the code over the
years several developers many changes
based on user feedback it just gotten to
the point where the app is too much to
maintain because of that legacy
so we're rewriting from scratch to have
a nice clean implementation so I'm very
excited about that and this is not
uncommon Mac OS Mac OS I think was
originally written Pascal or something
get the language but anyway it was
terrible at one point in terms of its
usability it's like it's multitasking if
you want to switch out you have to
restart exist like a disaster so Steve
Jobs made the decision that they were
going to scrap the old Mac OS and they
rebuilt Mac OS fresh off of the UNIX
backbone FreeBSD in fact so and that
took a couple of years to refine it and
get it up to speed but it was a good
decision because the original Mac OS was
based on an architecture that was way
out of date and it just couldn't handle
the modern day computing and there was
no way to rescue it they patched it to
its extreme and it was done same thing
with Judy Webb's do web is pretty much
bug free works really well but it's it's
kind of like OS 9 and in the sense that
it's at it end-of-life so I've had to
retire it so going back to your original
point of this vlog the myth is that when
you do build an app or you build a
business that the idea that you come up
with is going to be perfection or is
going to be near perfection chances are
it's never the case you have to expect
you're going to be doing many many
iterations
and I think the bottom line means that
when you do go out there with your
business or your app and you have to
prototype quick and dirty
prototype quick and dirty so that you
get the app into the hands of your users
you can get the business out into the
marketplace and see if it has any
liability whatsoever and this is the key
to being successful app developer this
is a key or what keys to being a
successful entrepreneur all right we'll
talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
