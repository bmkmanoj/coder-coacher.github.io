hide the JavaScript from somebody
typically client-side code I'm assuming
he's talking about browser in browser
JavaScript code why do we call a
client-side because the browser is the
client software to software with people
use on their own computers on their own
smart phones etc anyhow so JavaScript
runs on the client client-side
JavaScript is something that is
typically not encoded it's not compiled
so it's there as expose but there are a
few strategies in which you can make it
harder to to read he wanted to hide some
app that he was building with his
JavaScript now most people won't even
bother one of these you could do though
is use something called a JavaScript off
you skater now I just did a quick search
on Google and this was one of these
things that popped up and here's an
example also you write your JavaScript
code here on the left and you press off
you skate and it encodes it like this so
that's breathing hard to reverse
engineer I'm sure some ways around it
perhaps but this will prevent most
people from check out your JavaScript
code so if you're worried that somebody
might harvest your code your JavaScript
code you could use a JavaScript off you
Skeeter such as this to make it that
much more difficult although if you can
click a button to make to encode it you
could probably find software beckon
unencoded so this is one strategy that
you can use if you're concerned about
that that being said most people are not
going to try and reverse engineer your
stuff so I wouldn't be too concerned
about it but here you go that's it for
this quick little nerd tip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
