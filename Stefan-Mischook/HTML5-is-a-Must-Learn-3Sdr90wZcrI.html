sites calm in this video blog I just
want to comment on a blog post i
recently put out and it's about html5
let me get to the point quickly because
i figure you guys are busy essentially
html5 has out of nowhere really has
become a very important technology and
in and in fact i think html5 is going to
soon be one of the most important web
texts that any web nerd should learn and
there's several reasons that i believe
this but primarily i'm seeing it on the
ground meaning in talking with people i
hear that the demand for competent html5
coders and programmers meaning that you
know javascript as well is growing quite
a bit I was talking for instance to my
brother who's out in Europe and he was
saying for a company but he works for
which produces mobile applications for
Android and iOS specifically they are
having a difficult time filling in work
positions for client-side scripting side
meaning html5 JavaScript programmers
it's it's kind of new it's not terribly
difficult to learn actually but there's
a lot of there's a lot of stuff in there
to pick up and so I can see why there's
a shortage of people now what exactly is
html5 it's the latest incarnation of
HTML previous leaders HTML 4 and html5
really
takes HTML to a whole different level as
I point out in this blog post and you
can read about it more in more detail at
killer sites com you can see the URL up
here what I point out is that what makes
html5 very interesting is that the
specification the html5 specification
was put together by people who actually
paid attention to what was going on in
the real world rather than trying to set
up some ivory tower spect as the XHTML
people did with the html5 groups they
essentially said okay first of all how
our web page is being coated today and
they scanned randomly a million or two
million web pages and they saw what
people were typically doing with their
CSS and their code and as as a result of
that examination they put together new
tags in HTML five things that would make
sense again you can learn more about
that if you take check out our html5
course and other places i'm sure another
thing that they did when considering
html5 was to actually consider what the
most popular browsers were doing
themselves so for instance the ex an XML
HTTP object I think that's what it is
basically the object in the web browsers
but allow for Ajax to happen and again
if you don't know any of this just check
out our courses on html5 and Ajax and so
on this is something that was actually
outside of the specification that the
official nerds at the w3c I put out the
this whole thing but allowed for Ajax to
occur
I just popped open a screenshot from an
old Ajax video tutorial that we put
together yes the xml httprequest object
i had forgotten exactly yeah anyway you
get the idea this is something that's
now used in all the web browsers and
it's but it wasn't part of the official
spec and there are other examples of
that as far as I understand where
basically the people putting together
html5 they said okay let's let's see
what the browsers are actually doing
what see what people are doing another
examples inner HTML again this is a very
powerful tool Microsoft came out with
inner HTML and then the other major
browser vendors adopted it so the point
is with html5 you saw a very pragmatic
point of view and that's why the
subtitle and maybe this should have been
the title of the article HTML 5 and the
rise of pragmatism and essentially be I
I would think because of that pragmatic
approach that the people behind html5
took to put it together now we see this
thing exploding people want to use it
it's extremely powerful you can do all
kinds of cool things with it that old
webinars such as myself were just
dreaming about back in the early 2000s
and the early 90s even so I really
encourage you to look at this if you've
never looked at html5 you're going to be
blown away by its power and capabilities
so some of you may be asking at well but
you know which browsers actually can run
html5 html5 is not necessarily the best
solution for a very public site but the
great news is that
all the major browser manufacturers
whether it be google chrome IE internet
explorer of course being still the
dominant one firefox and others opera
etc they're all pushing people to
upgrade their browsers on a regular
basis this is unprecedented we're really
pushing now people come on let's let's
let's forget about the old browsers
which gets a new browser so we can do
some cool things with the web so there
you go so I think that html5 will be
it's already become extremely important
and it's becoming more important as
browser adoption continues to move
quickly and you're going to see also
html5 and the related technologies I'll
get back to what I mean by that by
related technologies this is quickly
replacing what flash did I think flash
is pretty much a dead duck especially
since I've been looking at more detail
what you can do in html5 you can create
video games with html5 you can create
all kinds of rich apps there's threading
there's all kinds of crazy things you
can do in terms of the related
technologies html5 is a name that they
apply to many different things people
not many several different technologies
so when you're learning html5 you're
learning CSS 3 learning html5 and some
other sub projects and i am not a total
expert on this so you have to check out
our course i didn't design this
particular html5 course although once i
have something to say i'm going to do
others yes so it's sort of an umbrella
of technologies if you will but
nonetheless it's it's something really
cool and it actually changes some
fundamental thinking of mine in that
years ago and 2005-2006 i spoke about
the pillars of web design if you will
where i cited the most important
technologies in web design in order of
importance HTML CSS and then I said PHP
and JavaScript now people be wondering
why PHP will again not to revisit the
whole argument essentially I said that
you know all web sites require some
dynamic components you know what website
doesn't have a blog installed or a
shopping cart or contact forums all
these type of things are built with PHP
or they can be built with Ruby you can
build build with dotnet and others but
PHP by far and away is the most popular
for small and medium-sized projects
although Ruby's catching up now slowly
so that's why I argue back way back then
but even web designer shouldn't learn at
least a little PHP so the little PHP so
that they can go in there modified code
make changes and so on now and at the
time javascript was basically a support
technology you did a little bit of dom
scripting do em scripting again if
you're not sure what it is you know
where to go or did a little bit of ajax
maybe and maybe some form validation but
that was more of a fallback you still
had to use something like PHP or ruby to
really do all this stuff anyway fast
forward to today 2012 and looking
forward javascript is the primary
language used to manipulate the web
browser and to interact with in the
html5 environment to use javascript to
do all the real cool stuff a lot of the
cool stuff so all of a sudden javascript
is becomes many many times more
important and on top of that that you
have android devices iphone devices and
even windows 8 where you can build html5
apps directly for the OS it's it's very
cool so also you're going to see when
Windows 8 comes out in I believe it's
october of 2012 it's scheduled and looks
very interesting
I think windows 8 could be a game
changer for Microsoft I'll save that for
another video but anyway point is html5
is right there and it's built into the
core operating system so not only do you
see html5 and all the web browsers the
major web browsers for your traditional
desktop web browsing you see the no on
windows mac OS you see the android
android phones and tablets iOS ipads
iphones and now you're going to see in
the core of windows 8 within their metro
they call Metro UI user interface so
it's extremely important so if you're
looking to get into the game you have to
learn you know a website you can't just
go out there and be a Dream Weaver user
or a expression web user really if you
want to be competitive and get the jobs
and you will get the jobs you got to
learn your HTML ucss you got to learn
your html5 and JavaScript and you got to
learn your PHP as well and
that's about it I hope you found this
video blog interesting you want to learn
a bit more about what I'm talking about
you can check out this article here
html5 and academic skills and man I talk
about what I just spoke about here maybe
a few more details that's about it I
hope you found the video in enjoyable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
