killer sites com Photoshop for the web
tutorial in this particular lesson plan
what we're going to be discussing are
some of the things that we learned in
our earlier series of articles on
graphic design and in those if you
remember and if you haven't seen them I
encourage you to check them out we were
talking about some fundamentals related
to typography layout design color among
other things well as you can see what
we're going to be attempting to do is to
use those fundamental skills and create
a very simple website in both photoshop
and dreamweaver as you can see I'll just
switch over to photoshop what we're
going to be learning how to do in
Photoshop is working with type as you
can see here our headlines and our body
text we're also going to be learning how
to tweak some of these images that we've
introduced into our design working with
rulers layers and guides and ultimately
we're going to be slicing this
particular design using the file save
for web format and we're going to be
learning about image optimization so
that we can use our images inside of a
dreamweaver based HTML and CSS design so
we'll be learning about gif optimization
jpeg optimization and also what PNG can
offer you as well once we've sliced
these images then we'll be turning our
attention to Dreamweaver where will be
assembling a simple yet effective for
page website as you can see here this
three-column layout turns into a two
column layout with each of these
sections delivering information
regarding this very simple typographic
website so we're going to start our
tutorial next inside a Photoshop and
that begins in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
