busy with work
we've been on aborting many schools this
year and in fact we've been having a
server load issue server load issues one
other reason we're rewriting City web
from scratch is because City web uses an
old MVC framework an old arm or MS short
for object relational mapping it's
basically a layer of code that
programmers use to talk to databases it
just simplifies sayings anyhow long
story short the old app the old code
base is not exactly the most robust in
terms of scaling and that's one of the
reasons why we're rewriting from scratch
is it's easier and so with all the new
schools coming on board we've been
having load issues and I've been
throwing server resources at it like
crazy what does that mean that means we
migrated it's 2d web totally to the
cloud earlier this year or late last
year I forget now it's all blur and so
for us to be able to double and triple
and quadruple server power is literally
a click of a button that is what a huge
advantages of going cloud-based with
your web apps is because you can scale
immediately it takes literally a minute
or two and you can double quadruple your
server capacity whereas wouldn't you use
traditional dedicated servers like I had
been using for 15 years or so the
problem with that if you want to upgrade
it's a big job it's a big job because
you're kind of locked into this physical
box now cloud-based servers are just
basically you got this big cloud
software that is powered by many many
many physical servers so one server
drops out all the other servers take up
the slack and the hosting company can
add many many more boxes dynamically
without interrupting the flow of all the
hosting all the apps operations it's
kind of like hot swappable hard-disk
when you have a raid array where you
have been
hard disk and are constantly copying
each other and you can pull one out if
it fails but the other ones take take up
the loads and you just put another one
in and it spins up and it joins
everybody Alison they keep all the data
nice and clean and intact rather and you
have that with cloud hosting essentially
the same thing but on a server level
where everything is hosted everything is
powered by many many many machines lots
of lots of hardware CPU RAM hard disks
and so forth but because of replication
and a very sophisticated cloud hosting
infrastructure which is all codes all
apps everything is kept up-to-date so
you can scale very quickly and deal with
server load issues but at the end of the
day in my particular situation the
reason that the apps are really slowing
down is because of the influx of a bunch
of new schools we saw one of our key
tables in the database
it's racked up a bunch of records so we
hit you know around a million records
and you know I won't get into the
details up so because we had a million
records in that table the whole thing
surges like the whole apps are tanking
because everything comes everything
result revolves around hitting that
database table interacting with it
reading and writing to it so we were
able to fix it I went in there actually
I had to do it because let's put my nerd
cap back on and I sort of figured out it
was in fact the problem the bottleneck
problem was that table so fortunately I
was able to clean up stuff and it looks
like we got the app running back at
pretty decent speeds so there's a lesson
to be learned there number one
cloud-based hosting allows you to add
server power and that's what we did for
initially when the problem was starting
to occur over the last week or so we're
getting calls from schools and stuff hey
it's low it's low and we indeed checked
it out and our own reports are showing
was slow say why are we getting all
these processes so I went through the
steps that a decent
/ does to check to see to check and
isolate what the problem might be I
figured it out I narrowed it down to
that particular table and I was able to
address it by cleaning up some of the
table and so on that said it's not
normal for me to actually jump into the
guts of an app these days I'm just too
busy with everything else but I had to
at that particular moment I was up to
like 2 a.m. last night just you know
being sure I was doing things properly
so you know before you make any major
changes to your database in terms of the
records and so far be sure you have
everything backed up quite a bit and
test and retest so I was doing data
cleanup so what I did was I would first
do test make sure my MySQL query calls
SQL is the language of databases of
relational databases which is the most
popular type of database everybody uses
these days anyway so SQL structured
query language it's a language that is
structured and it's for querying which
is another word for asking questions of
a database anyhow so one of the things
you do before you do a big purge of your
data you backup everything and then I
test make sure my query is working which
just was a simple select with the same
where Clause the same where clause
criteria so make sure you know the
results you get back in the Select
statement pulls out the records that you
want and your double chip double-check
triple-check especially if you're out
one more one in the morning and normally
I would not advise this but you know we
were getting a lot of complaints so I
had to do something sorry about that the
camera stopped so I check to make sure
that my query logic was cool with the
Select to select is a non-destructive
query it just selects from the database
it doesn't remove anything and then yeah
I just checked it three four times
everything was cool then I executed the
delete to clean up stuff and yeah it
looks like everything is moving much
quicker sometimes when database tables
fill up with
million records are more in MySQL you
can have big slowdowns and I don't know
I have to check to see if the developers
properly index the table and so on I
haven't had time to check into that it
could be Wieck that's a big part of it
you can how you structure your table
have a huge impact in terms of
performance so I have to look into it
but fortunately because of the way we
manage our data in studio web where
student records are removed once they
finish the course and everybody has
everything is done it's for security
reasons but also helps with performance
as well anyway that's it I thought you'd
find us interesting my apologies for the
interruption since I've been using this
new high quality video format hopefully
the quality of videos improve but once
in a while for some reason the camera
just stops recording it's like it's
going it's too much and stops alright
much more to come I sorry I'm late with
everything in terms of YouTube and and
client-side stuff because I've just been
doing for a lot of work with the with
the institutional clients all right to
job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
