are two reasons to become an
entrepreneur to make the big money or to
go for the flexibility and the lifestyle
and the freedom I got some loans they
got some notes here so I've been an
entrepreneur my entire adult life I
started my first business when I started
planning the business when I was 17 I
sort of launched it part-time while
while I was going to school when I was
18 I started doing little deals and so
on at at the same time I was working as
a bouncer in a nightclub to pay the
bills and I was a bouncer because I was
able to work nights Thursday Friday
Saturday sometimes Wednesday and it
would free up the rest of the weekend
and the days for me to go to school and
or to sort of try to get the business
going and then what happened to me is
that it's all it's been a long time so
my excuse me if my months are also
around 18 or 19 years old
a lady team maybe 19 years old I got a
very serious blood disorder and long
story short it almost killed me and I
was on heavy heavy heavy duty drugs
prenez on diners all and a few others
just to keep my blood levels at is in a
safe level basically I had a bleeding
disease so like I would fall asleep and
the next day my head would be all
bruised from just the weight of my head
on the pillow
yeah I have pretty big head but you know
it shouldn't happen anyway so what
happened to me was there's a reason I'm
talking to blood this disease story
affected my decisions in terms of my
business career so I have this blood
disease I'm fighting it for about nine
months to a year and through Chinese
herbs believe it or not my chronic
incurable disease I was able to cure
with the help of a Chinese herbalist and
medical doctor it's and have a story if
people want to hear about it and so here
I am
why was getting the treatment Wow when
you're on heavy-duty steroids I was
going mental I was getting extremely
erratic and angry and from the steroids
amps yeah yeah amps you up so it's like
you're having a bad day every day and so
what happened is my Jeep
GPM a great book my grade point average
my GPA starts to drop now that it was
great to begin with but it starts to
drop quite a bit because of you know you
always in a rage cuz you're jacked up on
massive steroids so I decided to take a
leave from school when I guys today I'm
sick you know say okay take a leave and
I was gonna come back so I took a leave
from school and at the same time I quit
the bouncing job because when you have a
bleeding disease you can't have a
bouncing job so that I was my business
was there on the side and I just sort of
pick it percolating was starting to move
was starting to move there's always an
inertia period when you're starting a
business especially when you're young
you got understand when I started my
business at 18 it was not like today
today everybody is aware of on becoming
an entrepreneur is much more acceptable
in the culture almost for young people
to get him to entrepreneur a lifestyle
it's also a lot easier today because of
technology that's why I am I was seeking
to call my business battle plan course I
was gonna call an entrepreneur
entrepreneur because today any
entrepreneur no matter what type of
business you're in whether you're in
technology related business or a
restaurant or you're a butcher or you're
a lawyer
whatever you need you need to have an
understanding of technology so that you
can leverage it I'm talking
understanding where the basics of what
it takes to build a website so you can
make informed decisions the basics of
social media and social media marketing
again so you can make an informed
business decisions so even if you as an
entrepreneur you're not going to
implement your social media marketing
strategy you're not going to build your
site if you know the basics of HTML CSS
you just know the basics of it you will
be able to make smart decisions be able
to talk to nerds programmers developers
web designers web developers you be able
to talk to them and explain to exactly
what you're looking for in your site and
it'll save you a lot of money and
headaches in fact one of my friends he
has a business it does 2 million a year
or something and he tells me that one of
the most important skills he ever
learned was just basic HTML and CSS
basic stuff not only Reds code but just
by understanding that again he's able to
communicate with developers and
designers and he's able to get things
that much more quickly but it would have
would have otherwise especially in the
beginning in the beginning when he's
short on money having those basic skills
made it easy for him to put up his
WordPress site and his business as
always not technology his website which
is wordpress based is like key to his
whole business that that makes his
business anyway
would often a tangent my apology so I'm
young kid I I'm coming out of this blood
disease I just dropped out of school
because I was destroying my GPA and he
said to myself you know you know I mean
I was studying psychology and it's like
I went I went after I quit as a bouncer
because again I couldn't get punched
with a bleeding disease
I took a gig not a job but a gig as a
contract working in a cinema just doing
random maintenance and cleanup again I
was able to work at night freeing up my
days for my business now now I didn't go
to school and I decided to drop out of
school permanently at this point I had
intentions of going back but I never
ended up going back because the business
started working I decided not to go back
because I I was doing my undergrad in
psychology and I realized all the
popcorn girls they all had master's
degrees in psychology and I realized
well I could pop corn I could pop
popcorn with without a master's degree
so you know the value of it diminished
quite a bit and I also said to myself
you know I almost died at eighteen
nineteen
you know I can't afford to wait eight
years before you know because you do
psychology looking at least eight years
before you keep find yourself in
employment if you're lucky enough even
back then it was hard today I don't
forget about it and so I said I'm gonna
go full-time business see what sees see
what happens
I went full-time in business and I
became a workaholic
let's fast forward a few years at one
point you have to make a choice with
your business when you have success and
I think it's inevitable you can have
success if you structure your your
process properly and you're consistent
and you're persistent and you're
self-aware and you're self-critical and
you're able to see opportunity these are
all these things that you discuss in the
my course on this subject but at one
point you have to decide if you're gonna
go for the big money
or the big freedom the big money or the
big freedom and because of my health
issues and because why don't I was my
blood disease went away but who knows
could come back again five years later
10 years it happens all the time right
so I said to myself you know I'm gonna
go but for big freedom instead so what
happened is that when the company and
the earnings my earnings got to a point
where it was not only covering all my
bills but was able to save 50 60 80
percent on the dollar and through
passively essentially for through
residuals and just through the
mechanisms of the business because I
wasn't selling my time I was selling a
service that I said yeah I'm gonna take
it easy so I hid and to a reader lis
retirement if you will at 32 officially
I could have done it like a couple years
earlier but I want to be sure everything
was steady Eddie and they had developed
a nice big stash of a few and then I
just went into early retirement and for
about eight nine years I had enough my
business able worth maybe an hour a week
on it maybe I would do all kinds of
different things I have since got back
in because I saw other opportunity a
studio web as one of the things but also
you know after 8 9 years of drinking
coffee and having a brunch with people
it was time to do something you in fact
you get bored you get bored even though
I was doing things it was this unrelated
to business again when you go into
business at some point when the thing
starts to move you have to search decide
if you're going to be going for I said
the big money or the big freedom and the
two don't coincide right you have to you
have to assume
but you're not going to be the next
Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs so these are
unicorns these are very rare lucky lucky
people not taking away but there's a
huge amount of luck involved and the
strategy in fact in business
entrepreneurial activities if you will
is to is to hedge your bets meaning is
to to not expect huge successes to be
more be more aware of the potential
failures antis and to build up positions
one of the big illusions one of the big
myths in business is that you come up
with the brilliant idea and then you
execute and it's fantastic and you make
a fortune never happens that way the way
the big businesses and big successes
come about and the small successes is a
question is a is a process of refinement
and iterations just like software
development you come up with an initial
idea and you put it out there and you
get feedback from people and then you
start making changes accordingly studio
web is an example of that it's gone
through major major iterations over over
the years to to adapt according to the
needs of the client base and it
continues although it's pretty solid now
so you got to think of it that way so
big freedom versus big money at some
point you can scale up the business
which will be a huge amount of work and
at some point you can set it up so it's
becomes really self sustainable self
sustaining excuse me and it it more than
pays your bills and you can accumulate
wealth
most people get rich through a slow and
steady process of making three four or
five times the average person as opposed
to a thousand times the average person
but if you're making three four five six
seven times more than the average person
every year you make with somebody the
average person makes it seven eight
years in a few years you can retire
right and I'll leave you with this an
old story I remember back in the day
when I was still a young nerdling
entrepreneur nerd and I remember I was
listening to interview with an
entrepreneur who had retired and they
said it took took me ten years those
guys said it took me ten
to figure out how to do it and yeah and
then just two years to get it done
same thing happened with me by the way
so that's why I'm putting out these
videos I'm moving out towards
entrepreneur and code entrepreneur
because I have my coding courses covered
basically what you need to know and you
can go in any direction whether it be
professional developer or you want to be
an entrepreneur and leverage technology
it's all there so I don't need to get
into that anymore so I figure I'm going
to bring in the business end and the
entrepreneurial aspect of well I'm
setting up and starting a business
because this is this is a skill set that
you know I've been coding since the 90s
but I've been entrepreneur before VADs I
have several more years experience as a
business operator and so I figure I'm
going to bring this to my flogs will see
how people like it or not alright that's
it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
