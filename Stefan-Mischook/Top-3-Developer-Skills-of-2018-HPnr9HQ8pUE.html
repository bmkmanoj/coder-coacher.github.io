and well Happy New Year I'm recording
this just a few hours before New Year
because I'm a major youtubing nerd so in
this video I'm gonna go over the top
three skills that a freelance developer
needs to know in 2018 skill set number
one you have to understand the core of
programming the big mistake that noobs
noob developers doesn't matter what type
of development you want to do whether
you want to do app development for
smartphones whether you want to do web
app development wizard whether you want
to get into AI machine learning etc etc
etc doesn't matter the type of
development the big mistake that noobs
or people want to get into is that they
think that they should build projects
building projects is a necessary step
but before that you have to do number
one you have to learn the core of
programming which is the foundations I
call it the core other people might say
it's the fundamentals the foundations
why do you need to learn this well
practically when you learn your core
well all of a sudden all those
project-based tutorials that you see on
YouTube or anywhere else all sudden
they're so much easier to learn with to
work with because most of those
walkthrough videos those projects they
don't actually teach you the core of the
programming they don't tell you what's
actually going on they show you how to
do something but you don't teach you why
and without the why the how is useless
as I said in other videos if you just
learn how to play 10 songs if you were
learning to play guitar you're not gonna
be a musician you're just gonna know how
to play those 10 songs to learn how to
be a great guitarist you have to
understand chords chord progressions
flat sharp minor chords major chords you
have to understand the difficult with
the different courts are you have to
understand the scales blues jazz etc etc
etc etc etc etc etc same thing with
programming you have to understand the
foundations around languages because all
these programming language
and these coding languages coding
languages are like HTML and CSS
programming languages well programming
languages are coding languages too but
their programming languages in that
program programming languages allow you
to put decision-making capability into
your code anyhow all these languages are
basically controls think of them as
levers of controls that allow you to
control the underlying infrastructure
that you're manipulating you're
controlling with these languages these
languages are basically you giving
commands to your computer in a language
that they understand to do things like
build a shopping cart system build an AI
build a user interface add a button the
excetera etc etc etc so if you don't
understand what this foundation is you
don't understand this core then you're
gonna have a much more difficult time
learning how to program so first thing
you should do is master the core because
a it's gonna supercharge the speed at
which you learn how to become a
professional developer and B is going to
make you a much better developer in n as
opposed to you fishing around trying to
figure things out now in my career as a
coder when I started in 1990s I started
off sort of learning on an e - nerd
basis but when I got wiser I started
diving deep into the core of the
languages understanding that
infrastructure I just talked about and
what happened when I went in that
direction my ability to write code just
went sky rocketed so I would walk into a
particular job and I would look at the
job and I would say ok we're going to
use this language here we're gonna use
this framework there I wasn't somebody
was saying I'm a Java programmer or I'm
a JavaScript coder I'm a PHP guy I'm the
Python guy no I was a developer and a
developer who could look at any language
and use it to do the job the job would
dictate the language even I had to learn
a new one here's the great thing you
learn in the core learning a new
programming language will be like this
tip number two for developers freelance
developers in 2018
you have to develop good communication
skills written skills write concise
clean sentences good emails good letters
so that people can get to the point of
the email that you're sending them so
they can understand the proposals that
you're sending them very very quickly in
the business world nobody wants to read
ten pages or even one page you want to
get to quickly you're going to learn how
to write well great communication skills
are very very important great or great
verbal skills I don't want to say oral
skills great verbal skills are also
important because again your ability to
communicate to the non nerds the
businesspeople the suits your ability to
communicate to them in non nerd words is
going to put you way above the nerds who
spent their time learning some new
framework but they have no demand for at
that particular time your ability to
communicate to the non nerds in suits is
going to pay off huge so develop good
communication skills as well tip number
three for the freelance developer in
2018 you have to start working on
marketing understanding how to market
yourself if you're freelancer you are
essentially selling yourself as a
skilled professional so you have to
learn to market yourself on the web
that's where most people get their
information so how do you do that first
thing you got to do is build a good
website now if you're selling back-end
developer skills doing the backend
programming you don't necessarily need
to have a super beautiful site but you
need to have a site that looks pro which
you can do if you have no design skills
is to get a good template very simple
very clean and just have a good logo
some very nice images and again keep it
simple keep it pithy so that people
don't get bored reading your site now
here's another tip related to that
whatever you do don't have a dark
background on your site with
light colored text you have to have a
weight ish or weight background like an
eggshell weighs best with dark text
don't do the reverse unless you have a
nightclub but you're not you don't have
a nightclub you're developer you're
freelance developer you have to have a
whitish background off-white because
stark white is is too harsh with black
text or dark text much easy to read and
your conversions are gonna be much much
higher trust me on that one it's a big
mistake a lot of people make dark
backgrounds with like color text is a
big no-no should be the reverse and
there you have it for 2018 as a
freelance developer doesn't matter what
type of developer you are you need to
number one understand the core that's
the how and the why you need that why
number two you need to develop good
communication skills both written and
spoken and finally you need to start
learning how to market yourself online
website number one also social media
should have mentioned that before social
media as well have a good presence keep
it up to date doesn't have to be furious
but weekly article weekly comment
article article could be nice and simple
just a few paragraphs etc etc Center I
can get more into this in other vlogs
but these are the three skill sets again
this is based on my 20 years experience
as a developer somebody who hires
developer who's been hired as a
developer who works with several
companies who've hired people I hire
developers myself I just said that
anyway you get the idea there you go
have yourself a great 2018 Happy New
Year don't drink and drive I know it
sounds cliche but don't ruin yourself
for some stupid night of partying take
an uber or lyft or whatever if you
decide you're going to drink tonight
that's it bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
