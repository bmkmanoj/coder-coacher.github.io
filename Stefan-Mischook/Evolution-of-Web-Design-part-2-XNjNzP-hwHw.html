bubble burst and in about 2002 2003 all
of this had been brewing for a while
since 2000 or earlier the web standards
started taking hold and basically it
became as big movement were a bunch of
nerds pushed through and the browser
makers Mozilla helps a lot with this as
well the idea that the browser should
support the technology and standards
technology i'm not going to get into the
whole history of that but essentially
what happened so i think for the first
time in about 2002 2003 there was a
clear separation between a graphic
designer and a web designer a web
designer had to have a unique set of
skill sets form a whole process of web
design they had to understand HTML they
had to understand CSS they had to
understand usability and you had to
understand the idea of separation from
structure from style you had to have
said all these different things where
his back in the 90s these were at best
an afterthought you have most web
designers I have to say back in 90s had
it hot trouble with you know that
hyperlink tag things have changed so
there was this clearly this big movement
from web designer / graphic designer to
pure web designer and I think the birth
of the web design professional really
came into play in the early 2000s
with the rise of web 2.0 you know Ajax
dynamic sites all the things I talked
about the beginning of this video this
is now uh sure in the new web designer
and a new web professional web designer
web professional is somebody who has all
the knowledge that the previous
evolution brought into our hands you
open the CSS the HTML the usability the
separation of content and structure but
the new guy also has to go two steps
worker they have to understand the
blog's lift on stem JavaScript they have
to understand the basis of Ajax they
understand the basic of a server-side
programming language i recommend PHP
because it's ubiquitous because it's
everywhere so the web two point O web
designer is that modern designer those
who embrace that as they are some are
you see them now web designers who will
work exclusively off of a blog platform
like wordpress they have a lot of
success these guys have a huge
competitive advantage over those who
just do traditional HTML and CSS work
if you're still not convinced of how
important it is to move with the times
and to embrace this new web professional
I just described but me let me give you
a quick little story I was recently
talking to an old acquaintance of mine
old friend of mine and he was around
during the dot-com bubble days with me
in the mid-90s and he had stopped doing
web design web development I guess in
two thousand before the new web designer
came out before the HTML CSS web
standards guys came about and he
recently got back into its a maybe a
year ago a year and a half ago and he
was still using 1990s web design
techniques and the 1990s web design
workflow and he calls me up and it's
been have been a few years since I
spoken to him and he was flabbergasted
flabbergasted at how dramatic the
changes have become in the web like in
those days you can understand CSS was
just some quirky technology that one day
would be extremely useful and we did
really pay much attention to it because
it just didn't work in the browser so it
was a waste of time and when he saw that
how CSS was now just as important and
actually in many regards more important
than HTML and he saw how the whole
workflow changed and now he's out there
trying to provide web design services
and he gets the occasional gauge but
he's now working at a severe
disadvantage to other web designers
who've adopted the modern techniques and
he's realized that he has to learn a new
way of doing things otherwise he just
cannot compete in in the world out there
and of course he sees a huge advantages
of the evolution from 1996 web design
style to modern 2000s
web design style and now I was talking
to him yeah you learned all that but
guess what you also have to learn you
have to learn the web two point O is now
if you really want to compete
I'm Steph miss check i hope you found
this blog post podcast video whatever
you want to call it interesting and
