all finished with this admin side of
will be press one thing I need to do is
I need to set up the featured image size
I'm going to go back to Kota in my
functions that PHP file go all the way
to the top the twenty ten theme function
dot PHP file sets the default size for
those featured images and they set it to
a very large size that i need to change
so i need to need to go down and find it
and here's the post thumbnails line that
adds theme support for those post
thumbnails but what I'm specifically
looking for is just a little bit below
it here set post thumbnail size and
instead of using these constants I'm
going to set it to two hundred and two
hundred let me go ahead and save that
now go back to the admin just going to
refresh the page and let's go ahead and
add our image and I'm going to open up
t-shirt 1.jpg I have included these
images with the source file so you can
use them if you want
ok so I'm going to use I use this
featured image and close this out and I
believe that set for this particular
product so update and let's go ahead and
add a couple other products and t-shirt
number two
and also put this in the t-shirt section
add a featured image
and I believe that's it so we're going
public this one too
and publish this and then one final
product and in this case I'm going to
leave this particular item without a
featured image just leave it blank and
i'll show you how we work with that a
little bit okay so you notice we have
two t-shirts sweatshirts and one pair of
jeans and we don't have anything the
dress sure its category and i'll show
you that a little bit how to handle when
you don't have any products in that
particular category so the last thing i
need to do in the admin is go to under
the appearance section go to the menus
i'm going to create a new menu i'm going
to call this products and it looks like
it isn't showing immediately i want to
show the who is it
oh here we go just miss down the second
line okay the product types and i want
to add all these different types to our
menu and then i'm going to move to these
items into this section we order them as
I see fit so I save my menu and the last
thing I need to do is go to the widget
section and remove all this stuff I
don't really need it but I am going to
go ahead and include a custom menu
widget and call it product navigation
and it's going to use the products menu
so save and let's take a look at the
front end there we go so we have our
products navigation set up and let's
take a look and see how things look so
far so we have a product's navigation
it's just showing things in the standard
post template and we want to do a little
bit of tweaking to that
so we're about halfway through this
tutorial now we have basically all the
backend stuff within the WordPress admin
done now it's just a matter of adjusting
the front end so you notice at the
moment let's go home let's go to the
clothing section I mean this section is
showing products but we need to improve
the styling you need to add post
thumbnails it might be nice to have the
meringue excuse me displaying in rows
perhaps this blog archives need to be
changed and specify which section we're
looking at products jeans t-shirts you
know whatever so the first step I'm
going to go back to Kota and we need to
come up with a template for everything
that appears within the product type
taxonomy and one other thing I forgot to
mention you'll notice that items on this
page are being displayed by date we
actually want them displayed
alphabetically so I'm going to go ahead
and tweak that as well so I'm going to
duplicate my category PHP file and I'm
going to rename it taxonomy dash what
did we call ours type
okay so this is the template that's
going to be used whenever we access our
particular taxonomy and I need to make a
couple changes first of all I need to be
able to get information about the
taxonomy the visitors viewing and we're
going to do that by going creating a
trim variable and we're going to use the
get turn by function and pass in a
couple arguments slug get query bar
Porter and get query bar for taxonomy
and then the second line we need to
tweak the order in which items appear so
I'm going to do posts equals query posts
and this is going to change the query
string that specifies which products
display and in what order they display
and we're going to set that equal to the
existing query string and we're going to
add on to it ampersand whatever x equals
title so this will order by the title of
the product in another ampersand &amp;amp; Order
equals a SC for ascending
so this line is what controls the order
of the products on the page and then
let's go down a little bit we need to
tweak this instead of category archives
i'm going to use product category like
so and instead of the single cat title
i'm going to delete this instead use the
term variable and pass in the trim name
and instead of category description
let's see do i need to do this yes I do
um can delete this line and into the
category description i can use term
description so if the term description
is not empty i'm going to go ahead and
echo that out
like so and I believe it would good on
this particular file yep so you notice
now we have product category clothing
and that will change depending on what
section we look at and if we go to the
clothing section you'll notice that all
products are now ordered alphabetically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
