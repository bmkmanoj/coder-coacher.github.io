killer sights calm and killer PHP calm
this is a first of many video blogs I'm
going to start producing now I've
haven't done many in a long time we've
just been really busy at killer sites
with upgrades and having lots of new
content and so on anyhow the video blog
is different from the prepared videos in
that first of all you see a live video
of me and these videos will not be
edited because I just you know I just
don't have the time and I'm just too
lazy to edit the videos so I figure I'm
just going to speak as I would having a
normal conversation and we'll talk about
different things related to web
programming and web design in this
particular video I want to address an
email that was recently sent to me by
this guy in Greece this guy named
diagnosis and basically he sent me an
email talking about asking whether or
not it made sense to build a wordpress a
blogging engine or CMS like Drupal to
build something from scratch with the
idea of looking more professional and
having more control versus using one of
these packages these open source
packages like Drupal like WordPress like
Joomla and he got an opinion but from
somebody I don't know his person was and
they were saying that it made more sense
to build your own from scratch because
you look more professional so I answered
him and in the email I'm not gonna read
the email
I wrote word for word cuz I'm I'm not
very good at doing that in the first
place but let me get a quick answer
unless you're coming up with some sort
of newfangled CMS content management
system or newfangled blogging engine
mint is unlike anything else done before
it makes zero sense to bill
build a blog or our CMS edge it from
scratch it really does because first of
all for most of us there's probably no
way you could compete against the
probably tens of thousands of man-hours
put into building or press or building
rapport building Joomla Dave you're
gonna see a much more refined codebase
you're gonna see a much more thought-out
code basement which you probably can
produce simply because you know 10,000
hours versus you know you're you working
alone on your own project or what
somebody else again unless you have
something really revolutionary totally
different it there's no way you can
compete against these established
products like WordPress or Joomla
another thing you have to consider is
that moving forward you know as systems
become more evolved on the web you know
blogging systems and content management
systems again if you use a WordPress or
Drupal Drupal you're gonna find that
you're gonna get all the updates for
free whereas if you roll out your old
from scratch you're gonna have to build
all these updates and changes which
could be very time-consuming
so again unless you're doing something
that's totally drastic and new in the
way of thinking about how to design a
blog or a content management system
you're not gonna be able to compete and
another thing is you know a lot of
people will come to expect to use these
products so to know them from the get-go
makes a sense as well so today yeah the
perception of professionalism with
regards to building your own yeah it
looks kind of cool I suppose had to have
it on the resume trust me built my own
systems from scratch in the past so she
back in the late 90s early 2000s when
these type of things were not
readily available a lot of times you
rolled you're all out but now in the end
I don't think people are going to really
care too much whether or not you've
created your own or you're just
leveraging WordPress or something the
one exception again or the other
exception perhaps is in a situation
where maybe you want to get into the
business of creating a blog or CMS and
to sell that and there might be a viable
business model there I don't know and
you would have to look at that look at
that yourself but if that's not your
primary business or option hey I
mentioned or unless if you don't have
something very specific some special
type of CMS or blog you want to you want
to create then there's absolutely no
reason to build these things from
scratch remember the top three rules of
programming at number one is reuse
number two is reuse and number three is
reuse keep that in mind so whenever you
approach any project whether it is to
build a blog or a CMS or forum or
whatever the first thing you should be
doing is looking at what's out there and
seeing if you can leverage open source
or even commercial tools that have where
you can MUX with the code open source so
that's just my my two cents from my
nearly 15 or so years of web programming
experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
