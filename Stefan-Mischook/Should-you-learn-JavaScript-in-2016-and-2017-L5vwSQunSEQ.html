JavaScript in 2016-2017 and going
forward short answer is yes javascript
is now the most popular programming
language in the world it's got a bit of
quirks to it and it actually can be a
bit of a mind screw once in a while
because it works in weird ways compared
to other languages out there that's for
sure like for instance Java which is a
much heavier language a much more for
both syntax meaning you write a lot of
code they get stuff done with Java it's
actually easier to learn in many
respects because the language is more
consistent in terms the actual syntax
and in the way it works it's hard to
explain but if you get into it you'll
see that so should i what I learn in
2016-17 of course yes javascript is
hugely important it's the only language
of the web browsers if you want to do
any of the Ajax stuff synchronous coding
you want to do any of the html5 stuff
animation web browsers you want to do
mobile app development using the html5
stack which is very very popular you got
to know JavaScript no kidding if you do
web apps you're going to do a whether
you're back in is Ruby PHP Django Java
c-sharp you're going to do JavaScript so
javascript is a hugely important
language and now I'm hearing that Java
scripts now being used now in IOT
Internet of Things so that's pretty
crazy stuff so you got frameworks so
JavaScript you know for all - warts and
you know you know javascript is actually
the first programming language I believe
I learned back in 95 96 whenever it came
out the first year although you know it
wasn't very useful back then compared to
today javascript is not only used in the
web browser is not only used create
mobile apps now IOT Internet of Things
is actually also used of course on the
server with projects like nodejs
and others now it's immature in many
respects insert you know it's going to
take a couple more years before
good save in JavaScript on the server
side is as mature as say PHP or C sharp
or Django or Python or rails but it's
coming along and it's got some real cool
things I would use still we use
JavaScript on the server for something
called a micro service where you use it
for JavaScript is strong my synchronous
communications and stuff like that I've
talked about that hub of videos so yeah
I would definitely be learning a
JavaScript in 2016-17 now do you make it
your main programming language that
depends on the type of work you want to
do so you learn a bit of JavaScript you
can start with the basics learn the
client-side JavaScript meaning the
JavaScript the traditional JavaScript
works in the web browser and then from
there you can check out what type of
career you want to get into kind of work
you want to get into it you want to get
into mobile app development then yeah
you learn JavaScript with the html5
stack size html5 css3 javascript and
then you learn what are those middle
layers it allows you to take your html5
stack by the way html5 stack is html5
css3 javascript such as we call it the
stack mall called the stack anyway so
you take that html5 stack and then you
use it through a translation matrix I'm
going Cordova as an example open source
free takes all takes your html5 mobile
apps converts it so works on iOS works
on Android works on Windows 10 no
problemo
so it's kind of cool and a lot of big
companies are moving in that direction
you're saying instead of writing and
happen Java for Android and having to
write it from scratch again for iOS
using objective-c or these days Swift
people say no 99% of apps can be done
with html5 and it's just getting better
because the JavaScript engines are
getting better too getting faster and I
think that's where it's going to go so
yeah learn JavaScript pay attention to
how much you learn how much you dedicate
to it depends on what your career goals
are if you want to do server-side web
apps and stuff I recommend especially if
you're freelancer you put more effort of
course into PHP on the server side and
JavaScript your secondary on
server if use it at all so depends on
what you want to do but yes jazz was
extremely important and I'm if I were a
why not if I were I advocate these days
that people learn html5 css3 javascript
first three coding languages that you
learn those three are super important
and then from there you can decide what
you want to do depending on your career
I talked about you know where Python
sits where javis it's where PHP sits
where Ruby sits Ruby sits at the back of
the bus now so anyway a little dig at
Ruby just because the Ruby guys are
going to scream and cry don't get me
wrong
nice language all language has the
program pros and cons but anyway yes
JavaScript learned some even if you're
just going to do a little bit it's super
important in 2016 2017 and beyond
alright that's it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
