had a very interesting lunch with a
former employee of mine a friend of mine
who now is a CTO of a company that have
just closed their Series A funding I
believe to date they have raised six and
a half million for their startup and
yeah he's supposed to come in and talk
to me about his experience working with
the the VC's developing his startup
raising millions of dollars and so on so
this is somebody who came right out of
school started working with me and I
trained him up and he got really good so
now he's the CTO of his own business so
that's very cool
one thing he was pointing out to me is
how it's so hard still to find competent
well trained web developers this is
something interesting because people are
all excited about AI programming and
maybe cryptocurrency programming and
there's lots of opportunity there but
you know where there's a huge amount of
opportunity especially for freelancers
good old-fashioned web development if
you're trained properly if you know what
you're doing so he was talking about how
a mutual friend of ours in fact called
him up looking for web developers
desperately trying to find web
developers to help work on their
WordPress based site and a little bit
more and they've been trying for a year
and a half trying to find competent
people and they they work at it they
find some company or something some
freelancers and they just do a bad job
and they got to find more and they're so
desperate they're spending 25 30 grand
easily to build out a new wordpress
based site and they're happy to spend
the money because they just can't find
the people and he was telling me about
another friend of his somebody I knew as
well who had the same experience they
hired a web development firm spent about
$20,000 on a site that they were
developing and still turned out to be a
disaster project for them again being
able to find competent web developers
these days is still
very very very difficult now people may
be looking at what development say is
that kind of old school staff you know
people been developing since the 1990s
well compared to AI yes it's old school
compared to cryptocurrency stuff it's
old school but here's the thing in the
grand scheme of things a 20 year old
industry it's still very very very young
and the fact that it matter is that's
still to this day there's a huge demand
there's a huge demand for competent web
developers these days I have a hard time
finding good web developers to work for
me and I have a huge selection of people
to choose from now don't send resumes
now hooked up now I got my good people
in place now but even me I have
difficulty finding people and I have a
lot of contacts and connections and even
though I do find good people I still
have to get them up to speed in terms of
what I do and how I want things built
and done this is for the ongoing studio
web development which is of course PHP
laravel based could have done in any
language and he could have done a good
job with it in Python Django I could
have done a good job with Ruby rails
even or Java or.net as I've said in many
other videos many of the languages out
there and frameworks out there are very
good today they've all pretty much
normalized what I mean by that is we
figured out over the last 15 20 years
what works what doesn't work and all the
major players have implemented it so
when it comes down to when you're
choosing a technology or a framework for
web development you have to choose
something that makes sense for your
particular needs in terms of what you
like to work with you may just prefer
working with Python you just like the
language you may prefer to working with
PHP you just like the language you may
prefer working with JavaScript you just
like the language and saving with the
frameworks because all the frameworks
all languages are preening that much
neck-and-neck for the most part now
there are areas where certain languages
are better
just because of a particular use case
I've discussed use cases before and so
for instance if you're doing AI you
could do ML an AI with PHP I've seen
actual people do it with PHP but that's
not the language to do AI pH in ml if
you do that with Python or maybe R
something I would do it Python so you
have a lot more flexibility there but if
you're doing web apps specially if
you're doing freelance web work again
because of a business environment
because of what's out there because 85
percent of small businesses probably use
a PHP based system on their web site
because WordPress is PHP pays because
Drew Powell's PHP paste if you learn PHP
development you're gonna have a huge
huge advantage web developers in 2018
are gonna be printing money if they do
PHP or pressed about mint and you go
into freelance you think making 30 bucks
the hours but that's good but if you get
into the freelance space with PHP
WordPress in time as you develop your
workflows as you develop your client
base you could be making $300 an hour or
more for your time but you get to there
over a period of time as you develop
again you're going to develop skill sets
workflows contacts your ability to work
with clients to get there quickest learn
the core the core is key as watch at the
core learning the latest framework
learning even a brand new programming
language will be easy for you if you do
your core training in addition to that
because it's very popular in my Python
course where I have Python
specializations and I also teach Python
career paths I will be adding that to my
interactive web developer course very
soon so if you get it now it will you
have access to it for free of course and
I get into the three career paths of web
development that is the getting a job
become a freelancer developing your own
web apps and the other thing I'm gonna
get into is the career while the
specialization so whether the helper
specializations that you can
to front-end developer weather scales
were the pros and cons how does it
affect your ability to make money get a
job business full stack web developer
you're doing a friend and the backend
with emphasis on the backend and then
finally getting to WordPress development
CMS development that is kind of a niche
in there as well it's a specialization
Oh help you to understand what the skill
sets required for that what does that
all mean in terms of your business etc
like you I'm assuming you're like me
where you want to learn this stuff
because you want to make money at the
end of the day you want to make money
whether you want to get on a very high
paying job where you're respected where
you have a lot of flexibility there or
maybe you want to become a freelancer
where you have ultimate flexibility
ultimate earning potential it's a lot of
fun it's creative or maybe you want to
build your own web app or your own
website you have an idea for a website
or a web app that you think that could
address some sort of market niche then
you know learning the core having those
fundamentals is a key to all that so
there you go I hope you found this vlog
useful once again for 2018 if you got
the good web developer chops you could
make a lot of money a lot of money lots
of opportunity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
