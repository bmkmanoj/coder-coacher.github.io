blogging because I have a very sore
throat laryngitis actually can't speak
too much but I have some interesting
things coming down the pike or pipe I
think it spiked anyway
new things coming up number one I'm
going to be I think I'm going to do a
little miniseries on rewriting an old
app now I see studio Webb is at version
3 but the code base it's closed soon it
could be seven years old now or more
it's hard to I have to think back though
it's runs well and it's pretty much bug
free it does have some fundamental
problems from being a seven year old
codebase having had multiple developers
work on the codebase and to be totally
honest me my fault for not paying close
attention to some very crucial stages of
the apps development life where I was
not directly involved in some aspects of
the architecture where frankly I wasn't
into it and I let people take care of it
and now we have a mess and the mess is
is that the app is very hard now to
update you do a little update here and
then you break something over here and
you do update there and you break
something there so adding anything but
very superficial updates to the software
is extremely problematic and that is the
no.1 reason why you should have very
clean simple code why you should adhere
strictly to particular standards in
terms of your code and in terms of the
architecture so the last thing you want
to do as a developer is to rewrite an
app that works from scratch and it's
largely largely a judgment call as to
when you're going to pull that trigger
and you are going to actually rewrite
from scratch so we're doing it for
several reasons first reason I just
the second reason in the last seven
years there has been new frameworks and
architectures that have been made
available so I decided that I wanted to
take advantage of those new
architectures as well because of what I
want to implement end
Judis to do web app going forward so I
think what I might do depending on the
time and so forth is come out with a
series of videos where I go over step by
step as we're going through the process
of the rewrite and I sort of give you a
peek into some of our decision-making
processes right from the architectural
design start moving forward a so I'm
going to be directly involved everything
from the database design architectural
choices it serves as a database app
design architectural choices why we're
going to be doing this and that the
other thing for example if you're
looking at an app that has a growing
user base how should you scale out
database or several strategies so we're
going to look at the different
strategies why you'd want to go one or
the other
again there's no universal right or
wrong answer in this situation because
it's all circumstantial it's like what's
the best type of vehicle well are you
going on a highway but maybe a sports
car German sports car are you going
off-roading then you want a jeep Exeter
Exeter you get the idea so I'm going to
be looking at these type of things and
these are architectural choices they're
gonna have to be made for City web
mindful of what the app does now there's
the first thing you do is when you
rewrite from scratch you want to
reproduce all the function you know the
functionality of the app you have in
place now the app that people like the
app that's been proven in addition to
that within the context of the
architecture you have to consider what
are the future features that you want to
implement so you have to be mindful of
the big picture now the advantage of the
rewrite is that you're well aware of
what works what doesn't work you know
what you want and you know how to
achieve certain things the core app
you're also very aware of the
case meaning you're very aware of what
your users what so as a results you can
really design your architectures on the
database level on the business object
level turns the framework that you
choose even turns on a platform ie
language that you choose this is all
impacted by your knowledge of the use
case that's why in previous videos I
mentioned if you have an agreement say
in biology or chemistry or accounting or
something and then you decide to go into
programming into code you could be very
valuable to certain companies because
you will have what they call domain
knowledge if you for instance our
practicing accountant and then you go to
coding for a company that works on
accounting software your knowledge of
counting especially if you have
real-world skills in accounting will
come extremely handy in terms of you
building a really good accounting app
because you're gonna know what
accountants are looking for now with
Cydia web I had been teaching cold for
several years at this point for my
videos and mentoring and so forth so
when I built the first when we built
rather the first prototype first to do
web app I didn't write the code and
still have the time to write the code
these days I really I got about 75% of
it correct I would say give or take you
know right off the bat because I really
understood how people best learned how
to code and said I understood that from
years and years and years of experience
also from the fact that might come from
a family of teachers my father's a
teacher and suckles cousins etc my
brother taught so we have a lot of
experience in teaching a family I was
surrounded by a man told entire life so
that experience of that instinct of
teaching and especially teaching a code
gave the suti web app a huge advantage
the great foundation from the get-go and
then over the years working with
different schools and teachers and many
districts and so forth we were able to
further refine the app so in all those
refinements burying the dirty code
got in there got in there because of the
changes to the app based on user
reaction or user input for to us rather
but also because I was slacking at one
point and not paying attention to coach
ices and architectural choices as the
app was being developed over time I'm
not gonna make that mistake again
so anyway we got to this this is
supposed to be a short fly we're already
at 7 minutes so I'll stop it here
I don't know when either to come out
with a new one I can the throat yes you
can hear the voice is very weak so
hopefully soon but yes I think that
series I think rewriting studio web
might be an interesting little series
for you guys in terms of sneak peaking
I'd tell the process goes and I think
they'll be videos of myself and my two
senior developers who are highly
experienced guys then we're going to be
going over every aspect of the app in
terms of high level architecture I
thought we're not going to sit there and
watch them write code that would be kind
of I think boring but in terms of
architectures and decision making why
we're making certain decisions I think
that might be a big part of it if this
style presentation or this subject
rather is interesting let me know put in
the comments below thumbs up this video
yeah yeah yeah don't worry the other
series like the entrepreneurial series I
will continue to put those out again I
throat saving with the Python course
again my throat and also just work so
it's my day-to-day job has been pulling
me away besides the throat problems but
soon as this gets better for I'll be
rebuke I'll be finishing up to Python
course we got like 24 video lessons out
there now two and a half hours of
material I'm not sure how many more will
be it'll probably be another at least an
hour and a half of material to complete
this this intro intro to Python which so
far base all the columns they've got
people love it anyway that's it for now
have a good weekend I'm recording this
on Friday bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
