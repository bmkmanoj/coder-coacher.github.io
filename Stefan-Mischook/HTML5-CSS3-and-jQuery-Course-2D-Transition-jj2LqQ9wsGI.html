different what I want to introduce to
you is the ability of animating some of
those transforms that we saw last time
if you remember and you're following
along with your progress you probably
have a skew but you'll notice that my
skew is seemingly gone it's actually
still there the only difference is I've
changed the background color back to
this sort of off-white color that I have
here and the reason I've done that is
because now what I want to do is create
a sort of animated rollover where I roll
over this and we'll see the colors start
changing in fact since we're going to
have a gray background I'll even change
this to a wider background as well so
let's see how to do that well if we
return back to your editor you'll notice
that my header p is exactly the same as
what we saw before the only difference
being is that I happen to have changed
the background color it was the same
background color the triple-eight but
I've changed it to this one here but
other than that everything else seems
exactly the same as what you had in your
progress from the last video so I'm
going to keep the skewed transform as
you can see here the only thing I really
want to do is to change the background
color and to change the color of the
text itself so how do we do that well
let's see I'm just going to paste in a
little bit of information that I just
written and you'll see here that I have
a little comment that says css3
transition I'm not going to put the same
comments because by now you should be
familiar with them one thing that you
will see that does happen to be or is
omitted is the fact that there's no ms
transform IE 9 and what you notice here
is that i have transitions for WebKit
opera mozilla and here's the basic
transition property declaration so what
this is telling us is that yes you might
have imagined already but internet
explorer even nine does not support
transitions in css3 you're going to have
to work with animation in different ways
in that particular browser nevertheless
here I have css3 transitions by the way
what would happen in that browser is my
website going to break and crumble into
a million pieces now it'll just look
like it does right now without the
animation so not really a big deal
however let's take a look here and see
what we can do so you'll notice
similarly to what I did with the
transform first and foremost we have a
transition property in in other words
indicating well which is the property
that I want to transform now you'll
notice if I will later on when we work
with the rotation that happens to be a
transform property so you could have
just come in here and written WebKit
transition and I could have said well
transform if it's the one that I the
property that I want to change however
I'm going the easy route because we're
changing two properties we're changing
color and we're changing background
color so in order to accommodate that in
the most efficient means possible I'm
just going to declare this overall
declaration of all transform everything
all the different properties in CSS can
be set to animate using the css3
transition property is that fun great so
notice this the transition property is
set to all animate everything whenever
you want however you want and I've set a
transition duration of point five
seconds I found the one second a little
laggy a little slow I mean it is one
second but I wanted to cut that in half
and also gives me the opportunity to
show you how to do that to speed things
up so I just made it like point five
seconds half a second long so let's take
a look in WebKit we have to say WebKit
transition and we can give the direct
relation at the same time in Opera we're
giving a property declaration and then a
duration declaration same thing with
Mozilla so let's see what's going to
happen well nothing's going to happen
what do I mean well because at this
particular moment in time i'm going to
copy the selector that we're using for
the header paragraph right now all we're
saying is for that paragraph
these are the things that I want you to
be able to animate and this is how long
I want that animation to take place but
we do have to add some more information
in other words i'm just going to close
this for a second no i'm not going to
copy paste the exact same information
but what I will do is to say that header
p selector let's add a hover State for
it in other words a rollover state for
it and what do we want to do in this
well all we need to declare is what are
the things that I want you to change so
in other words i want you to animate
since we have all of these possibilities
quite literally i could animate anything
that i have here by the way but the only
ones that I'm really concerned with is
the color of the text actually I could
come in here just use my little finder
color of the text and at the same time
I'm going to put the color of the text
being that off-white that sort of
background color that we have and if
you're following along its f2 f3 ed and
I'll put the semicolon then I'm also
going to include the background color
and the background color we're going to
make that same grey that we were using
elsewhere the triple-eight gray all
right well let's save this now first of
all let's look at it one more time I'm
going to make a separation here so you
could read that a little bit better so
within the header p selector so anyways
the paragraph inside of header it's got
all these declarations we've indicated
that we wanted it to be transformed in a
two-dimensional skew and we also told
that paragraph to say hey listen be
ready to transition all properties in
half a second length then on the header
peas hover we said well these are the
two properties i want you to transition
and it will take half a second to do
just that and i could put in more if i
want it to but right now i think that'll
suffice so i'm going to save this then
we're going to jump on over to Safari
preview that in my browser by refreshing
and check
what a nice rollover effect right and
that's great so whatever you happen to
have here you can create a animate our
an animated transition or rollover just
by indicating that information that i
showed you before so when we come back
in the next video we're going to do the
same thing for this logo here and
instead of using the background we're
just going to rotate a transform so come
back and we'll see how to do just that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
