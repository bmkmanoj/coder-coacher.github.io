I'll be showing you how to work with a
real amazing tool which is a new part of
cs4 that's called the bone tool it's
really fun and as you'll see when we
start playing with it you'll quickly get
addicted to working with it it's
something that's very convenient
something that's more closely associated
with other 3d drawing programs but
actually as you can see with some of the
later tutorials flash now has some 3d
drawing capabilities as well because of
that we start to see a lot of different
things inside of this version of cs4
well anyways here's the bone tool so one
of the first things i'm going to show
you is what if we were to use the bone
tool and do so with something that is
more along the lines of let's see a
shape tween animation so as you can see
I've got this very basic shape I'm going
to take my black arrow and delete that
with my selection tool so now I've just
got this very basic shape actually let's
try that again delete that only got the
basic shape now if I wanted to create
something with this with a shape tween
and you know I'd be rather limited as to
what i could do with it but with the
bone tool you can do some pretty amazing
things so for example let's take a look
at this if I were to come in here and
start clicking on these things once and
then twice and then maybe three times so
now i'm just going to change the color
so you can see it better
and we'll use something like red and
then you can see that everything that
was on the previous layer for example
the shape was on this layer one but now
it's empty so I can delete it what
you're left with is something called an
armature and an armature allows you to
use this tool use the black selection
tool whichever one you want but as soon
as you select the item you can see that
it has a bone system in place so let's
take a look at what you can do with that
Wow check it out really fun you can like
twist it around move your shapes in and
out move them this way and let's say we
want to create some animation so for
example if I start like this I can go to
15 and say insert opposed what that
means is just as you would with any
other sort of style of animation I've
got a new pose here
and you can move your object in any
particular way for that particular pose
and then let's say we come to frame 30
and at this point I'm going to insert
another pose if I bring it back
approximately to the same area that it
was up at again inc an kind of create
sort of a looping effect now take for
take for granted here that what we're
seeing is not exactly what I'd like at
that point so you can see that at this
stage in the game I want this to maybe
we up here and then if we were to move
things along you can see that that's
showing us what's going on there now if
you wanted to you know move things a
little bit better than what we had them
before may have to sort of slowly add
more keyframes but for lack of time here
on just adding things slowly as they go
along so if you don't want them to cross
in that regard you're just going to have
to add more keyframes to get it to work
the way you want to but nevertheless as
you can see here I've created this
animation control-enter to test your
movie and as you can see we've got this
great little animation happening with
the bones structure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
