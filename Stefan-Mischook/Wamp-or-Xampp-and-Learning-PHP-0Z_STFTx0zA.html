want to just quickly mention a lamp
server versus zamp so in my beginners
PHP course I talked about using lamp or
zamp to install Apache PHP MySQL on your
computer so that it's really you know
it's easy for you to to test and learn
your PHP now I want to point out two
things if you're having trouble with
lamp if you're on Windows and some
people I hear may be having some trouble
why I had one complaint so but you never
know I just want to point out you can
use zamp
zap is a cross-platform it's Windows
Linux and Apple and Mac compatible
I believe WAMP is only Windows I haven't
checked in wow yeah it seems to be only
Windows so whichever one you choose is
fine don't get too caught up with
regards to installing lamp or examp
in that you're you as being a PHP
programmer is not dependent on lamp or
zap and in fact in my videos I also
mention if you already have web hosting
up and running or your simple testing
you can you know worst-case scenario you
can just upload your PHP scripts to the
host although it's always better to test
new code on your local machine so you
don't screw up your web server so there
you go web is app are just convenience
tools they are not core to being a web
page P programmer excuse me then that's
about it it's gonna point to that point
that out and yeah I just want to close
off and mention that we have finally
released a new studio web skin it's yeah
it's up and running now it's pretty much
complete we have some text issues we're
gonna fix here and there but we got a
new video pair
that's kind of cool and yeah we just
cleaned up the layout so it's kind of
you know 2014 ish in terms of the style
and of course we use Twitter bootstrap
and I had mentioned on a previous video
and you'll see that the current system
is now totally responsive kind of cool
anyway that's pretty much it so if
you're learning PHP don't get caught up
on whether you're using lamp or zap
install whichever one works easiest for
you because at the end of the day your
role as a PHP developer will have very
little to do with installing and
configuring web servers that's you know
something that your hosting company will
take care of so I would worry too much
about it just get it up and running so
you can start learning PHP that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
