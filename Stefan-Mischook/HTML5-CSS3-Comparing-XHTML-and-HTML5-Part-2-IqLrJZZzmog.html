and CSS work any kind of web design I'm
sure this looks pretty standard fare to
you now we've got our title tag we've
got a reference to a style sheet which
I've got open over here and that's about
it now going on to our body you'll
notice that there's no tables here and
this is a table lyst design and I'm
trying to use class names to describe
sections of my document so I've got a
div here I call it head and then i use
the h2 tag because it's going to be
bigger than the h3 tag I use a div here
called nav I have an unordered list with
various elements and then I have an
active list item over here and so on and
so forth I have a div called content in
it I have left content which is going to
be that hero and then a collection of
postings or a posting and then if you go
down here you'll see that i have another
posting so we've got two postings in
this document again using the h1 tag or
a header tag and we have a section for
metadata in other words the author and
the time then I have a left column and a
right column and I you know if I want to
turn something into a pull quote a pull
quote is when you want to take a part of
your document and you want to emphasize
it so you've got that over there so now
that you have a sense of the document oh
by the way we have our sidebar again
just a class and then we've got an
unordered list so that if I go back here
each one of these items is actually a
list item and I'm going to be using i'll
just show you what that looks like in a
web developer so I'll just display the
element information and you can see that
I've got a class called content and then
inside it a class called sidebar and
then inside that an unordered list tag a
UL tag and then this is a list item and
then this is a list item and then inside
those list items again I'm using a class
of type nav but it's being styled
differently and in here you know we've
just got some text and then at the
bottom i'm using this is
a sort of a CSS trick to clear your
floats so that if you have two columns
and you want something to appear
underneath you can just create a div
called clear or give it a class name
called clear and then assign some
properties to that and then I've got a
footer another div class equals footer
now this looks pretty good you know I
think by most measures this is a pretty
semantically well done X HTML document
but there are some obvious pitfalls you
know div here is being used for all
sorts of things and it doesn't really
describe the document in any way it just
becomes this tag that is redundant you
know it would be much smarter to say oh
you know what this is a header this is a
nav but instead we're using the class
which is really supposed to be used for
CSS to help describe the document and
this is something that html5 tries to
resolve another thing that you'll notice
is I mean that's that's really it also
in terms of the footer you know that
that doesn't really mean anything it
should just be a footer tag the
navigation sections could be better
described as well the postings you know
if we're going to be doing a lot of
postings it would make more sense for
them to just you know be called articles
or whatever and so on and so forth so
html5 provides additional markup
additional tags that we can use to
better describe our documents why would
you want to do that well when you better
just when you do when your document is
better described it becomes easier for a
search engine or you know somebody
that's trying to pull out relevant
information in your document and you
know what I don't want the navigation or
I'm going to take everything in the nav
section and i'm going to use those as
links to you know the major arteries of
my website and this can only really
happen when you properly describe your
document and why do you want to do that
so that search engines like Bing and
Google can easily go into your site and
easily pull out all of the pages that
are relevant and of course that
increases your search ranking and
ultimately also makes your site more
accessible for
like screen readers and you know text
speech tools for people that are blind
another thing that you'll notice is that
at the top we've got this XML
declaration this doctype and this HTML
tag all of this is really doing the same
thing and in order to describe an XHTML
document we have to write three lines of
code again that's also kind of redundant
now let's take a look at the style sheet
so the style sheet itself again is
pretty straightforward you know you'll
notice that I'm using you know dot head
nav content whenever there's a dot
that's a reference to a class you know
basically we're just describing things I
have a general description of what the
navigation should look like and then we
override it when we go down to the left
content sorry the sidebar yeah the
sidebar and then we can say okay I want
to override the nav for the sidebar but
i'm still using the same class name so
you're going to find me doing a lot of
this i'm assuming that you have a
cursory understanding of CSS if you want
you can check out you can check out the
wordpress from scratch tutorial where
you see me kind of building something
from scratch using CSS and explaining
how that construction happens but i'm
going to assume at least for this
tutorial that you have a cursory
understanding of CSS and CSS selectors
you'll also notice that I indent my CSS
this is something that it's a style that
I've adopted over the years and I find
it really helpful for managing CSS
documents that get pretty large and
having an understanding of how they're
constructed so that I know that one
thing is inside of another thing you
don't have to follow that convention the
spaces don't do anything but I find them
helpful so in the next tutorial what I'm
going to be doing is actually you know
taking this document now we're going to
convert it into html5 slowly and with
that we're going to start moving into
CSS and then I'm going to show you some
of the cool features of css3
and then after that we're going to going
to take a left turn and look at fonts
and all the wonderful font support and
html5 and then lastly we're going to
look at audio and video and how we can
you know basically use movies in a
totally different way make them more
accessible make them work on iPad iPhone
or any kind of mobile device with
relative ease and so that's about it I'm
