web calm and killer sites i mentioned
studio web lot because that's my new
interactive training program k-12
schools are using it community colleges
are using it career centers are using it
now so I'm quite happy about that anyway
enough with the promotion so in this
video I want to discuss well quickly
talk about what 20 years of web
designing and web programming but the
perspective going to bring to you after
two decades now it's unbelievable I
built my first website in 1994 for more
import/export business and a half the
time I started business when I was
really young and I built it not because
I wanted to be a web designer it's just
that this web thing came out and I want
to reach clients overseas and my brother
actually approached me said hey you
should build a website and I said well
what's a website any help so over the
years I've seen all these cycles all
these trends go through and I just want
to give you some perspective so just in
case you're new to this or you've just
been in this a few years to help you to
navigate the changes in the web world
now the web itself is stabilizing quite
a bit in that the technology is becoming
much more mature but it used to be you
know back 10 15 years ago it was
changing very rapidly because nobody
knew exactly how it was going to work
out and there's all these wars these
battles between like netscape vs
microsoft and so on so when we describe
a couple big patterns you're going to
see the technology battles what are you
going to see one programming language
will become the the must know
programming language of the day and like
oh that's it's going to change the world
and and everything's going in this
direction and then if the year or two
later or three years later then well no
actually this is the key language and so
on so you see these battles brew now I
mentioned a couple like the original big
tech biker
at least within the context of the web
is the browser Wars he had internet
explorer versus Netscape and the
back-and-forth and eventually internet
explorer 1 and then you know I'll fast
forward and you had Java applets now
applets are kind of like Java
applications that ran in the browser you
embedded in a browser because of all the
browser Wars people say well we need
some unified method of creating
applications so the java community was
the Sun which orange ave at the time
created applets which kind of like
flashing beds and that sort of the idea
was that you know it would work
consistently across browsers of course
didn't work out that way there's all
kinds of problems with applets i'm not
going to get it too and then after this
push for outlets which really never
didn't fulfill his promise as i said
that everybody went back to the browser
notes d HTML and everybody is going to
go the web browser now and again that
was d HTML d HTML was a precursor to dom
scripting what you see today and then
then flash came in mail flash oh yeah
everybody's flash again was always an
answer to the fact that the browsers
these technologies just mention rather
it was always a factor of the browser's
not playing evenly eventually because of
the web standards movement you know
bunch of web design nerds got together
jefferies element and some others and
they basically pushed the major
manufacturers in to explore and so on
excuse me microsoft and so on to
basically pay play by the w3c rules now
they went a little crazy with ex HTML
XHTML is the best forget about HTML of
course I never believed that you can
look it up but back in the early 2000s I
argued against XHTML I knew it was
looking I knew was going to fail because
it has some fundamental problems and it
made it more difficult basically to to
work with JavaScript to work with the
DOM and I II didn't support it so you
couldn't use X
HTML really anyway html5 came out that
sort of killed the XHTML things about
html5 is all in flash is dead you know
anyway the point is you see all these
technologies change constantly ders
these wars back and forth Ruby and PHP
and Java and C dotnet yeah Deanna
all these technologies have their places
you know at some point in time some will
last a while I think like Ruby will be
here for a while Python of course PHP
big time etc there's a bunch of things
you know that will last quite a while
but a lot of technologies will disappear
and go into the niche like Java applets
you ever see two hapless anymore trust
me back in the late 90s Java applets
we're everywhere so what can you take
away from this first of all I've given
this advice before number one do not get
married to a technology don't fall in
love with a technology thing that's it
this is what I'm going to use the rest
of my life it doesn't work that way if
you want to be successful in this game
you got to be ready to dump a technology
that's now going is getting old you know
so that's what you want to do so you got
to be prepared to leave so for instance
Ruby became pretty popular as largely as
a result a big movement of Java people
who had enough at Java because Java was
designed by committee and meaning all
these big organizations IBM and
Microsoft Sam they're all about a whole
bunch of others ba and Java became this
huge bloated beast and became it became
very difficult to work with so a lot of
people took off from Java and went into
the Ruby community and had fed the Ruby
cube minus the rise of Ruby I think and
then Ruby on Rails came along blah blah
blah blah so yet never get married to a
technology be prepared to migrate to
something that's better now just because
for instance if you were a Java expert
that was my thing java how's my favorite
language alive
many languages I was prepared to drop
Java what I saw that was this getting
too stupid its left it it's not like
you're losing out on all your java
skills all that programming skill but
you get in Java or you get a PHP or ruby
or whatever language it will translate
into the next language that you learn
the next environment that you jump into
same with frameworks you may be a code
igniter guy and you've seen code
igniters getting killed now and
everybody's moving i think laravel is
going to be the big one and you know
that's fine don't worry you know your
code igniter skills will do it will do
you good in laravel so just be prepared
to move on you know I want to I want to
want to be too worried about that well
it's my notes here ah what else can I
tell you after 20 years usability is
still huge you know at the end of the
day whatever your back-end technology is
Ruby PHP ASP done that jab whatever at
the end of the day how usable your
website or your web apps are how easy
they are to use is still it still
something holds true 20 years later it
will be still true 20 years from now so
having the skills to develop a very
highly usable site is extremely valuable
and it will transcend time in decades in
fact you know the basic principles of
usability are applicable whether you're
using a desktop computer or whether
using a iphone ipad or whatever other
device it comes down of the road so
again invest in learning usability I
think and finally the oldest rule of you
know of the web I think they got it from
publishing its content is king at the
end of the day you can have the best
coated website and it can be extremely
usable but if the content sucks it's
worthless so you know how important
content is you know depending off the
banking site well kind of how content to
you whatever it is banking but you know
at most sites you know whether it be
online store or blog or whatever you
have to have good content so there you
go after 20 years don't marry technology
usability is super important and content
will always be king and yeah that's
pretty much it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
