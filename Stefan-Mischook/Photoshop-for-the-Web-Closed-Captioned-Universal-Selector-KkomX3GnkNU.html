quickly and easily insert a rapper using
the insert functions here and as you can
see insert div tag is what we did and
we're going to do a little bit more
about that as well but as you can see
inside of my CSS definition it's a
couple of things I want to do first
before we insert any of the other
rappers any of the other div scuze me
inside of our wrapper div a couple of
things I want to make sure that we have
ready for us now first of all what I
want to do is to create a new CSS rule
and as you can see here all you really
got to do is click on this little plus
sign now usually at this point is where
you choose the selector for CSS now that
selector can be created as a custom
class it can be an ID can be a tag or
compound based on your selection well
what I want to do is to say let's
redefine a HTML tag now we're going to
be redefining the body tag in just a
second but first and foremost what I
want you to do is to add this little
symbol the asterisk sign what that means
is we are now creating something called
a universal selector the asterisk sign
is a universal selector meaning any
definition that I apply to this asterisk
will be applied to absolutely every
single thing on this page they might be
wondering I mean why do we do that and
I'll explain in just a second do notice
this since we've already defined an
external style sheet called style dot
CSS we will not be placing anything
inside this new this document only never
do that we don't need to create a new
style sheet we already have one created
called style dot CSS so all of our
definitions including this universal
selector will be defined inside of style
dot CSS so let's click OK all right now
what do we want the universal selector
to do remember it means do the same
thing for every single tag on this page
so what I'm going to ask you to do
is to set the padding 2-0 and set the
margin is zero in the Box category that
we have right here notice on the body
you see that there's some spacing at the
top here that's because there's some
default margin and padding to every
element that's on this page well at this
point if we were to say okay what
happens is you'll notice that your
wrapper is snapped all the way up the
top there's no margin there's no padding
on anything in this page right now now
why is that a good thing well one of the
problems that will oftentimes encounter
as developers is the fact that different
browsers and have different ways of
dealing with margins so in other words
Internet Explorer has a proprietary
method of working with margins that's
different from fireworks Firefox excuse
me or any other different browser that
we have available so by implementing a
universal selector that pairs everything
down to zero there's zero margin and
zero padding as we start on this
particular project and what that means
is everything is equal 0 is 0 0 is the
same in fireworks Firefox excuse me just
as it is inside of Internet Explorer so
that's fantastic thing for us to do
right at the beginning and generally
speaking even before I create my wrapper
div I usually like to create this
universal selector pairing everything
down to zero so I'm going to take it and
I'm also going to move it at the top of
my CSS list now you might be wondering
why do we do that well it's just to
organize things a little bit better but
I also want to bring to your attention
something else all of these definitions
for CSS we've been sort of defining
through dream weavers site definition
window here CSS styles and look you can
edit this again by selecting any of your
definitions and coming over here where
it says edit rule and you can come back
and change any of these settings now I
don't want to do that necessarily I'm
happy with these settings we will have
to make a change to rapper eventually
but check it out here where it says
source code we can see the source code
for this page that's fine but notice
here it also says style dot CSS and that
shows you all of the different
definitions that you'll have here inside
of your design so check it out I can
actually add some comments now one of
the ways of adding comments are just
saying /a snicks and this will add a
multi-line comment as you'll see in just
a second so I can explain that the
universal selector makes all tags have a
setting of 0 and to close that
multi-line comment you just do the
opposite and it would be asterisks /so
notice how everything else is not gray
and that's a great little way that you
can leave little notes to yourself
especially as you're working with me
here and for example look I can even
copy this control command or ctrl C and
look remember we talked about the
wrapper with the auto margins and stuff
like that I can come in here and i can
paste it right on this line and i can
say something like auto left and right
centers the wrapper so these are great
little ways that you can save your code
and it's also some place that you can go
in and manipulate code you don't have to
do everything inside a Dream Weaver
necessarily through the little CSS
window that we have here you can
actually write your own CSS code if you
prefer but if you're new to things and
you know you haven't really had a lot of
experience doing that sometimes doing it
this way is great also notice that
there's a little star here next to style
that CSS it means that this has not been
saved yet so if i press ctrl or command
now it has been saved and that little
asterisks disappears so let's go back to
our source code view and we can see that
we've got all of our elements in place
and a universal selector in here as well
now let's move on and we're going to do
a little something else to the body tag
and finish up a little bit more about
what we're doing inside of here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
