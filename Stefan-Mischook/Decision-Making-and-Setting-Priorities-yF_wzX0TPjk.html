the last blog I did I talked about
analysis paralysis where I was trying to
decide what to do whether to do a bunch
of small things that were less important
or to do one or maybe two big things
that were very important so I read the
comments that people made and some good
points were made on both sides what I
decided to do was to consider the
psychological implications of the
decision and the business implications
of the decision so the psychological
implications ours we have a certain
finite amount of mental and physical
energy and when you're doing all these
little small things you are using up
energy whereas when you're doing the big
things you're also using up energy
that's clear but you also have to weigh
this against against the outcomes of
doing a particular task so for instance
if I do a small little thing or five ten
small little things they have small
impacts right whereas if I do this big
important thing the implications is is
that this big thing will have a big
impact now you're gonna have to decide
if all these small little things add up
to something more impactful than these
big things that's something that's very
circumstantial so you have to look at
that individually what I'm going to do
in my situation rather this big thing
that I'm looking at this one big project
is going to have much more of an impact
on my business that all these little
things these little things can linger
they're really not key to pushing the
business forward they can help they
could streamline it will help mentally
get stuff off the table but in the big
picture they don't really do too much
clients I'm not going to care too much
about that and the business is not going
to be inhibited by these little things
not getting done now so the solution is
then the answer rather is
to concentrate on the big things while
your mind is fresh your psychology is
fresh and when it can have an impact in
two terms of your business so I have two
things I want to do that are substantial
and so I decided to concentrate on that
what these two things are I will not say
but I've decided to take care of the big
things because the big things have big
impacts on your life the big things have
big impacts on your business and the
little things have little impacts so
what's more important all right that's
it for today we'll talk soon check out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
