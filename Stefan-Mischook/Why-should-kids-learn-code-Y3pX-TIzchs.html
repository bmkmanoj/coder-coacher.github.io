your kids how to code of course why
would you want to teach your kids how to
code well it comes down to a couple
things number one coding is now one of
the most valuable and in-demand skill
sets around the world so if your teacher
kids had a code you're just going to
give them an opportunity to be able to
get into a good job even at an early age
you see coders are so much demand and
they will continue to be in so much
demand for several years that even
somebody with no degree in software
engineering or computer programming
computer science even somebody with no
degree if they have good skill sets
which they can demonstrate through a
nice portfolio by doing work they will
easily find work either as a contractor
or working for a company it's that in
demand and it's going to continue for
the foreseeable future it's not my
opinion all the data shows us there's a
big lack of coding talent in North
America and Europe that's sure the other
reason the teacher kids had a code is
simply the brain training advantages you
see when you learn how to code it's like
doing push-ups for the brain much in the
same way when you learn math in
elementary and high school especially
high school math the later stuff you
know you're not going to be using
functions in your day to day life but
you still learn it because it trains the
mind to think in logical ways same thing
with coding but take it a few steps
further not only will coding teachers
your kids how to think logically they'll
learn problem solving skills they learn
about architectures they'll learn about
organization it's very very helpful just
in terms of day-to-day life you'd be
surprised how much of an impact learning
to code will have on students you know
whatever they choose to do and it
doesn't have to be coding it doesn't
have to be technology
that said even if your kids don't end up
becoming programmers knowing how to code
is going to help them even use apps
because we're going to understand how
apps are created by the scenes and
they'll become more sophisticated in
terms of their understanding of
computers in general it will actually
help protect them against things like
identity theft and other online frauds
why because they'll be much more
tech-savvy much more web savvy cold
savvy they'll understand it don't know
it so when some charlatan starts you
know they try to send some fake email to
you know to do whatever knowing how to
code will just make these scams much
more obvious so there's just a few
reasons off the top of my head why I
strongly suggest with your students well
your kids rather should learn to code or
even you if you're a non coder and
you're thinking about it just learn it
even you know you have no intention of
becoming a full-time coder it's a
fantastic skill to have even if you find
yourself maybe your director or your
management it's good to know at least
the basics so that when you deal with
coders you'll be able to speak their
language and you understand the basic
processes so you'll be better able to
judge the cost of projects and what's
involved it will just make you a better
manager in general there you go that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
