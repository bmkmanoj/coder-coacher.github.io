auto increment MySQL will be
automatically creating the unique ID
whenever record is saved so you don't
have to create it yourself again this
probably very confusing but once we
actually start using you now you're
going to see what I mean and will become
very clear van so I'm just going to save
those changes and once again get a
message from PHP mine men table people
has been altered we've altered it by
adding by changing the ID field and
given it an extra capability on auto
increment essentially MySQL will
automatically create the unique ID for
us so we don't have to do it and if you
see up here the SQL query it's this is
actual xq el code and you can see it's
very human readable says alter table
right that's the command we're altering
the table and we're altering the table
called people and it says change ID ID
int to these values here so again we'll
get into this later on as you can see
SQL once again it's very human readable
for the most part
okay we're getting there we're almost
ready to actually jump into some PHP so
one thing I want to do is what's browse
the tables I hit the Browse tab here
again our message mysql return an empty
result set 0 roles that means you see
the query select star from people now
star is basically a wild card if you
remember when you do if you if you
recall when you do star searches it
basically select anything and we're
saying from where from the table people
so limit 0 30 means bring back record 0
to 30 nothing higher so again we'll get
into this a little bit later so what we
need to do now is actually insert some
data into this table so that PHP has
something to work with so we go into the
SQL tab you see here is a basic SQL
query but what I want to do is going to
delete that and I'm going to cut and
paste something in here this is some
brand new SQL we haven't seen before and
this is called the inter commands call
the insert command because it says it's
small because it's called it inserts
data into the table so it goes insert
into so that's the basic command and
this is the table right people insert
into people our table people here and
and you put little brackets here and you
say whatever you want to insert what
fields remember we had our name field so
I'm say insert into the table people in
the name field this value so here we
have the vice of fan so let me just hit
go and hopefully that will insert that
value into the peeped into the people
table let go so we have a message again
inserted rows one and zero idea one so
here's the actual query so it's actually
browser database see what happens now so
we see that showing roll 0 of 0 corey
you know douses how long the query has
taken here and so on one thing i want to
point out you notice it says showing
roll 00 doesn't say empties that means
actually turned a record
so why is it saying zero the reason is
like PHP MySQL starts counting at zero
so 0 is your first record one is your
second record 3 s.u to is your third
record and so on just like MySQL arrays
excuse me PHP raised if you look down
here you see the actual data return you
see name and ID CID one I was
automatically created by mysql because
we use the auto increment if you recall
before when we created our table we used
auto increment here so that
automatically created that one for so I
go browse right one so let's actually
insert another record into our table and
receive this increase so I'm going to go
SQL cut and paste is again pace and so
I'm going to put Nick so I just hit go
so again again insert into table people
we're going to Sabrina we want to insert
data into the name column or the name
field and the value we want to insert is
Nick so we hit go into the rolls one
into roll ID 2 and then tells us how
fast this quarry took and it shows us
the SQL again so let's go back to browse
again and here now is showing rules 021
see you because we added an extra record
if we scroll down now we have two rolls
right we asked the fan was first one we
have nicked the second you notice how
the ID was incremented here and you know
how in both instances when we created
our query we did not actually tell it to
increment the ID mysql took care of that
for us again because of the auto
increment extra that we added here kind
of cool
now that we have a database created
inside of our yeah we have a database
created inside a mysql server the
database is killer and we've actually
created a table inside of killer the
table is called people and we've
actually added some information into
people if we go into so excuse me
database killer SQ out we could run a
query here or but we'll leave it will
leave it for now so we were inside of
killer we have killer and we're ready to
go as far as PHP is concerned one last
thing we need to do now is this to go
back to server host so if you're inside
of killer excuse me you go to server
localhost click that and we get the
front page of PHP mind min again we need
to know the user as in the username to
access the database so if you go into
privileges and you notice here we have
only one user root and it's got no
password we could actually change that
we could give the root user password and
you notice down here we're getting a
warning error of it maybe we should do
that but since this is running on our
local computer we don't need to do this
when you're actually going to a hosting
account and using their mysql they're
going to set up a lot of this stuff for
you and i have another video where I
show you how to use cpanel to create
databases with mysql and PHP mine men
that will have to leave again to that of
a video but for now since i assume
you're using ma'am poor wamp or exam on
your local machine we just wanted to
point it out where you're going to use
the roots user and we're not going to
need a password and as you root user
global privileges has all privileges
what that means is that this guy is like
a super user he could do anything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
