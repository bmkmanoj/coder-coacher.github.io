Photoshop that you will definitely enjoy
working with and using and it's called
under the image adjustments you'll see
it right here and it's called replace
color and as you might imagine it's
useful for in any circumstance where you
wish to replace the color that you have
existing in a particular image so right
now if you open up guy in shirt in the
same source files folder that I pointed
you to earlier we are going to attempt
to change his white shirt into a
different color shirt for example like a
green shirt or something like that so to
begin with what I want you to do is to
go to the quick selection tool and will
use it to just quickly click and drag a
little bit at a time come in here slowly
go around that edge and you get yourself
a little area here that you're working
with if you wish you can also click on
the zoom tool and zoom in on any
particular area that you might not have
inside here so it's really important
that you've got all of your area
selected appropriately I'm just going to
undo that and just come in here and fix
that area here and remember you can just
move this along just holding your
spacebar to get your hand tool going and
you'll notice I want to get in there and
get all these little elements notice I
don't want this area here selected so I
can pres- by using the option or alt
notice i'll just slowly slowly move my
way in like that perfect and as you can
see here I've got a little bit there now
remember square bracket left square
bracket excuse me allows you to make
this a little bit smaller and we can
undo that if you get in there too too
much and notice i just did that again so
i'm going to undo it one more time and
if you just click it's having a little
bit of extra trouble so you can go in
here and use for example the polygonal
lasso tool remember holding shift you
can come in
here and you can click click click come
back click and come back to your
beginning and that's added that element
to it so very nice got everything pretty
much the way I wanted it to look and
we've got a very nice selection so
command or control minus just zoom out a
little bit so now we've got all of these
elements included very nicely inside
here what I want to do at this point is
go to image adjustments you might be
asking can I make an adjustment layer
know you can this is something that is
going to be applied directly through the
adjustments at the top of the menu item
so we'll come back to here and say
replace color you may not see much of
anything in here well that's why we're
going to I drop the color that we want
to replace now notice there's a lot of
different variations of light in here
and we'll get to that dilemma in just a
second now because we have a selection
what's good about that it's not
affecting any of the whitish areas here
notice it's not really white it's a
little bit off maybe he's sure it's a
little dirty anyways so as you can see
I've done that and one of the things we
can do is what do we want to replace it
with well you can you know go through
your hue and saturation and lightness
but I'm just going to come in here and
go towards the greens for example and we
can choose a green that we want to use
so as you can see it's making a very
different sort of color variation
happening inside of our window I'm
taking a look over here at this side
here I want to make sure I've got
exactly the elements of green that I'm
looking for and i'll happily just move
my slider up and down get a green that i
want to work with and something that I'm
content with so at this point I'm also
going to recognize that there are a lot
of portions in here that I'm not
actually saying so I'm going to now add
another color so I'm going to say well
not only this color do i want you to
recolor I want you to also recall
they're this particular color huh what
about this excellent notice how it still
keeps those dark areas so that we have a
shadow defined in here that's really
quite beautiful to work with and as you
can see you can also play with this
fuzziness which allows you to determine
as you can see here how much of the
object is going to be affected but
you'll notice you if you go too high you
may be losing some of the content and
quality in here around where the ribbing
of the undershirt happens to be so I'm
just going to scale that back a little
bit but the fuzziness the way I have it
here is great and I'm pretty content
with what i see so if i click ok the
next step would be to say command or
ctrl d on a pc and lo and behold what
you have is a new colored t-shirt it's
great and if i was to press command
option z or edit undo or step backward
command options that we can see what we
would be doing command options that
again AHA there it was originally and if
we want to go forward step forward is
command shift set just command shifts
that again and we have our d selection
so it's a really great way of selecting
just a particular area inside of your
document and recoloring only what's
inside that document there so we'll come
back and continue with more adjustment
