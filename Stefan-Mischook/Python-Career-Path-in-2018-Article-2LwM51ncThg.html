today I figured why not anyway I took
care of a huge pile of work in the last
couple weeks so I'm gonna have more time
for blogging and vlogging of course I
want to ask you a quick question see
what your thoughts were I really cut my
teeth in the whole web thing and I put
well I didn't put it on the map but I
made Killa sites pretty popular in its
day and care of PHP largely because of
my writing writing articles and
tutorials and so forth so I was thinking
of doing a lot more writing or at least
doing more writing and I just want to
see what your takes were if you wanted
me to refer to little written pieces on
different things so one of the things
I'm doing now and I'm going to be
starting to promote my Python course
finally to get the word out because you
know even have the best product in the
world but if you don't market it
nobody's gonna know about it so this is
this one of the quick pieces where I
talk about briefly about Python career
paths and different career paths that
you have in Python and I mentioned that
you can eat supporting skills etc etc
this is something that covers a new
module I just put out on a Python course
any help so I'm gonna be writing up
little articles on Python and web
development and the business end of
things and so on and that's about it so
just let me know if you want me to
reference them in fit flogs like this so
you can come come and read them if you
want to it's up to you the link to this
article is going to be in the
description under the video and there
you go so give me some feedback about
that and what do you think of articles
and me just doing a quick vlog about
articles as they come out
