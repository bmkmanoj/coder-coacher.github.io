not very obvious that i'm on products so
it would be really nice if when i'm on
products i know i'm on products so if I
view the page source here again I'll
increase the font size will notice that
on products here WordPress has very
kindly added another CSS class which is
current page item so if I style current
page item then products or any other
navigational element will then appear as
though it is the current page element so
let's go back to our CSS and I'm going
to create another nav Li and then
actually we can do Steve and then
current page item and I want it to look
as though it's hovering so I'm just
going to paste this in and if i refresh
this that doesn't quite look right but
if I add the a here there we go so what
we're doing is we're saying that any
hyperlink with current page item and is
inside of nav should be styled in this
way so when I click on contact contact
will appear and then products and then
about and if I click on my new template
then none of them are highlighting so
you can see it's very easy with a bit of
CSS to take what WordPress gives us and
make a very powerful navigation system
so let's create a couple more posts and
see how WordPress can deal with that for
us so I'm going to go back to my WP
admin section I'm going to go back to
write and i'm going to create some more
posts so if i go back to manage i should
notice a whole bunch of different posts
that have appeared now let's see how our
site is holding up if i go back to view
site
we're starting to see quite a bit of
content now we probably don't want all
of this information to appear all the
time we can actually change that in the
settings so let's go back to settings
under reading and let's say that our
blog page shows only the latest five
posts and instead we show a summary now
if I hit save again and i refresh this
page will see that we've only got the
latest five posts but there's no way to
go back further into the history so
again WordPress provides us some really
simple functions to deal with this
problem I'm going to go back to my index
PHP file and we're going to take a look
at the loop again now the way the loop
is constructed right now is I've got
this section here for post and then an
end while loop so we've got a while and
then an end while loop now in order to
add what we really want to do now is add
a link to any existing or old content so
I'm going to create a new div at the
bottom of this called navigation now
this is a different Navigation class
because it's inside content versus this
nav class which is inside the header so
because it's embedded or it's nested
inside of another div it's still easy to
navigate it using CSS and inside the
navigation class i'm going to create two
more classes one which is going to be a
class equal to align left and another
class which is going to be a line right
now these classes are very handy and
we're going to write them very briefly
just for styling or creating content
that is either left or right aligned and
in fact WordPress uses this when you're
embedding images so that they're
properly formatted the next thing I'm
going to do is I'm just going to open
another PHP tag and in here and i'm
going to close it
and here we're going to say next
underscore posts underscore link and
then we're going to say older entries
and then I'm going to close my function
and then that's it and then I'm going to
take this and then just paste it in here
and say previous posts link and it's
going to be newer entries now if I go
back with firefox and i refresh at the
bottom i'm going to get this link for
older entries i click on that i'm going
to get the older entries if i click on
this again i'm going to get newer
entries now because we don't have enough
posts yet we don't see the two of them
on the same page at the same time so
let's just add a couple more posts so we
can see what that looks like
now that we have at least at least 10
posts we actually have 12 posts we go
back to my new template and we visit the
site and we refresh this will see that
we've got five posts here and then older
entries and then we've got older entries
and newer entries now I want these to
appear on the two different sides of my
template so I'm going to create an align
left another line right class in CSS so
in style here I'm just going to create a
new block for generic styles again you
don't need to use comments or you can
comment them however you wish whatever
really makes sense to you align left
will be float left and a line right will
be float right now if i refresh this
page again we'll see that older entries
and newer entries are now on the two
different sides of this page before that
i'm going to create a new block here and
i'm just going to say footer because i
think this is more part of the footer
it's not part of the overall footer but
it's definitely at the base part of the
page and i'm going to say navigation and
i'm going to give it a height of let's
say 30 pixels and a background of
off-white and i'm going to refresh that
and the last thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to give it a margin right of
10 pixels so it's properly aligned or
getting a bit of alignment on post
itself so i'm going to get rid of this
margin
so on the post here if you notice
carefully we've got a 10 pixel margin on
top of another margin and i'm just going
to fix that by in my post here saying
padding a rather margin left is 0 pixels
because we already have a margin of 10
pixels in our content so we've got a
margin on top of a margin and there we
go and the last thing I'm going to do
here is just say margin right is 10
pixels for footer navigation so
everything is properly aligned now I
think there should be a bit of padding
so that things aren't totally hugging
and we've got older entries and newer
entries so everything looks like it's
properly aligned I can go to newer stuff
and I can go to older stuff and if you
want to change what's in the textbox you
just have to go into next post links and
then the argument can be a different bit
of text if you want i'm going to add a
greater than symbol so this is another
way of saying greater than and i'm going
to add a rather than less than symbol
and this is a greater this is a greater
than symbol and this is a less than
symbol so if i refresh that now I've got
older entries and newer entries perfect
so in the next video now that we've
looked a little bit at the loop we're
going to get ourselves a nice side bar
or the starts of a sidebar and we're
going to refine our template a little
more we're also going to be looking at
how we can style pages differently in
the videos to come thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
