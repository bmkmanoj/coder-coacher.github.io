sites calm welcome to a screencast on
credit basics with MySQL I and PHP what
exactly is crud that stands for create
read update and delete it's one of those
foundational concepts that you need to
understand when working with databases
almost it's almost essential for
anything and everything that you build
that accesses a database you have to
understand how to be able to add and
edit records that are in that database
I'm going to be specifically covering
mysql I today there are a couple
different ways that you can access
database using PHP there's the PHP MySQL
extension there's the MySQL I extension
and there is PHP data objects or PDO and
the mess mysql I extension has a couple
benefits that I'm going to be
demonstrating in this tutorial today the
main two are that it provides better
security the standard mysql extension
has been known to potentially cause
issues with cross-site scripting and SQL
injection which are issues you really
don't want to have to deal with so P or
MySQL I includes prepared statements
which makes it a lot more secure and it
also provides better performance since
the new extension has improved speed
dramatically so let's get started and
i'm going to show you briefly what we're
going to be building in this tutorial
today i've opened firefox and this is
the basic web application we're going to
be building it's pretty simple we're
just going to imagine that we're part of
a sports team and we want a basic
application to keep track of who's on
our team we could obviously extend this
much further but in this simple example
I'm just going to keep track of the
first name and last name of people on
our team so it allows us to add new
people to the team so
so we're going to go ahead see how it
shows up so we can add new people we can
edit them submit and then we can also
delete them if we want to so this is
sort of a standard building blocks for
almost any application that you build
you need this sort of functionality so
let's get started building our actual
application this tutorial is aimed at
beginners but hopefully you have at
least basic understanding of PHP and a
little bit of experience of working with
a MySQL database so to get started here
first of all you're going to need
something like mamp which stands for
Macintosh patchy mysql and PHP or wamp
which is the windows version it allows
you to run PHP and MySQL on your local
computer or if you have access to web
posting and you have a web server
available to you that's another option
to go with so the first thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to open up my text
editor which in this case is koda and
I'm going to create a new file
and first of all I want to just make
sure that MySQL I is installed on your
computer and now minus QL I has been
included since php5 came out and that's
been a little while now so it should be
included on everyone's computer and most
servers have updated to PHP 5 but just
to double check so I'm just going to do
PHP info and preview that if we go down
the page we should be able to see two
words
okay so here's my SQL and then just
below that is my sqli so I just want to
double check that you have this if you
don't have this you're going to need to
put potentially upgrade your install of
lamp or mamp or talk to your web posting
about upgrading to PHP 5 so just as long
as that's clear okay so i'm going to go
back first thing we want to do is
consider the how we're going to actually
build this application so we're going to
build it with a couple different files I
want to have a connect DB script that
will hold all of our connection to the
database and then I'm gonna have a
couple other files and have a file for
viewing all the records in our database
I'll have a file for deleting records
and we'll have a file that both ads and
updates records in the database so let
me start with the connection to the
database so MySQL I is pretty similar to
standard mysql in a lot of ways but the
main difference is that you can use an
object-oriented approach and makes
things a little bit simpler and easier
to understand the code so i'm going to
go ahead include my server details
and this you will change depending on
whatever your variables are mine is
localhost root root and I'm connecting
to a database that I'm gonna call
records actually take that back i'm just
going to call mine records to you can
call you is whatever you want i'm going
to show you how to set that up with PHP
my admin in a minute so these are the
connection details now to actually
connect to the database so i'm going to
name this in mysql I and it's going to
be new then we're going to pass in all
the data that we just created so server
user and okay so that's the start let me
go back and create our database so I've
opened up PHP my admin and I'm going to
go and create a new database call it
records to create that and then we're
going to want to create a table miss I'm
going to call mine players because again
going back to the idea of it we're
creating this application since we're
part of a sports team and it's going to
have three fields it's going to have an
ID field which is going to be an int and
it's going to be the primary key in this
table and it will auto increment and
secondly we're going to have a first
name I'll be of our HR with that 32 I
believe we set on that and then the last
name
again 32 okay so let's go with that okay
so a table is being created let's go
ahead and insert a couple data in search
a couple of fields so okay so we've
entered in two names i'll just go ahead
and enter into more so mine and okay so
if we go browse we have created our
table and we have some data in it that
we can use let's go back to our text
editor so this is the basics just make
sure i'm going to save it and preview
things and we don't get any sort of
error that's good means connections fine
um one other thing I should note when
you're working with mysql i sometimes it
helps to have additional errors being
reported to you in case you have
problems so i'm going to go ahead and
add mysql I port and I'm going to add
okay so this will show errors if we have
issues with the database you probably
don't want to show these to your user so
when you put if you were to put this
website live you'd want to remove this
