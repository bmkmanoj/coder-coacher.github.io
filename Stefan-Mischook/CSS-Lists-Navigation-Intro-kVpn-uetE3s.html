another killer sites calm video tutorial
in this next tutorial what we're going
to be looking at is how to take all of
our designs from our CSS layout video
which was an earlier title and we're
going to look at some other elements of
working with CSS in particular using CSS
to style lists and to create
navigational bars and this is something
that you'll see often times in very many
different examples different websites
there's a lot of different ways that you
can do this but one of the easiest ways
without having to resort to working with
JavaScript or anything else it's to work
with CSS and even over and above just
changing the background color of your
links inside of a navigational element
you will be learning also how to work
with some images and how to substitute
background images in place of colors and
you can you know take your Photoshop
wizardry and bring them into your
designs and do all kinds of really
interesting things with them so we're
going to be concentrating first and
foremost on working with a vertical or
navigational element right looking at
links working with them in a vertical
navbar but will eventually be moving on
in later video tutorials into how to
create a horizontal navigation bar so
there's a lot of ways that we can do
this in a lot of ways that we'll be
exploring how to do this with CSS and as
you can tell just by looking at the
screen here I'll be working inside of
Dreamweaver this particular version is
Dreamweaver cs5 you can be working with
any version of Dreamweaver that you
might have because if it's compatible
with CSS then you'll be able to do any
of the things that I'll be showing you
how to do in the next sequence of video
tutorials so stick around we're going to
learn a lot of things and you'll be able
to implement those into your designs as
soon as you get through with this
