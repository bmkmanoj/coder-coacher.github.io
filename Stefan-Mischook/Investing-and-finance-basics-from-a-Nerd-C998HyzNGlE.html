YouTube about finance can you recommend
a youtuber that is similar to you but
provides guidance and motivations and
finance investment banking and
securities industry I can't recommend
anybody in particular but what I'll tell
you is some of the things I have done
and I've seen so up until about seven
years ago for period about four years I
was almost full-time doing all this kind
of stuff investing and stuff and I'm not
a professional
i just took a whack at cash and started
playing in the market and so on and what
I'll tell you this here to my talk rules
of investment through harder experience
I came out now I'm a passive investor
which I think most people should do
99.99% people should do now get into a
second but I was actively buying
security selling them I was in
commodities those in equities I was
playing with ETS playing a derivatives
through DTS etc etc etc so all of a
sudden done and let me give you some
blanket statements about investing but I
discovered now remember I am a software
developer entrepreneur so and legally
speaking I can't give advice in terms of
stocks and so on so keep that in mind
caveat emptor with all this but you'll
see that my opinion is actually a pinion
of safety so I'm data-driven I'm a dad
to driven meaning I look at the stats
and I make my decisions based on that
and what are the big stats that is very
interesting to me is that the broad
market basically if you bought an index
fund an index long if you don't know is
this basically a slice of all the top
companies in
the Dow Jones as an example or the
Nasdaq etc use Elvis I basically get a
little piece of the Apple a little piece
of Microsoft's a little piece of Oracle
a little piece of ExxonMobil little meat
you get the idea
look please McDonald's so you buy that
what it is this fun basically tries to
capture what you need to a good job the
flow of the general market as opposed to
trying to pick individual stocks hoping
you get that home run here's the stat
the best traders in the world the guys
work the guys and girls work at Goldman
Sachs and JP Morgan all the other major
banks all the hedge fund guys they will
90% of time 8090 percent of time
underperform
the broad market so what does that mean
you get these guys and girls who are
studying it trading in and out reading
reports trying to figure out all the
angles their full-time job and they went
to school for years to study all this
stuff there's 89 percent chance that
they will do worse and significantly
worse than if you just brought bought an
index fund which is just like a slice of
need top companies and let me give you a
concrete example it's kind of famous the
most famous and possibly the most
successful investor of all time Warren
Buffett they're rooted for richest man
in the world
he bet eight years ago the hedge fund
industry but if he bought the index and
just took the dividend profits from
those every year reinvested he said he
would outperform any hedge fund and
eight years going one or two is a
certain number of these hedge funds took
him up on this anyway so going forward
anything at eight years now the hedge
funds are up like 200% not bad
where's Warren Buffett who did nothing
nothing is up eight hundred percent so I
don't know about you I rather be the guy
or the girl who does nothing and it's up
eight hundred percent versus trying to
figure out the angles and all this kind
of garbage and being up only two hundred
percent Wall Street there's a lot of
scamming with all those kind of stuff
you see the bank's they want you to tray
now buy stock sell stock buy so I'm
still suck because they want
transactions that's how they make the
money they want every time you buy and
sell they make money so they want you to
buy and sell so they say should buy
himself no you buy a whole you forget
about but better than that you just buy
an index fund and you forget about it
because what help perform now if you
want to confirm my thesis I'll give you
an example I looked at Apple stock and
you just go to a Google Finance you type
in Apple simple just type in Apple or I
think it's a APL is a simple or are a
ppl area and then you can click a little
buttons you can click 5-year little blue
link and we'll show you two chart over
five years and you see that Apple and
five years its stock is going to like 78
percent something like that which is
great which is great Apple the biggest
richest company in the world but if you
take an SMP 500 right or Vanguard fund
the tracks the S&amp;amp;P and you do the same
put the five-year you see but it's up
just about the same so maybe half a
percent off or something so if you pick
the Apple on you're lucky that you
picked the the best performing well the
richest company on the market today
you'd be up 78% and you pick the the
index you'd be up seventy seven point
five percent something like that you see
what I'm saying with this now you say
well watch is buy Apple because Apple is
performing well now but who knows what
happen two years from now there's one
thing about the broad market broad
market goes up or down but at the end of
the day by just buying an index fund
like that you'd have to think about it
you're going to get all the good stuff
you're going to get the bad if some of
the companies in the index will go down
but you're also going to get some of
these killer winners and all credit
balances out
but again the numbers show that over a
10 or 20 year period something like that
D if you just buy the broad market the
index funds you're going to help perform
all most of these traders you get the
occasional unicorn most of time these
unicorns will have a streak of luck for
four or five years and then they're
failing they feel like crazy there are
some exceptions
like Warren Buffett Buffett he's got
access to all this insider information
stuff physical and then when he buys he
just holds for many years typically
he'll sell it here and there and so
forth but many years and I'll just add
this when Buffett said that when he dies
and he met his guys leave in diapers
he's gonna hold he said for his wife
this you know in the will index file I
should tell you everything right he's
got all the best people surroundings and
I just haven't buy the next one that's
the safest way to go so that is my
suggestion with regards to the market
the other thing I point in point out is
that another thing that they didn't
mention but it should be really
emphasized you should have extreme
diversification with regardless through
your investments because you never know
what's going to happen so that means
across many companies really index funds
maybe different sectors maybe you have
for us may buy an indexed one for Asian
market and have some bonds as well
because you never know what's going to
go what's going to happen so you don't
want to be trying to try to be on top of
these things and track these things
history shows the numbers show if you
just buy the mark and you forget about
it and you wake up 20 years later you're
going to be we're now performing most
people the market always does better
than housing always does better than any
other market segment
any others ups and downs and everything
but trust me if you actually look at the
math you know you may have bought a
house seven years ago and you're up to
100% on the house but if you bought the
stock market you just bought the indexer
of eight hundred percent right the other
thing is the emotions play huge role a
huge role and that was my mistake in the
past like if I hadn't been so
concentrated in positions meaning put
too much money into a particular
investment I would have done much better
off because when you got too much money
in a particular investment you get very
nervous and you start selling because
you get nervous if it goes down then you
miss the upside or as you spread it all
out so you're not emotion
we invested in a particular investment
it's much easier for slightly sleep
while night inside of all you're able to
let it just right because stocks never
go up in a straight line they're going
to go up and then they go down and they
go back up higher so life's time ember
Trading silver and I did very well with
silver but I would have done like four
five times better if I hadn't had too
much money concentrating my silver
investments and I never still would go
up and then I figured it was going to go
to here and I have bud here and went up
and then I was set to go down but
because I had too much money now is
getting nervous oh my god oh my god it's
going down better sell so then I would
sell and will continue to go down a
little bit I go all right I'm cool and
then shoot back up past where I sold it
oh my god I just missed two three
percent and I jump back in I kept doing
this because I was too heavily
concentrated so wasn't able to
emotionally stand the ups and the downs
when you have big money in it but if I
had purchased of my room no more than 5%
of your investing money in a particular
investment so if you're buying silver
nowhere in 5% of the cash that you have
for investment and silver let's forget
about it if you're buying if you want to
buy individual stock which I wouldn't do
well I won't get into it now but you
want to put no more than 5% into that
and you forget about it excited okay
this way the 5% rule means that you
sleep well at night because if you buy
let's say for instance you buy Apple
stock just for a sake of buying man and
a year from now it's gone down 10% right
but since it's only 5% any money I went
down 10% of 5% of your money that made
you only Dell point five percent of your
entire cash so you're like man I gotta
have the point five percent imagine if
you would have put 50% of your money or
40 percent of your money or fixing your
money into Apple and it goes down 10%
now you're down four percentage is now
five percent you're down a lot you get
the idea and that makes you nervous and
it makes it difficult for you to play
the long-term play with Apple now Apple
itself I invested in that did very well
I bought it at the it was in the $60
range and sold it like 140 or something
I thought it was a champ
but since gone up quite a bit right
again I was highly
concentrated in that and that's I say
I'll take my money and run but if I
would have just put a position as hell
differed as Warren Buffett advises
forever for ten years or so I've been
warded up in terms of Apple and it's one
example but Apple the most powerful the
most richest company in the world even
it it's not went up to was at 50 and 60
and 70 went to 104 and they went down to
70 Apple went down to 70 during the
crash and so never nothing goes like
this usually so if you're too high to
concentrate it you're too emotionally
involved you won't be able to play it
out so keep that in mind again I'm not
an investment counselor these are just
my personal experiences I say play to
the numbers and the numbers tell you
that you're much better off just buying
index fun and getting on with your work
and you do much better
I say it's a date by buying an index
plan you're heavily diversified and you
would use you buy over time so you're
diversified over time so diversification
is a key to all this long-term so
especially if you're young especially
for young if you're your 30s or 20s do
it just take your time you'll be fine
just buy index as far as I can tell the
Vanguard is the best there's a lot of
these funds I have all these crazy fees
and they'll eat so much of your profits
and the fees Vanguard has the
rock-bottom fee so I think that might be
the best way to go but again you got to
research this yourself because I'm not
an expert in finance but I have some
battle scars so you can learn from my
mistakes cow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
