what we're going to be starting to
implement are the pictures that we
wanted to have here if you remember in
our final design we had some pictures
integrated into the look of our work and
we're going to attempt to do the same
thing here now sometimes when you're in
this development stage you may or may
not have the images actually available
at the time of your design and that's
okay because part of what you want to be
doing when you're designing is now
anticipating for an area that might be
used for a graphic or a picture but you
may not actually have that picture ready
so what we're going to be doing first
and foremost is to integrate a couple of
shape layers and those shape layers
would just be color coded initially and
will eventually be doing something with
it and integrating it into some pictures
so let's just go about making some
placeholders for ourselves right now and
you'll notice I'm pointing to the vector
based bad shapes that are here starts
off with the rectangle tool just perfect
exactly what we want let me just draw
your attention up to the top here for a
second and notice that I'm making with
these vector tools a shape layer not
making a path and we're certainly not
making fill pixels so it's a shape layer
that I want you to integrate now don't
worry so much about the colors because
we can change those colors a little bit
later on so as I draw this out and
you'll notice you know as I'm slowing
down here you can see how the object is
snapping to our guides it's one of the
big reasons that we're integrating those
guidelines in here not only for our
graphic design layout but we're also
doing this just with regards to what we
want to have happen here inside of our
design so with all of these the things
absolutely matched out we know we've
measured and we've calculated that each
one of these are two hundred and sixty
pixels wide and that's perfectly fine so
you can see them here shape one two and
three and if I wanted to I could also
double click any one of these and
choose a color remember we used some
Adobe swatch exchange options last time
in the last video so I could come in
here and I could choose any number of
different colors and click OK and notice
very easy for us to change what those
colors actually are and we do that just
simply by you know talking about which
colors were using in which space and
just by double clicking on these here we
can see that it's very simple to go in
and change some colors and do different
things to it so now we've got those
three styles these shapes right here and
there's three separate shapes so
technically speaking if we didn't have
our pictures ready these would be
perfect place holders however we're
going to be doing something with
pictures in the next video and will
still continue using these three as we
go along but before we continue let me
just take note of what's happening here
inside layer palette everything seems
pretty manageable because we only have
about six layers but soon enough things
will start to get a lot more complex and
there's going to be a lot more layers in
here so one of the things I want to do
is to organize these layers much better
and we can do that by putting them
inside of these groups these little
folders here that you can create so I
selected the top layer of the type here
so that the group would be right on top
of it doesn't really matter because we
can move them around at any given point
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
put all of our type which belongs in the
header graphic into group number one
which I will now double click and rename
header now after we've done that that's
fine and we could stop right here but
let me show you something else that's
advantageous when you're working with a
lot of layers you can also color code
the specific layer so check it out you
can collapse that folder so that makes
it a little bit more manageable you can
expand that layer and when you do all
the color coding is there so it shows
you this belongs to the header folder
let's do the same thing with these since
they will in fact be used where the
pictures will be I'll select the top
layer and
we'll then click on my group and we'll
rename this one if you click right on
the text you can rename it directly and
we'll rename this one pictures and then
once that's done I could also double
click it out here not on the text but
out here and we could choose a color for
this as well so as you can see here I've
made them red now all we got to do is
drag our objects inside of this and when
we do that they also become red as well
so we can collapse those elements
everything seems to be in order and
seems to be ready for us to now
integrate our pictures which we'll do in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
