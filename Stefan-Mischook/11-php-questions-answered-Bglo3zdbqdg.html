mentor organ killer sites calm and a
whole bunch of other sites anyway I'm
going to answer 11 PHP questions that
were put to me recently I don't
necessarily have all the answers but I'm
just going to run this through this
rather very quickly so here we go
everyone how to protect server from any
type of hackers well the best thing you
can do is use a firewall so it doesn't
have really anything to do what to do
with PHP most of the server hacks will
be through either SQL injections or is
going to be SSH brute-force attack so a
good firewall helped a lot in that
regard how to test my SQL injection is /
if it is protected wow you you test it
you use prepared statements and other
things that you can do in PHP to prevent
SQL injections and then you just you
know look up on google SQL injection
attacks and find some examples and see
if it works basically what you want to
do is you just want to scrub any SQL
that it's coming into your your site
that can be processed by our PHP and
prepared statements will do that and
that's a big way of handling that how to
create accounting web in PHP I don't
know what that means how do you create
an accounting app in PHP perhaps I
wouldn't do it if that's the question I
would just use google spreadsheets or
something but anyway before how can you
create a treeview system using PHP well
treeview is a client-side visual
component visual elements all what you
would do is you would you know I assume
you would store perhaps whatever
information in a database you grab that
from PHP and return it to some sort of
client-side object that does the
treeview for you so you might want to
look into jquery or something like
you might have to pass that information
from your database through JSON or you
might just do I don't I would be
probably the best way of doing it so
there's many different ways but in terms
of previous systems that's a client-side
implementations a client-side thing
meaning in in the browser that means you
should look at jquery or some other
framework that would provide that for
you and and then in their libraries
their tree view libraries they'll talk
about how to implement the tree view
properly number five what front what is
a framework and what is why is imported
from work he's asking i'm sure about PHP
framework so you're looking at zend
you're looking at Laragh val cakephp
there's many others a PHP framework is
just basically it's just basically
rather a collection of PHP code but it's
designed to make it easy for you to
create apps the PHP code will follow
certain conventions like something
called MVC and they'll have something
called arm in it which is a way of
basically making it easy for your PHP
code to access databases relational
databases I can go on for hours about
frameworks basically a frame was just a
collection of code that makes it easy
for you to write PHP apps but you have
to learn a framework in there some bit
of a learning curve there number six can
I use PHP to create large project
without frameworks or see web system I'm
not sure what a see web system is but
yeah you could create large projects
without a framework you can roll out
your own PHP framework and I know people
who do that I've done my own frameworks
in Java but unless you're you can't find
a framework that handles the type of
work you need to do I wouldn't do it I
would just use some third-party
framework that's just the way I roll
about these things reuse we use reuse
right that's the top three rules of web
development number seven in opie what is
the difference between
method properties whatever their
importance well it seems that you need
to do my basic Opie in PHP course but
essentially an Opie PHP a method is just
a function and properties are variables
that's all it's just the same different
word for the same thing so in opp HP
again instead of calling them functions
you call methods instead of calling
variable called properties their
importance is the same importance as you
know as as functions and variables
extremely important eight why do web
programmers use private public or
protected in a class these are these are
key what's the worst forget the word
Allah so essentially they are a way to
control how people can access the code
that you write so when you declare an
object being private it's it's not
accessible through by other objects or
you can do that with a method for
instance if you declare a method public
than anybody can access that method and
protected it's kind of a happy medium
again this is a video 11 PHP questions
quickly answers online again to detail
but essentially these are access
modifiers there you go private public
and protected they modify how you can
access objects access modifiers and so
it just it's just a way to to control
how your code is accessed by other
coders so this is really something about
this is something that really comes into
play rather when you have many coders on
a project and you may have a lead coder
whom it will set up a structure and a
sub certain objects within the
application will be protected and
private and to prevent some other coders
from accidentally breaking things which
I've seen for sex
yeah number nine why do web programmers
use this variable instead of choosing
any name as a variable this is a special
type of variable in object-oriented
programming it's a self-referential
variable it's basically it's it's like a
special keyword in PHP and object
oriented PHP that allows you to refer
back to its throughout total secret to
allow an object to refer back to itself
again you have to do a course do my
course on the object oriented PHP go to
killer PHP object-oriented program it's
an older one there but it's free so you
can take it there or you go to web
mentor where you see all this web bent
org web mentor yes shameless plug where
you can see this type of stuff all
implemented in detail number ten why the
web programmers use statement instead of
choosing any variable name that's just a
convention it's when you're creating a
string and SQL string and that's the
statement and that that's that's the
context what I know I know of it you
have to maybe there's others but that's
that's that's state st mt is a short for
statement what does these two variables
this and stay with me I think I just
described that so there you go Levin PHP
questions answered that's it for now do
you want to learn more go to web bent or
org and I'm Steph I'm most known for
killer sites calm and killer PHP but
anyway that's all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
