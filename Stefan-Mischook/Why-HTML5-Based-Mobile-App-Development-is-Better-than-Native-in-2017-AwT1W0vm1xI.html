about html5 mobile apps versus native
mobile apps native I mean writing apps
for iOS in objective-c or Swift or
writing Android apps in Java and a
question that comes up every now then is
will html5 replace native app
development not a hundred percent but
quite a bit that's because html5 app
development for mobile is very very very
capable and in fact the vast majority of
apps being developed for mobile devices
can be done nicely with html5 based
technology that means html5 css3 and
JavaScript combined with some sort of
framework like PhoneGap and or others
out there which are free to use and why
would this replace native cost cost
savings if for instance you want to
develop a business app for some clients
some small business and medium sized
some large business you can if you do it
natively you can have to write it for
iOS so these days you can do Swift and
then you don't have to write it from
scratch once again in Java for Android
and weapons if I don't know Windows
Phone comes around I don't think this
could happen but yeah whatever some
other phone and you got another language
you're going to have to rate and the app
in on the other hand if you write it
with html5 based technology then you
just wait at once and you're done it's
over so some of your say will help what
about performance stuff performance of
native written absolutely better than
web for sure but it really depends on
the type of app you're developing if
you're developing a game that's intense
in terms of graphics yes of course
you're going to drop down into native
again for Android MB Java for iOS that
would be Swift on the other hand most
apps that are being developed for
mobile don't requires that much
horsepower you can do it all quite
nicely in html5 and this is not
speculation on my part why do I said
because I've spoken to people work for
very large organizations even the bigs
now are stopping for the most part
native app development and they're going
the html5 route on a web stack route to
develop mobile apps so if you wanted to
get into the mobile app development
world I would suggest that you learn
html5 css3 and JavaScript first and then
get the phone back gapped
or some other framework with help that
adapt your adopts or - rather your html5
code base so that it becomes a mobile
app the other advantage of learning the
web stack for mobile app development is
that you've learned the web stack now
you can get into other types of
development you get into web development
you can get into web app development you
can take that into WordPress development
so by learning the web stack first you
basically open up many opportunities for
yourself in terms of development jobs so
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
