talk about web design 2018 a question
that I get every so often is whether or
not Web Design as a profession is at
risk because of tools like Wix web
building tools like Wix Squarespace
tools like Shopify are these tools going
to make web design obsolete because they
look pretty easy to use and you can
create some pretty good-looking sites
short answer is no because you have to
look at these things as being tools
period yes for very simple sites any
small non-trained non-professional could
get in there and build something it's
very basic but there's much more to web
design today than just doing a layout
much more than that
you'd be surprised of how many business
owners small business owners have no
ability to see and layout things even
with the tool like Wix you kind of think
of it like a race car you can give an
average person a race car does that mean
they're gonna be able to drive it on a
track well chances are not very likely
let me get into this a little bit more
web design goes through changes every so
often and these changes are driven by
technology so back in 1994 when I
started building websites everything was
hand coding then the programs came out
the web design programs came out like
front-page hot dog Dreamweaver later on
etc etc and they changed the way we used
to build sites and that went on for a
couple years because of limitation of
technologies in terms of the coding
languages people would make made heavy
use of programs photo editing programs
like Photoshop CorelDraw whatever in
their web design the web design toolset
in the 1990s was very different from
where they are today or even where they
were in the early 2000s I remember a
friend of mine
who had been a professional web designer
webmaster as we would call them back
then and he stepped away from the web
design world for about three years to
three years and when he came back he
found out but it was totally changed the
way we would look at things the way we
would apply the technologies was totally
totally changed one of the major changes
was that the use of Photoshop had
diminished quite a bit back in the late
90s early 90s using Photoshop was a huge
part of the process to fast forward to
2003 and 4 totally changed the use of
Photoshop became at best
secondary and in fact today say you
don't really need hardly any Photoshop
skills to be a successful web
professional web designer today that's
another story so in comes the early
2000s you have this migration to CSS
based layout the whole game changes
again back in those days around that
time give it a couple years WordPress
came about and other content management
systems you install it on the server
boom a bone you apply template and then
you want to generate a new page it's
just like using a lose the week which
you see what you get type of app and
Bob's your uncle where you go and web
designers were freaking out oh my no no
no abused WordPress we won't have any
more work we won't build all these pages
well what happened was that yes certain
jobs that a web designer did in the 90s
got replaced with even more complex jobs
in certain respects that you did with
WordPress so you had this growth of the
WordPress professional the WordPress
ecosystem with the themes and the
plugins and the templates the
installations and a maintenance in the
update and now today 35% of websites are
give or take are powered by WordPress
added another CMS this you're looking at
you know maybe close to 40% of the
websites or CMS based and that makes
sense
CMS's are good but it hasn't taken
away from the utility of web designers
it's just that their roles the jobs that
the web designer did changed quite a bit
fast-forward to today you have web
builders like wakes you got ecommerce
platforms like Shopify and people are
wondering um all know is that going to
replace web designers as well again the
web professional web designer is kind of
an old-school term today I think web
professional or front-end developer
might be better but even front-end
developers kind of a specialization you
see web design the whole process of
putting a site on the web there's
different ways to approach it you can
use web builder like a Wix or
Squarespace you can use a Shopify you
can go traditional you can go WordPress
your go Drupal all these things are
viable and depending on the nature of
the job at hand you can use one or the
other so to answer a burning question a
lot of newb web designers or aspiring
web designers or front-end developers
have will these tools make web design
obsolete no it's just going to shift the
way web designers work and the type of
skills that they bring to the table
in fact guess what there are jobs for
professional Wix developers believe it
or not there are jobs for professional
Shopify developers of course there's
tons of work for WordPress professionals
as well so it's just there is just a
shift in the skill sets required for a
web developer web that web developer a
web designer web professional beyond the
mechanics of getting a site up in terms
of the layout and so forth there's all
these other things that come into it
search engine optimization strategy web
marketing strategy setting up just the
whole process getting the site up online
how do you get video going now you can
do these certain amount of these things
with a tool like Wix and stuff but
typically what you're going to find with
builders like that web builders is that
they work fine with a very narrow track
just a very narrow and you go out
that track you got all kinds of problems
and evidence of that is that wicks has
opened up its its toolset using
javascript of course he and so VAT if
you really wanted to master wicks you
got to know your JavaScript wealth what
business owner is gonna know that so the
fact that you have people posting jobs
and I'll do this in another video for
Wix developers or Wix designers tells
you something about Wix tells you
something about the profession again
whether you do from scratch whether you
go for CMS like WordPress or Drupal
whether you go for Squarespace as a
starting point and build off of that all
these tools are still still require a
certain amount of knowledge in terms of
the web and the coding and so forth so
again I don't see these things as a
threat I just see CV sings as power
tools if you will to help speed up the
process
trust me back in the old days we used to
have to spend a huge amount of time
tweaking tweaking images making sure
they were compressed properly so they
look they loaded in a reasonable amount
of time a huge amount of work had to be
done really is teeth pulling work we
don't have to do that anymore
thank you thank the Nerds for that one
thank the nurse for that one so if a
tool like a Wix or a Shopify simplifies
a process to implement a cart or
influence it to implement the basic
structure that's cool that's fine you're
gonna they're gonna hire people web
professionals like you potentially to
put that into place because business
owners they don't know they don't know
when should I use Wix or you Squarespace
how do I use it what do we do how do I
get video what I do for my social
strategy how about the SEO how did I get
it on how do I get my site ranking what
kind of layout do you think I should use
given the type of business these are all
things that weeks can't answer these are
things but our web professional will
bring to the table so again all
this said you still need your basics
always a fundamentals again if you know
your html5 your sister 3 or JavaScript
and you understand the fundamentals of
web design and development and so forth
all these tools become much easier to
use and you'd be you'd be much more
productive with them if you understand
proper layout properly usability they
call that UX you know and UI again you
need that training that I to know what
what to do where to place sakes Wix can
help automate the process like a power
tool can help you automate the process
of building a table or something but
just because you have the power tools to
build and cut the wood and etc terrible
you still need the skills put it all
together so it looks pretty good just
with these builders whether it be
WordPress or whether it be wicks or
Shopify they just speed the process up
that's all so I wouldn't worry too much
about it
cheers guys in fact in one of the
businesses I'm involved with it I can't
go into too much detail but it is
basically in the the Airbnb space and so
we were looking at a web app where we
had to build something that was required
a bunch of a bunch of complexity so I
said I would looked at it as a CTO of
this particular business I looked at it
and I made the decision to not spend the
hundred thousand dollars it would be
required to build the application from
scratch I found the SAS software as a
service that pretty much did everything
that we needed at least one part of the
business and we paid our licensing fee
there and then for other parts of the
business in terms of the website the web
presence I used in this case we decided
to use WordPress again there were
reasons for that now I had the skills I
have people work for me about the town
we could have built these things from
scratch but it was not required so we
use third-party tools as any smart web
professional
do now still I was able to make these
decisions and make these judgments
because of my background as a developer
and of course a business owner and so my
role as CTO was very important where's
my the two partners involved with this
like two other partners they have some
technical skills but not very much
so they depended on my judgment to make
these decisions otherwise they'd be
running around for a long time and in
fact and I have other people I know or
who have businesses because they don't
have a proper CTO they call me up or
down now and then asking questions about
things because they just don't know what
to do what you know could be simply
should we use WordPress or use Drupal
shouldn't go from scratch you may build
from scratch what do we do what do we do
is should we use this platform at they
don't have any way to judge that's where
web professional comes in I hope that
story gives you some insight in terms of
how the real world looks so again don't
see these tools as threats see them as
just new tools that will make your job a
little easier in certain areas and if
you learn to embrace understand these
tools and how to use them properly
you're just going to be a much more
successful web professional that's all
