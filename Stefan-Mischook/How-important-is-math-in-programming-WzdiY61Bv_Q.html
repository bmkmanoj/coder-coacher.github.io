mentor org in this video blog I'm just
quickly answer a question do you need
math to become a web programmer or a
general developer slash programmer short
answer is no about 98% of the time from
my experience why because when you're
creating apps these days math plays a
very tiny tiny role in app development
I've been doing this since the 90s
99% of the time as I said well whether
or not eat no no you get the idea the
vast majority of times all you're going
to need to know is adding subtracting
and multiplication division and it gives
one other type of mathematical equation
may come into play but it's very very
very very very very very rare the
exception is if you want to get into
perhaps game programming that's where
more advanced math will have to be
implemented in terms of game physics and
colors.you and all this kind of stuff
but again even in that field a lot of
this math has already been figured out
for you a lot of times you can just drag
and drop these objects into place and so
again it's always good to know math it's
always good to know more about any
subject any field but to think that you
need a lot of math to get into
programming and development this is not
true whatsoever from my experience over
the last two decades so don't worry
about it if your strong suit is not math
and should have no impact in terms of
your your career as a web developer or a
developer the exception is again game
development also maybe if you're going
to go work for a very large corporation
they may require a certain level of math
skills in because the HR department will
say well yeah we need math even though
it doesn't really reflect on reality so
you know if you have to do deal with
human resources and large corporations
which are
minority of the companies that are
hiring developers by the way small
medium-sized corporations like Dell
unless they're in game specific fields
or maybe some type of scientific study
they'll never bother you about your math
skills it's a false requirement just
like I remember when I was going to get
into Business Administration back in the
day and they required a cow to to get
into business Business Administration
and that it was ridiculous this is a
made-up requirement I don't know why
just so they can fill some Skell two
seats I suppose but it's a made-up
requirement because never in business
you're going to need to know Cal one or
two all you're going to need to know is
basic arithmetic so that's about it so
again back to programming don't worry
about it you don't need math it's not
important most of the time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
