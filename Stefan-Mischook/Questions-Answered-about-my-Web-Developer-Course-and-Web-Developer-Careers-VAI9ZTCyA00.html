again based on an email sent to me so
somebody sent me an email and don't
worry if you send me questions about
career code whatnot I'm not gonna
publicly say your name you be anonymous
no worries about that
so yeah wearing a hat cuz it's bloody
cold and it's so cold and I got so many
windows here it's like I got 30 feet of
windows overlooking the mountain it's
hard to keep the place pretty warm so I
actually wear a hat silly I gotta move
to California or Florida or something
I'm actually thinking of moving down to
California anyway so here's a question
that was put to me I have no background
in ite and no basics and computer
science at all perfect you don't have to
unlearn anything so that's one of things
when people are taught incorrectly
sometimes it's harder for them to
unlearn the bad training and it's easier
for a teacher to have somebody who's
totally new to teach them properly from
the beginning this is a I learned in
martial arts of course or and in boxing
when you have people come in with real
bad habits but that have been drilled in
to remove those bad habits to rewire to
rewire the brain to put in good habits
it's more difficult than just starting
them off fresh all right let's continue
with the questions I would like to learn
coding and programming to be able to
work freelance as I am currently in a
wheelchair after an accident in 2000 so
is it possible and how long we'll take
the first question
so I sent an email back to this person
and so I'll just read out my quick
answer so how long it's going to take
and is it possible yes it's very
possible how long it takes it depends on
you depends on your personal
capabilities and aptitudes it depends on
how much effort you put into it
it depends on several factors but it's
very possible how long will it take for
you get those skills I've had several
people tell me they've been up and
running with front-end professional
developer skills basically being able to
design any type of layout that they see
on the web within a few weeks of doing
my course you learn very quickly with
the studio web-based courses my course
is because of the way that the lessons
and the courses are structured they're
mindful of how we learn as humans and
that makes a big difference in terms of
how quickly you can absorb the
information next question how do I go
about getting work into the field once I
have the basics so I've talked about
this and several vlogs first thing you
need to do is you gotta set up your own
site showcasing your skills then what
you do is you reach out to small
business or people around you who want
to start small businesses or may have a
small business and build a site for them
for free you got to consider first one
or two sites as part of the training a
lot of people go to these expensive boot
camps that cost ten thousand dollars
five thousand dollars or more because
they say wow they're gonna they're gonna
send us to a stash what we're gonna do
learn how to build websites and web apps
with real company well if you follow my
courses which are a small fraction of
ten thousand dollars I'll show you I
show you how you'll be easily be able to
find freebie work stash work essentially
where you don't have to spend ten grand
or five grand on it on an expensive boot
camp in fact once you have the basic
skills and you follow what I teach step
by step you'll be able to find all kinds
of freebie work for yourself in the web
space in the web stack especially if you
get into PHP development or WordPress
development there's so much work it's
unbelievable she even asked me can you
help with this that was the next
question and your album fish they said
yeah sure take my course I teach you not
only the basics the core of the language
is something
but I really concentrate on I don't see
other people do that out there and then
I also teach you job-ready skills my
courses stand out for several reasons
but one of the main things that I
concentrate on is giving you real-world
skill sets not just academic skill sets
my concern is to get you up and running
as quickly as possible to be able to
build professional size to write
professional code why because that's
been my background for last 20 years she
goes on to say I am currently living in
France but I'd like to return home once
I have the skills is that possible
why not you just got to as I expressed
in recent videos put time every day to
slowly learn the material
let your mind your brain fatigue tell
you how much you can learn per day I'm
jumping ahead to another question but
yeah it's very possible next question is
there a timeline on the course I'm not
exactly sure what you means by that but
essentially the system is designed that
you are able to work at your own pace
now it's not just a set of videos it's
the interactive training with the
quizzing and the tracking and the
built-in hinting it's almost like having
me sitting right beside you tutoring as
you go through if you get confused you
can get hints ask questions it's really
a highly refined system literally
hundreds of thousands of students helped
us to refine the studio system and the
course curriculum so it's really
self-paced you can work at your own pace
so so I have lots of people who are
students and they're doing the studio
web to SuperSpeed if you will they're
coding people who are approaching
retirement and you know I learned
something so they do this on the you
know in the evenings on the weekends I
have stay-at-home moms who want to do
this kind of stuff so you know make some
money as they're looking after the kids
this is a great thing and people who are
disabled who are not able to leave the
house web development freelance web
developer is fantastic because you could
work from home deal with fewer clients
remotely and in fact one of the many
reasons that I got in
web-development myself was that
flexibility because so I had a nearly
fatal blood disease and I would have
these bouts where I'd be a very tired
for weeks on end so I needed a
profession and a skill set that allowed
me to just veg out for a week if I
needed to just to rest up and web
development and web design was the key
to all that next question how many hours
a day do you recommend learning knowing
that the brain can only take some lunch
information at once perhaps you didn't
watch my previous videos I typically
recommend when you're starting off two
to four hours per day when you first
start again you let your brain tell you
when to stop when you are starting to
feel fatigued and the head headaches or
information is not sinking in time to
back away for an hour to maybe the next
day if you're really tired and what will
happen though is as you progress you're
gonna be able to learn much more much
more quickly simply because over the
next week or two or three and later on
months your brain is going to slowly
rewire itself literally so that it's
more able to absorb the coding and the
programming information the brain has to
just get used to things so that's why I
tell people you got to pace yourself
stay relaxed drink water or lots of
water be rested don't try to push it
through and if you're having problems
initially that's normal you just got to
give your mind some time to just adapt
to the situation it's like when people
want to become runners long-distance
runners you're not gonna run the 10k
race the first day and you're not gonna
run the marathon the first day but
slowly slowly you start with you know a
half a kilometre a kilometer or two
kilometers five kilometers ten
kilometers and eventually it becomes
pretty doable saving with learning to
coal you start off slowly don't get the
sewers don't get discouraged if it's
difficult at first just let it come they
come well and next thing you know you'll
be writing all kinds of code next
question what do you recommend for
to focus more on the task and not get
distracted with the monkey mind
she must be watching my videos one of
the things you have to do is you have to
engage your brain and so what we've done
in studio web in my courses the whole
thing is gamified it's kind of like
playing a video game you unlock levels
you score points
there's hinting and you earn badges and
stuff like that and this engages certain
people I also just make the teaching fun
you'll see the way I structure my videos
and the quizzing it's quite a bit of fun
another thing you could do is once you
have at least the basics done you've
done maybe five ten lessons and you
start understanding at this point you
will have built like a very simple web
page in HTML and what you do is you
start planning out the career that
you're going to build with your skills
whether it be getting a job whether it
be becoming a freelancer whether maybe
you want to build your own site start
selling your own products maybe you got
an idea for an app or a dynamic website
you want to build and what you do as you
start planning out that bigger project
very not in terms of code that in terms
of business structure or maybe planning
out where you know start looking for
employers you want to get jobs out maybe
start thinking about you know what would
you want to call your freelance business
where would you want to focus you want
to focus on raw app development with PHP
or maybe you want to get into WordPress
development theme development or just
become a wordpress professional start
thinking about the business and start
researching that so what you're doing
there is you're motivating yourself
you're giving your brain a long-term
target or medium-term target so it will
start associating your career and your
money-making with the core training that
you're getting with my courses or what
any courses and then you can move
forward that way that is one of the ways
to motivate yourself to keep yourself
focused and again if you're starting to
drift off and lose focus after a half an
hour an hour or two
three hours whatever it is of coating
that's your brain say okay it's time to
take a little break let's you know let
me assimilate this information let me
process this information you expose me
to well how much is the course well the
normal price for my full stack course I
called the IWD course interactive web
developer it's interactive because it's
in studio app it's like having a tutor
seen beside you the normal price is 100
bucks now it's on sale it's a wintertime
and check it out
now you can pair even though it's full
price $99 $99 boot camp and I've had
people tell me they'd learn much quicker
with mine in fact I got an email from
somebody saying that they did five
thousand dollars in courses at college
and they didn't learn one tenth of what
I taught them in a much shorter period
of time
so I call that a bargain so is your
career worth or buying me a burger in a
beer I don't know I think so
well there you go that answers those
questions so I hope this vlog answers
questions that you may have had I did
this video because I'm thinking that a
lot of people have very similar
questions I've had a similar life
experience to her where she is confined
to will share it where she's confined
now of course I'm fortunate enough to
have my legs still but I with my blood
disease for several years was a
situation where though I was managed to
cure it through Chinese herbs believe it
or not I still had to contend with for
in a few years with severe bouts of
extreme fatigue almost like having mono
and so I was looking for a business
where I didn't have to go to work every
day where I could work from home where I
had the flexibility to be able to work
when I had the energy and I could rest
when I didn't have the energy and web
development today is just as capable in
that regard or how should I put that web
development provides that opportunity
today just as much as it did back then
and in fact even more today because so
many websites are small business
websites and a lot of them have needs
for professional web developers which
includes coders and designers and SEO
SEM social media integration WordPress
integration WordPress professional work
where you install it and configure it
and all kinds of other things web design
is an interesting thing which I've been
at since the 90s it shifts over time in
terms of the skill sets in terms of what
exactly you're bringing to the table as
a web professional it changes it's in
fact getting easier in some respects but
much more complex in other respects web
professionals these days have a hybrid
set of skills if you will and it's just
something that's going to be viable for
many many many years to come
although it's focus is going to shift
over time as it has since its inception
in the 90s so there you go all right
that's it bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
