stages of our design and as you can see
here as I mentioned earlier this is
going to be the first design that we're
going to be addressing now one of the
things I want to bring up first and
foremost is the idea of how our designs
are going to react inside of our browser
windows in other words the very first
type of design that I'm going to be
showing you how to create not only in
Photoshop but then how to assemble
inside of Dreamweaver is this one here
which I would refer to as a fixed pixel
based design and the reason we're
addressing a fixed pistol based design
first is because it's probably the
easiest style of design that we can
build inside of our websites so what a
fixed pixel based design will do is once
it's inside of a browser window if I
move that browser window if I resize
that browser window if I full screen
that browser window the elements inside
of the browser the design that we were
creating right here is going to be fixed
in other words it's fixed to a specific
size and it's never going to move it's
it's always going to be sort of set in
that sort of scenario the other kind of
website that we will also be addressing
in our series here is something called a
liquid based design and liquid based
designs are much more malleable they
stretch out they they move around some
of the text will be resized when we sort
of resize our browser window the text
will wrap and you know get bigger or
smaller there's advantages and
disadvantages to both of these the
advantages to a fixed pixel based design
is number one quite simply it's a lot
easier to sort of build inside of your
web scenario and the other advantage is
is that you always have a sort of
understanding of how big your text is
going to look how big the columns of
your texts are going to look so you
don't end up with if somebody has like
some ridiculously large screen you don't
end up with 70
five words on one line before a new
paragraph or line in that paragraph
begins a liquid based design on the
other hand also has its advantages one
of the things that we want to avoid is
horizontal scrolling on our designs well
if somebody has a screen resolution
that's smaller than this particular
design one of the things that you'll
encounter if you're working with a fixed
pixel is that in order to see the entire
design you might have a horizontal
scrollbar that's generally something you
want to avoid so before we move forward
with our planning of how this is going
to be laid out and what it's going to do
one of the things that you have to sort
of keep in mind is the simple fact that
if we are addressing a fixed pixel based
design we have to know what the average
end user is going to be looking at in
terms of their screen resolution and how
it is going to react with our particular
design so a couple of things about that
where do we get this screen information
where do we get this information about
resolution and how things work in that
case one of the best places you could go
is the w3c which is the World Wide Web
Consortium there are a bunch of people
out of MIT that are working to set the
web standards it's led by a guy by the
name of Tim berners-lee incidentally he
actually invented HTML in the very early
90s and he and his team are responsible
for things like web standards the CSS
revolution all of these different things
which make developing web pages so much
better than it was say ten years ago or
something along those lines so that's
one spot that you can go there's another
place that you can go called net market
share as you can see here and what I'm
showing you in the net market share
website is this the vast majority of
people who are looking at your websites
have a screen resolution of minimum 1024
x
68 or higher that's the vast majority of
people so higher than 1024 x 768
probably accounts for like ninety-four
ninety-five percent of your audience
anything smaller than that is a very
small portion of your audience 800 x 600
used to be popular but as technology
improves and as screens get better and
graphic cards get better more and more
people are able to support a higher
screen resolution on their particular
computers so when we are addressing a
fixed pixel based website and deciding
upon our environment and how we are
going to sort of plan for this 1024 x
768 environment we have to keep those
statistics in mind so even though twenty
percent and higher are on 1024 x 768
what we're saying here is that if we
address that base of 1024 x 768 that
will give us something that's going to
work on the vast majority of people's
browsers so if a person has a browser
size that's larger than 1024 no problem
you're just going to have some extra
space on the left and right hand side of
your website if somebody is at 1024
that's great too because that's exactly
how we're optimizing our Photoshop
layout to work inside of their browsers
so you'll only have like you know less
than 1% of the population that will
actually encounter a horizontal
scrollbar when looking at your website
in a full screen scenario so that's
actually pretty good statistics for us
and because of that we're going to
address our layout and plan for our
layout to be well within the 1024
environment now if you'll notice when
you say file new inside a Photoshop one
of the things that you can address is
that there are preset sizes there are
preset sizes here for the print industry
US paper international paper stuff like
that but there are also web
and mobile devices film and video stuff
like that well the web presets are all
set to different screen resolutions and
that's wonderful so you might think hey
santhal just told me 1024 x 768 is the
way to go so that's what I'm going to
choose but let's hold on before we do
that I want to also address something
else to you if I were to just switch
over to Firefox here for a second and
we're looking at this full screen when
we say that the screen resolution is
actually 1024 x 768 what I actually mean
there is the very top of my screen down
to the very bottom of my screen as you
can see here but with this browser being
full size as you very well can see
notice that there's a lot of information
here or rather a lot of real estate
that's being taken up by a number of
things number one the operating system
i'm working on a mac you might be
working on a pc but that operating
system is going to take up a small
portion of your screen but look at this
the browser and here i'm working inside
of firefox the browser is taking up a
good portion of real estate on my screen
as well not only here at the top but
there's some scrollable areas down here
on the side there's also down here at
the bottom a status bar that's taking up
some of my screen so all my website
really has to contend with is this area
in the middle right here that area does
not make up 1024 1024 as I said is the
top of your computer screen down at the
bottom of your computer screen or at
least what my computer screen happens to
be set to here and the vast majority of
people are as we mentioned following at
least this screen or a higher screen
resolution so in order to make your
website work really well if I was to
create a layout of 1024 x 768 then we
would see that if my browser was set to
full screen there would still be a lot
of real estate that's taken up by the
browser itself probably giving me a
horizontal scroll bar which I don't
really want now a vertical scroll bar is
not really the end of the world a lot of
people have come to
expect that but I want to address that
in just a second if you want to play it
safe the best way to work within this
environment is to choose a width and a
height of 9 55 x 600 now let's also
address that issue there's going to be
some math that we're going to have to do
sorry if you don't like math but you do
have to spend some time preparing
especially in a fixed pixel based design
a little bit of how your layout is going
to work inside the browser so there's a
little math involved if you want to have
the easiest way of working with that we
can round off our 955 to a nice even 900
that'll be easy for us to sort of
divided into different sections and work
out mathematically the height of 600 on
the other hand is something that also
contends with all of that extra real
estate that's taken up by the browser as
we mentioned earlier so what does this
mean for us well I mentioned that height
of 600 is also important for a number of
different reasons number one as I
mentioned vertical scroll bars are not
really unusual in the web world and
everybody comes to expect them to a
certain degree however one important
thing about this height of 600 is in the
design field we often refer to these
areas as above the fold or below the
fold well in print it's easy to think
about this think about like a newspaper
and how newspapers fold it in half
usually when you pick it up well
everything above the fold or at the top
of the newspaper is generally seen as
the most important information it's also
the most highly visible information
that's where you'll have to pay the most
for advertising and there's a reason
behind that because it's got the most
visibility same thing can be applied to
this the principal on a web based
environment everything above a height of
600 is referred to as above the fold
because of this we can recognize that
the vast majority of people are going to
be looking at that area
more so than anything below the fold now
that doesn't mean any person is not
going to look below the fold of course
the information is there it's always
going to be there however the most
important elements of your website
should always be above the height of 600
or rather above the fold it's really
important to sort of address this
because it's the highest area visibility
most people are going to look at that
area before moving on to another website
not everybody's necessarily going to
read everything below that area most
will but the attention span of most
people will sort of Peter off with
anything below the height of 600 so
address that issue as well and that's
something that's important here too so
not only is that 600 sort of addressing
the extra real estate that's inside of
the browser that we can't use for our
design but it also addresses some
important information in terms of
visibility from your audience also
remember something else SEO search
engine optimization tells us that search
engine spiders as they crawl the web and
as they crawl down different websites
will generally only have a finite amount
of information that they can ingest and
usually what is happening is they ingest
the information that is above the fold
now that's not to say that they won't
grab anything that's below the height of
600 possible but the higher your height
value is the less information that
search engine spiders will actually
attract so if you have something that's
ridiculously high and a lot of scrolling
on your website that might actually
affect your SEO adversely so it's
something that you also should be aware
of not only for the attention span of
your audience but also for search engine
optimization so what I've done here is
in Photoshop chosen a heightened width
of 900 x 600 and that's what we're going
to be starting with at this point now
we're also going to have to address a
couple of other things in other words
where we're going
going to set up our rulers and guides
and also a little bit of information
about color schemes and how we can work
with color not only inside a Photoshop
but in any application that you want to
be working with even if it's just
straightforward HTML so we'll discuss a
little bit more about color in just a
second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
