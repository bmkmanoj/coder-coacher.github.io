learn about the three different ways
that Dreamweaver can display a page to
you as you're editing it
let's start out by launching this index
HTML page that we built earlier and I'm
going to reduce this thing here so what
I'm talking about the three views I'm
talking about these three buttons up
here we have code view split view and
design view we've been working in design
view because I think that most people
new to Dreamweaver are going to want to
use Dreamweaver like they would a word
processor like Microsoft words or
Apple's I word i think it's called
let's look at these two other views and
we're going to discuss the significance
of these two other views and why
Dreamweaver includes this let's look at
code view first or clicked on that and
what we see is our very same web page
but we see the code behind the web page
so what does that mean well this tells
us that web pages are actually built
using code this is a code here the code
of course is called HTML or some people
may use something called XHTML for our
purposes salt we'll just call it HTML
that's what what most people are using
and this differences between X HTML and
HTML are very subtle once again HTML
code is the building blocks of any web
page and when you're adding stuff in
Dreamweaver yourself from cutting and
pasting and doing things like this and
making things bold Dreamweaver is
actually writing the code for us in the
background so for instance I've
highlighted this piece of text here I go
into code view and you see that the
piece of text is highlighted but you
notice here wrapped around it is some
strange-looking txt this is the HTML in
the HTML specific video I'm going to
explain to your going to give you a
basic quick course on how to understand
this code it's really not that difficult
the next you want to talk about is the
split view now split view is basically
just a hybrid you got the design view
down here and appear you get the code
what's really interesting if you notice
if I highlight some code and design view
it gets highlighted in the code view up
here
so having these different ways of
looking at your page in a cold view
split views design view begs the
question why would Adobe creating weaver
in such a way to have these different
ways to look at your web pages the
reason is that sometimes it's just
better to go into code Dreamweaver is
very powerful was probably the most
powerful WYSIWYG HTML web page editor in
the world so what does WYSIWYG stand for
wysiwyg stands for what you see is what
you get essentially the idea behind a
wysiwyg web page design software like
Adobe Dreamweaver and there are others
out there is that you don't have to use
code you don't have to actually write
code and as you build your pages what
you see in this design view is going to
be representative is going to match what
you're actually going to see in a
browser so we've done that before where
I've previewed some code in internet
explorer for instance so I just hit f12
and Internet Explorer launched and as
you can see and Dreamweaver it looks
very similar to well identical in this
case to what we see in the actual web
browser this is very useful because it
keeps us from having to continuously
launch the browser to check out our
pages we should check them out from time
to time but with this nice visual editor
we got a pretty good idea of what's
going on
so to recap Dreamweaver provides a code
view and a split view so that we can go
into the code and make changes to our
pages so just in case there are
situations where when we're in our
actual design view where we may have
some trouble later on in some other
videos I'll show you how we have to go
into code view because using the visual
editor here just doesn't cut it
sometimes it's not often it's rare but
it still comes in useful to be able to
understand what's going on behind the
scenes to understand the code what's
really cool about the cove you in the
split view is that you can use this to
actually teach you about web design so
for instance if I go into the code view
here excuse me I'm in the bottom pane
here which is the visual view I can
actually watch Dreamweaver write code I
can see what it's all about so for
instance right now I'm selected this
header here what is new about
Dreamweaver cs3 if we look up in our
code view you see that it's surrounded
by these these two HTML tags
an HTML tag is basically some text
that's specially formatted in such a way
but browsers understanded tags
essentially tag text images and so on in
your pages these tags are processed by
the browser and as such the pages is
displayed to you when it's a process
essentially the tags give instructions
to the browser and how to display things
what I want you to take away from this
is that split view can be used to more
easily learn HTML so again I'm in the
design view down here I select this text
and you see that it's actually this code
here so another thing i can do if i
select the text here he knows down in
the properties tab i have the format
drop-down list here remember that now
right now says heading 1 you knows we
got h + 1 that means heading 1 so watch
what happens when i select this text and
I say let's make this to heading to
watch in code view what happens as you
can see here it turns to heading to or
how about if I select paragraph so I go
into well reflected here see it turns
into a paragraph so as you can see by
working in the split view and working
with the properties tab and so forth you
can learn HTML much more easily and
that's what we're going to learn in a
dedicated video
that all said what you're going to find
is that once you start building your own
websites with Dreamweaver cs3 that by
jumping in and out of design design view
and split you in code view you'll speed
up the process of your web design and at
the same time you're going to become
more and more familiar with the code
behind the pages so to use Dreamweaver
you don't have to become a code expert
and you actually don't have to
understand everything about the code but
it just makes your life easier if you do
understand code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
