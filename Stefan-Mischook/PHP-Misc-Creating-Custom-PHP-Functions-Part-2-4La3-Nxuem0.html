part two where we actually learn how to
return a value from a function so it's
very simple we just replace echo with
return and you spell it right and what
you want to do is you want to get rid of
these for now so now this function
simply returns hello world so what we're
going to see is that calling footer will
not actually print anything to a screen
and we'll see why the second
so nothing is printed why because we
haven't by calling this function we're
not actually telling it to print all
this function does is return the value
hello world it's up to us now to use
this value in our PHP pages now the
simplest thing you can do is go echo
footer and hello world appears
what's the difference between just
simply printing and returning well
besides the fact that you can do all
kinds of things with your custom
functions you can create custom
functions or to validate email addresses
that connect to databases that draws
images to the screen you can do anything
with a custom function and the return
values are important because that allows
you to control what messages if you will
this custom function gives back to the
rest of your PHP script so for instance
you could have this custom function
return a value that's used in another
function that does something so returns
are pretty fundamental to programming so
is this again these are very basic
examples just under so that you
understand how to return values
we're moving right along now let's go to
part three where we're going to learn
how to create a function now we're going
to add to our function so that i can
accept arguments so let's add our
argument you simply do that by this
putting a variable so i'm just going to
call it argh short for arguments but you
might want to give it a a real name like
you could put email or whatever you want
you can create multiple arguments by
putting a comma colon rectal comma and
adding different arcs rx2 so you can do
whatever you want but we're going to
keep it down to one for now we'll save
that so we have our argument and let's
see what happens when we refresh the
page missing argument for footer see so
we've basically said that this function
has an argument we define it up here but
when we're actually using it we don't
give any value for the argument so
that's why PHP is giving us the error
code because it expects the seed
argument so how do you argument well
just a piece of text so we're going to
put stuff on and refresh that there we
go everything works so one thing I want
to mention let me just remove this
argument here I'm going to refresh that
page when you're learning PHP it's
really important that you start getting
familiar with error messages because
once because you're going to get error
messages while you're coding in real
life and it's very important that you
understand what the error messages mean
because they can look kind of cryptic at
first so when you're learning try to pay
attention to the error messages try to
understand them and sometimes it's good
idea to break your code on purpose just
to see what error messages are produced
and this and in time you're going to
become more and more familiar with the
error messages which will make coding a
lot easier
so let's go back and we'll add our our
value for the argument now if you notice
what refreshes again a function works
fine but we're not actually using
argument in our in our code to see we
have stuff and we're basically passing
the values to fan to the function footer
and when you let me just back up here
when you when you're setting a value for
an argument when you're adding an
argument into a function that you're
calling or calling footer in this case
we're adding the values to fan we're
giving that or passing that value it's
like think about passing the ball or
passing the battle we're passing that
value to footer now we've we said that
footer inside of our function will be
stuck in that will be placed inside the
variable email right by adding the
variable like this in between these
curtain ease brackets when we define our
function footer we're basically creating
this variable email that will be usable
within the function footer we'll get
back to that a little bit later to clear
that up just in case it's not clear to
you so what we're going to do is we're
going to go like this and we're going to
actually use our our argument in the
code so let's we say that let's see what
happens see hello world Stefan see now
we're actually using the argument within
our PHP function
the next step is to actually add another
argument I'll just call it argh for the
sake of speed and again if i refresh the
page we're going to get an error because
missing argument to saying we're missing
the second argument for the function
footer so we have to go back and we have
to again give a value for our two now
let us go to our PHP because I'm
shameless in my promotion and we'll just
refresh that hello everything works but
again we're not using our second
argument inside of our code here so
let's let's do that now you know I'm
just going to push this up like this
because we don't want more room for you
guys to see the actual code window
alright so let's actually use let's
actually use the second are you in here
inside of our code and again I'll just
append this like so nothing to get
excited about there it is what you want
to take away from this section is that
we could pass arguments into our
functions and then use those arguments
in our functions we can use them so many
different ways this is very basic where
we're just returning the values we could
actually do something like this for
instance just to show you that it
doesn't all have to be together we could
we could sell just deflate the script to
actually echo out a value so we're just
going to tell it to echo out the value
in the second argument and let's see
what happens here
and as we can see nothing happened and
the reason I did this was the show to
demonstrate another point is that when
you have a function you can have all
kinds of code in your function right but
when you hit the return that's when the
function stops doing its thing it's it's
basically tells PHP okay we've hit our
return this is our return and we've hit
a return statement alright functions
over move on and that's what happened it
never got to the echo because it got to
return first so we have to put our echo
first and will refresh that and then
we're going to see what happens okay
we're great so hello.php that was our
second argument and then we returned
this right that making sense here so
again to take away what you want to take
away from this part is that your return
statement inside of a function because
you could have tons of code here you
could call other functions you could
call dealt in PHP functions put them in
here you can create a whole set of your
own functions put them in here and you
can have footer call these functions but
at the end of the day when the function
hits the return statement that's the end
anything that comes after that will not
be processed by PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
