recovering from my cold I'm still taking
the Tylenol pills cold ensign is not
advertising it helps elves anyhow so
title of this vlog too much JavaScript
I'm a big fan of JavaScript I did a
whole course on JavaScript and I've
written a lot of apps with JavaScript in
the past what I'm seeing though these
days is people in their websites are
going my opinion are going a little bit
too JavaScript crazy now I got a brand
new laptop with an i7 and it's powerful
tons of RAM etc etc and I hit some of
these pages and they're loading so much
JavaScript in the pages that the browser
is trying to slow down it's just a real
pain now you add on top of this the fact
that the browser's all of them seems
these days are quite buggy a lot of
times you find browsers will start
eating up memories I think as in ram
memory i think with firefox it has a
memory leak you have to list you have to
shut down firefox every now and then
because it just starts slowing down
slowing down slowing down slowing down
over time and it because it just becomes
like unresponsive so the browser makers
in trying to make web browsers much more
sophisticated so that you can have
browser-based apps that replace
traditional installed applications so
sim install a excel on your computer you
would just use google docs or you'd use
google's cloud version of excel I
suppose anyhow
problem is that in their aims to make in
their aim rather in their goal to make
browsers more powerful more like the
clients they've become heavier and
buggier and they can cause problems so
you know I have issues every now and
then where I have to clear my browser's
cache especially on video based sites
and
because the videos that start going
blanc ii it doesn't work so you clear
the cache and everything works fine so
it's it's a normal issue with the
browsers you go to chrome support site
they talk about and so on so yeah when
you're developing your website and apps
use JavaScript but you know keep in mind
that the JavaScript can be heavy in
terms of the amount of memory or matter
CPU takes the process and some sites are
becoming wickedly difficult to navigate
because they're just so heavy with
JavaScript so my suggestion to you is to
like any other technology don't
necessarily run out and go nuts with
your JavaScript because you might make
your site less responsive and if you
want people to want to use your site and
want to use your web app if it's less
responsive and starts tanking all the
time
you may start losing some audience so I
would take care of that if I were you
all right I figured I'd use some mailbag
so this guy Drew wrote me I bought your
book I thought it would make a good
refresher for me and you can always
learn something new the fact you
mentioned no nonsense jargon is very
refreshing well thank you very much as
you know there are a ton of video
tutorials and books out there that are
packed full of fluff I see your videos
includes some tutorials on photoshop and
WordPress themes on Photoshop for
WordPress dreams
well we absolute Photoshop cs6 vo
courses in place I didn't create that
one I'm going to be taking it down
because I think that the role of
Photoshop has changed drastically in the
last several years in the web design and
development because because just the way
when we design sites today you don't
really need to leverage Photoshop like
we had to in the past you see in the old
days when you were designing sites a lot
of people rely heavily on Photoshop
because he would slice images who have
the optimizations
just the style of that time meant you
needed a sophisticated image editor like
Photoshop or Corel paint or their
drawers whatever I'll pick pick whatever
image editor you want in the old days of
web design images were used a lot more
great buttons and menus and all this
kind of stuff but that that's that's now
gone with html5 css3 you do all your
menuing your buttons in encode which is
10 times better than doing an image is
so what's left yeah creating sent me
images and so forth but you know you
don't need Photoshop for that you can
use online image editors that Google has
them and others that you know you just
you know I'll put a nice image it looks
good I teach about this in the HTML
class how to do that kind of stuff so
the old Photoshop courses will I keep
them there because some people still
want them but at the end of the day
modern-day web design the need for
sophisticated graphic design apps or
photo editing apps like Photoshop and so
on are highly highly diminished so don't
worry about that and he goes on to say
you know word press theme development
oversaturated no no not at all you think
that but I can see why you would think
that because there's so many theme
providers and so forth the thing is no
pre-made theme will do everything for
everybody especially in a business
context so and most business people
wouldn't know how to edit to the theme
at all so there's a huge market I've
talked about this other videos there's a
huge market for WordPress professionals
those are people who understand where
press how to install or configure it how
to install theme very good if you know
how to actually build a theme from
scratch very powerful skill set to have
and of course you need to know your
html5 your css3 a touch of JavaScript
and a little PHP helps so know even
though you you think that the wordpress
mark would be saturated it's not even
close to being saturated in terms of
being a wordpress professional would I
get into creating a wordpress theme
platform I'm not sure about that matters
a lot of themes out there live a lot of
theme providers but
of you providing WordPress theming
skills that you would sell as a
contractor to small businesses and
medium-sized business there's plenty of
work in that that's for sure
final question he says the other
question I had was does your book cover
a lot of what is in your video tutorials
yes and no the book covers it in a
different way but the video tutorials go
far more in depth
far more in depth I did write the book
to help me structure the basics of my
video courses that are now on Studio web
and in to some extent in the interactive
web developer but the book doesn't cover
nearly as much as what I get into
individuals they they complement for
sure because some people like to read
and then some people prefer to watch
videos some people like to do both I
actually learned from both I do a lot of
reading and I do video watching as well
but a lot of people prefer watching
exclusive videos and in the videos I was
not limited by the demands of the
publisher because when I wrote the book
it was published by a good publisher out
of the UK and the book is distributed
over world and on Amazon and I was
limited in terms of what I could talk
about I could only barely mention jQuery
barely mentioned JavaScript barely
mentioned PHP I concentrated on the
basic web concepts I cost you basically
html5 and css3 well a little bit more
than that actually but nonetheless yes
if you read the whole book would you get
a lot out of the videos wolf definitely
big time do you need the book to do the
videos not at all it's you there's some
overlap but the videos is going to
perform more detail because I'm able to
demonstrate all kinds of stuff like
animations and so on and finally if you
submit a comment or a question to me and
I don't get to it sometimes it's just
cuz I'm really busy other times because
sometimes the commenting and the
messaging system and YouTube is not the
easiest to navigate
there was like some questions I couldn't
approve and I was clicking through and
it did this just just didn't work
alright that's it for this vlog I'm
still a little bit under the weather but
I'm slowly improving bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
