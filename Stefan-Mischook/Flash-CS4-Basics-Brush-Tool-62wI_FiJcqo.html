the brush tool and I got to say the
brush tool inside a flash is actually
pretty simplistic when we compare it to
some of the other ones and as you can
see here if I were to choose the B brush
tool notice that my stroke color is
black so if I were to come in here it's
not giving you the stroke color the way
the pencil tool does so it's giving you
a fill color so pencil tool gives you
black for the stroke same as the line
tool but when you're working with
brushes you take the color of the fill
color that you have here well let's look
at some of the options for this
particular brush tool I'm just selecting
all control a and deleting it and at
this point you can see that if I were to
come in here and say they brush shape
what kind of shape the brush has that
I'll explain just a second but first
let's look at the brush size now I'm
just going to move this over so you can
see get a better glimpse of what that
actually looks like the brush shape is
one thing but the brush size is
something that I want to explore so I'm
going to choose the largest size that I
have available right now and you can see
that if I wanted to here is an S and
there is an a and n so let's say I
wanted to make something in a song serif
something like this right no seraphs as
you can see it looks a little like comic
song where all of the stroke sizes are
roughly all the same now I'm going to
delete that and I'm going to show you
something different if we were to choose
a different shape something that's not
completely circular but rather something
that has more of a slanted effect to it
you'll notice that this text now has
thick and thin transitions so in other
words areas where there's going to be
thicker text and areas where it's going
to be thinner so this emulates more of a
calligraphic brush so kind of gives you
an interesting approach to what you want
to be doing with these and how you want
them to all look so the brushes
themselves
and I've left behind something the
brushes themselves are kind of
interesting because you can choose from
different sort of shapes in your brushes
however let me just make well aware of
the fact that all of these brushes are
extremely limited not only in its size
but also in its shape and if you've ever
used brushes in Photoshop or illustrator
for that matter you'll notice that by
comparison flash is very very poor on
the brush strokes and the brush sizes
now that doesn't mean you can't do
things with the brushes certainly you
can but what it does actually mean is
that you'd probably do best if you're
looking for something that is a much
more you know professional view of
brushes to do well by looking at
illustrator or Photoshop and bring in
some of those since illustrator is a
vector-based drawing program just like
flashes it'd probably be best to take
some of the brushes from illustrator and
bring them into flash and we'll talk
more about bringing in drawings or other
elements from illustrator in another
video a little bit later on so other
than that there's really not much else
that you want to be dealing with your
brushes you'll notice that there is an
option here that allows you to paint
normal paint fills paint behind well
paint normal is what you want to be
doing but however like let's say I had
an object that looked like this and I'm
going to actually delete just the fill
shape and if I were to go back to my
tools maybe grab a pen tool and as you
can see i'm just going to you know come
in here and draw a little curvy shape
just as I've done there you'll notice
that these shapes are not filled in well
with the brush tool we could come in
here and say hey just paint the phils
and if I were to do this well you know
that doesn't really work all that well
that's one of the reasons I'm a little
reluctant to sort of show you what's
going on with that but if we said paint
behind that would work if we actually
had it Phil if we could say paint the
selection or pain
inside right so that works but as you
can see what it's allowing us to do is
to only paint what's inside there and if
you go out too much it doesn't really
work all that well for you now that
seemed to work ok but listen with all of
this information that you have here it's
probably so much easier and so much
better to just grab your paint bucket
tool and fill that information and just
like this much much simpler much easier
and you get much more precise results so
that's the you know basics of the brush
tool it's ok but there are better ones
out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
