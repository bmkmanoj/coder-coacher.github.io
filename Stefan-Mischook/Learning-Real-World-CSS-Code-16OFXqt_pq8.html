answer some questions put to me on the
YouTube so one question I got from this
guy says I'm learning CSS and should I
use CSS resets or should I just go into
CSS in terms of learning how each
browser works I would use CSS recess
because everybody uses CSS recess
whatever you're learning anything you
want to learn in a way that's oriented
towards the real world you want to code
like people code in the real world
that's all my courses are all structure
that's how I've learned that's how I've
done everything comes from my business
experience comes from my martial arts
experience what I want to learn had a
fight I would just fight now in boxing
for example a lot of people will do pad
work so some guy who holds up or a girl
holds up two pads and they go left right
jab left you know they go left right
jabber jab right blah blah blah and they
just do pads and pads and passwords you
do a heavy bag and skip rope and they do
all these exercise but they never get
down to the actual fighting I've seen
that for a longest time I remember when
I was how old was I maybe 16 or 17 7
like that when I first decided to get
into boxing at the doing martial arts
for quite a while at this point and a
friend of mine had joined the boxes go I
was like 18 and so friend of mine went
to a boxing school sighs he had been
going for mine so I'm gonna join you in
boxing finally so I went to the boxing
school and I walked in and I saw my
friend so what do you do he showed me
his routine said well how often do you
spar because I haven't sparred yet well
how long you been here oh six months
they said why haven't you started you
why I don't know I'm not feeling ready
so I said so first day I went in I went
into the ring with the head coach and I
sparred I took a major beating it was
unbelievable and but that was it when I
would going to the ring
hitting pads and bags all those little
exercises that are supposed to prepare
you for actual sparring I feel there's
people spent too much time hiding in the
exercises it's like when people go to
these training sites for code
and they just do these little little
training you know write one line of code
or two lines of code to move a character
or something like that that's that's
really not something you should hide it
that type of little thing we're writing
snippets of code she'd only be in the
very beginning what you should be doing
is actually writing real code building
things right away same thing when I
started to actually learn how to box I
got in there and I just started sparring
the first day now don't get me wrong I'm
sparring with the coach and while we
were sparring we're doing her feet and
boom boom boom boom boom and he would
say no no you got to put your hand here
you got to do this you got to do that
you got to do this and so I was learning
as we were sparring but a lot of
sparring because that's what you do we
were there to learn how to box now if I
want to be a professional pad hitter I
would just do two pads but I didn't want
to be a professional pad hitter I want
to be somebody who could box so I just
got in a ring and started fighting with
coding as well once you get your basic
fundamentals you should just be in there
you should be writing code so back to
his question should you use CSS reset
CSS resets are just code that you use to
reset the browsers so they are they all
have the same baseline what does that
mean in non nerd C I'm not sure how this
today but traditionally going back to
Stephen a few years browsers would have
different default settings for things
margins and padding in particular one
browser would have zero margins one
browser by default would have one pixel
margins now if you don't know what this
is just do a CSS course you know what
this is
now margins and padding for traditional
layout traditional CSS layout very
important and you have to be pixel
perfect with your layouts so that they
don't get messed up you actually show
you counting pixels it sounds worse than
it is actually not too bad once you know
what you're doing is not that difficult
but if you have one browser that's off
by one pixel and then you're in another
browser so ie has one pixel you know
that's a pixel here and Firefox doesn't
or a chrome does it could screw up your
layout so what people would do is they
would have
default CSS code using the star selector
and CSS it's kind of the universal
selector if you don't know what this is
don't worry just do some CSS anyway it
would basically write a little bit of
cold very quickly so when all the
browsers basically start off at the same
level same margin same padding and saves
you a lot of headaches so if I
understand this guy's question says
should I use a CSS reset or say just
learn what each browser does know
there's use the CSS reset because the
fact that the browser's are not play
even is just you can almost think of it
as a bug in the browser so you don't
need to learn all the stupid bugs with
browsers new versions that get patched
and you know who cares what ie9 does or
what chrome 56 does right who cares just
reset so you play on an even playing
line baseline rather and the way you do
remember what coding you have to commit
some things to memory but at the end of
the day as you become more and more
advanced you better forget all the
details there's no question you're gonna
fit all kinds of deal I literally have
forgotten much more than I remember too
today about programming coding and in
fact sometimes I'll forget basics like
how do you do that again and CSS it's no
big deal because I know my foundation I
know my car and I just go to Google i/o
boom boom boom and I get the answer in
two seconds and there it is boom so in
the beginning yes you have to learn the
syntax you have to the syntax of a nerd
word for the actual code that you write
but as you become more advanced it
doesn't matter it's like it's the
principles that matter it's architecture
what matters is good coding practices
that matter and the specifics about you
know whether you have to how do you
access a node within the Dom I forget
the code off the top of a head right now
even though I've done courses on it and
I've written so many so much code I just
forget cuz why cuz I haven't done it
recently it doesn't matter you just go
and you just google it up and there you
go that's all it is to it so let me end
this video and say when you learn how to
code you start with your core and your
foundation of course does that that's
what my course does I feel that that gap
but you can do it of course you want
after that
there's two sites I recommend it for
general web stack programming and
general program in general well first of
all if you got questions that are very
specific the first place I would go
would be Stack Overflow it's like a huge
repo of information check that out you
can get some very specific answers or
voted up it's a great site for that and
that would be the first place I go if
you got very specific questions in terms
of when you're building a project if you
have if you want to learn something new
about HTML or CSS or bootstrap or
angular or whatever but I would go to
the w3 schools they have a bunch of
tutorials there are fantastic if you
know your foundation your core your
school there boom boom boom the answers
is concise you can test the code you can
check it out it's great it's better than
so many commercial projects that are out
there
that's where I recommend once you know
your basically if you don't know
anything it's not gonna be good for you
you're gonna be what is this that's
where my courses come in so those are
the two places I would go on a day to
day basis as a profession of l44 a web
star if you're doing Python I should use
the Python Docs the Python Docs are
well-recognized and so on again once you
know your basic Python if you want to
learn how to do this or any other thing
bye honey boom boom boom limbs right
there again Google's your friend or you
can go specific to one of these sites
aiming with PHP if you forget how to do
something in PHP just go to PHP done
that boom boom boom it's all there with
example it's pretty good so there you
have it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
