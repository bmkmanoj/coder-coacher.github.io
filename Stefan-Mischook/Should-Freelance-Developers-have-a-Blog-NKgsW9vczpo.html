to me by and senior developer an
experienced developer who is looking to
maybe get into the freelance game so
this question is basically I'm gonna
paraphrase the email as it's a pretty
long one the question is does it make
sense to put up a blog site should you
put up a vlog a blog a for quick answer
to that is yes of course put up a blog
blog today is almost a standard thing a
professional web professional should
have whether you are a developer a
front-end designer or even a social
media marketer you should have yourself
a website and a blog that you can use to
promote yourself and to create like a a
home base for yourself it legitimizes
you to a certain extent because at least
people could say okay here is a place
where we can contact this guy he has a
hub on the web he has a home on the web
he's an is just not some nebulous person
who floats around on the interwebs
so having yourself a blog site where you
write articles about your profession
makes sense to me so what kind of
articles would you write well you might
want to write about a particular
technologies you're using what you like
what you dislike about it in the context
of a particular job you are working on
now or you may have done what I wouldn't
put and the guy's asking about that
should I put opinions about video games
I play that kind of stuff I would really
be very careful about how much very
personal personal personal or hobby ish
oriented blog post I would put on my
professional site if you want to write
about your hobbies I would have a
separate site for that personally
because think about it if you were going
to hire a doctor or an accountant would
you want to read ten thousand blog posts
about is the factory likes to go fishing
or something I don't know
again you could have it because it
personalizes you but you want to not go
crazy with that if you have a
professional site with the intention of
using it as a way to help but legitimize
yourself out there on the interwebs so
that you get some freelancing gig gigs
which is a good idea I would strongly
recommend that you stick to blog
subjects that are related to your
industry in some way or another you
could do like a piece on the computer
that you're using why you like using
this operating system or at that
operating system or maybe you like using
this code editor app versus that code
editor app all those things are pretty
cool the key to the blog site when
you're getting into the whole
freelancing game is again to legitimize
yourself to get the word out and you'd
be surprised in time if you write well
and you write a decent amount of
articles you'll have to go crazy you
will start getting interested in the
work but you do even if you're not
interested in freelancing it's good to
have a blog site that you can reference
prospective employers because if they
see that you're actually interested
enough in the work that you do the
programming work - the development work
that you do the social media marketing
work that you do if I was a prospective
employer if I saw that you were writing
blog post and you were interested in it
what you actually did it'd be far more
likely but I would want to hire you
because people who are interesting to
work but they do tend to do better work
than people who are just doing it for
the money
so yeah definitely put out a blog site I
would very much limit the amount of
personal articles you put up there
especially video-game-playing stuff like
that you do a little bit I suppose but I
would stick to techie nerd stuff I would
stick to subjects that would interests
it would interest prospective employers
in terms of you showing your - you're
interested in technology that you're
actually working with this goes back to
what I've talked about a few other vlogs
developers whether you're full stack
and whatnot should develop good
communication skills and that starts
with writing actually if you can write
well it's going to actually help you to
speak well because when you write
they're able to really examine the words
that you're putting out there you're
able to consider how it is you present
things and that's an important an
important aspect of communications so
it's easier to organize your thoughts on
paper or typing it out than it is in
speaking so they start learn to write
well first learn to speak well
communication skills will help you a lot
more than learning some new framework in
terms of your career</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
