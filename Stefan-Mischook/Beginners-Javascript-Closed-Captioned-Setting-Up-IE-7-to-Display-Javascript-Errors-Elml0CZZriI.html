learn how to configure ie7 to display
our javascript errors of course we want
to do this because seeing the error
message is produced by the browser makes
our lives a lot easier when we're
writing our JavaScript so let's jump
into the code right away
so here we are you can use any text
editor you want of course we seen this
before this is an alert and we got our
JavaScript block of course so let's take
a look at how IE displays this when it
works so that IE here I 7 hit alert we
get our windows internet explorer alert
box and so now let's do something that
would cause an error so I took off the
semicolon here that JavaScript period
you know remember semicolon is like a
period so we'll say that let's launch
into X bar again hope it works anyway
into X bar is very forgiving so let's
just take off the bracket that should
bust so here we go my my code editors
Tommy you you probably got a problem
here with the code here so let's just up
launch a consider explorer again alright
so we see nothing happens let me just
bring this in so we know that it's not
working but of course we don't know why
so what we need to do is you go into
tools you're going to internet options
and you want to go into advanced options
here and under browsing scroll down you
want to say display a notification about
every script error so that's the first
thing you want to do and we can have to
say we can actually enable that as well
so we're going to apply and now let's
just refresh this and here we go we get
our little box that pops up and it tells
us some detail about the errors now you
can hide the details you may have it
like this and so go show details and it
tells us what line etc etc etc just like
we did in Firefox and you also see down
here it gives you a little little ! or
telling you that something has gone
wrong on the page with school k the page
loads
and yes oh there you go so that will
tell us we have a bug and error in our
internet explorer so let me just finish
this off now they're very forgiving
Internet Explorer is very forgiving
where allows us to not put in a
semicolon but always like putting in the
semicolon at the end of a line of
JavaScript code because it just it's
cleaner that way so let's reload/refresh
there we go I'm back so as you can see
well you know what I'm just going to
jump there and show you this in a
Firefox just of imperative to so I'll
just reload the page you see how Firefox
cause the JavaScript application on
backs a little bit different let's see
how the error display is a difference
i'll say that oh this in firefox you see
we've got nothing now you have to
actually go into error console and show
a console in a clear vez and I'll reload
and you can see our error appears now
here's the thing the error console in
Firefox is more detailed I find it's
it's more accurate i suppose and that's
in display vs ie7 but it's a little bit
more of a hassle because you're going to
have to have your aircon so open on the
side here so you can load the page you
can see the errors coming in on the side
here so if you have a lot of real estate
screen real estate that is then the
error console in javascript is kind of
cool and but if your may be stuck with
some terms of screen real estate IE is
much more compact where you see what's
going on right on the page itself you
don't have to explicitly go and say show
me the error console so it's up to you
to decide which way you want to go in
terms of using ie7 or Firefox although i
did mention before that I kind of prefer
Firefox but I'm revising that statement
a little I guess it depends on how you
want to work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
