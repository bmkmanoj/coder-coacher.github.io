shadows and in particular the box shadow
in the last video I'm going to show you
another new css3 feature called text
shadow as you might imagine just as
inning box can be given a drop shadow so
too can any piece of text so let me show
you what I mean if we wish to implement
some text shadow and I'm just jumping
back on over to our work in our style
sheet I'm going to move on up to the
header h1 so if you remember we do have
a heading in the h1 and what I want to
be doing with it actually I'm going to
copy the box shadow information
including our safari a little bit right
there and what I want to do is to come
in here where the header h1 is and i'm
going to paste that information right in
there but instead of box shadow let's
put in text shadow and as you might
imagine the exact same information will
work for you text shadow as with your
box shadow now you'll notice here that
the same declaration horizontal shadow
vertical shadow blur amount and color is
all going to be exactly what we need it
to so in this case however i'm just
going to come in here and put a value of
22 and well let's say two as well just
so that you can see it a little bit
better and you can kind of see what's
happening now do remember we we have a
very gray of shadow here you can make
that whatever color you want it doesn't
have to be great could be read for all
you care so i'm going to save that and
let's go back to our work and check that
out look at that we made it come off by
two and it's looking just the way it is
here now that's just fine and dandy you
can leave that in there and there's
really no problem with it it's great to
use you can even do some fun things
although I will change this but let's
imagine we wanted our shadow to be
or our text to be all white so i'll put
in 6 f's in here and if i save that and
preview this again check that out you
can have like a same colored background
actually since my background is not
white I'd probably make it the same
color as the background here now here's
the only problem number one with doing
something with white on white with a
drop shadow it works great if the drop
shadow is there but the only problem
with our text shadow declaration I'm
going to change that back to normal
right now and save it the only problem
with it is the simple fact that it will
not work in internet explorer so that
means even if you're working with the
latest version of internet explorer
internet explorer 9 which is much more
friendly to css3 and html5 elements it
still does not support the text shadow
so I would not put white text on a white
background with a shadow until Internet
Explorer can support it and the reason
being is because well you know if I
switch on over and we look at our work
back the way it was just a second ago
this still shows our shadow and the only
difference is is that in internet
explorer well there is no shadow it'll
just look the way it did just a second
ago and one of the other things that you
should keep in mind is that the blur
effect that's here again could be set to
zero and if i do that i just want to
show it to you to see what it looks like
and then we preview this in our browser
take a look it's just not a blurry
shadow still a shadow there it's just
not blurry but we've offset it on the
horizontal and vertical by about two
pixels so that's how you work with drop
shadow in text so text shadow another
great new feature inside of css3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
