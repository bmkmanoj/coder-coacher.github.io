now shooting this log on my brand new
camera I don't know if you even go to
see the difference but we'll soon see
I'm using a new mic but I'm gonna be
upgrading it might very soon matter how
clear the sound is gonna be anyhow so
let's get to it
is Bitcoin a bubble is aetherium a
bubble is litecoin a bubble so a bubble
is an economic term a finance term it
refers to when an asset class could be a
house could be Bitcoin could be theorem
could be stock market could be anything
that you buy and sell in terms of hoping
what the value will go up this is an
asset so Bitcoin is now an asset the
government's I think they call it a
commodity I think they treat it as a
commodity and there's all these tax
implications for that so the big
component is a Bitcoin in a theory and
like coin they think it's the the
blockchain underlying all these coins
this a technology called blockchain
which is a kind of a giant database so
so far so good if you were invested in
these things from the beginning you've
made a huge amounts of money if you
cashed out and I have no idea if and
when it's going to collapse or if it's
going to collapse it is by definition
though a I don't know by definition but
it is very much a gambling instrument in
the sense that you have something like
Bitcoin where it's very hard to buy
anything with Bitcoin it's very hard to
do anything with Bitcoin it's not like
you can go buy a car with Bitcoin if you
can it's very difficult to do it it
doesn't have any other utility at this
time people are just buying it simply
because it's going up and I think a big
part of it is driven by the Asian market
because the Chinese is very much a
gambling culture they love to gamble
Chinese is driving up housing prices in
Canada and us because they're looking
for ways to gamble they drove up their
own housing prices
and that's just the nature of the game
so am I saying bitcoin is a bad thing to
be in I'm not saying that I'm saying
it's gonna be a very dangerous thing to
be in because just like the dot-com
bubble stock market where all these
companies that have no sales no profits
or losing tons of money they had these
crazy evaluations meaning the market
decided they were huge amounts of money
even though they weren't actually
generating any income and I was around
during the dot-com bubble era and many
many of these companies this way fell
apart with totally bankrupt and
everybody who was invested lost
everything now you have to understand
something
at that time when people were looking at
these dot-com bubble stocks that went
bust
viii there was a lot of reasons why
people were buying it they came up of
all these reasons and if you debated
with people say well listen the
companies are not making any money or
they're losing tons of money there's
nothing special with their technology
they would argue if you argue if you are
with you they had all these reasons why
these companies were worth so much even
though they weren't earning anything
kind of like Bitcoin kind of like
aetherium let's go back let's go back
not so far
2007 2008 something like that when you
had the silver and gold mania he had all
these silver people and silver became
not just a commodity to buy and to
speculate on it also became almost like
a pseudo religion it was a fight against
the the evil bankers you buy silver you
take down the bankers and silver was
real money will never go down and became
like a cult where people were so into
silver they would stack silver they
actually called himself silver stackers
you would see all these YouTube videos
where people would have like video they
would take videos of all their silver
and all the different types of coins
they had breaks and they were saying
it's like they're showing off their
prized dogs look at my silver stacks and
they were sure
that when the whole system collapsed
their silver would shoot up in value at
the end of the day all these people buy
silver and gold they're doing it because
they were they were speculating they
were hoping that the value of gold so
we're gonna go up in fact they were
convinced and he had all these reasons
that they thought silver was going to go
to 500 the ounce and gold was gonna go
to 10,000 the ounce etcetera etcetera
etcetera and when you see a situation
like that when you see within an asset
class assets could be gold silver
Bitcoin houses whatever when people
start telling you that it could never go
down and they start coming up with these
weird nebulous things or excuses as to
why these things are so valuable that's
the time when you got to start being a
little bit concerned about what's going
on that's usually indicator of an
approaching the top before a collapse
now I'm not saying bitcoins gonna
collapse now all I'm saying is that as
more and more as you see those signs
those type of type of reasoning come out
you have to be concerned about what
actually is going to happen down the
road you know so with regards to silver
and gold the people were being told when
silver was like 35 $40 $45 an ounce it
was good they go to 500 and he had
people out there who were pushing this
whole narrative and turns out these
people were in the business of selling
silver so a lot of these silver guys out
there would come on and talk about you
know how the system was corrupt and how
the bankers were corrupt and govern was
corrupt and the only way protect
yourself would be to buy silver and gold
meanwhile they were selling you to
silver in gold and a basic piece of
logic that people didn't want to listen
to it was that you know if these guys
thought that silver and gold was so
valuable why were they selling it all
and taking the worthless American
dollars used to call it the Fiat dollars
let me dispel one other myth out there
that you're gonna hear in the
cryptocurrency markets where the crystal
the cryptocurrency community is about
the US dollar and
the Canadian dollar and Swiss franc all
these all these currencies backed by
governments how they're worthless
they're absolutely worthless but somehow
bitcoin is worth more this is so
ridiculous it's so ridiculous because
bitcoins value is dependent on whether
or not there's people who believe in its
value
Sooners you got maybe ten or twenty
percent of the people decide that it's
not valuable that's all it takes to move
a market probably less the whole thing
will collapse
so bitcoins value its price is totally
dependent on people believing that it's
going to keep going up so those people
start thinking it's not going to go up
it's gonna crash a currency even
fluctuates so much weight as Bitcoin and
does and theorem does it's not a
currency because you can't the whole
point of currency is to exchange value
to be able to exchange value but if the
currency fluctuates so much you can't
you can't use it it's not it's not a
useable tool in that regard
that's why currency is issued by
governments are much more usable because
they don't fluctuate so much yeah one or
two percent you know whatever they may
slowly change five ten percent in a year
unless they're having major economic
upheavals or something so this whole
idea again Bitcoin is somehow more
secure than u.s. dollar is absolute
lunacy because US dollars backed by so
much more than just to speculate
speculators in the Bitcoin market the US
dollar is backed by the value of the
United States the value of the United
States includes all its land all the
resources all the gold and the oil and
all the farming land that is the u.s.
it's also backed by all the productivity
of the entire US population hundreds of
millions of people the government can
tax these people thus backing the dollar
the dollar is also backed by the
military US military very important you
got a sound something if the Chinese
government or the US government or
European Union ever decided to put the
clamps down on the crypto currencies the
clamps technical term for making it
illegal it's over the game
is over so am i saying don't speculate
in Bitcoin no because it's been super
profitable and as I've learned through
hard experience about asset bubbles they
could go on for years for instance that
a lot of the dot-com companies that
eventually went bust they they kept
going for years and years and years and
years and years and you know about five
six years and even though they were
worthless in the end right so keep that
in mind so all I'm saying is if you do
decide to speculate in cryptocurrencies
which I think it could be very valuable
because we're actually my friend and I
were looking at it we're looking at
different things my friend put together
a couple of theory of miners and right
now the theory of miners you got an ROI
9 to 12 9 to 10 months depending on your
own electricity cause of so forth I'm
gonna be breaking that this down a bit
more as we go into it it's worth
exploring there's no question but don't
think that cryptocurrencies and is a
panacea and meaning it's it's the all
and I'll be all that's that's not true
some variant of it of that technology
maybe maybe results in something but I
would be very surprised that in five
years that Bitcoin will still be super
valuable I think once the government's
decide to do something about it it's
over these things are over because don't
fool yourself if the cryptocurrencies
live up to the aspirations of some of
these cryptocurrency people in that it's
going to you know you know replace
traditional currencies and bypass
government controls are you crazy the
government's are gonna come after you so
hard so fast you'd be done in about ten
seconds alright that's pretty much it
