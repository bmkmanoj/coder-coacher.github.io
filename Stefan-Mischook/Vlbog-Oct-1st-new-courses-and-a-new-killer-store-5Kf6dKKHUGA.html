Keller sites
calm I haven't done a video blog in a
little while and reason I haven't done a
video blog in a while is because I'm
suffering from a key itís which is an
acute form of pure and simple laziness
I've just been too lazy to get to it
been preoccupied with other things but
fortunately we have been working on a
bunch of new content and some of it is
online at the killer video library right
here and just killer size column /video
dash library and so we've put out a few
courses on dreamweaver cs6 a monster 1
1230 hours Photoshop cs6 we've put out a
new PHP shopping cart video which now
has many more advanced features than the
traditional one but we have and it also
is backed by a MySQL database so it's
kind of cool beyond that we've been
working on our video store now here is
the current via storm it's live very
simple kind of a blogger's type of
interface with some ecommerce
capabilities added on it's ok but what
we're doing how we're about to release a
far more advanced that you store that is
well two main things first of all we've
made the video is much easier to find
and turns are categorizing them as well
restyled it on to show you here here's
here's what it looks like on the dev
site this is not the latest version but
gives you a pretty good idea what you're
going for here so click on killer sites
collection instead of having to go to
many pages you can see our our major
courses all easily found on one page
what's I guess besides the fact that you
know we have a totally different look
and feel what makes this store a little
bit more interesting is that we're
adding the ability for users
to rate courses and videos and to
comment on them so that will be
integrated within these sites so you
click on a particular course and you're
going to have the testimonies here here
live plus or a rating system on this
version of course the user reviews and
rating as has not been implemented but
they'll be there very soon we're also
going to have a video a blog for the
video store for the first time and
insight up with a blog here because I
wanted to comment and start blogging
about very specific videos within the
courses themselves or some interesting
things that we may be able to discuss
and I'm also going to include some
exclusive video content on the store
that may or may not be included in any
of the courses themselves the idea is to
make the video store not just a place to
come and pick up videos but also a
really really interesting place to learn
there's going to be as with the current
storm there's going to be a lot of free
videos there for you to watch but the
new system this video's will be given a
much better context meaning the it's
going to be much I don't know how to
describe it I guess it's going to be
going to be positioned more effectively
so they're easier to find and there's
going to be a relationship and there's a
little bit more commentary on the videos
themselves by the blog and the rating
systems I guess so yeah that's about it
I don't want to go on any more about
this so that's it so besides that i
myself am working on a new course or two
I just been really delayed with that
specifically I'm working on a new
beginners web design course to replace
my very old and very first course or
produced I guess it was in 2003 maybe
earlier I'm not sure and now that the
course is relevant now although because
web design has not changed radically in
terms of the basics anyway since that
time the last big evolution of web
design was and I guess 2003 to maybe
2004 again now where there's a shift
from table based design for page
structure to CSS based design for page
page structure and that was a major
shift and it really affected even all
the web design tools and even photoshop
and they had to adjust to this new
paradigm if in web design so yeah
besides that unfortunately my previous
course which is called what's it called
it's called web design one it actually
here it is it actually taught modern web
design techniques using CSS positioning
and so on although some of the like in
this video besides the factors may would
have much smaller video size because of
the time and the sound quality wasn't
isn't nearly as good as what we do now
simply because i was using a crappy mic
back then I didn't know what I was doing
in that regard the you know you see me
using IE 6 in this old versions of
firefox so it kind of freaks people out
anyway so putting together a new
beginners web design course I'm putting
together we're also putting together
rather a new jQuery basics course to
update our previous title although
everything taught in our older titles
are relevant it's just we want to spruce
them up with newer graphics into sort of
cool some of the newer stuff as well and
besides that I got some other
interesting titles but I been slowly
working on taking notes and structuring
things anyway we'll stop there I want to
bore you guys so click more very soon
thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
