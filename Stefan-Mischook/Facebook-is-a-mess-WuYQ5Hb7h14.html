with killer sites com I'm on my Facebook
page I had to do this video because i
haven't been on I haven't been on
facebook you know in a while I have one
of my assistants who sort of manages the
facebook pages for me and it decided to
take a look because you know it's there
we got a couple and your friends you
know although I don't we don't actively
use Facebook except to promote some of
our videos and so on so i'm making this
video because I'm just flabbergasted at
how disorganized facebook is it's
incredible it's an incredible mess now
it's i guess if i use them more often i
would get to know it but it's really
really crazy in terms of where to find
things security settings it's for
instance i noticed that you can't really
delete anything you can you can archive
it but i don't think you can delete
anything it's very interesting in terms
of you know your info and the state is
where to find things like for instance
college concordia university ba
psychology I didn't get my bae i quit
college and i started my first business
so I never finished my BA so I click on
OK category okay it takes me Concordia
fine so let's go back so what say I want
to edit that I want to edit my college
situation it's very weird it's like so
what do I go I'll go to edit excuse me
so ba psychology okay maybe I understand
oh ok i found it finally ok so my
apologies ok I take that at
concentrations
okay psychology oh you're so there we go
we found something there yeah I just I
just fine so I proved myself wrong
you're supposed I just find that
Facebook is really a mess and my little
status update facebook is like the
Highlander movies great idea a bad
implementation it's it's uh yeah yeah it
is you know the wall so lucky either
newsfeeds okay so I'm here how do i get
to my wall why isn't this consistent
where is the wall again you know now if
I go back here I guess no go back to my
prior we go I have to click on my
profile get to my wall it's very strange
why not have the wall right here why do
I change it anyway what's the point of
this video I guess to save it you know
from somebody from the point of view
somebody who has not used facebook in a
while I have to say that it's it's quite
the mess I'm surprised how messy it is
to be honest with you I figured it'd be
at least a consistent interface that
allow you to say click home I just click
home and where's the wall now like this
is news feed but why did it all
disappear why I don't have the option of
the law yeah so let's let's go back okay
i click facebook i have to guess i had
to click on myself okay now i click on
myself i get to the wall so obviously i
don't understand the facebook logic it
seems like facebook was designed by a
bunch of frat kids who are stoned and
drunk and it's sort of like reminds me
of what my my my apartment looked like
when i was in college quite the mess so
anyway you know I think you know there's
a potential opportunity for somebody if
they can some big player like Google or
something if they can come up with
organized social network where people
can actually you know find things where
things are consistent and you can
actually have decent privacy settings
it's like you know privacy said it's
like but you know I race software you
know I written software in many
languages and it's unclear to me you
know really what's always going to do
for people you know all these privacy
settings it seemed to be a very strange
kind of like reminds me of the credit
card application forms where they make
them really complex so you don't really
know what the deal is it seems to me I
get the impression facebook facebook is
making their privacy settings extremely
difficult so that people have no clue
what the heck's going on yeah anyway so
that's it that's my criticism I'm just a
pretty surprised at how unfriendly say
facebook seems to be at least from my
point of view maybe I'm just an old
school nerd who knows but anyway I think
there's an opportunity here for some
player to come up with a better
organized a more user-friendly interface
for social network and maybe improve the
privacy settings you know make them
simple I think the hope the new google
thing actually has a better idea what
their circle of friends although i don't
use that either you know I'm not much of
a social networker to be totally honest
with you perhaps that's a mistake of
mine anyway that's it Facebook's a real
mess I'm pretty surprised at how messy
it really is I had stopped using
Facebook a couple years ago myself
because it got me in trouble with my
girlfriend at the time and
that I was doing anything but there is
this perception i was doing something
and apparently i'm not alone i was
reading as somebody was telling me
apparently like a lot of marriages they
cite facebook as one of the reasons for
divorce you know old girlfriends
ex-girlfriends you know contacting
husband soon-to-be-divorced husbands or
wives and getting everybody jos and you
know if you've gone if you're going to
communicate with your ex-girlfriends you
better better do it privately of course
yeah privacy and Facebook yeah that's
it's not something I go together alright
that's it i hope i didn't boy with this
quick little vblog screencast I suppose
we'll talk to him</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
