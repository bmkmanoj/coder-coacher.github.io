going to take a closer look at the bone
tool and see what you can do with it
especially if you've brought in some
elements from other applications like in
this case Photoshop or if you had things
that you'd brought in from illustrator
or anything else so as you can see here
this particular Photoshop document had
individual elements of the picture on
its own layer so they had been extracted
and all the background had been removed
so you'll notice we do have our
background layer there's the left arm
layer that's there and the last three
layers are the right upper the right arm
and the hand and you'll notice that in
each one of these particular instances
what I had done was when it was imported
I had converted each of those bitmap
layers into what we see here
movie clip objects and remember if
you're working with the bone system you
have to work with your movie clip
objects so what I'm going to do is to
take the bone tool and just start
clicking on the different elements that
you wish to maneuver with that bone so
what you can see here is that I've
quickly and easily tempted to set up the
bone system as you can see and let's
take a look again at what had happened
when we did that an armature layer is
created the hand right arm and right arm
upper have all had their elements
extracted from them and placed onto the
armature layer now since we've got all
those things on their own layer I'm
hitting the trashcan and we're going to
delete those so there's the left arm and
there's the rest of the background that
we had in place and if you remember when
you're using the bone tool you can just
go to any position for example I'll go
right here right click and say insert
pose now you'll notice that when we're
where'd everything else go well that's
just a matter of extending the other two
layers so I'll extend these by inserting
frames to
frame 30 or so let's see what do we want
to do with our arm at this position well
remember you can move it up you can move
it down you can position it back here
whatever the case may be as you can see
it's moved from there to there let's
give it another pose over here like
maybe back here and then finally I'll
give it its final pose over here which
will bring back down like that so let's
take a look if we scrub the timeline we
can see the object is moving pretty much
back and forth like this so if I wanted
to press control enter to test our movie
we can see and this is all inside of a
movie clip so as you can see we've got
the beginning of our boxer starting to
move its hand around and again it's it's
rather rudimentary here we're not really
dealing with anything that's overly
complex or overly produced but
nevertheless as you can see you can
create some really easy animation and I
could have taken a long time to do when
you were using the older flash system
that didn't make all that much use of
something like a bone tool because we
didn't have it so enjoy the bone system
it's really fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
