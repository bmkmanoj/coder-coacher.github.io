killer sites calm and killer PHP calm in
this video tutorial I want to teach you
how to use cPanel to do two things
number one create a email account an
email account scuse me and then set up
an email for der to send your emails to
some other email address what I suggest
what people do is you set up an email
account for your particular site so of
your site happens to be killer sites
calm you set one up for killer sites
calm but then what I would do is then
for that email to some cloud-based email
service what's a cloud-based service
gmail yahoo mail etc and the reason I
will suggest that is because it's just
so much more convenient to have your
email stored on a cloud-based email
service like Gmail so that you can
access your email from anywhere in the
world from any computer it's just
convenient so there you go so I jumped
into the cPanel interface for one of our
sites killer JavaScript comm the cPanel
layout that you might see in front of
you could be very different from this or
a little bit different depending on
which version of cPanel your hosting
company has provided for you but you
should be able to follow follow along
regardless if your hosting company does
not use cPanel and uses an alternative
like plus course something else the
principles are a hundred percent
applicable so you should be able to
learn anyway so what I'm going to look
for is email accounts I click on that
and in here it shows you what email
accounts are associated with this
particular website and as you can see
right down here we have no email
accounts so let's just create one right
now so I'm gonna call it Stefan I'm
gonna give it a password of Stefan
- no no 33 now let me just do that again
Stefan - 33 I'm just confirming I mean I
didn't write it properly so try again
Stefan - 33 well maybe Stefan - 33 there
we go I was kept writing Stef you see
how cPanel responded here on the side
when I didn't have a matching email
address emails don't match you got a
confirm it right first password
confirmation password the reason to use
a - and then a number after Stefan is
just to keep the strength of the
password pretty strong as you can see
cPanel tells us approximately how strong
they think the password is you see if
you have a password with dashes and
numbers mixed in with letters and a
lower case upper case it will increase
the strength of the password making it
harder to break for email count
passwords is not as important as say for
instance a password to access your
banking so anyhow so I've done this
create account account create is there
you go so our account is created and
we'll cPanel we're able to change a
password and change quotas quotas
basically how much how many emails well
how many emails you have in terms of
megabytes before the system blocks any
other emails coming in so right now it's
that through 250 makes it really depends
on the type of email account that you
have you know if it's your mania email
account you want it may want to Croesus
if it isn't you can decrease it of
course when you initially created the
email address you could have set it
right here or you can set it to
unlimited as well it's up to you so what
cPanel does is it makes it really easy
for you to configure your software on
your computer to access your email from
your computer you can just configure
email client client is a nerds term for
email software
and you got different applications you
can configure so let's say you know
click Auto configure Microsoft Outlook
mm so I just go right here so it
basically just gives you a warning about
what its gonna do it sets your etc so
you download the file will follow your
registration information and set stuff
for you if you're using a an email of
software that's not listed here you can
just use the manual settings that are
right here and it gives you everything
you need to know to be able to log in
and read the email so just in case some
of your smart guys to think you can go
check Stefan's killer site killer
JavaScript b-mail this email will not
exist by the time this video is done I
go back now that I got the email account
set up right we have it listed here
I want to afford this particular email
to another account so afford any email
comes into this now I sent it to my
gmail account so you easily done by
going back and what you want to look for
is forwarders under the mail tab so you
click that and what you do is you say
add for tour now you notice that there's
these are all empty that's because
there's no for tours yet so go ahead
forwarders so I say Stefan
iq JavaScript calm that's the email
address we just created and then we just
specify what email address you want to
send it to so in my case one said to
Stephane dot killer size at gmail.com
and that's good that's it and I just go
I can just hit add for tur there we go
that's it the email sent to Stephane at
killer JavaScript accountant comm will
now be all copy to defend our killer
sites at gmail.com and there you go it's
as simple as that
we set up an email account using cPanel
and we set up a mail order and I told
you why I like to mail forward my mail
to Gmail
the advantages are quite men that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
