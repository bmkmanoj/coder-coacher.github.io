so I just have a few things I want to
cover it's around one o'clock Friday and
I just finished applying the last
typographic or typographical or the
corrections to the text in the Python
course studio web version the
interactive quizzing component so it's
now live and if you did by the Python
pre-release and you downloaded the
videos and you want to do the
interactive quizzing component to send
me email although I will over the next
few days I'll be sending out an email to
everybody so they can sign up if they
want to so if you bought the pre-release
you can get access to the interactive
training if you feel a need for it so
there are a hundred and seventy quiz
questions and I also added a chapter 8
where I got into file manipulation and
error trapping or exception handling
with Python just because I thought
people might want to see that with this
course right now it's called beginners
Python although I had another name for
it but then it was found out it was copy
written somebody had gotten it or was in
the process of getting it so not to get
into fights I should forget it and I
might call it something else anyway it's
a beginners Python course like my other
courses it's really there to establish
the foundation let me amend that like my
new courses it's really there to create
that foundation because one thing that
I've learned over the years whether it
be in pipe Python programming JavaScript
any language really martial arts
business just app development in general
the key to success and all these sayings
is to have a good grasp of the basic and
fundamental concepts like when I
practice my drumming most of my work is
on keeping time because that's any
drummer will tell you any musician will
tell you with any experience the most
important thing that
the drummer can do is keep the time if
the drummer doesn't keep time it just
sounds terrible and so instead of trying
to work on fancy patterns and fills and
rolls and stuff I work on getting a
super hard timing what you find in
drumming is when you start really
working on your timing you you you can
look at timing is not being a single
line to be on but rather two tracks and
timing you can work and be within time
within these two tracks so you can start
playing with the way you you drum in the
way you handle the timing in the song
and that's what a feel comes in so you
can really change the dynamics of the
tune based on how you play within that
timing range if you will it's a lot of
fun and I used to do that action with
martial arts every person has a time
signature if you will every person so
when you're in the ring fighting with
somebody and you're spying the first
thing you're trying to do is you're
trying to assess their timing because if
you can get their timing then you're
going to destroy them it's it's it's not
even issue because if they're if they're
if they're beat if you will and let's
simplify it I'm going to simplify this
in this example they're beat is 1 1 1 2
3 1 1 you know you can time it because
you see the are they always move they're
always working on his timing here so in
in the half beat when they're just about
to throw their most vulnerable and you
can just go poop and nail the book and
nail them and that's where having a very
subtle understanding of timing comes in
which brings me to another principle
something that I picked up a long time
ago the difference between successful
apps successful fighters successful
coders is a master the fundamentals and
it's in the nuances in the subtleties
and nuances I'm sure I've mentioned this
in other vlogs today with separates
really the successful apps in a nozzle
so successful apps is UX UI UX UI is the
big
of it and to really create beautiful UX
excuse me beautiful UI and very
functional UX UI is user interface and
UX is user experience to create that
subtlety in that beautiful experience
and apples probably consistently the
best at that whether or not you're an
Apple fanboy or what not I'm just saying
I use Windows Android I have a pixel
phone I use a Windows 10 I got tablets I
got Mac OS I got ILS devices and Apple
they really have a nice there's such a
subtlety or nuance to how the operating
systems work iOS and Mac OS that's why
they can command such a high price for
the computers because even though their
computers may seem underpowered spec
wise in terms of overall experience it's
that smooth experience that's the
subtleties and how the operating system
works it makes a big difference
alright so a little dating tip we're
going to interject your ever four things
I want to cover here one of these guys
still uses a notebook so a little dating
tip if you go on a first date and the
person you're on the date with mentions
their ex their recent ex you have a 70%
chance that it's not going to go
anywhere so don't take it too seriously
just I'm just saying just a little
warning I don't know if I mentioned this
in the previous vlog I forget but I
mention these things just slipping that
in just slipping that in if for those of
you who may be going on dates just keep
that in mind yes once again the
importance of the foundation that's why
my new cords are all foundation courses
because you have that the rest comes
easy and I'll leave you with this since
this is really a development channel in
a business channel but let's talk about
long-term which what will make your app
work long term and that's simplification
a simplification of the code base that
simplification of
the devops of simplification of u u X
simplification of UI that's the key the
difference between the true masters and
the not so not so masterful people is
that the Masters can simplify to such an
extreme to such an extent that it just
flows sex a grand member heard a long
time ago I was watching Olympics and the
commentators saying these people are so
good at what they do they make it look
simple though they actually execute as
they do at that level of that level of
extreme simplicity is extremely
difficult
same thing with app development and code
always look to simplify your code master
simplicity and you'll master everything
alright that's it I am going to be
celebrating now that that the worst part
of creating of course that's right all
the quiz questions in the interactivity
that's done over it's over it's ready to
go out and it's vetted as well tested
and so this time around went pretty good
writing quiz questions any teacher will
tell you by the way is the hardest part
about creating a course really it's it's
it's hard in the sense that it's like
pulling teeth it's really it's very
mentally draining quiz questions have to
be well structured and but they're so
important to the learning process so
important to learning process if and
when you do any of my studio web courses
with the interactive quizzing it's just
like I don't know what that how much
better it is versus just videos but it's
significant it's significant anybody
who's done the quizzing component who's
done a quizzing course one of my
suitable courses what all the quizzing
and so on they will tell you without a
doubt it improved the quality of the
course immeasurably it's just really
really important part about it and I
wish it wasn't because I really don't
like creating quiz questions it's a lot
of work but anyway to celebrate I think
I'm gonna head
town get myself some chicken and a
little bit of exercise at the same time
have a great weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
