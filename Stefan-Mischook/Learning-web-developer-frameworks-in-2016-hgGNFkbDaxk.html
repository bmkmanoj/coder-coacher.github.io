hitting this this topic from different
angles and that's learning frameworks
learning technology frameworks whether
it be a CSS framework and JavaScript
framework a PHP framework which you'll
see out there as a developer as a
budding developer and even as an
experienced developer but you're going
to see new frameworks that are coming
out all the time and the temptation and
worry at least it was for me back in the
90s when I was first experiences when I
was first experiencing this myself back
in the 90s V frameworks came out so fast
there's almost impossible what's not
almost it's totally impossible to be
able to keep up and learn obviously
different frameworks and in fact you
shouldn't for the most part most of
these frameworks will just fade away and
the reason they're going to fade away is
because most of the time these
frameworks do not offer any significant
advantage over what is out there already
most of the time once in a while you
have a game change of it comes out a
game changer framework so for instance
with JavaScript the game changing
framework but I can think of right away
is jQuery this is huge this is the
important one now there's several others
out thurs angular's react and resumption
sure as many more now I'm not sure how a
much of a long-term impact angular or
reacts will have they will have their
their little pockets of popularity I
can't say but right now angular at this
point I'm the 2 point 0 NE livers of the
three-point Oh apparently it's a totally
different branch so I'm not sure how
that works and I've heard from a lot of
developers out there who've used angular
and I have not I just looked at it they
found that its advantages where a
marginal what you find many times when
you go to a framework from framework a
to framework be you'll be work you know
working with this framework in a while
look at his new framework over here you
go over and you why I can do all this
cool stuff and then you realize this new
framework is missing things that the old
framework could do
so a lot of times you know you know
which framework you some have pros they
are pros and cons it's very rare with
you have something like a jQuery becomes
of it really changes the landscape of
things so my advice to you is really
learn your base language well learn
advanced coding techniques advanced
practices and so forth so if for
instance you're learning JavaScript
learn JavaScript well understand
object-oriented JavaScript was actually
a prototype types of language but it's
kind of object-oriented understand how
to write advanced JavaScript in
anonymous enter functions recursion that
kind of stuff then you can start poking
around a particular frameworks now today
in 2016 I would be looking at jQuery for
sure you'll have to learn all jQuery
just learn the basics of it and
understand what jQuery brings to the
table so that when you come to a project
you'll know well jQuery help here now
I'm not saying you should use jQuery in
every project but you but you go with
actually you shouldn't you should only
use a framework you should only use a
technology when it makes sense to use it
don't look for places to use a
particular technology this is again a
habit and urgent nerds I got I want to
use jQuery I got to use jQuery I gotta
use angular I got to you Zach no no no
no no no you use these tools because
that's all these are that's all these
frameworks are but just tools you use
them when they make sense when it's
makes sense to use them so there you go
there's so many frameworks you can't
learn them all you know pick the
dominant one or two maybe in your chosen
slice of technology so here in
javascript i would definitely learn
jquery if you're in PHP today i would
learn laravel and so on so forth you
know learn that one or two the one or
two popular dominant frameworks and keep
your eye on what's coming up but don't
jump into them like crazy because you're
going to find yourself wasting a lot of
time as I did they will fall away all
right that's pretty much it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
