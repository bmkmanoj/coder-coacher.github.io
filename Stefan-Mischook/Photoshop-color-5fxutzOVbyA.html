about how to work with some colors
inside a Photoshop first and foremost as
we see here we've got our toolbar which
we've been introduced to before and in
the toolbar you'll notice that there are
a number of different objects available
to us and in particular the ones that I
will be looking at for the moment are
these two which indicate the foreground
color and the background color so as
you'll notice when I mouse over these it
says set the foreground color set the
background color you'll notice that
you'll be able to switch between the
foreground and background colour just by
hitting this little button right here
and you'll also notice when I mouse over
that and just hold it there for a second
you'll see to switch between those 2 X
is the shortcut that'll come in handy a
little bit later if ever we change these
colors we can always set them back to
the default which are black and white
well the foreground color in the
background color indicate number one
whatever's in the foreground is the
color that you are going to be painting
with or doing a number of different
things with the background color that
generally denotes the color of
background that you're going to be
working with as well you'll be able to
switch between these foreground and
background what if we wanted to change
what the either foreground or background
color is there's a couple of ways to do
that simply single clicking on this
button box allows us to open up the
color picker and as you can see here the
color picker will enable you to choose
between any number of different colors
as you can see for the vast majority of
time we're going to be working with RGB
values and you'll see here that here you
can enter in RGB values yourself and
when you do enter in those RGB values
they will change the colors that you're
going to be working with as well you'll
notice that you can access a hexadecimal
number this is exceptionally important
for any would-be web designers because
that you will need to know exactly what
the color representation is in a
hexadecimal value and you'll be able to
copy paste this and bring it into
notepad or wherever you're doing an HTML
dreamweaver or any other application and
if you choose ok you'll notice now that
we have a different color or use so if I
was to use my brushes or paint buckets I
could do just that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
