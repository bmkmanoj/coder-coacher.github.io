be starting by looking at some basic
drawing tools inside flash and seeing
how they can work for you and as you can
see I've got here highlighted the
rectangle tool in order to understand
that a little bit better what we're
going to be doing is making a few
drawings first and foremost what I can
show you here is that down at the bottom
there is a icon for fill color and an
icon for stroke color as you can see
here currently there is no stroke color
so let's put one in just by pressing
down on this file what you'll see is
that you have a a bunch of grids of
different colors that you can choose
from i'll keep this black and i'll press
on this one and choose something like
red so you can see it so I've changed
the fill in the stroke color before I've
actually done any drawing and at this
point what we're going to do is to use
the rectangle tool to make rectangle so
as you can see I can click and drag and
it makes a rectangle if you want to make
it a square just hold shift and it will
constrain the proportions of this object
so you always get a perfect square as
you can see these objects are drawn with
the defaulted one pixel stroke which is
black in this case which I chose and the
fill color is the inside color so in
other words we have a red fill black
stroke so that is a little bit about the
basics of drawing in this fashion if you
hold down on this drawing tool you can
also choose from there the oval shape
tool and as you can see I can draw an
oval or if I hold shift I can make a
perfect circle as well some other things
that you should be aware of is that down
here there is a another icon called an
object drawing icon and if we were to
click on this you would notice that when
you draw your icons they ex or excuse me
when you draw your shapes they actually
have a blue bound
a box around them well that's just
telling you that this particular shape
that I've drawn as an object drawing is
now grouped element and as you'll see
when we talk about the selection tool in
just a second you'll notice that when
you have an object drawing group drawing
they will react in a different fashion
than some of the other types of drawings
that we will create the ones that are
not object drawings so let's continue
with that in our next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
