killer sites and other sites so in this
vball I'm actually going to initiate a
new style of find grained V blogs why
because I'm getting a lot of questions
but I've answered in longer blogs while
longer vlog excuse me and you know
sometimes my vlogs are eight minutes ten
minutes and I think that's a little too
long for most people so I'm going to try
to cut them down too much more
fine-grained detail so anyway here we go
the first one careers and code so
careers in cold essentially when you are
choosing the programming language
whether it be PHP Swift Java C sharp
Python etc etc etc you have to consider
a few things you have to consider the
type of work that you want to do and be
have to consider your level of education
so first of all if you want to get into
java coding or C sharp coding typically
that means Enterprise calling me that
means going to work for very large
companies so what does that mean that
means you need a degree that means you
need probably a higher degree doesn't
have to be calm side but it could be
biology could be legal whatever but
typically when you get into Java work
with Android development as the
exception you are going to be working
for a larger organization Archer
organizations have aged our departments
and because they have HR departments
that going to want you to have some sort
of higher education let's flip that if
you want to get into freelance
development freelance you don't need any
degrees you don't need any high school
you don't even need high school really
they don't care when you're working in
the freelance world people don't care
about your degrees all they care about
is your experience and your experience
can be demonstrated by the projects you
have built so at first you build your
own projects and you move on from there
so if you want to go to freelance route
I advise PHP server side coding there's
another type of PHP by the way and maybe
combine that with a little bit of
WordPress development as well I know
some people hate WordPress they think it
stinks but there's a lot of
look in that so that's something to
consider for freelance you don't need
any degrees you don't need you just need
to have a track record which you can
I've talked about how to do that in
other videos if you want to go work for
startups and maybe you're looking at
python python django maybe you're
looking at ruby although i wouldn't
learn ruby i would maybe go more towards
javascript instead although in the
enterprise there are opportunities for
mobile development using java using
Swift or maybe even the html5 and
cordova which is the html5 css3
javascript working together with a
Cordova or some other framework used to
build apps for Android and iOS again so
there you go so you have to always
consider the type of work you what to do
enterprise C sharp C sharp Java
freelance PHP then of course html5 css3
javascript if you're doing PHP you gotta
learn html5 css3 and JavaScript a little
bit javascript not too much or you can
do a server-side JavaScript where you're
going to get into more maybe startup
culture or it'll care less about degrees
but it's not as free as free last
because we're freelancing by the way I
mean I did freelancing for several years
and when you're freelance our last thing
and anybody will ever ask is what
degrees you have actually they never ask
it it's always about performance which
is kind of cool so there you go short
video fine grade subjects made easy for
you to find these videos on my channel
