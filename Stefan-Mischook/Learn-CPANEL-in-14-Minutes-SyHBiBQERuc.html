with killer science and study web in
this V blog I'm going to do a quick run
through cPanel which is a very popular
control panel used in a lot of web
hosting situations so you register
domain name you setup your site you buy
some hosting and your hosting company is
going to send you access to cPanel if
they use it and you see when you buy
hosting they'll say cPanel included or
not there's other control panels out
there too - but I'm aware of a cPanel
plus caner others some are more complex
some are simpler cPanel is very standard
a lot of people use it so I'm just going
to run through a bunch of basic
functionalities just so you have a feel
in terms of what cPanel is all about
this is not an exhaustive cPanel
tutorial it's just here to give you an
overview because somebody asked me to do
one so enjoy all right so I've popped
open C panel here and here it is from
top to bottom now your version of cPanel
may look a little bit different in terms
of the graphics but the functionality is
going to be exactly the same so let's
just start off at the top so you see the
Files section here it says right here
files so there's all kinds of
capabilities here the thing that you're
going to be using the most is something
called the file manager so let me click
on that and what does the file manager
do this is the file manager what it does
essentially is it gives you a view of
the directory that the web hosting
company has given you so this is the
root of it right here the root being the
base of it and where you would put your
HTML document all your website files
whether it be HTML pages CSS pages
JavaScript images videos whatnot they
would be all in public HTML public HTML
so I click on that and it shows you the
few files that are in this particular
public HTML directory
now what's CAG what's CGI bin that is
where we used to put our old
scripts scripts that you could do things
like the process pages and forms and so
on back in the old CGI days I'm not sure
why they still keep this here I guess
where people are still running Perl now
Perl is one of the first languages used
to create dynamic websites to create web
apps it's a this is a throwback to the
1990s most people I don't believe you CJ
cgi-bin too much these days so in this
particular public HTML directory I have
an index page and an image called pet
shark now this is the file manager the
file manager allows you to do all kinds
of different things you can see upload
new files you can download files you can
delete copy create new folder so let me
just create a new folder right here
great new folder I'm going to call it
images assuming I would keep an images
folder like you will with most new
websites now this is not a beginners web
designed tutorial you can check those
out I have plenty of those so I just
created a folder in there you can also
create all kinds of things great files
click file create new file so I'm going
to create a new file when I call it a
contact dot HTML so I create new file
and here it oh here it is contact on
HTML now if you right-click on that file
you can download it you can view it you
can edit it you can code edit it you
could HTML edit it you can do all kinds
of stuff what's changing permissions
changing permissions is something you
would do when for instance if you were
uploading a wordpress blog and sometimes
you have to change permissions of
certain files to enable the blog to
function correctly I won't get into this
now this is just an overview video but
if I clicked on HTML edit it would ask
me ok do you want at this I go OK
what external assets may fail to load in
browsers but blocked makes HTTP and
HTTPS contella okay whatever don't don't
worry about this is getting more
advanced into advanced web size you
click Edit and look at this cPanel gives
you a full HTML editor so you can write
in all kinds of text I can make it
better make it bold underline it's kind
of like you know anyway you might use
this you might not
I'm just I'll save that here that's it
see file save down here and I close that
and here is the the file gain con tablet
chemical view so we beautiful and there
you go here's a view of it
as in terms of code now if you want to
see this actual file live you would
navigate to your website and you would
do that but that again is about a web
design tutorial so I'm not going to get
into that so I'm just going to close the
file manager here that's one thing you
can do we have other things like you can
set up FTP accounts now what is an FTP
I'll just let me click on that FTP is
one of the ways in which you can move
files from your computer to the server
through something called fdp fdp is
called the File Transfer Protocol this
is kind of an old-school way and you
have to have an FTP program on your own
website to be able to do this it's not
on your own website on your own computer
most computers have a Mac Windows and
I'm not going to get into teaching you
FTP but you would set it up you would
have to set up the long a day and
password and so on where the files would
be deposited right here directory right
so it's I'll leave that to you to sort
of look over if you wanted to now if you
want to really upload files I would just
go back to file manager and I'll just
click the up I would click where I want
to go okay I'm gonna go over here I go
upload right and I get to drag and drop
my files and it tells me select a file
to upload it to public HTML member
public HTML is where you put all your
website files so I want if I want to
drag images video or whatnot I could
just do that just like you know clicking
on an image and the second you know Jake
a dragon file right in here if I wanted
to but I'm not going to so that's how I
would upload my files now if I was
putting up so simple websites I wouldn't
bother with FTP anymore you'll need to
this is kind of powerful so let me
scroll down databases what's this these
are all the controls that you can set up
a MySQL database on your server most
hosting accounts these days just about
all of them they're going to allow you
to set up a database so how do you do
that well you would go to my databases
MySQL MySQL database and this loves and
then create a new base database so you
can create a data
so I'm going to call it my database I
want to have a database on fish I go
fish there we go add a database HTML
never finish go back so why if you
scroll down here here it is HTML nerve
fish why HTML nerve because that is the
name of the cPanel account that was
given to me you don't have much of a
choice there so then it just add fish to
it I just said fish so you've created
your database that's pretty cool so now
you got to add a user to the database
how does that work so you got to create
a new user you got to give it a password
and then eventually you bind it to
database so I'll just do that real quick
so I'm going to say username I'm going
to go HTML nurse staff I'm saying my
password is web blah blah blah it's
going to be a very weak password because
I'm just doing demos I'm just going to
create the user now you could generate a
password here which would be much
stronger but for the sake of this demo
I'll get us to create a new user actus
so you have successfully created the
MySQL username HTML nerve I'm score
staff write HTML nerve underscore stat
so I go back kind of clunky and then
down here finally you have to add your
user to the database you've got database
ah here's the database where we have one
user h2 under staff we can create
multiple users by the way you can go
back create another user I won't do that
then you guys select your database now
we have two database tests and fish so
I'm going to go fish I'm going to say
add HTML nerves underscore step two fish
I go add so then it's going to ask me
what kind of privileges what is this all
about privileges well when you're
creating a user you have to say this
user can do visited database so I'm just
going to say you can do everything and
then I'm gonna hit make changes and
there you have given the requested
privileges to the database HTML nerve to
the user blah blah so this guy is now
bound to this see the HTML nerve dude
HTML our staff can now login to HTML
fish and why do you did why did I do
office because if you're creating like a
WordPress app or a you're installing
WordPress or installing joomla drupal or
many other apps you're going to need to
do this you need to create a database
and you're going to need to bind that
database to a user and we just
we just solved it with cpannel so I may
go back home so as much more you can do
you can actually navigate your database
with PHP myadmin go right in here
boom PHP my admin which PHP my admin
well it's made with PHP it's an app
built with PHP that allows you to
administrate MySQL databases so here's
look at here's that database HTML nerve
right here it is that's the user HTML
nerve brother and here's the first
database to fish and the test and then
in here you can create HTML tables and
all kinds of stuff again this is beyond
the scope of this particular video
because this is a video on cpanel so i'm
just going to close that but now you
know just within cpanel in the databases
section you can create new databases new
users and do all kinds of stuff what are
the domain stuff I never use this so you
don't really need to use this most of
the time this has to do with configuring
your domain name for your site but again
this is something I rarely ever use so
I'm not going to get into it email while
you might set up email accounts write
all kinds of things you can do right you
can set up how your server handles spam
you can set up for der so let's say you
have three email addresses but you want
to route them all to one so let's say
you have a shopping store shopping carts
site you have store you're selling
you're bananas and you're fish and you
want to have all your emails to go to
your private email account so let's say
your name of staff and your site with
Steph goes bananas comm so you go step
at bananas like columnist email just how
do you do that you go even email counts
and you create an email account whatever
you want now this is the HTML Nirvana
site so I could go Estefan at HTML
Nevada I put in a stupid password boom
boom boom I create the account and it
would appear right now I'm not going to
do it cuz you know pretty obvious now
you can setup a four door so you can say
you can forward all emails to let's say
at an info at HTML at Nirvana comm you
could forward them all to stab Stephane
sometimes you want to do forwarding it's
just there and there's all kinds of
other stuff you can do as well but we'll
skip that so what our matrix metrics are
basically your web stats you're tracking
how many people are visiting your site
now you got all these different things
you can look at
got errors of being generated just in
case people you know are looking for
pages that are not there images so it's
a good way to keep your website up to
date I don't know I don't know if I'm
speaking too quickly but I'm just trying
to get through things because I got a
souvlaki pita on the way so now aw
staffs aw stats is what I use this is a
very common stats program that tracks
all your traffic on the site now this I
don't use it all so it's going to be any
stat so we're just going to click on
here so that I choose for HTML under
Viacom and view stats and there you go
that's actually some traffic I'm
surprised because I hardly this is not
there's nothing on the site except a
picture of a shark so it's kind of weird
I'm actually getting some stats but you
know you get unique visitors number of
visits number of pageviews I'm not going
to explain all this the most important
thing with people look at when they're
looking at sites is page views pages how
many pages of the scene in a particular
map so you see in January 59 pages from
the site has been seen which is amazing
to me considering if I look at the site
HTML nirvana calm and I see this is the
site I put this up as a demo that's it
that's the whole site so it's kind of
weird but people are actually visiting
it but let's see what's go down get all
kinds of information like from what
country people are visiting the site as
people coming from United States mostly
IP addresses from what ip's right if we
scroll down more you can even see the
type of computers that are visiting your
site mostly Windows Linux well more
linux people than macintosh that's
interesting web browsers chrome firefox
blackberry wow who uses a blackbird look
at even google right here links from
internet strange aging unbelievable
google actually sent somebody to the
site and for some reason burglar and
Perea sent it i don't that is probably a
spammer you get sometimes these weird
reverse spammers coming in here and you
had to know for aw stats so you got you
have full stats in your cPanel which
kind of cool let's cool down now you got
security now which is what's ssh this is
a way of logging in through a text
a text window and it's beyond the scope
of this particular video but the
advanced coders will actually do a lot
of SSH to send up files from their home
computers to a server it's safer and
once you understand which you know how
to use SSH it's actually quite fast let
me scroll down software so now you see
that you got all these different things
installed into this server PHP the PHP
pair packages which nobody uses any day
these days so forget about this this is
kind of like PHP instant PHP scripts
which you could use Perl there we go
here is programmer I mentioned Perl and
the CGI bin the CGI directory that's
what this is all about a ruby for people
want to use ruby you can install ruby
you got to know about your stuff you got
to know about ruby and so on so let me
just jump into PHP because a lot of
people be using PHP because they're
going to be doing WordPress I click and
here it gives you a bunch of information
about your PHP configuration which is
kind of cool again I'm not going to get
into this because youyou have to be
somebody's doing PHP you care about this
but that information is there for you
it's kind of basic but nonetheless ok
what's advanced stuff ok the only thing
I'm going to talk about here is cron
jobs you can set up your server to run a
particular script to run a particular
PHP page for example on an interval so
you can say every day at 2 o'clock in
the afternoon you have this PHP script
do this or that or the other thing like
send an email or something so that gives
you that possibility there as well
preferences now you can do all kinds
password security contact information
user manager this is stuff I never use
anyway but that's it that's pretty much
an overview of a cPanel from the users
point of view sees how much disk space
you use monthly bandwidth how much
bandwidth you transferred in a month see
right now it's only transferred 1.1 8
megabytes not much where I logged into
from what IP this could be for good for
security because if you log in and you
see an IP which you don't recognize me
who's logging in to my site here so
that's it that's pretty much an overview
of cPanel hope you found this useful and
talk to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
