video I'm going to talk about business
negotiating tactics and this is
something that can be used whether you
are a freelancer developer or maybe
you're working for somebody and you want
to know the goshi eight positions ago
she ate your salary and so on so I've
been a coder since the early 90s but in
fact I've been a business owner for
longer I started my first business when
I was 18 years old it was an
import-export business so it wasn't
related to technology at all in fact but
my business led me to technology because
in 1994 I built my very first web site
to basically promote my business and to
get contracts overseas now today that's
no big deal but back in the 94 95 this
is brand new I had one RV first websites
in the world that actually had images
most websites were just academic sites
from universities they were just great
backgrounds with purple text and blue
text believe it or not so yeah so anyway
business negotiating tactics and so
here's the very first one I'm going to
talk about it's very common actually and
what it is basically is you're going to
push really hard when you open your
negotiation so let's say you're bidding
on a contract and you want 5,000 for it
you figure it's going to it's going to
be worth 5,000 so you might go in there
to pay and say you know what I think
it's going to be about 10,000
easily 10,000 now let me just say I'm
giving you a basic argument here a basic
example rather and there's all kinds of
things you got to consider how big the
contract is how much leverage you have
lab lab lab lab can go on for a long
time but anyway I just want you to
understand I just want you to understand
the basic principle of this tactic so
you go in there and you push really hard
with a heavy demand and then in the
negotiation you're going to come back
and there's an expectation of that so if
you are ever approached by somebody who
wants to buy something from you whether
you're selling your services or you're
selling your car if you're dealing with
people who are experienced negotiators
at all experienced business you have to
assume that they're going to hit you
with a heavy-duty offer write something
that's extreme because they're going to
expect that you're going to try to walk
them back so they're always it's it's a
game that people play and it's a
psychological game more than anything
else and people do it all the time right
they do business approach business
negotiations is really a big game of
psychology and persuasion it's a big
part of it and in something you got to
learn if you're going to be a freelancer
because for you to secure your freelance
jobs you have to start understanding how
people work in terms of negotiating
positions and so forth so let me give
you another tip I was only going to do
one tip but it did the first ago shading
tips so easily so quickly I decide I'm
going to give you a tip number two now
this is tip this tip I'm gonna call 50
million chickens it's the 50 million
chicken tip and why do I call it 50
million chickens because this is a
tactic business negotiating tactic if I
learned from a guy who was at the time
much older than me who ran a
fifty-million-dollar business and he
sold chicken products
so it all kinds of different types of
chickens in fact you go to his office
you'd have always stuffed chickens all
around his office I didn't know there's
always varieties variety of chickens out
there's you know it was new to me at the
time so it was kind of a strange surreal
experience you walk into this big guys
office and he's got all these stuffed
chickens everywhere and his business did
at the time did about 50 million dollars
a year in sales or decent sized business
so i used to call 50 million chickens
and so 50 million chickens did some
business with me and one day when I was
sitting in on a couple meetings with him
we had one of his suppliers i believe it
was come in to a meeting no wasn't a
supplier in fact it was somebody was
trying to set up a deal with and he
freaked me out with wood with his tactic
now what he did was this the guy comes
and he sits down and they started
talking 50 million chickens start
talking to this guy about some details
about the deal so then out of the blue
50 million 50 million chickens he goes
to the guy hey so uh how's your wife is
she hot you know do you know do you know
do this and he starts getting into some
pretty salacious we'll just say details
right there in the in the office in the
boardroom sitting at the table or vp
singh at table diving and he starts
asking these lewd questions and you can
see but the guy in front of 50 million
chickens is getting a little over no
he's easily sleep with what's why is
this guy asked these questions and he's
getting a little bit flustered right hey
what just went on for about a minute or
so and then they just continue with
their negotiations in Seoul floor so
when the guy left 50 million 50 mm
Jacobs told me said you know what yeah
he started chuckling you know he said
dad he just did it in you know i'll give
you the Reader's Digest version the
short version it was a tactic he wanted
to throw the guy off his game he wanted
to get him emotional because he knows
any boxer will tell you this i learned
this in boxing as well and in martial
arts if you are emotional your ability
to think clearly and to act clearly will
be hindered so what 50 moon chickens
would do is he would go in there and you
know you got to be you got to know when
you can do it when you can't do it he
would go in there and save things and do
things to throw people to get them
emotional to get them off their game and
you see that with fighters crimson so
before a fight sometimes sometimes it
show the drive up sales but sometimes
they literally are trying to get their
opponent angry at them or scared of him
and so that really redo makes them much
more vulnerable when you get him in the
ring in fact because their minds are
clouded Mike Tyson was famous in that
regard he would just scared the crap out
of people so then they would get in
there they would be like her and he was
a bit of a woman you know that was it so
fear is a great great tool that smart
business people will use and not
necessarily very moral necessarily but
I'm just telling you they use it all the
time if they use fear to drive people
they use anxiety to drive people or they
use greed fear and greed to use greasy
you got to take this deal now this is
amazing deal you're not going to get a
deal like this that kind of stuff so
keep that in mind when you're
freelancing how you shouldn't be we
should try not to as much as possible to
be emotional about a position you
shouldn't be because you're just going
to put yourself in a disadvantage right
you're going to put yourself in
disadvantaged one-trick what I do is if
I'm a little angry about something or
frustrated about something I don't send
that email then I'll write it and I
won't send it and be sure don't put the
guys address in the ears here to box
just write the email then put it in the
in the drafts folder and wait until
you're no longer emotional whether it be
scared will be angry whether it be
frustrated and I guarantee nine times
out of ten when you do that you're going
to look
that email that you wrote when you're in
that emotional state you get a roof I've
better changed this line but I change
that law I better change this line right
because remember when you're an
emotional state it clouds your cognitive
mind makes it very difficult for you
difficult for you to really see what the
hell is going on excuse that language so
yeah try to stay calm and remember that
when you're emotional your intellectual
judgment is severely impaired almost
like being drunk and can be worse than
being drugged and just so you know I
studied psychology in University it was
my major it wasn't it wasn't was my
major and I did for two years I dropped
out because my business start moving to
put anyway so that's another story today
oh there are my negotiating tips and
some business survival tips don't let
the emotions carry you away bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
