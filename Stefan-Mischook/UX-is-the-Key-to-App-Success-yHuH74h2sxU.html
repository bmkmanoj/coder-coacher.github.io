we're going to talk about the most
important thing in any app in any app
whether it be a web app whether it be
iOS app whether it be Android app
whether it be Windows 10 you get the
idea so what is the most important thing
in an appt today number one it is the
user experience number two it is the
user experience number three it is a
user experience yes user experience ux
is super important it's more employment
anything else now it's even more
important than the UI UI considered user
interface I consider that the aesthetics
to look yes but it is important it has
to look pretty good but then again
craigslist and reddit show and google
shows you that it doesn't have to look
very good at all if it's very usable and
very functional so usability is the key
differentiator between successful apps
and unsuccessful apps so if you're
working on apps now whether it be your
own apps or apps for clients you should
be spending a heck of a lot of your time
on the UX on the usability user
experience this is key to modern day
software I was speaking to somebody who
I knows a founder of a funded company
they got pretty good funding 1.6 million
or something and he was one of my
mentees I took me out of school and I
trained him up and he's very good very
very proficient software developer and
it's a CTO of course co-founder and he
and I were talking about this today and
he sees that too as well he sees that
the technical problems but you know
while he wasn't around a time but I was
talking to old time coders the technical
problem but we used to be faced with in
the 90s and the early 2000s with regards
to app development are pretty much all
gone you see in the old days we have to
try to figure out how do you build this
how can we do this it can we build a
graph how do we
the graphing to work off we gotta build
a date picker it's gonna take two weeks
to build a date picker blah blah blah
blah blah how can we scale this is it's
going to be doable and okay you know
there's a lot of technical hurdles in
the old days and a lot of programmers
today a lot of developers today still
kind of think in terms of mmm how can we
write this code so we can solve these
technical hurdles don't get me wrong
writing good clean code that's
maintainable and can be scaled and stuff
it still has to be done but it's so much
easier today it's actually quite easy
today if you watch my video on
modern-day cloud hosting you see how
that has a huge impact in terms of
simplifying app development no no the
complexity now the key now took
successful apps is UX user experience
and also the content and the service of
raw service at the app provides again my
proof to that is like reddit reddit is
you know visually speaking it isn't
exactly the most compelling but it's so
usable that it's what our most popular
sites in the world craigslist another
one it you know it's a text site but
it's so usable it presents the
information such an easy to find and
logical way that is such a successful
app so when you're considering again to
wrap it up when you're considering
building your apps consider ux number
one ux number two ux number three in
terms of order of importance i hope you
find this useful we'll talk soon ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
