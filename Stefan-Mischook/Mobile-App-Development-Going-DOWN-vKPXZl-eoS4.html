development according to Gartner which
is one of these big organizations that
tracks all these things apparently
something like 20% of companies are
gonna be they're gonna stop having
dedicated mobile apps so no more
dedicated iOS apps no more dedicated
Android apps they're probably seeing
that it's not worth it as I said in
previous vlogs these days smartphones
are so powerful and their browsers are
so powerful that for most apps with the
exception of maybe gaming and so forth
with most apps you can build web-based
interfaces and they're more than more
than powerful enough and fast enough for
most companies uses that's why when it
comes to mobile app development the
first thing I say is just to do it via
responsive design for instance the new
form software that I just installed on
cue sites it they used to have a
separate mobile version of the app not a
mobile dedicated app not a native app
but they had a mobile version now with
responsive based design techniques which
makes it so easy with Twitter bootstrap
and other types of UI frameworks for the
web stack it becomes super easy and it's
super usable it's like you know if I was
looking at that form in terms of whether
or not I would want a dedicated iOS app
native or dedicated Android app native
or form it would be there's literally no
point to it because the web UI is super
fast and super capable so yeah that's
pretty much it
yeah the regards to mobile development
again if you're into the software
development game you're looking for
opportunities still to this day special'
freelancer the web stack I think is the
place to go and of course true
freelancing I'm a big advocate of PHP
PHP laravel or maybe PHP and
WordPress development PHP Drupal some
wonder it was big to big CMS's again I'm
not dissing on the other languages
whether it be Ruby or whether it be Java
Ruby Python they're all great they'll
help their purposes but for free lines I
think you're gonna see and you have to
check in your local area of course
you're gonna see there's a lot of work
for PHP developers that said whether you
learn PHP or Python or JavaScript furs
or Java or C sharp or you know all these
languages of Swift whatever whatever
language you learn they're so similar
that to learn the next language will
become so much easier so it's really not
like a dead-end path it's not like
you're you would be investing in a bad
language that doesn't exist these days
it's not possible so what do I mean by
that
so let's say you decide you want to
learn JavaScript and you find out that
all to the man in your area is PHP it's
not like oh no I waste my time with
JavaScript you're not because a
JavaScript and PHP share like you know
80 that 90% of the same principles the
code looks different but it's pretty
much the same the hard part about
learning how to program is not in
understanding what not not ready to code
the hard part is actually understand the
concepts behind the code things like
object-oriented programming like
functions and arrays and function
arguments and and accelerator observe
that kind of thing so you're never
wasting your time regardless of a
language that you're learning because
anything you learn in one language is
almost 100 Center 100% of is applicable
to another language so don't worry about
that now it brings me back to my larger
message I talk about all the time it's
the core it's the core of the
programming language that matters the
core concepts the core techniques the
core capabilities of a language that
matters because this is these are
principles these are ideas this is the
learning if you will that's Universal
applies to all languages that's why I
emphasize learning your core languages
first learn the basic techniques really
understand those and then you can jump
into any specific library or framework
after
on a need-to-know basis needs a nerd
basis because when you get out there in
the real world as a developer what you
have to do is you sit down you look at
the project and with a basic awareness
of the frameworks that are out there
like jQuery like bootstrap like laravel
or if you're in a PHP world or Django
here in a PHP world in the Python world
except you have your core then you have
basic knowledge of all these little
frameworks that are out there some are
little some are big and then when you
look at the project you'd be able to sit
down say okay I'm gonna use this amused
PHP laravel makes sense here and I'm
gonna use we're gonna use jQuery here or
we're gonna use bootstrap of course or
we might use react or you know et cetera
eccentrics the same thing you know Ruby
same thing with Python etc yep
it's always about the core is always
about the core all right that's it for
now Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
