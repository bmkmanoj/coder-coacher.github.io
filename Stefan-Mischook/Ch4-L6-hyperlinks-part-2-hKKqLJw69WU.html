HTML links again so here we are within
well let me just back out again my
websites this is the folder where we
have all our website files so what I can
do is I can select them right click you
see how multiple options here to open or
do something to the files I have open
with sublime text to which is the text
editor but I've been using throughout
this series I also have another text
editor here notepad plus plus let's take
a look at notepad plus plus I'm gonna do
if one file so you see it's it's quite
different looking and it has the same
basic behavior though where it will
color your code so you can differentiate
between the HTML which is in blue here
and the text and the Col completion a
whole bunch of other capabilities as
well the only reason I mentioned is I
just want you to see that there's many
code editors out there another thing you
can do is you can select all your files
you need to edit and just hit open with
whatever app you want to open them with
I'm gonna use sublime text to and you
see here they are each one of the files
has its own tab so it makes it kind of
easy to work with so what we're gonna do
first is look at a new attribute in our
page so I've done it here actually I've
done two things at the same time first
of all let's look at this line here so
specifically if you look at the H ref
the hypertext reference and you'll
notice that it says male 2 and then I
have an email address you see what's
built into the web browser is the
ability to use male 2 and the web
browser will then launch your default
web app so that you can send an email so
let me show you what that looks like in
the browser and here it is so if you
click on this you'll see the email app
launch ok now that we've got that done
let's look at something else so if you
scroll down a little bit you notice I
have a new
attribute inside of our a tag which is
our hyperlink tag and the attribute is
target now what target allows you to do
it allows you to control where the web
browser loads the page that you're
referencing in your href tag so for
instance in this situation here I am
loading up my - friends dot HTML which
is one of our pages right here
so when you say blank like this
underscore blank this is one option this
is the attribute and this is the value
right and yeah that's how it always
works attribute value attribute value so
what we're telling here we're telling
the browser to load up a new blank
window or a new blank tab to load up
this page here so let's take a look at
that so check out our list of friends
watch how the tab will spawn up here
there we go now if we load up or close
that if we load up plans now if you look
at the plans code check out our list of
my plans you notice that the there's no
target it's just a simple hyperlink tag
but we we know about now so let's try
that help my plans
see my plans just loads right into the
same page so we go back home click on my
friend's it loads a new tab so that's we
go back again loads another new tab so
you see that is what the target
attribute does now you have other
options you have other options I would
take off the caps caps is okay but I
just preferred lowercase save that so
let's reload our our homepage again now
look at the source code you see target
equals self and all that means is that
when you load this link just load it in
the same tab and there it goes right
that's just the way it normally works
let's see that's what you call the
default behavior</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
