now this is something that you may or
may not have to do and it depends
entirely on your shopping cart and what
you're selling you know you but paypal
does support shipping so i want to show
you how you can do that here so here I'm
going to say shipping amount and i'm
going to say shopping cart get item
shipping costs and you can do the same
thing with tax as well you can apply tax
just like you apply shipping and you can
have you can have rules you can have
business rules associated with that as
well so for the shipping costs for me i
want to keep my shipping costs
relatively straightforward so in order
to do that I'm going to do I'm going to
create another public function so we've
got get item shipping costs this is
another thing that paypal likes to have
so that it can know how much the
shipping is for each item and so I'm
going to say public function get item
shipping cost pass in the product ID and
here i'm going to say return this items
and i'm going to have the product now we
need to multiply that by however time
many times we have the item so this is
where the original cost of the item if
let's say our shipping costs for tomato
soup is to box well we might want to say
that if you buy ten ten ten cans of
tomato soup or if you buy ten of any
item then you know the shipping cost is
this or the shipping cost as that you
could do it any which way you want
however I'm doing it just this very
simple way because it makes sense for
the tutorial but if you were writing
your own shopping cart this is probably
where you would deviate and set things
up however which way they made sense to
what you were selling but i'm going to
say i want to multiply the item quantity
so I'm going to say this get item
quantity of the product ID and i'm going
to multiply that by this now you're
going to notice I'm using a lowercase
get this time shipping costs for and i'm
going to say get item cost and then i'm
going to say product ID all right let's
explain this for a second we want to
take the item quantity for a particular
product ID and we want to multiply that
by the shipping cost now i'm not exactly
sure the way the way I'm doing this
right now is I'm basically saying okay
whatever the item is cost its cost is
I'm going to pass that into the shipping
cost so if something is 6 box then get
it shooting shipping costs for six bucks
is going to return a certain amount and
let's say actually let's just do this
I'm going to create a private function
and it's going to be get shipping costs
for and i'm going to say price now it's
important to bear in mind that all these
rules are being calculated on the unit
price of the item and then multiplied by
the quantity now we can create certain
business rules so if price is less than
10 for example let's say it's less than
10 bucks then your shipping is going to
be a dollar ninety-nine else if you're
let's say your price is over 50 bucks or
sorry is less than 50 bucks and your
shipping cost is going to be 1099 and
let's say for everything else if you've
got a really big order then your
shipping cost is going to be 34 99 I
don't know
so this could be very different
depending on how you want to do it you
could check based on the product ID and
based on certain products or you could
also have a for example in your catalog
over here you could also have wait and
then based on the weight of an object
that you're shipping you could pass that
into your shopping cart and your
shopping cart could figure out what the
shipping costs are for or another way of
doing this is to actually pass into the
shopping cart where you're from picking
the address and then you know if you're
doing something outside of north america
then you could also have rules for that
as well but this is the underlying
framework that we're going to be working
with so it's a very simple shipping
calculator but just to give you an idea
of where you would want to store the
logic for that now for now to keep
things a little simple hopefully I'm
just going to add a break tag here and
I'm going to say shipping amount is
shipping them out and just like we have
the amount here I'm also going to put in
a break tag and i'm going to say unit
cost is and then the unit cost and i'm
just going to refresh that so we can
tell that for 931 shipping amount is is
third ok for 48 of these guys my
shipping amount is going to be fifteen
dollars and my unit cost is a dollar 33
for each one of these cans of tomato
soup so what I've done let's just go
back to our calculator here is I've
basically taken the shipping costs for a
dollar 99 and i've multiplied it by the
item quantity so I've got eight items at
a dollar 99 and my shipping cost for
each item is a dollar 99 and I'm
multiplying at dollar ninety nine times
eight and that's how we're getting
fifteen dollars for a ten-dollar order
which may or may not make sense
depending on what you're selling anyways
so now that we have these very
variables in place we've pretty much
flushed out most of our of our shopping
card we can add to it we can clear it we
are now in a position let's just go back
view court view cart doesn't exist yet
so let's let's do that in a minute but
for now let's just add some more items
to our existing shopping cart so I'm
going to go back to view store i'm going
to add another thing of tomato soup i'm
going to add some linguine i'm going to
add some fresh cumin you can see that
our quantities are starting to come up
here and i'm just going to quickly go
back and i'm going to style this so
we're going to call this shopping cart
another neat little section and sa
shopping cart and the width of this
table is going to be 0 600 pixels border
is going to be 1 pixel solid light gray
border collapse set this to collapse
what this means is that we're not going
to get double border so it's going to
collapse them down if it notices that
the neighbor has a border I'm going to
set this to margin 0 auto which is going
to align its center shopping cart TR th
so we're going into the table row and
into the table head and in here I want
the background to be eaeaea which is
going to be a little lighter than cccc
or ccc which is the same thing as si si
si si si si this is the same but it's
just shorthand and i'm going to set
another border here to 1 pixel solid ccc
and we're going to add a little bit of
padding and refresh that so already this
is looking a little better
and the other thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to say shopping cart TR TD so
these are the actual cells and they're
also going to have a one pixel border
and a bit of padding all right Oh got a
dot here there we go well this is
starting to come together slowly but
surely let's go back to our add to cart
page now this function here render
shopping cart row we can probably just
move that into our templates file at
this point I'm just going to delete that
cut that out and then go to templates
file and drop it in here so this is
going to we're going to create a section
called shopping cart templates in the
next video we're going to be creating
new templates for calculating the
subtotal and the shipping row and
finalizing our shopping cart page before
going to paypal thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
