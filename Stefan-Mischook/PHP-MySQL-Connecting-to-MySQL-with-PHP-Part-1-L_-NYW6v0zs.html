this video tutorial I'm gonna show you
how to connect to a database and in this
case we're going to use MySQL since it's
the most popular database so it's used
with PHP anyhow we're going to learn how
to connect to a database using PHP
PHP provides several different ways that
you can use to connect to a database you
have the MySQL package sort of like a
group of functions wasn't it's actually
is a group of functions then you have
the MySQL I extension which is MySQL
improved and then you have PHP PDO and
PHP excuse me and pair DB PHP PDO and
pair DB are object-oriented ways of
connecting to MySQL whereas MySQL and
MySQL
I have procedural ways although MySQL I
which is the improved version of MySQL
does have an object-oriented package as
well or a set of functions as well in
this video tutorial
my goal is to get you up and running
with regards to connecting to MySQL with
PHP so I'm going to use the MySQL method
the first method and this is the first
set of functions that did come with PHP
in terms of being able to connect with
MySQL the reason I'm going to use this
package or these set of functions is
because well number one you're going to
be sure that with any host that you
happen to be hosting with will allow you
to use MySQL that will be enabled
whereas MySQL I and the other ones
you're never too sure so this is
guaranteed you're gonna have access to
this or just about and the second reason
I'm going to use this way is because
this is the oldest way and it's the
easiest way that I know of to connect to
MySQL when you start getting into PHP
programming and you start getting to
perhaps more serious projects you might
find yourself using MySQL I or PHP PDO
or something like that although I think
I think that it's going to be going
towards pH
P PDL for various reasons I'm not going
to get into now
before we crack open the PHP part of
things first thing we need to do is get
a couple pieces of information about the
database we want to connect to so here I
am in PHP my admin and what I want to do
is connect to the killer database so I
click on that we see at one table called
people we're going to keep that in mind
later and and we know we're inside a
killer database of course because the
breadcrumbs trail tells us so right here
so what we want to do is we want to go
into privileges we want to see what
users have access to this database as we
can see here we only have one user and
this user is called root and they have
access to the database we know that goes
under grant says yes we know it can do
everything because it says all
privileges let me back up and explain
one thing of privileges and users when
you set up a new database in MySQL so we
have killer over here now but you see as
you can see we have the others here I
set up WordPress and so on so when you
do set up a new database you can specify
you can create new users so I could
create a new user and I could tell I
could say ok this user has access to
this particular database here and this
user can do x y&amp;amp;z so I haven't gone into
this before because for purposes of our
testing I just used this default master
user called root so here's something new
about MySQL when you set up a new MySQL
system there's a super user called root
that can do just about anything actually
they can do anything
although when you're dealing with a
hosting company you will not have access
to the user called root they'll give you
a username and
that user will be able to do everything
you wanted to to any database which you
create yourself anyhow just understand
that to access a database through PHP
you need to know what user has access to
that particular database and you need to
get there so you need to get their
username and in this case we're gonna
use root and you get you get you need to
get their password we did not set up a
password for user root because this is
just a local system this is not a public
website if it was a public website that
would be just crazy and you would
actually need to set up a password again
your hosting company would probably set
that up for you anyhow so for our
purposes all we need to pick out is that
we want to use the user called root so
if you've that in mind and let's now
look at our PHP code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
