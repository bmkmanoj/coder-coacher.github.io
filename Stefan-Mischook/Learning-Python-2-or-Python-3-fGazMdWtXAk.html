answer a question was put to me recently
should you be learning Python 2 or
Python 3 just so you know there are two
versions of Python Python 2 Python 3
Python 2 at the time I'm recording this
video in November 2016 Python 2 is at
2.7 - I believe version 2.7 - and
basically the 2x branch meaning 2.7
branch of Python is essentially in
maintenance mode you will not see any
new developments there the action is
with Python 3 at this time of writing
it's at 3.2 I believe point 5 and if you
haven't purchased any books or purchase
any courses yet I would concentrate on
Python 3 because that's the future all
the new stuff is going to be coming out
in Python 3 and so why did they come up
with a Python 3 when it already had a
Python 2 well I guess the Python and
people who thought that there was some
core aspects to the language that had to
change so they decided it needed a whole
new version number when you look at apps
you look at programming languages when
you see a whole new version of receive
go when you see for example Python going
from 2 to version 3 as opposed to going
from 2 point 1 to point 2 to point 3
when you see those point point 1 point 2
point 3 incremental changes in an app
and in a programming language which
you're typically seeing there are some
small additions and bug fixes that kind
of thing but when you see it goes from a
whole new version from a 2 to a version
3 of Python that's a big change
something profound is going on there
like if you look at OS 9 in the Apple
world I'm going back several years OS 9
was radical a totally different code
base so when they went to oh s 10 it was
brand new so he said it wasn't 9.22
what I mean it was we got to go to 10
now it's totally different and that's
what you see with Python Python 3 is
very different from 2 in certain
respects on core aspects and Python 2
apps several of them will probably won't
run rather on Python 3 although there
are conversion scripts would allow you
to convert them but just so you aware
there are still lots of Python to stuff
out there apps libraries that won't run
in Python 3 so that's why I guess they
keep Python 2 around 4 of those older
apps and yeah so if you're starting new
you should definitely just jump into
Python 3 but if you're learning Python 2
don't worry
python 2 is not so different in terms of
the core language this is a few
differences here and there so if you
learn how to code in Python 2 when you
move to Python 3 you may have to you're
gonna have to change some some things in
the code here and there but it will take
you like a half an hour to learn the
difference in solo don't worry about if
you're learning Python - you're fine
you'll be fine getting it to Python 3
but you haven't started learning Python
just jump into Python 3 because that's
what Python is and that's the future of
Python tishell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
