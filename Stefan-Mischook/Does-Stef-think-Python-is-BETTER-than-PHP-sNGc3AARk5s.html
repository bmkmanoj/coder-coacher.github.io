many
she looks pretty good boy that she love
me wow if I had this much luck on tinder
so let's try the YouTube comments
doesn't work too well right I just
shouldn't they all disappear since I say
hi this user comments from the channel
yeah well whatever
delete delete alright let's jump into
this vlog hey guys it's Lancer a quick
question that was put to me on YouTube
am i advocating now for pythons that
instead of PHP since I just did a Python
course no I did a Python course because
a lot of people are asking me for a
Python course on YouTube and offer you
to as you may or may not know my main
thing the terms of the coding anyway is
not YouTube YouTube is more or less a
hobby although it's been kind of cool in
other ways as well but I did the Python
course simply because people wanted a
Python course for me and so I did it do
I think Python is the best language ever
invented no I think it's a great
language has a lot of pluses I don't
think any one particular language is
overall better than any other of the
languages out there they're all good
Java c-sharp Ruby Python PHP JavaScript
they all and many other Swift they all
bring something to the table it just
depends on what you want to do Python is
a great first language to learn because
the code the Python code itself is kind
of easy to read reads more like
Englishmen my code and Python is a
general-purpose language so you can go
in all kinds of different directions
with it but in terms of web app creation
PHP in my opinion for most people still
King because of the environment PHP has
a huge ecosystem in that regard
and because PHP runs much faster at
runtime than Python and runs much faster
than movie movie unveils much faster
much faster and just to get your app up
and running with PHP on the web is
simpler traditionally speaking than
Python because Python is created as a
general-purpose language and not
necessarily specific for web apps
there's a little bit more plumbing you
have to do to get your Python out app
live on the web whereas PHP PHP is
simply a web app creation language so to
get your PHP app live on the web is
tributing so coded PHP page and that's
it it's done so go answer that question
no I'm not saying peach Beach forhead
PHP now or Python is the King on just I
did a crispy Blas before it and B Python
has its role you can do web apps of
Python b-grade a lot of people don't
both use Python for AI robotics and
other things so I just figured I'd put
on a Python course what people are
asking for I have a different philosophy
about teaching code than what you see
out there and my philosophy is about all
about super solid foundations that's
what I teach what you have the
foundations everything else comes super
easy after that and my philosophy is
based on the fact that I've been
teaching since 2003 I studied psychology
of learning University and I come from a
family of teachers my father taught it
most of his career many my answer
uncle's with teachers many of my cousins
are teachers like five or six of us and
we were never encouraged to become
teachers sort of habits the blood if you
will so that's why I teach any health
I'll just leave you to emphasize again I
don't think any particular language is
overall better than any other language
it's all very specific to what you want
to do what you want to accomplish I hope
that helps behind one last thing yes if
you want to get into freelancing I am
under the impression I'm of the opinion
that best and easiest way to get into
freelancing in terms of coding its PHP
there's no question about that speech
because you've got this huge ecosystem
of wordpress sites small business sites
and small businesses were going to be
hiring independent freelancers and
Joomla and Drupal these are all big
three CMS's the three big CMS's and what
they're written they're written in
Python no they're written in PHP so
knowing PHP is is key to that a lot of
shopping cart apps are created with PHP
so just having PHP in your back pocket
in terms of freelancing to me is the way
to go again in terms of freelancing do I
get into AI robotics machine learning
it's Python right if you want to get
into enterprise development either Java
spring or asp.net c-sharp getting the
idea what you want to do dictates which
language you want to learn just try to
keep that in mind people are always
trying to think what's the best one so
circumstantial is like what's the best
type of automobile is it a Porsche 911
or is a minivan well if you want a whole
twenty people you're not going to use
the Porsche was the portion at these
tiny seats in the Porsche 911 you can
put like a little tiny dog in the
backseat that's about it so sometimes
the minivans better than the Porsche
although I would not drive a minivan
personally but I'm just saying you know
same thing with programming languages
hope that helps bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
