CSS and CSS layouts I want to finally
show you those templates I was talking
about you can create those and a few
different ways
easiest way to use this dashboard here
another way you can go file new and you
can choose blank page and you've got all
these options here we're gonna go
through now you don't want to go blank
template and page from template and page
from sample because these template tools
here are really designed for situations
where you may be working with another
team of Dreamweaver users and these
quote-unquote Dreamweaver templates here
are used in that situation and I'm not
gonna cover that in this video what we
want to look at is these blank page
templates and HTML and we don't choose
HTML template and choose HTML and here
we have a whole bunch of layouts these
are all predefined layouts and you can
see how they little thumbnail here it
gives us an idea of how the layouts work
for instance if you have a little spring
that means the layout is flexible or
stretching the text it's text will
stretch and flow to pay on how big the
browser window is whereas here if you
have a lock on it you know that the land
looks set and solid and we we demoed
that in our own layout so we made before
so typically liquid would imply a liquid
layout a flexible layout so we have all
kinds of different options here 2 column
3 column whatever you want so I'm gonna
go with let's say 2 column liquid layout
right sidebar now doctype misses some a
had it I haven't addressed before the
doctype basically is as you see we got
different options here in a nutshell the
doctype is basically the is the rules
that the engines will use to process
your code
so how can I explain this you see there
are different versions of HTML HTML
strict transitional and then there's
something called XHTML which is very
very similar to HTML but it's different
then you have different versions XHTML
transitional strict and so on the co
looks very similar and only code monkeys
will really see the difference and very
subtle the key to the doctype it
basically gives instructions to the
browser what type of code you're
creating so that it can use the best
engine to process that code I hope that
makes sense so we have a whole bunch of
types here I always tell people to use
HTML strict or transitional not XHTML
I'm not going to get into the reasons
here but for now just use HTML 4 pull
all bunch trick so what that will do is
will tell Dreamweaver to first of all
dream a roll inside insert this doctype
code in the page telling the browser
with the codes about and at the same
time the code that Dreamweaver will
create will be HTML 4.01 string so yeah
we'll go with that
so layout dot CSS now what's this it's
asking us here the code to create this
layout do you want to add it to the head
of the page now the head refers to
pieces of the page in between and the on
top of the body I'll show you that in a
second it's basically embedding the code
in the page or do you want to create a
new file to embed that code the code to
create this layout or do you actually
want to link to an existing file so
we're gonna say just add it to the head
I'm gonna call create so here's our page
we've seen this before so let's take a
look at the code scroll up and now
please minimize all these so you see
head and we scroll down and head that's
the head the head section of a web page
is the section that contains all kinds
of miscellaneous information mostly for
the browser that people don't actually
see so nobody's going to see this
right they're not gonna see this this
cold appear in the pages anything that
users see is going to be in between the
body and body tags so as you can see
here not only do we have all the CSS
rules that we need to create our page
generator for us by Dreamweaver here but
they've also tagged the divs with the
proper IDs to create this layout here
let's preview this I have to save
changes so let me say that so whenever
you add a new to page from a template
you're going to save it so I'm going to
call it
DW template so here we go here's our
page and we said give us a liquid layout
of flows and here we go
so now instead of having to fudge around
with trying to get our layout to work
it's already for us all we have to do is
go in there and add our own content you
know welcome to the page and they say
domain and you and we can just put in
our own text right this is just like
using Microsoft Word so you get the idea
and you can drop in images as you
normally would I hit enter certain image
and I'll put the reading man here all
those I won't put any alternate text for
a sake of what we're doing
save that preview that of 12 say as you
can see I'm able to build up a page
really really quickly by using a
template
so even see if we go in we got our Roxy
we got our DW template here let's see
the CSS see all the CSS that's been
added to our page now that doesn't stop
us we can add our own CSS so we can go
in here what's redefine a tag let's say
our paragraphs paragraphs here we go in
this document only so we say the font
style for our paragraphs
times new roman' and we're gonna do
something bad we're gonna make it all
bolt just really stupid but for the sake
of demo say that
f12 so here we go so as you can see with
the template we can add our own rules
and we can do all kinds of funky stuff
and it saves us a lot of time if you
notice how much time it took me to show
you how to just create a new page from a
template versus having to build it from
scratch another great thing about these
templates is that they've been debugged
the good people at Adobe have worked
hard to make sure that these templates
work consistently in all the browsers
you gotta have much less had headaches
and hassles with with your layouts and
one last bonus as you can see you see
this slash forward slash star and the
closes SAS start or slash these are what
you would call comments and essentially
these are instructions left to us by the
people at Dreamweaver who created these
templates for us and these instructions
tell us why they're doing certain things
and this is this is a good way you can
actually learn from their work and you
can learn how they do certain things and
why they do certain things if you decide
to become a real code monkey yet another
reason to use a Dreamweaver templates as
you can see how these people who you can
be guaranteed has spent a lot of time
working on this stuff to make it work it
it will save your headaches why reinvent
the wheel to see
they've done and you can build out from
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
