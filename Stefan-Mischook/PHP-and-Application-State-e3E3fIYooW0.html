killer video store calm in this quick
little V block I want to discuss PHP and
application state so first of all what
is application state that's the ability
to track information across the scope of
your application so so let's give an
example of application state let's say
you have a members-only area and you
want to track to see if a user a
particular user name is logged on more
than once at the same time you know so
you have John Doe logs into your system
and you want to see if and then you want
to see if another guy using the same
user credentials tries to log you have
to see into the system at the same time
now if you have application state then
you could just have a variable that's
accessible across the entire application
so if somebody tried to access again
logs it again you can just check that
out you could check your application
state to see if that user is already
logged in and then you can you know
block multiple logins or track multiple
logins whatever you want to do that's
what application state allows you to do
you it's basically a global variable
that you don't confuse that with PHP
globo's it's basically a global variable
that anybody hitting your application
can access so you can track all kinds of
information in real time and make
decisions like I said let's say you have
a membership membership system and you
wanted to prevent multiple logins by the
same user at the same time there can be
scenarios where you might want to do
that application state makes that easier
now there's ways around it in PHP excuse
me there's ways around it if you don't
have application state in your
particular language that you use so
brings me to my larger point PHP
unfortunately
does not have a application state and
the reason it does is because PHP the
PHP process is fired up every time a
request is made for a page and if then
it's completely shut down oh when the
request is complete
there's advantage to that because it
helps prevent memory leaks and so on so
so it's gonna open a process start
closing so because the process there's
no process that keeps this kept alive
across system there's no you know easy
way to track an application state now
you can get around it by this making
database calls that's a real pain in the
act or you can use with object-oriented
PHP you can use object serialization you
cannot automatically you know basically
write text files to the server and start
tracking that way but if you have an
application state built in to your in
your environment your language your
server model then you don't have to do
this manually and that's one of the
advantages Java has application state
dotnet house it has application state
Ruby apparently I don't I never use it
so I couldn't say but yeah it does have
application state ColdFusion has
application state because it sets on top
of Java so there you go application
state allows you to track information
across the entire scope of the app so
you can track where multiple people are
doing multiple people could share
information that's the thing multiple
sessions a session is defined by
somebody hitting an application and
interacting with the application and if
you have app state you can easily share
information very quickly across all
these sessions but because PHP does not
have app state because of the nature of
its model you have to jump through a
couple hoops to do that yeah it's just
something app state is convenient
sometimes and
you know I used to use a quite a bit in
my Java days but again with PHP there
ways around it so that's it it's just a
nerd vblog probably putting some people
to sleep with it but what are you gonna
do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
