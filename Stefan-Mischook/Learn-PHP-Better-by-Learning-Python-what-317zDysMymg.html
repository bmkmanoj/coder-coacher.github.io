I'm not vlogging I find flogging kind of
weird anyway I'll skip that for now so I
just wrote a piece I put it on killer
PHP although if you go to killer sites
calm you can find it there and I was
just talking about how PHP developers
could become better PHP developers or
understand PHP better if they learn
Python people go what how is that the
case
well it's something I picked up a long
time ago when I started learning my
second language and all of a sudden I
was able to get a better understanding
of the first language what I learned and
why is that the case is because most
modern languages share pretty much 98%
we can debates 96 98 99 % of the same
basic constructs in concept but they
express them in different ways so for
example PHP has functions and so is
Python but they have different color
different syntax and slightly different
behavior so if you learn PHP functions
then you go out there and you start
learning Python functions all setting
your understanding of functions is going
to improve but it babe and this gets
especially so when you start getting
into more advanced concepts like
anonymous functions and hope you
articulate your programming you know
what I should have got new I should have
known this extinct of me because that's
I learnt this concept of comparing
technologies of world
if you will in martial arts where I
would do one martial art style then
we'll do another style in terms of
kicking some kicking art or some form of
karate or so kung fu and it would give
me more insight in the first style but I
did and it's comparing and contrasting
different styles different technologies
different programming programming
languages has tremendous benefits that
you wouldn't consider you wouldn't think
otherwise I'm getting out of the win
there yeah yeah yeah so that's it so if
you want to become a better PHP
programmer learn Python you want to
become a better Python programmer learn
a little bit of PHP just to see how the
other people do it it's very very
educational and it will just give you an
overall deeper knowledge of programming
that's the case and if you're learning
martial arts do that too if you're in
one style of fighting if you're in Thai
boxing go learn some just you know North
American kickboxing for a little while
if anybody still does it I don't know
where you get the idea or if you're
doing judo go learn some jujitsu and
it's going to give you more insight in
terms of grappling overall it's it's
actually a whole concept I did catch
Campbell for quite a while and I got my
black belt in that it's kind of like an
early mixed martial arts but catch
Campbell the philosophy was initially to
look at a whole bunch of different
styles try to take what was good and try
to keep it was bad excuse me
trying to try to take was good get rid
of what's bad for you and just compare
different styles and in fact the
original idea is once you hit your black
belt your should you should go out there
and try different styles try different
styles not just in catch Campbell but
all over the place and as a result catch
Campbell is so very now like you can go
from one school to the next in the same
city and you're gonna have a totally
different take in terms of how they
practice their catch Campbell that's
cool
that's cool anyhow so comparing and
contrasting languages that's a cool
thing and about this vlogging is fine
I've been studying the whole YouTube
thing for a while and they little bit
older than 20 so the vlogging thing is a
relatively new thing that people are
into and I find it's funny I watch a lot
of these vlogs and these people they
don't much to say so it's funny it's
like I today I'm gonna go get some
coffee and then I'm gonna go get on a
skateboard and then I'm gonna look at
some new cameras are gonna buy and
that's the vlog and they get some of
these guys again millions of views they
it's it's interesting I used to poopoo
on it if you will a little bit but then
I realized well there's no different
than when people back in the seventies
and early eighties would watch Johnny
Carson or they would watch Jay Leno or
they would you know whatever they were
just interested in the individuals after
you know at the end of the day anyway
the whole vlogging thing is this kind of
weird for me that's why I don't vlog
very often but whatever to each other to
each their own and it's all cool all
right Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
