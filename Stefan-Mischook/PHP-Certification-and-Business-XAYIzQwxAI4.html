PHP calm and killers is calm in this
video blog I want to remind people I
covered this in many blog posts and I
guess a few videos but I just going to
keep repeating this message because it's
something I get asked on a regular basis
almost you know three four times a week
and that of course is about a PHP or web
programming certification or Web Design
certification and getting jobs out there
as a programmer or as a web designer and
let me just stress two very important
points about the market out there eighty
percent of jobs are from small
businesses not big businesses small
businesses that's just the facts eighty
percent are generated in small
businesses now you know and your country
maybe seventy percent you know because
I'm speaking to a worldwide audience
here but that's generally the case and
so you have to look at when you're
looking at if you want to get a job
working for somebody chances are is
eighty percent chance you're going to be
working for a small business that's a
business with less than 50 people and
the character of the small business
owner is that they're very practical and
very pragmatic so they don't care so
much about degrees and certificates they
care much more about track record and
skill sets and results because they
can't afford to just lean on people
certifications now there may be
exceptions to this like if you don't
fear in the medical professions or
something where government mandates that
you have a degree that's a different
thing they always have to look for that
but when it comes to web design and web
programming fortunately right let me
emphasize this fortunately it's about
skills it's about ability you know and
you so you if you are someone who's
trained at home
you can produce really kick-ass looking
sites or you can write really good code
you can show look here's an application
it created here's the books of these
websites I've done that will get you
work in the market out there for small
and medium-sized businesses max when you
go into large corporations you know
thousand five thousand employees that
kind of think 500 employees are bigger
then in government of course then the
whole you need to be certified or you
need to have a degree BS comes out and
and the reason it comes out there is
because in large organizations like that
you know as the organization gets bigger
just like coal just like software just
like websites as it gets bigger they
become less and less efficient so they
have to put in artificial controls to
try to maintain some sort of quality if
you will or stability within the system
so in large organizations and in
government jobs that are going to have
HR human resource resources departments
basically people who know nothing about
you're in the case of programming you
can have people know nothing about
programming you know they've been
trained in human resources and they're
going to try to make judgments about who
they should hire based on a couple
articles they read somewhere or video
blog regrets it hurts aware
unfortunately so that's why you see
rather in job postings that governments
positions or large organizations you
usually see these ridiculous
requirements which have no basis on
reality for instance I've seen like job
postings were expected everybody know
where you know Java H know PHP is you
know JavaScript channel jquery object of
sees you know Photoshop and dreamin they
just named everything right and there's
very few people who throw everything you
know and it's absolutely silly babe I'm
not going to go
tangent but so again if you're looking
to get work chances are and that's
eighty percent chance that you could be
working for a small company and in that
case certification is an afterthought
ninety-five percent of the times because
the business owners can't be concerned
about certification and degrees because
these guys get to send entrepreneurs and
I've been entrepreneur for 20 years I
serve arms are very young when 18 and
they don't look at that they don't have
enough money to be concerned about that
kind of crap and in fact a lot of these
guys are sort of they don't trust big
institutions and higher education
they're not into that whole herd thing
they're into being individualist or into
pragmatic solutions that's why they're
entrepreneurs so that's what they care
about so keep that in mind if you're
looking to secure work and remember the
culture in the small business is very
different from the culture in large
organizations you know government or big
companies it's a small business culture
typically means that you have there's
more of a chance you have to know what
you do it you can't hide in the system
as they do if they work in government or
they work in larger organizations that's
another reason why small business is
much more efficient it's much better
because people can't hide and disappear
in the framework with their own
competences and we're a small business
if you're an idiot you're going to be
caught very quickly and given a boot and
that's just you know again another issue
that you have to consider yourself you
have to consider it in this regard
finally if you have your heart set on
working for a large business a large
corporation because there's certain
advantages to that as well you have to
think that a certificate or online
degree in web design will not cut it for
me split your places they're going to
want specially today they're going to
want technical degrees they're going to
want
related degrees so if you want to become
a software designer it won't be a
programmer they're probably going to
want you to have a comp sci degree or
computer engineering degree if you want
to become a web designer you're probably
going to need a fine arts background or
something to that effect a few years
back you know maybe 5-10 years ago if
you just had a degree in anything and
then you add on top of that you know web
experience whether it be programming are
designed so on you're in now they become
they're becoming stricter as time goes
by and and even before bad back when I
was doing in the heyday back in their
mid early 90s mid-90s they were so
desperate for people web technology
skills that you know you didn't have any
degree you're in even large organization
so anyway as the industry matures larger
organizations are going to be following
back on traditional models at least
we're a short term of we need people
with degrees because if they don't have
a degree they don't know to talk about
which as I discussed in the previous
video blogs is a bunch of any way in
fact I found the best programmers I know
I see over the last 15 years are
self-taught people because they really
enjoy what they're doing they do it for
fun where there's a lot of people who go
and get a comp sci degree or a computer
engineering degree you know they may
enjoy some no certain percentage enjoys
it be going to find a significant amount
of them they're there just to get kind
of degree so they can get work by the
way because I think there's a shift
going on the broader economy economy
excuse me I think that the value of
university degrees are going to diminish
over time for a whole bunch of reasons
which I'm not going to get into now but
if you start looking around on the web
you're going to start seeing the things
you know what's coming to light about
higher education in the US and Europe
and
and what's going on there it's a hole
we're going into a period of time now
we're seeing a shift in the culture and
in the business community as a result of
certain economic realities that are
coming to the fore anyhow that's it so
now you know if you're looking to get a
degree or certification you understand
the implications about that and so
fingers think about which you where you
want to find yourself big business
government job or small business you
know and then as such you can decide in
what type of education you need based on
the type of work that you want to get I
hope you found this video blog useful
