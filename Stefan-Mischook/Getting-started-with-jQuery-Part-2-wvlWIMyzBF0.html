traditional javascript i would have to
make sure that my javascript runs after
the h1 has been read by the browser let
me give you a quick example of that so
if we were doing this typical JavaScript
I would do script type equals text /
JavaScript and we can just use our alert
and I would do document dot get element
by ID now we need to of course attribute
this or ascribe it some kind of
identifiers so we'll say title and here
i would say title and enter HTML now if
I take this little chunk of JavaScript
if you've seen any JavaScript before
then you'll know that what what you're
seeing here is that we're looking at the
document which is the whole page
basically and we're saying get element
by ID in other words let's just grab
that one ID called title which we've
specified up here and give me the inner
HTML in other words give me everything
inside that tag so if I hit save and i
refresh this page we're going to see
getting jquery perfect however if i take
this script tag or this block of
javascript and i run it beforehand and i
refresh it it's not going to run in fact
we're going to see a little error up
here at the bottom right if we're using
Firebug and it's going to tell us that
this is a no-go because it's going to
say that this is null so actually the
way that the browser renders this is
it's all done sequentially it's done in
the order in which it appears now jquery
has a very nice feature to basically
mitigator or deal with this problem all
we have to do is we have to use the
dollar sign so if i say dollar sign Open
bracket close bracket or actually just
open bracket and then function and then
I were to take this code that I've got
here I move it into the head of the page
this should actually work so if i
refresh it again getting jquery appears
and the reason is is that the dollar
sign in jquery is actually just the name
of a function and what's going on in the
background is that jquery will only run
this when the dollar sign has been fully
loaded and the page has been fully
loaded so you don't need to worry about
having a half-completed page rendering a
whole bunch of JavaScript now let's see
if we can clean this up some more alerts
tend to be kind of annoying when you're
doing debugging especially since if
you've got a lot of events happening on
a page it's hard to properly log them so
instead of using the alert i'm going to
use console dot log and this is a
feature of the Firebug extension where
if i save this now and i refresh this
we're not going to see anything however
if i open fire bug again in my console
I'll see getting jquery so already
things are a little cleaner and it's
easier to track things without having
all these things pop up now let's see if
we can do a little better than this
instead of saying
document.getelementbyid I'm just going
to use the dollar sign which is the
jquery function and then i'm going to
say pound title now the pound comes from
the CSS style of grabbing different
elements on the page which is exactly
how jquery works so just like in CSS
when I want to grab an ID called title I
do the same thing with jquery so I'm
grabbing that ID call title and instead
of saying inner HTML what I really want
is the text if i refresh this again
nothing should say it should change but
getting jquery will still appear on the
log and also this code is far more
descriptive and it's a lot more elegant
now the last little thing I want to talk
about here is how we can use Google's
content delivery network so when you're
working on a larger project you might
want to speed things up by using CD ends
or content delivery networks and these
are networks of computers that exist
around the planet and that can serve up
content you know if I was let's say
doing this tutorial in Australia then I
would be hitting the Australian Google
server versus the American Google server
the Canadian Google server so it's a
great way of speeding up those requests
by for standardized content in this case
we're talking about jQuery and google
has this wonderful content delivery
network that they're providing for a
whole bunch of Ajax libraries like
jQuery or dojo or prototype or script
oculus these are all libraries for doing
client-side JavaScript so instead of the
script type text / javascript jquery
dash one point three point two min GA s
unless instead of this we're going to
change our source to the Google content
delivery network so here what we're
going to do is we're going to go to HTTP
colon slash slash ajax google api scom
/j s api in other words JavaScript API
so that's the first step now if I save
this and i refresh this you'll notice
that I'm going to get an error and
that's because when we use the Google
content delivery network we need to do a
little bit more configuration than just
changing our source I'm going to just
copy this URL and show you the web page
in case you want to look at it later on
but if you go to ajax google api scom or
actually i believe it's just just google
api scom or ajax Google Play api's oh
here we go it's on
google com ap is Ajax lives and you can
see that they've got Ajax libraries for
everything from jQuery to prototype to
dojo mootools and there's even some
sample code you'll notice that not only
do we have to reference the JavaScript
API but we also have to specify which
library we want to run and just like in
the initial example where we had the
dollar sign to make sure that the page
wouldn't start executing JavaScript
until it was fully loaded google has
their own approach where they have
google dot set on load callback function
so the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to say Google dot load will
just copy that paste that in and here
the version that I want is the same as
the one I have on my current machine so
it's one point three point two and
instead of the dollar sign function I'm
going to do Google dot set unload call
back and have a function and this way
the code that happens to appear within
here is only going to load once google
the Google content delivery network has
been accessed and the JavaScript has
been downloaded to the browser if we go
back and we refresh this page again you
should see we're getting a syntax error
that's because there's two curly braces
if i refresh this page again you'll see
that it takes a little longer at least
initially because I have to cash the
version of jQuery from the content
delivery network but the functionality
is the same now we're going to be using
the google javascript api in some of the
tutorials and we're going to be using a
local version and others but they're
really interchangeable but having the
option of using the content delivery
network is is definitely nicest
especially on high
fake websites so that's part one in part
2 we're going to be looking at events
and firing off events and also a bit of
animation thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
