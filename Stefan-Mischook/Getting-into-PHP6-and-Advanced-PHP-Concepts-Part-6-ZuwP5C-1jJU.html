or in basically your your application
that you know something didn't go right
so we'll say magic method let's say
didn't doesn't support that prefix
so this way you know how we started
initially and we have this call and it
just it didn't return any errors and
that's actually a bit of a problem
because then we don't know if if
something is actually going wrong so by
throwing a new exception we make sure
that we can still check to see if
somebody is actually you know using the
write method prefix so if I do XYZ
address I should get require once error
and it's gonna throw an error
well now it's saying it can't find an
exception oh yes let me just go back
here for a second we again because we're
dealing with something that has
namespaces we have to specify that this
is the absolute namespace a global
namespace there we go so now we're gonna
get uncaught exception magic method
doesn't support that prefix so this is a
great way of making sure that your code
is robust enough that it can handle you
know some of these odd cases so now if I
do get address that should still be okay
but of course of course that address
doesn't exist we need to define that now
now I'm gonna take this 4/3 return
statement
and just put it where they get clauses
we're gonna make this a little more
robust in a second but let's just get
set working as well so in the set case
we have to actually deal with these
arguments so you'll notice that the call
function has two parameters it has a
name variable and it has an args
variable and the args variable is
basically any arguments that you would
pass in to the call parameter so let's
just try something if I go to set
address here and I have pram 1
/ am ii and / am three again nothing
happens now if I do a var dump or a
print are they're both very they're both
kind of synonymous in this case so I'm
gonna use Sprint are just to switch
things up a bit and I pass in args what
this will do is this will print anything
related to the args variable that has
just been called so if i refresh this
you'll see that it's creating an array
where the first the first index 0 is per
m1 the second index 1 is parameter and
the third index 2 is per am 3 so so far
so good
now we know that setters generally only
have one argument and if there's the
case where we want to have a special
setter then we can of course define it
as the primary setter for this class
I'll show you what I mean in a second so
we can have a very simple bit of logic
here where we can say if count args is
equal to 1 then this name actually we
don't want the name we want the method
property equals whoops args 0 in other
words we want to set the first parameter
to the method property else we want to
throw a new exception saying default
setter supports 1 argument so now this
is going to fail and it's going to say
default set or supports 1 argument now
what's neat about this is that we can
actually create overrides so let's say I
create a public function here called set
address with let's say Street postal
code
and state and then we say we echo got
three parameters if i refresh this you
can see that got three parameters gets
that code and that's because we have
defined a function called set address so
this will always run before anything
that has underscore underscore call and
this is a great way of creating
overrides so this is kind of our base
functionality and then we can extend our
class with overrides basically methods
that override the trivial functionality
or the generic functionality that we've
implemented in the call function so if I
delete that and I go back to index and
instead of just putting paramah 1 / n 2
/ n 3 I just set the press with Eiffel
Tower and I echo it I'll get Eiffel
Tower and I can do user set first name
John user set last name
I've been sold it's my last name all
that should work and now I'm gonna do
something that would be a business rule
so in this case instead of you know just
so I'm saying echo user get address
let's say I just want to echo the user
now normally this doesn't work object
could not be converted to string however
we can take advantage of PHP type system
and implement a special method called
two string I'm going to create a public
function called two string and it's
going to echo first name live first name
space last name lives at address</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
