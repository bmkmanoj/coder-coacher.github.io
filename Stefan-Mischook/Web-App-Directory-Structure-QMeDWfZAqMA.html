someone's email to me and what did they
ask they asked me about web design and
web developer workflows so they started
doing I guess they just started doing my
interactive web developer course and
you're asking about giving them lessons
on actual workflows how to structure
their code in in terms of the folder
structures and so forth well I'm not
sure for how far along he got but
getting into the CSS course even later
on in HTML course I get into that I
start talking about directory structures
and file organizations like for example
simple things like putting images in an
images folder as an example later on
when you get into the more advanced
courses specifically the projects based
courses at the shopping cart with a you
with the PayPal API or CMS course you so
you're going to start being introduced
to MVC design pattern Model View
controller design pattern which is a
standard way of organizing your apps so
that's in there as well ultimately
though if you get into professional
development you are likely going to be
using some sort of framework some
pre-conceived of framework so the PHP
world the number one framework is lair
eval in the Ruby world its rails of
course in the Python world is Django and
the Java world this spring and what
these frameworks do is provide a whole
bunch of extra functionality it's like a
library of code canned scripts ready for
you to execute deploy on your your
dynamic your website I was about to use
the old way of describing web apps
dynamic database driven websites anyhow
so a lot of these frameworks well all
these frameworks will contain things
like authentication libraries and
pagination libraries and UI widgets etc
etc don't worry if you don't know what
these are
basically it's just a pre pre-configured
code if you will that just makes it easy
to build out your typical web app you
know after 20 years now
the software development community has a
very good idea what the typical web app
will contain so these frameworks these
web frameworks like laravel like Django
like rails like spring basically have
these things built already for you so
you can just just put them into place
kind of like Lego blocks that's the way
it should be because when you have
libraries that are refined frameworks
that are refined where the code has been
vetted and worked on by lots and lots of
developers it's pretty much bug free so
you're gonna end up with a better app in
the end so anyway when you go past the
beginners courses that I provide the
foundation training where I do get into
the basics of structures and naming
conventions and so forth and so forth so
that your apps are better organized when
you get into an actual framework they
will these frameworks will provide a
structure for you for that particular
framework so laravel will have a
framework will have a structure that's
going to be different from rails it's
gonna be different from Django it's
gonna be different from spring and
different developers will have different
ideas about how to best do things and
that's why you may find yourself using
one framework or the other depending on
your particular taste in the end a lot
of times by the way these days all these
languages PHP Java Ruby Python Swift
Xterra they all have they're all very
sophisticated at this point in time they
all pretty much can do what everybody
else can do it now certain frameworks
have better capabilities have certain
advantages over others depending on the
circumstances so like node.js for
instance that engine can is really good
for a fast messaging type of systems but
PHP is very good at just ease of
development in terms of the learning
curve it's really easy to get up and
running with PHP because of the nature
of that language and I can go on and on
and on so you have to ultimately choose
which framework or which language you're
going to learn my philosophy is based on
my 20 years experience as a developer
where I learnt over the
years and years ago of that the language
doesn't matter the framework it doesn't
matter you can always take a framework
you always take a language and make it
work for you
and one caveat though is it's very with
framework or language you choose very
language specific as I mentioned in a
recent C++ video if you're going to be
building a gaming engine you don't want
to do in Python or Ruby or you know C
C++ you don't want to be doing it in
Python or Ruby you want to do it in C++
because C++ is super fast but if you
want to develop in a web app you could
do it in C++ but you'll be there for
like eighty thousand years trying to
develop that web app and C++ where if
you did it in PHP or Django Python
Django or Ruby rails or Java Spain you'd
do it in a fraction of the time because
of those other languages they are much
more geared towards that kind of
development web stack development anyhow
so if you're worried about that about
learning how to structure your apps
again as I said in the project-based
section of the interactive web developer
course package that put together you
you're exposed to that you're exposed to
ways of organizing your code and
ultimately though you're going to be
using some sort of framework especially
if you get into more complex app
development as an example for instance
you may not go into any of these
frameworks you beginning to app
developer you may not get into laravel
or Django or spring or whatever
depending on the language you may end up
being a professional WordPress developer
as I mentioned where WordPress has its
own structures framework a lot of people
might say that structure and that
framework sucks that's besides the point
if there's a structure there and you
just work according to that or you may
get into Drupal another content
management system in PHP you you have a
structure there to work within you get
the idea so that being said yes there
are different structures in which you
can organize your code but there's basic
principles that are kind of universal
like separating
code that's used to display things to
the user those are called the views
those will typically be kept in a
separate area on your in your directory
structure and then you have something
called controllers they sort of manage
the database later the object
you know I'll stop there because we're
going down this tangent I won't yeah
yeah so again I do teach basic structure
in the basic core coding courses and
then when you get into the project we
get a little bit more advanced than that
and then ultimately depending on where
are you going to go with your software
development you're gonna have certain
structures suggested to you well it's
good to say impose they saw a pull I
suppose they will be imposed if you jump
into a larva or Rails there's pretty you
know this is way they do it you know
there's some flexibility though that
being said for simpler projects you
might want to not use a framework and
you may just have very very simple
structure what I would suggest that you
do when you're thinking about your code
base think about in terms of logical
separation of your codes so you may have
code for a database access so you may
keep data in a particular subdirectory
you may have code you have to see your
images directory you know you may have
you may have images and video so you may
have a Resources directory done images
and video sub directories in there you
get the idea you may have your views
directory the visual portion or site you
may have a directory called views for
that so it's logically separated so when
you look at your code later on you look
at the structure of your code you'd be
able to find where everything is you
wouldn't want to put images inside of
your database directory right because
would why would you put images there
right mixes make sense I hope all right
that's it for this vlog search ow just a
quick ending to this vlog so a couple
days ago I did a not quite a 24 hour
fast but a 20 hour fast and then I
started eating very boring food for the
for a day or two so I broke down today
and I had one of my treats now this is
know if you can see this or not so this
is a menu this might be interesting to
you guys were not in North America menu
Pizza menu and one of my main stays here
was this thing here a submarine a steak
sub so I broke down and I bought a
stakes up today and taste very good but
now I feel like crap and so now I'm
gonna have to drink tons of tons of
water and tea to flesh all the toxins
from the steak sub
I don't eat steak subs very often
anymore maybe once every six months
because when I used to eat them a lot I
was about 30 pounds heavier so if you
want to see what fat stuff looks like
you can look back at the earlier videos
on this YouTube channel see me in my
orange shirt my friends call that the
polar bear look because my face is much
fatter and I had these tiny little polar
bear eyes so let me just say it is if
your era was using a Speier encoder and
you find yourself eating your snacking a
lot and you're getting a little heavy I
would suggest trying to put the brakes
on it because it's a lot easier to lose
510 pounds and it is to lose 25 pounds
of 30 pounds or more and when you are
close to your ideal weight or your ID or
at a good weight or you're not fat
you just feel much better you have much
more energy so I know it's kind of out
of subject I suppose but I just wanted
to bring that up but once in a while
it's good to have a little junk food
just to satisfy those taste buds all
right we'll talk to bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
