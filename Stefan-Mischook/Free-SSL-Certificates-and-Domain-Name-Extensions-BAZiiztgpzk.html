little bit of a screen capture I just
want to quickly cover two things first
of all SSL encryption this is when you
add security or SSL security to your
website now traditionally you would pay
for it and you had different levels of
encryption and it could cost you more or
less and then you would have to install
it on your server and the cost could be
anywhere from 29 bucks a year to 267
bucks for a wild card as they call it a
wild card SSL certificate it would be
for certificate for instance if you have
killer size calm if you wanted to have
shop killer size calm or book stock your
sites are calm each subdomain shoptalk
your site's not calm subdomain book soft
killer site calm is a subdomain you
could either get it an SSL for each sub
domain paying twenty five bucks per as
an example or you get by a wild card for
like 60 bucks and be able to SSL encrypt
all your domains now the reason for this
video is that you have something called
let's encrypt which is very
well-established now and it's free
everything is free free automated open
and you got all these sponsors clean
Chrome Mozilla
Shopify blah blah blah blah blah so
don't buy SSL certificates anymore I
just had my SSL for certificates for the
killer via store Auto renewal cost me
like 60 bucks ticked me off so yeah if
you're looking to secure your site in
these days a lot of sites you should
secure like for instance I'm using
Chrome here and you see killer size calm
is not secure frankly it is not a
security threat you really only need
secure sites in my opinion when you're
doing maybe shopping carts and stuff
like that which I'm not doing right here
on killer size this is basically a blog
site at this point time before we have
our forums and stuff but you see that
your connection to the site is not
secure but if I go to let's encrypt for
instance click on it so you got the
green lock
secure connection but if you go to kill
sites and I go to shop killer video
store calm where I saw the interactive
web developer you see of course because
it's a shopping site it is secure yeah a
secure connection and yeah so that's why
you want to have security on your site
it's for shopping so on but these days
because people are very sensitive to
security and so forth people want to
have SSL encryption and again it's a bit
of a pain to set it up but your hosting
company should be able to help you with
that and I would just use let's encrypt
you don't need to go pay for it anymore
and even if you're not doing shopping on
your site it's probably a good idea to
encrypt your pages to well to secure
your site with HTTPS that's what you see
HTTPS whereas if it's not secure it
would just be we don't see it here would
just be HTTP the s here means secure and
all it does it's when you have an HTTP
site an SSL secured site
it's just encrypting the data
communication from the web browser to
two servers so when you type in stuff in
a farm it encrypts it so people can't do
some can't intercept that information
again this is very important with credit
card information stuff like that but not
for web sites that are just blog sites
or something information sites but these
days it's become like a marketing thing
these days to secure your web sites even
if you don't have to so anyway that's
the first thing I want to bring up SSL
encryption just go to let's encrypt
let's encrypt our target tree it works
is fantastic if you put up a site you
probably should get an SSL certificate
here install it's a bit of a pain but
it's good marketing people feel a little
bit safer I suppose you know it's not
really founded finally I wanted to
mention this now I get I got this screen
capture from a particular hosting
company or domain seller forget which
one now anyway and this is interesting
to me now you know domain name
extensions like dot or dot com
net etc and you got many many more you
have regional extensions like if you
lived in Canada or B dot CA if you lived
in Quebec would be docking back etc etc
centre but there's so many more classes
if you will of domain name extensions
right if you look at underneath here
under Regional Extension to get creative
you got dot fail dot Roxton ninja so you
could have killed sites ninja and then
you got real estate extensions that bar
that estate dot house that technical
extensions audio dot graphic it's it's
amazing this is just a small sampling
these are categories you know regional
extensions is for for States for
countries or provinces there's tons and
for technical extensions it's probably
tons there's so many domain name
extensions now it's on believable
because at one point there was a worried
there was worried that it was going to
be a shortage of extensions when we used
to have only calmed org net and then and
then they expanded it a little bit more
but now we have all these domain
extensions are some extensions better
than the others I don't particularly
believe so I think dot-com still has a
bit of a cache a.com
comb was originally invented to
represent companies come come BIR
companies and then yeah org for
nonprofit organizations in the net for
networking based companies this is the
early web back in the early 90s and back
in the day if you weren't for instance a
non-profit you couldn't get a dork now
anybody can buy any domain any domain
extension why do I mention all this why
I just find it kind of interesting you
got all these different types of them
and domain name extensions but also I
just wanted to warn people against
getting taken in by these people who try
to sell you their domain names my domain
is verifiable look at this name and or
they or even worse they try to rent your
domains domain names are not in of
themselves too valuable unless they're
backed by goodwill in traffic so for
instance all using extreme exam
youtube.com that domain name is super
super viable because you know a billion
people water youtube.com every month but
you tubers calm I don't know if that
even exists that even though it sounds
kind of like YouTube it's not worth too
much because nobody goes to that
particular domain etc etc so domain
names really are valued by the number of
people the traffic going to the site and
maybe a brand name associated with the
site older domains like killer sites
calm this domain I took over in around
2002 but it was established no mm and it
was established in 1996 for the
best-selling book of of its time
creating killer websites I took it over
and this domain it still gets a million
or so page views a month but it's true
value well that's big value but it's
other values the fact that it's been
around since 1996 and older domains have
cachet and there you go so anyway that's
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
