with killer sights calm in this quick
little V block I'm going to answer one
of the oldest questions in the nerd
world something that's been bothering
people for a long time and that question
is which is better Mac or PC I use both
and for years now and right now I use
the two best laptops on the market four
in each in each camp I have the MacBook
Pro with the Retina display and the SSD
drives and I have the samsung series 9
the second generation again with the SSD
drives the first thing I want to point
out is that if you're going to get a new
computer and you have a few extra
dollars I highly recommend that you get
an SSD based system and SSD just just in
case you don't know is a solid-state
drive
they are the new form of hard drives no
moving parts and they move incredibly
fast compared to normal hard drives
incredibly fast meaning that your whole
computer is gonna seem light years ahead
of any other machine it's just going to
move so quickly because what a lot of
people don't understand is that reading
and writing to be hard drive is always
happening even with normal day-to-day
operations like opening up websites and
so on so having a super fast hard drive
like an SSD drive makes a huge
difference in terms of the perceived
speed of the system so I highly
recommend any SSD drive over a
traditional spinning magnetic drive ok
that said so what's better well yeah I'm
not gonna start a flame more because
actually I think now that each platform
will it be Mac or
see or windows is neck and neck and neck
each have their pros and cons and in
terms of web programming and web design
you know I would just go whatever you're
more comfortable with in fact in the
last several years five years I've been
primarily a Mac user and I first got
introduced the SSD drives with the
MacBook Air second-generation and I was
it's like unbelievable once you go to
SSD based systems you never go back to a
normal Drive
so recently though because of work
because of video work really I had to
demo a bunch of new courses I had to do
it on Windows seven since Windows 7 is
still the most popular operating system
out there so I got the samsung series 9
laptop and you know if I'm sounding a
little slurring my speech my apologies I
I burnt my tongue on something so it's a
little hard to speak sometimes anyway I
got the samsung series 9 which is an
excellent computer it's one of those
Ultrabook ultra thin laptops ain't cheap
but for me the price is worth it is that
the best piece of hardware out there on
the windows world I believe so I could
be wrong is it nicer than the new
MacBook Pros with the Retina display no
but they're different class of computer
and he retina display Macs are much
thinner than the previous MacBook Pros
but they're not nearly as thin as the
MacBook Airs which is the ultra
portables nor is it as there's of course
the samsung series 9 which is about the
same size and thickness as the MacBook
Air so it's not a direct comparison but
regardless so I got the two top laptops
I think out there at this time and
comparing you know top laptop to top
laptop again it's neck and neck and
depends what you like
like big advantage that I'm seeing in
Windows that really have surprised me
because I haven't used Windows in a
while if I hadn't used Windows in a wild
rather I was using XP up until recently
again the mousing features the ability
to mouse on on the on windows is
superior than on Mac for me it's just
much more precise I have better control
over it
I just prefer the mouse ain't on on
Windows another interesting thing in
Windows 7 is this whole taskbar it is
superior to Mac's
taskbar you know for instance I'm doing
right now I got my I just clicked on the
chrome icon here and just by mousing
over the various windows I'm able to go
from page to page to see what's open and
this flip to if I want it's pretty
useful saving with internet explorer so
I can just drop in into whatever window
I want to have another interesting thing
about Windows 7 that you don't see on
Mac is the ability just to maximize like
this full screen you can do some sort of
it's it's clunk here on one on Mac
another thing you can do is a drag and
push it to the top and it maximizes or
you can push it to the side and it takes
up that's place boy you know or the
other side does the same thing so it's
got some real neat features that I kind
of like now Mac features the big one is
of course you have very few viruses on
the Mac simply because the virus makers
don't target the Mac so much and also
because UNIX which Mac OS is basically a
UNIX derivative is harder to write virus
as far as far as I understand although I
am NOT on a virus expert another thing
that's interesting is that you have
multiple desktops on the Mac and I just
flying over over all the hardware is
nicer looking although I have to say the
samsung series 9
and I'll shoot a little video I think of
both machines are soon the samsung
series 9 I find to be quite nice in
terms of hardware comparable to the
MacBook Air I think let's see if we can
find a picture of it here
Google search so here's a model I have
it's not the best photo but you get an
idea it's ultra fans very slick I really
like to computer cell anyway I'm not
saying that Windows is better of a Mac
or Mac is better in Windows what I'm
saying now is that Windows and the PC
community in general has caught up not
totally but has caught up in many
respects to Apple in terms of putting
together a nice package and when it
comes to web programming and web design
again it's neck-and-neck one thing I
should point out you have the virus
problem on Windows but now Windows you
have them the Norton thing well Norton's
been around or McAfee or whatnot and
traditionally these are really real
pains and the buts because there's slow
down the entire system but now with an
SSD based system
Norton doesn't get in the way for me
anymore and it scans everything real
time and updates itself so it's worth it
to me the extra few bucks whatever fifty
bucks a year or something and you got
some pretty good virus protection in
there as well so anyway that's it
I hope this video didn't bore you again
this is just an off the cuff cuff vblog
I'm sort of stalling on putting together
our ting to actually lay down some new
courses that I'm about to build and
there are a lot more work on vblog so
anyway that's it so if you're trying to
decide what the gap in terms of macro PC
or Windows doesn't really matter in my
opinion get what you want but I would
always so I would always get an SSD
based system that means the MacBook Air
or the new MacBook Pros with SSD because
that's the retina
screams gorya get one of those
ultrabooks
my favorite of course was the samsung
series nine of all the asus ultrabook i
forget what it's called all of a sudden
it's very very nice very sweet as well
one last thing with the retina displays
the screens are fantastic it's
unbelievable how clear and how much
resolution you have in that it's almost
a 3k resolution versus 1.5 with the with
this brand new Samsung although I'm sure
that's gonna be changing very quick okay
that's it for the vblog we're gonna have
some real tutorials hitting the YouTube
very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
