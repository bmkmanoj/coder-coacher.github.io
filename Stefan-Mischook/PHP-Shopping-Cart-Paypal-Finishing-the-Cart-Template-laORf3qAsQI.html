we're gonna be putting together the
shopping cart row for subtotals and
shipping let's get started so that's the
beginning of our shopping cart we also
need to have a row for the shipping and
basically to have our total and our
subtotal and all of that fun business so
to do that we're gonna have a very
similar kind of template except it's
just gonna have the shipping cost so I'm
gonna create if I go back to my Add to
Cart page after putting down all of the
line items I'm gonna want to render a
row that's just gonna have the shipping
cost so I'm gonna just do Echo render
shopping cart shipping row and I'm just
gonna pass in the shopping cart as an
object and I'm gonna let whatever comes
out of there to get printed to this
particular page so just like I have
render shopping cart row here where we
pass in the product ID in the shopping
cart in the line item counter here we're
gonna just pass in the shopping cart
object and render shopping cart shipping
row is gonna render the shipping row for
our our bill that we're gonna be showing
our users so here I'm just gonna create
a new function and we're gonna call this
render shopping cart shipping row I'm
gonna pass in a shopping cart object
called a shopping cart now we could also
do this for taxes as well we could
render shopping cart tax row or if we
had like a promo code row then we could
also do that as well but the shipping is
just an easy example and you'll probably
have to do that for your shopping cart
anyways so now I'm gonna say I want to
return a new table row you need to close
that table row
and it's a three-column table
and we're just going to return that now
we obviously need to get the the cost so
in order to do that I'm just going to
here and I'm going to say okay we're
gonna say shopping cart
get shipping cost and what that's that
doesn't exist plate yet but basically
it's gonna go and it's gonna give us the
whole shipping cost for the shopping
cart let's go back to the shopping cart
object and let's create the code for get
shipping cost so we've got get shipping
cost for a particular price we've got
get item shipping cost so now getting
the shipping cost of the whole order is
in that / - isn't that difficult just
create a new public function called get
shipping cost pass in we actually don't
pass anything in and we'll start with
the total which equals zero so it's
nothing and then we go in and we say for
each this items has product ID and the
quantity so this is a key value pair so
the product ID is the key and the
quantity is the value the total equals
whatever the total was plus this get
item shipping cost for a particular
product ID so it's just going through
and it's basically running the same get
item shipping cost which it in turn is
going to call get shipping cost for and
it's going to pass in the price of a
particular item so by describing
everything that we're doing along the
way these each one of these functions
can be you know three or four lines and
can do very very powerful procedures for
calculating our rules or business rules
and at the bottom here I'm just gonna
say return the total so if I go back
you'll see that this is our essentially
our shipping cost so we've got 65 bucks
for cumin six times and a dollar
ninety-nine for the pasta and 1791 for
the tomato soup cans and if we add all
this up our shipping cost is $85 and our
cost of our order is something around
100 or so dollars so let's just clean up
the template a bit and we need to add a
dollar sign here and we'll put shipping
here if i refresh this I'll have
shipping perfect now the last row is of
course the total I'm gonna go back to
add to cart and I'm gonna say echo
render shopping cart total row and I'm
gonna pass in the same shopping cart
object here - we'll go back to templates
I'm just gonna take this copy it paste
it render shopping cart total row and
this is going to look very similar it's
gonna say total and here we're gonna say
shopping cart get total and I think
that's going to be the last method that
we have to add to our shopping cart so
we're gonna create public function
get total and we probably want to add
some tax here and stuff so I'm just
gonna say add tax here and you can do
that on your own but what we want to do
is we want to return this.get subtotal
which we haven't created yet times or
plus this cat shipping cost so it's the
shipping cost plus the subtotal and we'd
also want to add the tax in here as well
so we need to create one more method one
more function will be public function
cat subtotal and get subtotal is also
going to look a little like shipping
cost will start with total of zero and
then we'll go in and we'll say for each
this items as product ID and then
quantity we actually don't need the
curly braces we're gonna say that the
total is equal to the total plus and
we've already written this code so we'll
take advantage of it again which is this
get item cost and we'll pass in the
product ID so the nice thing about
object-oriented programming is that
you're actually reusing a lot of the
functionality that you're already
creating in different instances and then
I'm just going to return the total so
again very simple function we're taking
the subtotal and the shipping cost we're
adding it together and that's how we get
the total if I go back here we've got
the shipping and then we've got the
actual total here now I don't think we
need the shipping amount and the unit
cost for all of these anymore so I'm
just gonna pull that out for now and
that'll clean it up a bit and there you
have it in the next video we're gonna
create the view cart page and we'll
start looking at the PayPal API or the
PayPal integration and that should be it
thanks a lot for listening I'm John
