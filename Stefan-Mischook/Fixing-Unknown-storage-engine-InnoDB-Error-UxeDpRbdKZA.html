client saying that they're having
trouble accessing one of my apps I turn
on air reporting and I get this database
error number twelve eighty six unknown
storage engine in ODB so I blanked out
the details here but so here we go we
got this problem having trouble hitting
you know DB based tables just in cases I
know you go to Google what is in ODB you
know the B is a storage engine for the
database management system MySQL MySQL
5.5 and later user by default it
provides standard as you complain
transaction features along with foreign
key support then you have another style
of database if you will called my I Sam
my I am is the default storage into
minus QL relational databases major
deficiency though is the absence of
transaction support I won't get into
that now but I just wanted to clarify
what you know DB was all about so
essentially what happened was that the
database was not responding to user
input so the app was pretty much shut
down so what I did is I've searched for
unknown storage engine in little DB and
getting a ton of results on the web
which would suggest that the in ODB
tables in the system were corrupted you
see you can have a database in MySQL
where some inner tables are in ODB and
some of the tables or my I Sam it
depends on what you want to do I won't
get into that now so looking on the web
there's always elaborate fixes in terms
of reconstructing the database and so
forth so the first thing I did was to
see if I could load up a backup of the
database from just an hour before I
backup the database twice a day remotely
and of course I got a failure in doing
that and so that was a little work so
look pretty bad look like the tables
were corrupt so then I get a report from
the server
and this is the key light out of memory
the process MySQL D that's the MySQL
database let's terminate because the
system is low on memory right here
status out of memory so so the first
thing the most important thing a nerd
should do is to restart a lot of times
restart will save the day
and in fact that's what saved a day so I
did a restart on the MySQL server and
everything was ok so if you ever have a
error where you're getting the unknown
storage engine you know DB error first
thing I would suggest that you do is
that you try to restart the MySQL server
it could be a memory issue and be sure
to have daily backups at least of your
data just in case your database does get
corrupted in a way that requires that
you rebuild the tables which you don't
want to have happen especially if it
lose all the data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
