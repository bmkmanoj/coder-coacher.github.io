killer sites killer PHP it's been a long
time since I've done a video blog post I
suppose so i figured i would get into a
couple things that are in the news
lately well what's in the news lately is
this thing called Bitcoin now if you're
not familiar bitcoin is basically a
digital currency people will run the
bitcoin program which will basically
crunch a bunch of numbers and come out
with an answer to an equation and this
answer is considered the Bitcoin and
people are going wild for bitcoins now
meaning that there are these open
markets out there and people are buying
and selling bitcoins and the price of
bitcoins has gone parabolic in the last
few months like everything that goes
parabolic weatherby stocks houses or
whatnot people will come up with all the
reasons why things have shot up and
priced so much there's always reasons
people always believed it and then
eventually things will correct correct
is a nice word for a crash so let's
compare that to other famous and
previous bubbles that we've seen so I've
got this chart here from a great site
called zero hedge and here we have
previous famous asset bubbles so this is
a cell c company bubble from 1719 to
1722 you see its value to shot up like
crazy and then it crashed him went down
and went well below its original price
you see the same thing with tulip bulbs
is the famous acid bubble but I've read
about
where're for a while where people
basically value tulips those flowers
more than houses that's at one point and
in fact some rare breeds of tulips sold
for more than the price of a manor house
and at the time between 1634 1637 people
had a lot of reasons as to why these
tulips were so valuable everybody said
while tulips you can't go wrong with
tulips and everybody went crazy and of
course you see what happened they hit a
point and then people realize all of a
sudden that they were just tulips and
they crashed and you see the nikkei
which is the Japanese stock market again
I hit it to peak in that 1990 i believe
and it's been crashing for last 20 years
and you can see it it's not quite where
it started back in the 1970s but we're
back at the 1980 evolutions and i think
has a long way to go still so let's look
at bitcoin see how quickly it's jumped
up like it's gone totally parabolic and
kind of looks like these three charts as
well right if you look at how quickly
it's got up and of course as with the
previous asset manias the tulip bulbs
and the South Sea company etc people
have their reasons they have they have
reasons that they use to explain why the
bitcoins have shot up so much and you
know at some level some of the reasons
may seem credible and I think the reason
bitcoins have shot up so much is because
people are basically very nervous about
all this money printing that's going on
around the world don't worry that the
government's are devaluing currencies
and so they're looking for something
that is safer and that's the big iron
here because bitcoins is anything but
safe when you see any assets shoot up
like this for no good reason you know
that you got an acid bubble now people
say well there is a reason there's a
demand for the Bitcoin tins and it's
limited the problem is is that as I
point out
in this article there's not just Bitcoin
there's Bitcoin there's litecoin there's
a whole bunch of other virtual
currencies out there that are pretty
much like Bitcoin while they are like
Bitcoin and the only reason about
Bitcoin to going up in value is because
people perceive that they're going to go
up in value that's the nature of this
this asset mania phenomena that we're
looking at here so why is steph from
killer PHP a nerd site you know a nerd
blog talking about Bitcoin well bitcoin
is as a computer algorithm it's a it's
an open source product and so it's kind
of related in that sense I've been a
programmer for many years and running
little businesses for many years so I
have a perspective with regards to
technology and business and so on at the
end of the day what I think people are
the big mistake I think people are
making is that they are conflating the
value of bitcoin and litecoin and all
the other cryptocurrencies out there
i'll just use with you all the other
digital currencies out there they're
conflating the value of the system
surrounding bitcoins and how you can
create a Bitcoin or a light coin and how
you can transact in them and so forth
they're conflating the value of that
system with the coin itself well the
Bitcoin or light going as if Bitcoin or
litecoin have something special about
them they don't in fact they don't at
all the thing that's special about
bitcoin litecoin is that they are they
are an expression of a very interesting
system and I think at some point in the
future governments will adopt this
system or some variation of the Bitcoin
in the litecoin system to be able to
more freely distribute a currency
bitcoin and litecoin are not real
currencies because they're not backed by
anything they're extremely volatile and
people say water back by the community
well the US dollar is has
much more backing than Bitcoin will ever
have and that's because US dollars back
by the US economy the biggest military
in the world the US military and it's
actually the US dollar is backed by
every other government in the world
because most governments have the
majority of their reserves in the US
dollar so they don't want to see the US
dollar fail and there's a bottom or a
base to US dollars because US government
collects all its taxes in US dollars so
if you own real estate in the US then
you have to have US dollars to pay your
taxes if you want to hold on to be real
estate so to say that the US dollar has
nothing behind it it's ridiculous on the
other hand Bitcoin nobody needs Bitcoin
and there's truly nothing behind it it's
a pure speculative tulip mania style
acid bubble one day I don't know when
people going to realize that bitcoins
are just numbers because that's all they
are but just there's just numbers as Max
Keiser would famously say they are
precious numbers as gold and silver are
precious metals the difference between
Bitcoin and gold and silver is my gold
and silver actual are actually tangible
and are actually used for something
they're used in production the coins are
used for nothing except to buy and sell
things and of course there's not too
much about most of the Bitcoin action is
all about people wanting to get rich
quick which is crazy so there you go
that's my take on Bitcoin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
