sites in this podcast video blog I'm
going to answer a question that was put
to me by somebody on you to bed in fact
and the question was what I thought of
the new myspace layout so here it is
here's well part of it and so this is
actually from a video that the if you go
to new debt new dot myspace.com / play
you get to see this video what are
profiling there the new myspace layout
it's certainly a lot better than in
current one here's a current one the
current one is really bad it's amazing
to me that Rupert Murdoch who sold
bought myspace or a half billion and
spent done at home and I don't know how
much she spent another billion or so I
can't imagine how you know a billion or
two bought you this this is really
terrible so the new site or I guess you
can click through here and you get to it
here's the video and let's go here I
have it here so this is one of the views
and it looks much slicker it's got some
side to side interface thing happening
which I don't like meaning scrolling
horizontally that's a no-no generally
speaking although people are a little
bit more used to it than they used to be
and they do have any White House on the
front so I have to give it a thumbs up
for that I'm a big aiming White House
fan I like Jack White too yeah but
beyond Amy Winehouse I can't really
comment beyond that it looks good but
you don't really know a site until you
see it actually you work with it play
with it CL usable it is so you can have
a site like this site which is
aesthetically much more pleasing than
the current myspace site that's for sure
but the big question a larger question
is it usable that is more important in
many respects I think van its aesthetic
especially with a social networking site
where there's a lot of uploading of
videos and photos the videos and the
photos that the users upload can be used
to create all the the chrome if you will
so personally if I was creating a social
networking site I would keep it as
simple as possible see this is this
homepage here this is kind of cool in
terms of its simplicity but again at the
end of the day no matter how good a site
looks and how usable site is if the
content or the site itself what the site
does is not compelling I'm not sure if
it's going to have any traction at the
end of the day if you look at sites like
Reddit let's see if I can find right at
mom's pretty easy as go to goo there we
go if you look at the reddit site very
simple no eye candy no fancy layouts but
the content is compelling and the site
is usable very user friendly so Sarah it
success it's successful again content is
king one of the oldest rules of the
internet so whether or not myspace is
going to have the new myspace as we have
success I think you know again the
layout looks nice but largely it's going
to come down to the quality of the
content and how usable the site is we
will see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
