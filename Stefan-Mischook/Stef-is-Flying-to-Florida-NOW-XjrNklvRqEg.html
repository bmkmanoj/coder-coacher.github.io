just a few days before I head off to
Florida so I'm heading down in Florida
to just chillax and chill out so what
I'm doing in that time frame
I'm pre recording a few videos so you
have a flow of Steph videos throughout
that week I'm just going for a week
because I think a few weeks later I'm
heading off to California for something
else so how should I close off this
video I really like what I do in terms
of work and even though I really like
what I do it's very important that you
take time off from it it's very
important that you take a break so you
can unwind so it's been eight months
since identification so I'm going on a
vacation just to chillax on the beach I
mentioned this I think in a previous
video but this is kind of the official
video don't worry as I said I've
pre-recorded and scheduled for release a
few vlogs that will appear during the
week that I'm on vaycay alright if
you're on vacation or whatever you
happen to be doing this week going to
school going to work have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
