looking at how to create motion tween
but already seen the classic version so
now we're going to be concentrating on
the new motion tween and what we can do
with it so I'll just ask you to create a
square on your stage and I'm going to
press V to activate my selection tool
and then I'll completely select the
object that I have here and remember our
shortcut f8 which is modify convert to
symbol so we're going to convert this
into a symbol sq for square is the name
notice the movie type I'm using is movie
clip and the registration point right in
the middle so we'll click OK well at
this point as you can see and I'll show
you by opening up my properties window
we have in our properties selected the
instance of a movie clip alright so at
this point what we want to do is to
create our new motion tween so how do we
do that if you remember in a classic
motion tween at 30 frames per second if
I wanted one second of animation I would
select frame 30 and I would press f6 or
right click and say insert keyframe
however when you're working with the
newest type of motion tween all you got
to do is convert your object into a
symbol and at that first frame we're
gonna right click and say create motion
tween not a classic tween but a motion
tween so when we do that first thing
you'll notice is that it's extended this
keyframe to about frame 30 which is our
defaulted frame per second rate and
you'll notice that the red reading head
is pushed to the end and basically what
you got to do is just move the object to
another position and you'll see that a
keyframe is created at frame 30 but also
notice that you've got this interesting
little path if you were to count up all
of the dots in between those paths while
you would end up with is 30 dots so each
one of these little dots is representing
one of the key frames that are on your
timeline and if I grab this and scrub
the timeline
look how easy that was you just have to
move the object into a position and then
the animation is created for you it's
really fantastic and one of the other
beautiful things is that you know if I
wanted to come over here I could also
change it say at frame 15 I want to move
it to another position check it out you
could just move it from here to here
then you'll notice that it moves to
there if I want to move it over here
you'll see that we have even more sort
of movement in place so you can really
get a great sense of what you can
accomplish inside a flash with this new
type of motion clean really really a lot
of fun and as you can see I could
certainly you know come over here and
add another keyframe insert a keyframe
or something along those lines but
you'll see not really activate it
doesn't really show you what you want to
be doing so what you could do is to
insert frames extend those frames and
then now we have this object at another
position you could then create another
movement now notice from here to here 30
to 60 that's got a lot of key frames
there's 30 keyframes in between there
and you can see the difference between
those and what does that mean for us
well basically it shows you that if
you've got a lot of keyframes in between
those two points it's gonna move slower
than if you have fewer keyframes between
those points see the big jump over here
it looks almost like it jumps pretty
quick and basically what that's showing
you is all of these extra keyframes let
me just double click on the layer and I
will change the outline color to red you
could probably see that a little bit
better so now that we see those paths in
red you can kind of get a sense of where
those separations are and when you have
a lot of them means you're gonna be slow
when you have just a few of them means
you're gonna be going quickly so you'll
see bang it jumps rather quickly over
here so let's test our movie control
enter
and when we do that you see that we have
our movement see the quick jump in the
middle there and the slow movement at
the end so just to give you an idea we
could have you know positioned our
cursor read reading head over here and
check it out you know I mean you could
just add another keyframe just by moving
your object around doing different
things as I can see I'm doing here so
the zigzag pattern works out really
easily on this idea and remember if you
want to add more frames you don't come
and make a new keyframe but rather you
just say insert more frames and now
you've got all these motion tween frames
ready and available waiting for you so
if I were to take this and drag it over
here you'd see that now we've got 30
little dots in between that path so
control-enter just our movie again and
you can see how that's actually working
so the new motion tween is really a lot
of fun and wait till we take a look at
motion guides and we can see what we can
do with these paths that we have here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
