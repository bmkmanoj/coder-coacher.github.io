really useful when you're working with
opentype and that is to create a number
of elements now as you can see here I've
really messed things up so I'm going to
select that and I'm going to get rid of
the ordinals there you go and another
thing I'm going to get rid of
temporarily is standard ligatures and i
want to show you why well here is the
word office let's take a look at what it
looks like when you take away your
ligatures you will end up with something
that looks similar to this and what that
means is there are certain letters when
you put them together and notice I'm not
squishing these letters closer together
than they what they normally should be
it's just set to 0 letting but in
certain situations there are certain
letters that don't actually look good
when they're right next to each other
and the reason being is because some
elements overlap like the eye and the F
and even the second half here so let me
select this office and I will set the
open type options to say standard
ligatures and look what happens it
squishes them together but it does so in
a fashion that is going to be really
nice and very conducive to good
legibility it makes it easier to read
it's less distracting and in fact it's
not three letters it's not ffi this is
one character the FFI character and
there are many other ones that you can
see when you work with ligatures so any
number of large bodies of text or
anything like that should always have
your standard ligatures chosen and
that's why it's there by default and
it's something that you can use so let
me show you something else if I were to
come in here and choose a different kind
of font something that is maybe more of
a script based font something that's a
little fancier and let's just come in
here with my name again for example and
I'm going to select this and I'm going
to choose B I Bickham script pro now
notice when I
do that just press return and let's take
a look first of all I'm going to remove
any of the open type elements that I
have here specifically the swash and I
just want to show you what it looks like
with no swash all right that's great but
I'm going to make it a little bit larger
so we could really get to see it and
also in here I don't want any contextual
alternatives just to show you what it
looks like normally hey well that's a
nice little element of text but let's
make a copy of this and now let's turn
on all of our other possibilities for
example I could come into the open type
and I could say hey hows about rather
than working with the regular pieces of
text maybe I want contextual
alternatives what does that mean well
check it out if you click on it notice
what happened to the letter o see how
it's got this little swoosh going on
right there very nice unlike the one
that we have here not that there's
anything wrong with this one but it just
doesn't look as fancy or have such a
flourish as this one now if we really
want to go for something fancy if you
know somebody's contracted you to make
their wedding invitation which is one of
the worst jobs as a graphic designer but
let's say you know you've got a relative
and they need a wedding invitation or
something well at least use a good pro
script font and you could have access to
things like this swash capitals look at
this letter s in comparison to that one
there is no comparison this is gorgeous
letter s it's got this crazy swoosh and
it really looks very fun as you can see
here let me show you some other
possibilities here I'll get rid of the
ligatures and I'll just put these ones
over here for a second what if I were to
take this one which doesn't have any
ligatures or anything like that and if I
come in here let's select it and just
right extremely
extremely good all right I'm going to
well actually I can get rid of these as
well I'll just move these over here and
here is the word extremely good I'm
going to make a copy of it so we can
compare between two of our examples well
in this one as you can see really
nothing crazy it's just pretty
straightforward and it looks good
there's really nothing wrong with it
however if I wanted it to look even more
attractive there's a number of things
that we could do let's see i'll select
it here and i'll come in and we'll say
open type let's try some contextual
alternatives and as you can see it's
really got some nice elements inside
here very very good notice the d is
moving around the x got this little
swoop the e has a little element inside
there too if I wanted to and make these
capitals for example compress my shift
that's what the first he looks like when
it's in capital letters like this
however if I come in here and I give it
a swash capital wow that really makes a
very big difference inside of what we're
doing if I came in here with the why and
the open types and if I went into you
know looking at how that looks you can
see that there's a lot of different
possibilities depending upon what you
want to be working with so there's a lot
of elements inside there there's swash
capitals there's old styles I could even
come in here and say stylistic
alternatives and let's look at the
stylistic alternatives first of all
let's turn that on perhaps every
stylistic alternative is not going to
work check it out see if we turn that on
we've got some great ones but not
everyone is really working with every
element the way I wanted to for example
the r.e.m e not really what I need so
I'm going to come back
and I'm going to remove the stylistic
alternatives for those but let's see
what other stylistic alternatives have
afforded us look at this great L so much
more interesting than the one we have
here look at the tea with the long
swooping cross against it look at the Y
that's incredible here's a basic white
look at this big swooping gorgeous why
really beautiful the G stays the same
I'm going to bring the double o's back
down to regular not the ones that we
have there and check out the difference
it's really no comparison when you're
thinking about what this would look like
if you really want to go for something
that's very fancy and actually looks
incredibly great you can see the
difference between this extremely good
and this extremely good so there's
really no comparison here opentype
affords you a lot of great possibilities
and working with open type and your
fonts can make you that much of a better
designer and that much of a better
Photoshop user in the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
