from the outside so I'm still dressed up
with my outside clothes takes me about
20 minutes to warm up so excuse the Hat
in this video I want to talk about
Python specializations so what do I mean
by that well python is a general-purpose
programming language and that means that
it can do many different things whereas
you look out for example PHP it's really
focused on one thing PHP it just does
web apps
whereas Python you can do web apps you
can do machine learning and AI
artificial intelligence you can do
server automation data Sciences you can
use Python to automate high end video
rendering software it really has a lot
of use cases use case is just a fancy
word of cases where it can be used so
there's a lot of job opportunities in
Python in many different areas so as a
new developer you're going to have to
choose what type of programming you want
to do so you may look at the Python
language and go I love Python but you
may find that you want to do this type
of thing with Python or maybe that type
of thing and each type of Python job
each of the specializations has its own
pros and cons and it has its own
supporting skill set that it needs so
what do I mean by that so for instance
if you are doing web apps you're going
to need to learn the web stack so you're
gonna need to learn html5 css3 a little
bit JavaScript and Python and some
Python framework that allows you to
create Python based web apps and this
goes on and on and on depending on the
particular specialization now I go into
detail about this in my killer Python
course what it's actually called
forget the air quotes it's actually
killer Python and I have two modules on
Python specializations so I work I look
at each of specializations I give you
the step by step the pros and cons of
each whatever in better step by step I
give you step by step how to get there
how to get a job
or had a large into in a particular
specialization and I also described the
supporting skill sets that you need with
that so it's it's something that you
figure every Python course should have
if they're actually going to be teaching
you real-world Python the other thing
you have to look at in terms of
programming in general is the career
path that you want to take in
programming there's three options
there's getting a job there is becoming
a freelancer and finally writing your
own software writing your own apps that
you have a cell into the marketplace
there are pros and cons to each there
are different roadmaps from each and
again I include that in my killer Python
course now though Python is a
general-purpose language where it could
be used in many different places it
doesn't necessarily mean that it's the
best that all of these things in fact I
would argue it isn't well some areas it
is I would think for machine learning
and AI is probably right up there with
the best of the best you have Python as
one option you can use C++ now though
Python is a general-purpose language it
does many things it doesn't necessarily
mean that it is the best that each of
these things in fact I would argue it
isn't for instance if you're doing web
apps you can do a good job with Python
to build a web app but I would argue for
the most part PHP is superior it just
runs much faster it's easier to set up
it's for web apps PHP in most cases is
the King doesn't mean you can't do a
great job with Python
there are huge web apps out there have
been created with Python and Pinterest
is when it comes to mind so it's very
capable on the other hand
Python is right up there with the best
of the best I would imagine if not the
best when it comes to AI machine
learning maybe the data science is
nothing is perfect though python is easy
to write it's fairly easy to learn the
very productive in terms of when you're
creating your Python code when you're
creating your Python app I'm going at
run time it's not necessarily the
fastest out there so let me give you an
example
the AI world C++ will be used to write
the core engine because C++ is so fast
relative to Python but what they'll do
is they'll write the core engine in C++
which may be 5% of code or tip Center
code and then the write everything else
in Python having the Python code talk to
C++ codes so in so when the app requires
when the AI app requires some heavy-duty
processing Python will pass that
processing to the C++ part of it and the
C++ will run through it real quick give
the results back to Python and then
Python will continue from there this is
not uncommon in software development by
the way when you're ready to commercial
call off the tide you're going to be
writing in at least a couple of
languages this is not on common to say
the least so you see that a machine
learning you see that in the web stack
in a big way if you're building a web
app you're looking at at least three
languages most likely four languages so
you're looking at html5 css3 those are
not programming languages but they are
computer languages then you're looking
at JavaScript then you're probably gonna
be looking at some sort of server-side
language now server-side language is a
programming language that exists on to
the server that could be JavaScript but
it could be PHP it could be Python it
could be Ruby it could be Java could be
c-sharp
it could be Perl although not too many
people are doing in Perl these days you
get the idea
so working with multiple languages
within the context of a particular job
is not uncommon so try not to get into
the mindset that you have to say I'm a
Python programmer that's it everything
else sucks or I'm a Java programmer
everything else sucks etcetera etcetera
as I keep emphasizing in all my videos
I'm gonna keep saying it over and over
again you have to consider the use case
the particular job at hand in terms of
which language you're going to choose to
do that job every language programming
language has its pros and it's cons and
you've got to be language neutral
language agnostic as I like to say
whatever the job demands you go with the
best language for that job really
depends alright that's about it I went
off on one of my tangents but why not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
