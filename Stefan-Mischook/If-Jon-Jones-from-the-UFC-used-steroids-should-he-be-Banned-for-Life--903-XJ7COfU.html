name is Steph sure I haven't been
putting out too many vlogs as of late
I've been on boarding a bunch of schools
so it was kind of a busy time of the
year for me so it's difficult for me to
get around but everything we discussed
before the new business course etcetera
etc is going to be happening I think
starting next week hopefully I think I
think I should be done with the back
office work if you will by then alright
so I want to do a quick commentary on
John Jones
USC light-heavyweight and I'm not a big
UFC fan of I do watch some of the key
fights like I'm gonna watch this
Mayweather McGregor thing this weekend
for sure since I used to be a martial
artist for a long long time anyway so I
wanted to comment about this Jon Jones
things he apparently has been caught
doing steroids again and this brings up
question that I wanted to put out there
should people who are caught doing
steroids should they should they be
banned for life from the sport now some
of you may think this is radical and
maybe it is radical but there is an
argument for banning them for life and
let me explain something about a lot of
people don't realize about steroids
the conception is that when you do
steroids you get this huge performance
game that's for sure and then if you go
off of them then you're off of them and
everything's cool but it doesn't work
that way because well let me just give
you a background when I was 18 years old
or 19 years old I forget now I got a
blood disease and it was a pretty bad
blood disease and he put me on major
steroids for about a year about a year I
think it was to make major steroids high
doses heavy-duty stuff stuff that like
Ben Jonson famous Olympic runner from
Canada used to hit his records and so on
and here's the thing about steroids I
would start and start taking his
steroids for my blood but I was still
training and doing martial arts at the
time
and at that time for liver for whatever
reasons myself and my training buddies
we would film each other we would have
these sets these forms that we do our
sparring etc what happened was when I
was on steroids the rate in which I
would improve was incredible it would be
like one month would be of training on
steroids the equivalent of six months or
so if you weren't on steroids it would
great the gains are incredible because
if you think about training at its core
training at its core it's about lots of
repetition and the healing time and the
healing time between you doing a rep so
you do you train really hard you push
the body you're you you push the muscles
so you're tearing the muscle fibers
you're realigning the body you're your
excuse me you're you're adding to the
muscle memory very gulfs repetition but
when you do a heavy-duty workout there's
a rest period which is very very
important so what steroids does steroids
accelerates the healing process by a
huge amount I remember my doctor at the
time was saying up top of my head
they're saying the the rate of healing
is accelerated by a thousandfold
thousandfold so instead of taking two to
three you know five days to heal your
heal consistently and this way you can
go back and train again super hard get
those benefits accrue those benefits
then you heal right away because you're
not sterilized and you go back again so
in a very short period of time when
you're on steroids
you can come progress super quickly and
that's exactly what happened with me we
were filming and you could see from week
to week I would do like every week would
be like a huge improvement and people
were again homing oh my oh my god this
guy is improving so much even guys the
guy filming saying this it was
astonishing to watch how quickly I was
evolving my physical skills because I
was on these massive doses of steroids
and here's the thing when it came off
the steroids because I solved my blood
problem
a year later whatever I had maintained
most of those games so I was off the
steroids for a longest time but because
my body had been driven there because I
had taken my body to that extra high
level it pretty much stayed with me it
goes off a little bit but then if you
train it's there because anybody who
trains a lot knows once your body has
been to a certain place physically once
you're able to run that 10k in a certain
timeframe once you're able to benchpress
your own body way to success or
eccentric cetera cetera
the body remembers that and when you've
trained in the muscle memory from
thousands of repetitions that you're
able to reproduce so much more quickly
pleasure on the steroids the body
remembers that you have that in you so
you know in effect even if Jon Jones
stopped doing steroids for two years he
will have and comes back and fights he
will have the games that he had accrued
as a result of having done the steroids
it's effectively if he were a boxer
you'd be like it's surgically implanting
steel into your knuckles and then say ah
you can't fight now because you put but
stealing your knuckles but a year later
you go back into the ring and you still
let your stealing your knuckles right
the advantage is still there it's for
life really and I can tell you that with
lots of experience now let me just point
out so they when I discovered when I was
doing the steroids and it was again it
wasn't for performance it was because of
I had a pretty bad blood disease they
did it for that and when I after a few
months of whatever 3-4 months of
training you know I would I would lift
up like a bucket of water to do mop the
floors I would have these big traps it
was incredible how performance you are
I'll give you one story to give you an
idea how impactful steroids are I was
doing the steroids and I was again for
my illness and so I was about this far
away from my splits you know my splits I
had to go I would have been full splits
another like six inches now and it was
like sitting there so I remember one day
I was in my place I just start doing my
splits I just start bouncing bouncing
bouncing bouncing bouncing and then I
can hear I can let you hear that area
cross cross cross I can hear the
crunching the tearing and and and and
amazingly within 15 minutes I I got my
full split so listen it could take much
or you could never get otherwise and it
was like wow I remember seeing myself
home wow this is unbelievable and even
though I was hearing the popping the
crunching their it wasn't painful at all
so I did that I got my full split and
then I said to myself after doing I said
you know this is gonna hurt tomorrow I'm
gonna be a pain tomorrow next day is
like nothing ever happened like nothing
ever happened and I had to forced to
split et cetera so that's just a very
real example of what taking steroids can
do for now fleet's performance and how
the effects of the steroids endure long
after you stop taking the steroids so I
put that question to you again should
somebody like Joe Jones who has now
repeatedly apparently according to
reports has been caught doing steroids
on multiple occasions and I would argue
he has now accrued he has benefits now
that are permanent that are basically
gotten through cheating because when you
take steroids you are essentially your
TV if it's not essential as no no
messing around or you're cheating so you
have to ask yourself that
should he be banned for life now here's
the other question like we discovered
with the Olympic athletes as far as I
understand most them take steroids
so everybody's taking steroids anyway
it's just some people get caught some
people don't that's one interpretation
of reality on the ground I don't know
for sure but from antidotal II from
people I've spoken to that seems to be
the case so promise steroids people can
get very sick blah blah blah blah blah
anyway I just thought I'd throw that out
there see what you guys thought and
that's it bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
