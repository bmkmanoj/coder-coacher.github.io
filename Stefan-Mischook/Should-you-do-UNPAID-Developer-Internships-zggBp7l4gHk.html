recently about whether they should do a
stache basically go into a company and
work for free so in this particular
situation it was a stache error stache
situation where they were going to be
doing node J s node J s worked the mean
stack if you will something he didn't
know yet or was in the process of
learning so he wanted to know whether or
not it was exploitation for him to go
work for his company for free so the
short answer is if you don't know a tech
and you're still learning and your
junior and you're given the opportunity
to go work for a company in a production
environment and to work on that tech
this is a gift
this is a gift remember there are people
out there who are spending ten twenty
thousand dollars to go to boot camp to
learn this stuff meanwhile you have an
opportunity to go work for a real
company that's actually doing real work
in the field in this technology for free
now you have to understand both two
things number one the type of training
you are going to get working at this
company is going to far exceed what
you're going to get in in any boot camp
real world experience always much better
than academic experience this is
something again I learned initially in
my martial arts days I would see these
guys who would do sometimes years and
years of theoretical martial arts to
going fools and the karate gigs and so
on but he never really sparred much they
were masters at executing these
techniques in the air or rehearsed sets
they call forms or cat or something but
what actually came down to fighting they
weren't very good at all for the most
part same thing goes with coding by the
way academic coders who tinkered around
with code in an academic setting don't
really understand the real world of
coding and then when you get out there
if they ever get out there they are
shocked about how different things are
in the real world so in this example the
way you're going to
acute code node code in a bootcamp
environment is probably very different
from the way you're going to do it in
the real world
I'll get into specifics here because the
whole point of this vlog is to say yes
if you have an opportunity as a beginner
to jump into a company where they're
going to allow you to learn how to code
on their time it's not exploitation it's
a huge opportunity on your part let me
give you the perspective from the
business owner now when I had a web
development studio the original studio
web was a web development studio and I
was reluctant to hire junior coders
because they take up a lot of time
resources often times junior coders
contribute less than what they take
because a lot of times junior coders
they don't know how to write code
properly they don't know how to conduct
themselves properly in terms of the way
they structured a code they submit to
code so they have to be trained up and
this takes time it costs money cost
money to train people who are beginners
so to include yes it's an opportunity no
they're not taking advantage of you in
fact you are taking advantage of them in
many respects at the end of the day
though if you learn in this case your
node well and you show yourself to be a
good worker a good coder and somebody
you can get along with people
communicates well produces good code and
so forth they'll end up hiring you
because it's hard to find good coders
and so yeah take that opportunity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
