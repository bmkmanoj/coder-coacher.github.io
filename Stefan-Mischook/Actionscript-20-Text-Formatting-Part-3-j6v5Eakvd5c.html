can roll over and do exactly what we
want them to do remember that when we
press these buttons they're going to
their respective keyframes that we have
here and as we mentioned we could have
left everything on this first frame but
it's better to put things out this way
so that we can take advantage of the
browser's back button by using these
anchors so having said that what we now
need to do is to determine what's going
to happen when we do in fact get to that
anchored area here called author so or
killer sites or anything else for that
matter so let's start in this order and
we'll see what we're going to do if you
remember one of the most important
things that we need to do is actually
load the movie clip that we need so what
I'm going to say here is first and
foremost a little comment I'll say call
the mcl or movie clip loader right to
load
the swf
sorry just spell that correctly to load
the swf okay so if you remember how in
fact do we do that well you know we
don't have to say level zero anything
we're on level zero so all we really
need to say is my mcl as we normally do
and is standard common practice I mean
we see this in most most development
projects so as you can see we've got the
my MCL and what did we want that my MCL
to do we're going to tell it to load
clip
and which clip do we want to tell it to
load well let's give it the URL and in
this case it's going to be killer sites
dot swf alright and we'll put a comma
here and we'll tell it to load this on
to level 5 just like what we've done
before
and now that we've got that set up for
this particular frame why don't we just
copy this information and we're going to
paste it on all the other frames as well
and in doing it this way notice I'm
going to show you a little trick just
open this up here and i'll paste oh I
guess I didn't copy it but check it out
here is what we can do go back to frame
10 just by selecting this information
I'll press ctrl C come here and press
ctrl V now this time we're at the if you
remember author section right so let's
put in author dot swf right here as well
okay we can go now to frame 30
and do the same thing for the portfolio
swf and finally we'll come here to frame
40 where we'll do the same thing for the
contact
let's save this preview it in our
browser and see there's the author
notice I have to still style the swf
here portfolio that's great contact
works well just need some CSS that's
easily fixed however here's the problem
number one when i click on the author
section I want this to be disabled not
enabled the way it is here and I also
want the killer sites button to become
enabled again instead of disabled as it
is here so not as it's not only enough
to do what we're doing here if we want
to have the enabling and disabling of
our buttons we're going to have to also
create one last function which we will
call in a second
so in order to do that what I'm going to
ask you to do is to go back to your
master file the first frame of the
action scripting layer will open up
these actions and right at the beginning
where we start the text formatting
remember just after the definition of
the new text format objects I'm going to
ask you to do is to create a new
function and first and foremost it's not
call back function it's just a regular
function and we're going to have to give
it a name so i will call it be text
re-enable
and now that we have beat X reenable or
just get the regular brackets in place
and now what we will do is put in a
little bit of information so number one
remember what we're doing with this
whenever we call is function we're
setting all of the buttons to be white
enabled again and then specifically
addressing the one that pressed it so
we'll see that in a second to look first
thing we're going to do is to make them
all turn white again so in order to do
that we're going to target the buttons
as we see here right you see just like
this author MC right and we're going to
say make these buttons enable true so
remember what we did over here sorry
where we said killer sites MC enabled
false right so going to take this
particular one and instead of enabled
false we're going to say enable true the
boolean value true so we're going to do
that for all of these buttons so
remember author MC let's put in author
MC
and we'll say enable true
there you go and we also had one for
portfolio MC
and we'll tell this to be enabled true
and finally contact
MC will also be enabled true so in other
words when this particular function is
called bang all of the buttons can work
again they'll act like buttons again
right though they'll give you the finger
but they'll still be orange</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
