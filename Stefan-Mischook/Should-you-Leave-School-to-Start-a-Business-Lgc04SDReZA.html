answer a question that I get every so
often should you leave school to start a
small business or to start a business it
could be a big business should you leave
school good question
alright everybody is different everybody
is different and your circumstances
really will play a major role into
whether or not you should do it so let
me give you a couple of the bullet
points and then we'll get into it so
number one if you are studying one of
the liberal arts something where the you
know history philosophy religious
studies these are all great programs to
be in but not so great for work and jobs
very difficult to get a job with a
history degree very difficult to get a
job with a religious Studies degree
unless I guess you won't become a pastor
or something so if you are in university
and assume you're in university if
you're in high school finish your high
school in the at least your high school
but if you are in university of college
and you're considering starting a
business first thing I would look at is
the program you are in for me just to
give you an idea of my perspective when
I was in my second year of psychology I
was a major in psychology in university
I decided to pursue my business
because my business started to take off
but I couldn't do my business and my
university at the same time so brings me
to the next point I didn't drop
University to get into a brand new
business I dropped out of university to
basically support a growing business so
the business had already been started a
few years before I was a side job slowly
growing working out the details I didn't
have the guidance that you have forgot
like me so I was making mistakes so it
took a little longer than it should have
but it was still a growing business it
was still a growing concern and but I
still was pursuing my schooling as the
business was growing because I could do
the business on the side and then I
could go to school at some point though
it got too much where I had
to make a choice between school in the
business I couldn't do both you if you
are in school and you haven't actually
started the business I would not drop
out of school yet
I would first start developing the
business because what you're going to
see with most businesses there's going
to be a period of inertia that startup
face kind of like when you start the car
and you're gonna warm it up if you're
living somewhere in the cold and you
just got to give it time get going
Daniel starts to roll so while your
business is slowly starting to just rev
up if you will just you're starting to
establish the basis of your company you
can still be in school and have that as
a backup again it depends on the program
that you are in if you're studying art
history or philosophy or some subject
but there's no job opportunity and
you're running up debt with school then
maybe it might make sense to put a pause
hit the pause button with the university
and try that business idea so really
depends on your situation
so on the other hand if you're studying
engineering or computer science or
something where there's a lot of job
opportunities it would be in my opinion
especially if you're in your second or
third year or your fourth you're near
the end of your program more than
halfway through personally I would
probably stick it out and just slowly
develop the business with the exception
if your business is actually starting to
grow if your business is starting to
grow and you need to choose because
there's a time issue then you could go
see the faculty and go see the school is
a can I put this on pause I think they
will so just put it on pause and just
see if you can push that business out so
yes if you want to leave school start a
business make sure you're in college you
want to fish your high school number to
consider the program that you're in is
it a money-making program interns will
get you a job also consider how far
along you are in if you are more than
halfway through or halfway through it
might be good just to stick it out and
slowly build a business on the side if
the business is just an idea at this
point in time definitely work on it on
the side start working on different
ideas and see how things develop
business is a process
and you're gonna have to learn to to
maneuver and to adjust and to adopt -
adopt - adapt based on the situations
and for a lot of people you could do
that while still going to school
maybe you can lighten your course load
by one course a semester or two courses
invested a semester to give yourself a
little bit more time to work on the
business so yeah a lot of times in life
it's especially in business it's good to
dabble too dipped toe in to see what
happens before you go you know all in on
something make sure be cautious that way
and then when do you pull the trigger to
drop out of school completely when you
see the money starting to flow with the
business when you see the opportunity is
starting to flow with the business that
will let you know how to proceed I hope
that helps bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
