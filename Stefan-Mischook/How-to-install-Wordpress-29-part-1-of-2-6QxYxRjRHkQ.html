calm in this video I'm going to teach
you how to install WordPress the latest
version of WordPress which is 2.9 point2
and i'm going to show you two basic ways
of installing wordpress and that's the
point and click method and the manual
method and we'll take it from there
before i jump in to be installing i just
want to point out that though i will be
teaching you how to do this with version
2.9 point to which is the latest version
now you may be watching this video and
wordpress three or later maybe out no
worries because the install process for
wordpress is fairly consistent is pretty
much the same rather since well for a
little while now so if you're watching
this video and a later version of
WordPress is out like a 3.1 or 3.2 or
something you'll find that the install
process is pretty much the same
so
thing I want to do is look at the one
click or the auto install WordPress
which you'll see that some hosting
companies will have ready for you in
fact if you go to wordpress.org they
list some popular hosting companies that
do this so I'm going to jump over a
wordpress org and I'm gonna hit the
hosting tab up here and what they've
done here is listed some hosting
companies that they know of that do
support the one click auto install of
word press the advantage of course of
this type of setup is that you don't
have to concern yourself about
installing the database and the
WordPress files all this kind of stuff
it makes it really easy the disadvantage
is that you may and i want to emphasize
may have a little bit less control over
the wordpress installation and how you
might want to configure things that said
it's it's pretty convenient to have to
admit and you may want to take advantage
of it in that case you don't really need
to watch the install video because most
of this video is going to be about the
traditional manual way of installing
wordpress of course if you don't have a
hosting company that supports wordpress
auto installs then you do have to do it
the manual way but the good thing about
that is that the manual install is
really not that difficult and that's
what the bulk of this video is going to
be about
so when it comes to installing wordpress
the first thing you need to do is
actually get the wordpress install files
so again you go to wordpress.org and
you're going to probably be at the home
page here I ran a home page you have
download wordpress 2.9 point2 you just
click on that button if you're on
Windows you're going to download the dot
zip if you're on Mac or Linux you I
download the tar.gz so i'm going to
assume that most of you are on windows
so we're going to go to windows
installer you click to install and i'm
going to save the file so as you can see
it's a 2 megabyte file I'm going to
high-speed internet so i was able to
download it very quickly so now i'm
going to go take a look at where it is
now for me i've downloaded the wordpress
2.9 point2 into my downloads folder on
while i'm in my documents and maybe
somewhere else for you just take note of
where it is so i'm going to pull it out
of here for the sake of simplicity and
i'm just going to unpack it it's a zip
here it is i'm going to drag it out
so we successfully unpacked our
WordPress files it should appear in a
folder called WordPress so I double
click and you can see all bunch of files
most of them being PHP files PHP if
you're not familiar with that is a web
programming language and dreamweaver has
been written in that language which will
bring me to my next point so let's
delete the WordPress zip file we don't
need this anymore since we extracted all
the contents here and what you want to
do now is decide where you want to
install WordPress on your site for this
video I'm going to install WordPress in
an empty domain name killer
photoshop.com now this brings me to my
next point you can install WordPress
give a subdirectory of your site or on
the root of your site let me explain so
here's kill sites calm and this is the
homepage and you see here this is a
basically a standard PHP home page now
if I click blog now I'm inside the blog
and this is actually WordPress right
here and let me just bring this into
view so you can see URL so you see kill
sites are common / blog i installed
wordpress in the blog subdirectory now
let's compare that to another site CSS
tutorial now wordpress was installed on
the root of this site so this is
actually a wordpress right here and you
can see that you got the tell-tale or
press post count here it basically keeps
track of you know how many post you have
on the site so this whole website is
actually all powered by wordpress versus
killer sites com where the WordPress is
actually installed within a subdirectory
so for this video I'm going to show you
how to install WordPress in a
subdirectory and it's pretty much the
same thing for the root
but I'm guessing that most of you are
going to be doing that so kind of make
sense to go that way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
