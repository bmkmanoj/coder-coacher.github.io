inside of this little folder and we have
one shape here as you can see well it's
a couple of things that we can do to
continue making this look a little bit
better for example I'm going to just
click on a different color and I will
click on a different shape so i'll just
make a another one by clicking here and
you'll notice i'll make another triangle
excuse me rectangle a little bit like
this and perhaps I'll take yet another
color here maybe just a grey of some
kind and I can create a third object and
allow that to be a gray color that I
wanted now again don't get confused with
anything i did with these layers because
we'll be talking about these vector
shapes a little bit later so notice i
have these three shapes that are you
know can be moved around and they're
separate items however perhaps what we
can do to make these more manageable is
to put them inside of their own folder
this little group area here so I'm going
to expand this just by clicking down
here i'm going to double-click on this
group and i'm going to call it well
let's say squares well they're not
really l square so let's just say boxes
and i'll drag these particular files
inside there we really should rename
these if i was working a little bit
easier and rather a little bit more
organized I'd be renaming these elements
so now that that all these elements are
named you'll notice if I expand or
collapse any one of these we can move
them continuously in this fashion if I
wanted to since I have two groups I can
move one group and the other group
independently of each other because we
can set the auto select a group or two
layer so that's a little bit about how
things will work but let me show you a
little something else what we can also
do is to organize these layers by
color-coding so for example
if I wanted to I could select the
posters group and double-click it now
you could do this just by selecting a
particular layer and double-clicking it
as well and you'll see here it says
layer style right and if I wanted to
just double clicking that says layer
style continuously now if you were to
press option and click on that notice
you can rename it here but it also gives
you the layer properties window so you
can right-click something and say layer
properties or right click on the group
and say group properties and that shows
you a little bit about that as well so
double clicking it does it for the group
option clicking it does it for the layer
properties of that layer as well now
here's what I want to show you if I
double-click on the group and go to the
group properties it's got the name
posters that's fine we can also color
code these layers for example I could
say hey look make everything inside here
be perhaps blue all right and let's see
what's going on well you'll notice that
that icon is blue and when I open this
up everything in this particular group
happens to be blue as well if I double
click the boxes and let's say hey let's
make everything in here red take note if
I open up that one now you'll see that
everything inside here happens to be
read as opposed to blue so it's a really
nice and easy way that you can keep
everything organized if I were to double
click the background layer it says well
you can edit it because it's locked okay
so let's double click it without it
being locked and that's not what i want
so we're going to option double-click it
to get the layer properties for this and
for example I could say hey make it grey
and you can see that that's gray as well
for the background now I'll select it
and lock it as well so look we've got
nice color coding going on here if I
want to I can select things individually
like we said or select them as a group
and to move things around very easy to
do look i'll put every
inside of this group underneath the
poster layer just by dragging it
underneath it like that so all the
posters are on top of the boxes now or
all the boxes can be placed inside of
the poster layer but we don't really
want to do that notice the indentation
here so to take something out of it just
drag it and you'll see until you get to
the point where it's a line outside of
that box and then you'll see that's
where it works so if you go right on top
of the box it's going to or the group
excuse me it's going to go inside that
group you don't want that so I'm just
going to drag it outside of that group
by placing it right all the way at the
top so remember coming over here you'll
notice don't put it on top but rather
until you see the line in between those
two and that will allow you to move and
reshuffle around the stacking order of
these elements as well as I've shown you
how to color those elements with the
color coding of the particular layer or
group item</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
