killer sites calm killer PHP calm and
others in this video blog I want to talk
about html5 and Windows integration I'm
night I get into details about how that
works but what you should take away is
that Windows is now going to be tightly
integrated with html5 the new windows 8
8 which I think looks really really good
actually so it's yet another reason that
you should learn html5 you see what's
happening now is Microsoft is really
tying html5 and JavaScript into the core
operating system the new it windows 8
operating system so people going to be
able to develop Windows apps using html5
and JavaScript so what that does is it
makes html5 and JavaScript much much
more important than it already is let me
be wrong you know I'm a big mac guy used
a macbook air which i think is the best
computer I've ever ever made I've ever
used any way but I'm also platform
agnostic as I am language agnostic what
do I mean by that I mean as a practical
nerd I I go wherever the technology
leads me and I think with windows 8 and
the things I've seen and I haven't used
it I've just seen it played with it a
little bit I think it's something
interesting in that you know microsoft's
been in the in the in the wilderness if
you will for a long time but i think
with this real smart integration of the
windows 8 platform across all the
devices it's on their phones now which
are really nice to the nokia lumia i
think they're called the lumia 800
nine hundred books really amazing the
tile-based windows 8 interface you see
it on the Xbox and now you're going to
see it windows 8 and it looks really
really interesting it's a whole new way
of sort of viewing operating system with
the whole life tiles thing if you
haven't seen it she will take a look at
it some demos windows 8 demos online
it's pretty cool because it's a type of
operating system that works well for
both both the mouse the mouse and the
keyboard as well as for touchscreens so
back to html5 and JavaScript because
Windows still by far and away dominates
the market in terms of operating systems
you know they still own eighty percent
of the desktop you're looking at at you
no html5 developers and JavaScript
coders to become much more valuable
because now they can write apps for
Windows directly not just for rich apps
in the web browser as if you guys follow
me you also know that I believe that
flashes is on its way out because of
html5 and the rise of JavaScript and
jQuery jQuery is a JavaScript library
allows you to do all these things that
you would initially do with a flash and
there's several advantages of working
with html5 and JavaScript versus flash
for instance so the whole the whole
windows 8 integrating everything doing
html5 and JavaScript it's it's a real
big game changer in my opinion so I
think there's there's a slow shift going
now where I would actually be paying
much more attention to Microsoft because
of the HD windows 8 integration across
all the devices and also
as a result of that I would be looking
much more closely at html5 and
JavaScript it's just become more
important than it was just a few years
ago hugely more important especially
since you know that Apple has fully
embraced html5 a paradigm I don't know
if it's integrated to our operating
systems on the core but nonetheless it's
something to really look at so that's it
yeah I'm wearing a hat because it's kind
of cool still up here in Montreal I'm
having a bad hair day and as you can see
if you watch my videos the office is a
little disheveled here because I'm
actually moving from this old gray stone
building and you know so I'm just
starting to pack up and get things going
so there you go that's it another reason
to learn html5 and JavaScript and start
paying attention to Windows 8 you know
it's it's seal it's a it looks like a
very interesting operating system and I
think that we might see a change from
the Big Apple boom that's we've seen for
the last five years which I was behind
so there you go we'll talk in a video
blog very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
