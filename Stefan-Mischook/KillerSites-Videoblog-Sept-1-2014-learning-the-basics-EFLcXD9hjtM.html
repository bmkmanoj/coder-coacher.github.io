sighs killa PHP etc etc so just a little
update on what's going on I don't know
if you care but you know perhaps some
people do so I've been in and out i know
i've been talking about this for a while
one of the main reasons well few of the
reasons that are not regular with my
videos yet is because i've been working
on a book I've been working first time
I'm actually writing again for a major
publisher and it's been many years since
I've been published and so i figured for
whatever reasons I decided that I was
going to write a new book it was time so
it's it's coming out I believe sometime
in the late fall you'll see it in
bookstores around north america and
europe and you're going to see it on
amazon i'm sure so besides that have
also been working on what you see here
studio web this is a system that i've
been working on for about a year and a
half two years or in many schools now
hundreds of schools are now using it and
we're just refining the product and and
yeah we're having a lot of fun with that
so once i get my book done which will be
i believe at the end of September at
least that's what's on the contract and
yeah once that's out then I were going
to be full bore back into video creation
have new new way of presenting new
angles new new style and you know I've
been teaching web design programming I
guess since 2002 something like that and
to be honest with you I got bored with
technology for a while I had been doing
it for so long I built my first website
in 1994 I was writing MVC based
applications in the late 90s so I did a
lot and at some point you get a little
burnt out with tech and I got burnt out
for a few years and so though my courses
are relevant they look a little dated
because they record
back and so we decided that I'm going to
be revamping my entire collection and
with high-resolution videos fancy new
browsers etc etc let me just say this
when it comes to the basics of web
programming and design regardless of the
of the programming language PHP Java are
we the basics are pretty much the same
html5 is html5 you know HTML is HTML PHP
is PHP when it comes to the basics the
changes in the last five years or so
most of the time has to do with more
intermediate and advanced level things
so for instance in PHP you'll have the
old mysql library which was used to
connect to the mysql database and that's
been deprecated what does that mean it
means it's been it's been slated it's
been queued up it's in line to get
eliminated from PHP at some point
although in my experience as a
programmer i have never seen deprecated
api is deprecated libraries ever removed
from a language because of dependencies
you don't want to start breaking all
kinds of apps so in replacement of mysql
there is MySQL I in terms of the basics
what are the difference it's pretty much
the same small syntax difference here
and there but if you know mysql library
you will know mysql I so for instance in
one of my early beginners course I did I
must have did in two thousand four or
five or something like that I teach the
MySQL library you and SQL of course now
some people go oh my god oh my god
you're teaching the old stuff listen if
you know mysql you'll know mysqli yes
sir more features in mysql i like the
object-oriented interface and so on but
whatever you know so anyway whatever
whatever i'm going to be we're going to
be updating these things in fact instead
of doing mysqli
I'm knives and chance i'll actually
teach PHP PDL which is a universal
library that seems to be where
everybody's going anyway so we're going
to go there you know what it's like if
you know the mysql library you pretty
much know the mask you all I pretty easy
to pick up you know and if you know why
sq I you know PHP PD all pretty easy to
pick up it's the basics it's always a
challenge to learn after that it's
pretty easy and this is from the point
of view somebody who's written software
and eight nine languages over the years
I can tell you it's if there's a lot of
similarity between all these things
there's a lot of variations and are the
same ideas same concepts so if you're
learning this stuff new just remember
that the hardest part about learning
code and programming is in the beginning
and I'm not telling you this to
discourage you I'm actually telling you
this to encourage you because once you
get past those first few hurdles the
rest is much much much easier that's
pretty much it ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
