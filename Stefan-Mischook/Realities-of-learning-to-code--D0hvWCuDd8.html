look how big my hands are relative to my
head
it's amazing how baby I look at that's
crazy anyway so I'm going to do a Q&amp;amp;A
here answer a few questions and so this
is three off an email sent to me by
somebody I am a newbie but I love
programming and I'm learning PHP
JavaScript and C sharp woo a lot of
things to learn at the same time
although a lot of programming languages
share many of the same concepts and
principles variables functions raise
conditional statement recursion and
object-oriented programming techniques
are all very similar you should pick one
and learn that one and then maybe branch
into other ones as you need to anyway
let me go back to the email I love it so
much but I am afraid I am smarter
am i smart enough to become a good
programmer well I get a decent job
there's too much information too many
frameworks too much languages I feel
overwhelmed I feel stuck I feel stupid
could you please help me sometimes I
feel like there are so talented
I guess so many talented programmers but
I am that I am I'm not reading his email
very well when I wasn't very well
written but anyway can I ever be one of
the talented ones I feel bad okay so
here's the situation over there cut to
the chase
so you get this guy who is learning
multiple languages at the same time and
he's looking out there in terms of all
the various programming languages and
frameworks but you see and it can be
very very very overwhelming I can
imagine
well actually I know let me give you a
little story
now the story takes us way back to
nineteen I guess the 80s late 80s early
90s
I faced a similar situation when it came
to martial arts there were all these
martial arts systems out there and it
was like overwhelming oh my god what am
I going to learn there's so many what do
I do
what happened being a obsessive
compulsive workaholic I started taking
multiple martial arts at the same time
so Monday Tuesday Wednesday I do one
style and Thursday did you see was it
there Tuesday Thursday do another style
Saturday do something else and I switch
it up and I did this for a number of
years it got to the point where I'm
about 17 years old and had done martial
arts at this point fairly consistently
for about seven years it started almost
ten and one of my teachers I wanted to
style is said to me well Steph you've
done a lot of martial arts over the
years and you know a lot of about
several different styles he said he said
to me but your problem is you're not an
expert in any one style and as a result
it slows it down so he said to me what
you should do it's concentrated on one
style of martial art master it become
proficient at it at least and then what
will happen is that it will raise the
game on all the other styles what you do
so what I did is I took his advice
because I had been doing martial arts
for a lot longer than me and I stuck to
one style it was hard because you're if
you're curious about other systems or
martial arts you want to go but what I
did is I concentrated on one style and
I'd be a little bit on the side
something else but I cut it down to like
one day a week on the secondary style
and the rest of the week on this one
system and what happened is I got very
good at that neut that one system must
work quickly and just like my teacher
told me at the time when I got to a
higher level of martial arts in that one
system
it basically improved my skill set and
all the other systems I had been doing
and you'll see that with programming if
you are intermediate level JavaScript
code of PHP coders few sharp coder you
are an intermediate level coder but if
you become an expert that pick whatever
language PHP or C sharp or whatnot when
you become an expert in that one
language where you become a more
sophisticated level programmer your
ability to them right sophisticated
JavaScript code and PHP code is there
really is there because the language is
all very similar and what separates the
great coders one of the things anyway
that separates the great coders from the
not-so-great coders is the level of
sophistication in the code so I'd rather
take somebody who's been coding and
c-sharp for six years and bring them
into JavaScript as an example having
figured he's never done JavaScript
before this person with six years of
c-sharp coding it's going to get up to
speed with the JavaScript super quickly
I rather the c-sharp guy has never done
JavaScript before rather bring this
person in to write JavaScript than
getting somebody who's been doing
JavaScript for a year and has no other
background in coding so pick a language
stick to it and it build up from there
as a developer you do not need to know
all these different things I see some
videos out there where you gotta learn
this you got to learn that you gotta
learn that box you can assignment that's
it's not true it's BS you have to be a
good developer a good coder and that has
nothing to do really or very little to
do with learning all these languages you
should be aware
of the landscape you should know what
the options are but it doesn't mean you
have to be totally knowledgeable about
all these options because as an expert
developer when you get to that point
when you're a pro level you be able to
learn this framework of this language or
this system pretty quickly when the job
demands it so in my software development
career as a freelancer fishing last
several years I would walk into a gig
log into a project and I would listen to
what the clients were looking to do and
based on what they told me I would
choose the language I would choose the
framework sometimes the languages and
the framework or languages or a
framework I've never used before didn't
matter I can get up to speed in it in a
couple of days because of my background
as a developer so keep that in mind I
know it could be overwhelming you have
to cut away all the noise of these other
frameworks and languages pick one that
you like that you find entertaining and
rewarding and if you're concerned about
the job prospects what you should do you
should look around as I've talked about
other videos what the other what to your
language rather means in terms of job
prospects so you let's see how many jobs
and we'll say she should probably see
Sharpe jobs or in your area what
companies are looking for c-sharp
developers and see whether or not that
matches with who you are you know
because some companies they may require
you need certain type of degree or the
type of work that they're doing you may
like or not like so that's very
important you picked up so at any rate
even if you choose c-sharp as an example
or PHP as an example and you decide
after learning it really well that you
rather jump into some of the apps
something else you haven't wasted your
time because all that you learned
learning C sharp or PHP 100% of what you
learned there is going to transfer into
the next language or all that you've
learned in this framework
we'll transfer into that framework it is
there's no time lost learning a
programming language learning our flavor
not at all so don't worry about it just
get into it write code and you'll be
fine
