killer video store calm and killer PHP
calm and other sites in this video blog
want to talk about two things number one
flash and how Adobe just effectively
killed flash and I'll get into that in a
second and mobile development sort of
tied in together mobile thinking iPhones
iPads androids etc so first let me start
with flash last week Adobe just
announced that they were stopping the
development of the flash mobile client
so translated they're going to stop
developing the flash player that runs in
Ohio foams things like you know Motorola
phones and blackberries etc and of
course iOS doesn't allow that so you're
not going to you're never going to see
that on iphone anyway so what does that
mean that means that Steve Jobs was
right in that you know flash is not
something that's viable I suppose in a
realistic way on the mobile platform
what I mean by that I mean that flash is
very heavy it works in Android and I
have an android galaxy tab galaxy s2
phone great phone and but it does take
up a lot of juice and hogs up a lot of
energy it's very energy in efficient and
and on top of that you have now the
quick rise of html5 and css3 which will
allow you to do just about everything
you're going to do with flash where you
can do everything yet but it's it's it's
in there so you will be able to without
having to get a special Flash plugin so
even adobe the makers of flash have
acknowledged this and they're stopping
the development of the flash
player on for small devices so why does
this kill flash it kills flash because
the future of program of computing
rather is in the mobile devices you see
I'm i got this galaxy as to phone with
the dual-core chip it's very similar its
neck and neck with the iphone 4s in
terms of capability the larger point is
that these phones are now so powerful
that they can effectively replace
computers for most people for
ninety-nine percent of things that most
people do on computer spreadsheet
surfing the webs and the emails creating
Word documents all these things you can
do now on these portable devices so I
think in the next few years you're going
to see more and more people are going to
be coming out with phones that are your
main computer so you may have a phone
you put into a docking station which has
a keyboard and connected to a monitor of
some sort and there's knows you're and
there's your computer maybe you have an
external hard drive a little tiny little
thing for storage or something or you
may just use the the cloud iCloud or
Amazon or Google has a cloud as well so
I think that's where it's going so if
computing is going that direction you
see where flash is going and people may
be saying well I don't think computers
going to go in that direction what about
3d what about heavy-duty image
manipulation true for those type of
things some professionals a very small
group of people will still want to have
very powerful desktop computers but even
now desktop computer sales are dropping
quite a bit they're actually below now
laptop sales and I think netbooks for
instance which are those little tiny
laptops they're even getting killed by
the tablet pc market whether it be ipads
or
android devices or whatnot so that's the
future and as a web designer or web
developer you always have to be mindful
of wherever market is going so right now
I would not be investing in flash it's
done wait for us a killer sites the
killer a video store we are no longer
producing flash based training videos
because I know it's done and I've seen
this many times before I've been in the
web game and the programming game since
1994 well 94 is when I built my first
website and I can tell you from
experience that technologies come and go
and people are sort of married to a
particular technology though nope no
claw and scream and belly ache and cry
like babies about how this great
technology why is it going away it's so
cool but you have to sort of be nimble
as a professional in this game and
understand that things change and you
got to go where the moment where the
momentum is and not get stuck in
dead-end technology there's many dead
end technologies out there Delphi which
is a great language for today finish
classic asp which is microsoft's first
interim venture into dynamic page
technology classic asp kind of resembles
old-school PHP and it had its day but
it's finished and flash looks like it's
one of these technologies that's going
away and if you don't want to be stuck
there now I'm not saying it's going to
disappear overnight it's going to take
time but over the next couple years I
think you're going to see flash
disappear especially when Adobe the
makers are sir banding our abandoning
flash for a mobile platform which I
think he is the future of computing and
the web it's all going to be integrated
so there you go you don't want to touch
flash now in terms of my men chose going
to talk briefly about mobile about iOS
Android and the blackberry playbook OS
now now forget about the blackberry
it's a great operating system rim you
know I have the playbook it's great it's
one of those it's it's right up there I
think it's even better than the other
two insert from a nerds point of view
but unless blackberry gets their act
together I would be looking at that
right now what you're going to concern
yourself with is of course iOS which is
for Apple iPads and iPhones and Android
but in fact Android is going to become
more important very quickly it already
is surpassing Apple in terms of sales so
by quite a bit so you're going to see a
lot more Android devices out there in
the next couple years and you will Apple
devices that's clear in fact samsung
just one company if it produces handsets
and tablets for Android they're just
them alone or beating apple now for a
first time so in terms of sale so again
looking forward as a web developer web
designer you got to think android/ios
you gotta think mobile and there you go
so and you got to forget about flash so
the difficulty with dealing for Android
and iOS is that in terms of the core
programming languages better use develop
applications for these two operating
systems Apple's iOS uses objective c
which is kind of looks like you know C++
and Java schools you know it's a
sea-based language so and it's a little
bit hardcore if you're a programmer in
those a bit of javascript and PHP might
be a little hard to approach and on the
Android side they use Java my old fav
back in the day fav language again do
you have the same thing as objective c a
little bit more hardcore so it might be
difficult for some people learn it but
fortunately well i'm going to back up a
step
the other problems if you develop
something in iOS of with Objective C
then you have to develop something else
the same thing in Java for the Android
guys so let's see them now there might
be programs out there that will
translate them back and forth it's not
already if they're not already out there
they will be out there soon another
option which could satisfy most people's
requirements in terms of building
applications for iOS or Android is to
use html5 and css3 you see these are
universal now run on both platforms very
well and you'll be able to do just about
everything you need to do for most
people you building applications html5
and css3 this we have to explore here at
kill sites a little bit more thoroughly
of those consult talking with my bros
and doing a heck of a lot of development
for both platforms and I'm gonna have
more details about that going forward
again all very practical for now though
if you're mindful guys you're looking
what's the future you got to learn html5
and css3 there's no question that is
guaranteed you got to know so if you're
wondering where to go next that's where
you might want to go if you're a flash
guy and you're crying now and you're
what you don't cry things move on don't
worry about it you can take what you've
learned working with flash and apply
that knowledge to html5 and css3 and
many other things you got to learn to be
language or platform agnostic platform
can be like you know flash vs html5 or
so iOS versus Android there are nuances
between the different platforms and
different there's differences between
the different languages there's also a
lot of common ground because they're all
based on the same things so don't don't
cry over spilled milk now you know all
that flash knowledge you may
have a certain percentage of it a good
percentage of it can be transferred over
into html5 css3 etc as I did with my
java background i learned java first i
was did a lot of java work before i even
looked at PHP and then i was able to
move into PHP really easily because of
my java background amongst other things
so it's all good it's open again you
know I think the broader lesson here is
be a language agnostic you know meaning
don't be married to any particular
technology or language just use what's
best given the job at hand that's it i
hope you find these video blogs useful
I've been a little slack of us as of
late because I've been busy with some
other stuff and one of the things is a
whole brand new thing we're developing a
killer sites for for learning which i
think is pretty is pretty interesting
things cutting-edge make it even easier
to learn this stuff and a lot more fun
too so ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
