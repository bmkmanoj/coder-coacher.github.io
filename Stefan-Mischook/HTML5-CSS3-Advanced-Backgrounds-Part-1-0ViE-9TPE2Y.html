calm and in this video what I'm going to
do is essentially bring together a lot
of the examples that we've been looking
at and try and make a very simple piece
that will it's going to essentially be a
hero now a hero in marketing terms is
this banner image with usually a couple
different options at the bottom it's you
know like an interactive banner on a
website so we're going to build that
we're going to strip out a lot of the
kind of content stuff that we've done in
the other videos and focus exclusively
on how we can use some advanced CSS
effects to generate something that looks
pretty good and then from there we're
going to take that into the realm of
video so let's get started so what
you're seeing right now is a very simple
well is actually the video or it's
actually the the page that we did in the
last video and so what I'm going to do
is start off by actually stripping out a
lot of the content that we did in the
last video so I'm going to get rid of
the footer and I'm going to get rid of
the whole container section hit save
refresh this page and now we're just
getting the acne website the tagline in
fact I'm even going to take that out so
that all that will remain in we're going
to also get rid of these fonts so all
we're going to have is essentially this
top navigation that we've put together
in the last video now with just that in
place we're going to build out our hero
and you'll see very quickly what I mean
when I say a hero so it's going to be a
section and inside I'm going to have
this is going to be for a car website so
I'm just going to say class will call it
car
h1 another car website or another car
site and then we'll have another nav tag
inside here and it'll be the same sort
of thing except we're going to have an
unordered list with some options
and that's it so some very simple markup
basically if i go back here and i
refresh this page you're just going to
see another car site and then you're
going to see another a nav that looks
identical to the one on top and that's
it so now let's actually get into the
meat of it which is going to be styling
this this guy so we like our nav on top
I don't think we're going to change much
of that that looks fine but now we're
going to focus on this hero section so
first thing I'm going to do is actually
i'll add a class here calling it hero
and we're going to take out a lot we're
going to use the Annabelle script so I'm
going to keep that but anything related
to the articles anything related to a
side and by the way this is a huge
advantage of making sure that you indent
your your CSS because then it's very
easy for you to figure out what needs to
what belongs to what exactly so now we
have this header section again I can
delete that but we do still have a nav
so I want to make sure that that is
respected open that up delete that go
back refresh I think should change and
that's good so now we've got only the
CSS relevant to this current page now
let's start styling it so in section so
here in section hero I'm going to
specify width let's say I don't know
let's say 800 pixels a height of 300
pixels want to make it center want to
make sure its display block
add a top margin of 30 pixels I'm going
to add a background to it you've seen me
do this so many times now so basically
we're adding a gradient it's going to
start in the center bottom so it's going
to start on the bottom and we're going
to start with a dark blue at zero
percent and we're going to go to a
lighter blue more of a purple actually
because there's going to be equal
amounts for almost equal amounts of blue
and purple hit save let's see what
happens already we're getting something
a little nicer so we've got this
gradient happening and we've got another
car site I'm also going to add a border
radius so now we're getting some rounded
corners which is kind of nice and now i
want to start playing with the actual
font heading so again we're going to use
the you know the knowledge that we
gained in the last tutorial where we
were dealing with fonts and our font
face section which I seem to have lost
my at font-face i'm going to add that
back at font-face there we go so in
Section hero that's fine and now we're
going to go section dot hero h1 and we
want to style this with the font family
of annabelle script
and if the person doesn't have Annabelle
script for whatever reason then we'll
just default to Ariel and saw serif and
we'll set really high font size and a
color of white all right okay so far so
good I'm going to make it italic this is
also to show you that even though you've
embedded a special font you can still
treat it like any other font you can
make it italic you can make it bold you
can do whatever you need to do with it
and then I'm just going to add some
padding all around all right very good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
