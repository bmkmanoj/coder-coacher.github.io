topic when I buy into cryptocurrencies
now I'm recording this in December 2017
bitcoins making all-time highs my
Bitcoin horde because I was gonna buy
Bitcoin many years ago at four cents
apiece and it'd be worth like a hundred
and twenty million today so I never
purchased him because it was so blade
difficult I dropped it up you know three
quarters for the process big mistake but
so let's look at the Queen and all the
other cryptocurrencies today and would
you get into this would you get into
this game so what do I mean but by
getting into the game well there's
different ways you can look at the
cryptocurrency business you can look at
it as a way to just try to catch capture
some of that that rising market now let
me put out something I believe that
these cryptocurrencies in of themselves
are only worth anything because people
think they are going up in value but
it's the definition of an asset bubble
does that mean that cryptocurrency the
technology behind it is terrible no not
at all I think there's something to it
perhaps I honestly have not looked at it
from me programmers point of view I
haven't looked at the the merits of the
of whether it be - coin or Bitcoin or
like coin or whatever the theorem it's
interesting a space I see it not going
away but like the dot-com bubble I was I
was right around I was right in the
thick of it in those days the internet
was this growing thing right there with
the dot-com all these dot-com companies
most of these dot-com companies have not
survived most of god bankrupt God
disappeared but the web and the
Internet's is huge of course so will
cryptocurrencies and that technology be
somewhere in 5-10 years definitely in
some form or another I'm not sure where
but it will be I think it's an
interesting tech I don't know if we'll
become as big as the web maybe will or
maybe
the protocols and the underlying
technology be utilized by big financial
institutions in some way so it's going
to be important in some way does that
mean I think these coins are all gonna
be worth a lot of money no I think that
the vast majority probably 99% of them
are going to go nowhere in some period
at some point now will that take six
months six days six years I don't know I
don't know when I was trying to buy
Bitcoin when it just came out it was
like four cents a coin I was trying to
buy but I figured it would go up in
value because of the way these type of
things go assets assets these type of
markets go about where you see it all
the time yeah look up tulip mania on
Wikipedia and you see what this is look
at housing prices right I always ask
myself why would somebody pay twice the
price for a house that it cost to build
a brand-new house right it doesn't make
any sense now you can argue about
location maybe but and houses went up in
value they're crazy and I was talking
about how these these houses way
overvalued 2007 people thought I was
crazy and then they crashed
you know they've come back quite a bit
but I didn't go crash again because at
the end of the day houses are consumable
items like cars they they wear down they
break down the older the house the more
repairs cost more money to maintain but
again as the housing market illustrates
they can keep going up and up as long as
there's buyers and I made the crypto
currencies in the same situation
although at least with the house you can
live in it so we'll see how it goes now
that being said I am now investigating
crypto currencies friend of mine My
partner and I and another business where
he's got a theory and miners he built
and we're getting into other stuff and
we're looking at it more deeply because
as nerd programmers as technologists
it's just something worth looking into
who knows what business opportunities
this whole space will bring about now
most people are just thinking about
buying coins or mining coins but there's
much more to it than that if you think
about it there are business applications
I think a lot of people were going to
make big
money are the people who get into
cripples in terms of looking at how to
get into the whole crypto business I
don't know whether it be exchanges
whether it be apps support kryptos I
don't know you have to look at that so
it's a it's a it's a fun space and I
have to tell you from my experience as a
developer going back to 90s it reminds
me of the dot-com era back in like 93 94
I have to tell you when I was well 95 I
remember people would approach me and
say what is this web thing they didn't
know what it was or in 96 97 when I
started developing full-time sites for
other companies not just my own it I
would approach prospective clients the
company and I would say hey yourself a
website and they said to me sometimes
what's the website and other times they
said to me that is internet think it's
going nowhere
it's going nowhere even Bill Gates
famously thought that the internet was
just some sort of short-term hype hype
bubble and so this cryptocurrency thing
reminds me of that time in terms of in
terms of what's going on now before you
get super excited about getting to
Kryptos understand most of the dot-com
websites and businesses the vast
majority went bankrupt they don't exist
anymore only a handful are left over
right
think about Yahoo Google well Google
came after that really few others just a
handful but so many went bankrupt
because when you got a new market coming
about like the crypto market like the
web market like AI cetera we're still
trying to figure out how this is gonna
play out how it's gonna work if you look
at like the car industry back in the day
Tour like I think there's a couple
hundred car manufacturers when
automobile technology start coming
around there's all kinds of crazy
designs that people tried before what we
have now was established the four wheels
a steering wheel
has to break etc so understand that
we're at that stage now with the
cryptocurrency space in that it's a Wild
West we don't know what's gonna work
what's not gonna work right so
understand if you do get into gambling
in cryptocurrencies whether it be
Bitcoin theory and litecoin
etc etc etc etc understand that this is
a very risky volatile situation you
could make a lot of money but you can
get killed as well so and in the dot-com
era I know a lot of people who were rich
one day and literally within a week were
flat broke I know these people
personally I know people will work
millions and millions of dollars
investment and they were invested in
very solid companies solid companies and
they got out there are millions of
dollars worth of stock went to like 500
bucks and that's when they sold out so
this is where if you're investing in
crypto currencies this is where basic
investment strategies that are tried and
tested diversification etc etc etc
allocation of assets this is where it's
smart now you never know I don't have a
crystal ball but I'm putting this
information out there so what you guys
do what you will with it it's born out
of experience not not only my own but
other people's as well that's it for now
