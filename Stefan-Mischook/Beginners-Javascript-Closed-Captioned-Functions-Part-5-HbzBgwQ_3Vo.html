code and we're gonna learn a little bit
more about functions we're gonna get
deeper into functions and well what
we're gonna cover is I have some notes
here we're going to learn about creating
our own custom functions we're going to
learn how functions hold code in stasis
until we activate it and that the
process of activating a function if you
will is called calling functions we're
gonna many it's it's it sounds more
complex than it really is
we're gonna look at function returns and
how to pass data from one function to
another basically passing data has to do
with function arguments I think we've
we've looked at that in the past so
we're going to learn how to do this with
our own custom functions and we're going
to get a better idea of what it's all
about really and finally we're gonna
look at variables and functions scope
this is something we have not discussed
before and it's it's kind of important
to understand along the way we'll
probably learn a few more things and
yeah so break out your text editor and
get ready to write some JavaScript code
so we are looking at our very familiar
script here I think I think we did this
in the arrays videos anyhow so we've
seen this before and these source files
of course are included in the source
files directory if you're looking for it
so the first thing I want to teach you
is the idea of separating your
JavaScript code from your body code the
body code meaning the code in between
the body and the body tags at the bottom
of the page here let me just get that
interview so the idea here is to you
want to remove and separate your
JavaScript from your main body code so
I'm just gonna copy that out and you
want to put it in the head here
there you go and the reason you want to
do this it's always just a good idea to
keep your JavaScript outside of the main
action here in the body this is a lot
like CSS where you don't want to have
your JavaScript code in the body of your
web page and like CSS you can insert it
up here in between your head tags or you
can actually link to an external
javascript file just like you would
explain to an external CSS document I'm
gonna show you how to do that later on
but for now just keep that in mind you
want to keep your JavaScript code as
much as possible separate from your HTML
code that you see in the body here
so the first thing we're gonna do we're
gonna create a custom function for
ourself and that's that's pretty easy so
I'm just gonna take this I'm gonna
indent it a little bit make it cleaner
I'm gonna just write the word function
I'm gonna give it a name I want to call
it products array all right you know
I'll give it a better name
I'll call protocol list it's a little
bit more user-friendly so you got the
two round rackets and we got the curly
so I'm gonna take the Curly's just like
in his statement or a loop take one put
on the bottom here so this curly brace
and this curly brace demarks the
beginning in the end of this particular
function and the function packages up
all this javascript code and one neat
package so now we could use this code
over and over again by simply calling
this function so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to show you how to call
functions but before we do that let me
just save that let me load up the page
now here is our page load it up pre pre
functionalizing it so what I mean by
functionalizing is sticking it in a
function this is our code if you loaded
up the page it would immediately print
up the array right because when you have
this code floating around this for loop
printed up whatever was in this array
when we got it here but by sticking it
in a function now now that it's in a
function this code will not be activated
will not be fired off by the web browser
until we specifically say run this
function product underscore list
so now let's look at the code as it is
now where the function is not being
called but we've encapsulated we've
wrapped up all this code inside the
function see what happens well what's
gonna happen what we should see what
happens we won't see anything printed
here so let's just load this up and of
course nothing is printed right because
the function now basically posed all
this code here out of the game it will
not be fired off by the browser until we
actually tell it to run this function so
how do we do about how we run this
function one of the easy ways is to use
an event handler so let's do that so on
the title I'm going to create a new new
tag here I'm gonna put an h3 and
complete that and I say show list so
this is our cheap little button so I'm
gonna show list and then we're gonna go
good like this so we're gonna do it at
our event however so I'm gonna go on
click we've seen this before and I'm
gonna say product list so that's our
name of our function right product list
so this basically tells us when we click
on this show list text this tag run the
product underscore list function so
let's take a look at that so let me
reload the page show list let's click it
and here we go you see how it works our
array is printed out so do it again bang
so there you go here's a simple example
where we've taken our code we've wrapped
it in a custom function I just gave the
name product list like cult whatever you
want and behavior that you should
understand from this is that once your
code is wrapped inside of a function as
we did here the code will no longer run
automatically as it did before
it has to be called explicitly by us we
have to say eight run this particular
function
so now you see what I was talking about
when I said that right here when I said
that functions whole code in stasis
until we activated and we activated by
calling a function calling a function
was like doing what we did here with the
onclick we called the product list
function you can think of it as calling
as you know calling somebody over it's
you know nerds when they've put together
programming languages and so forth they
they use they come up with these terms
and for whatever reasons so I'm just
trying to help you understand why they
use certain terms like why did they say
call a function as opposed to activate I
don't know but you know what calling
function is now you understand the
stasis idea of code until it's called if
you have it in a function and you
understand when we took this out of a
function we went like this
now the code is is sitting there but
reload the page it will print it out
right away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
