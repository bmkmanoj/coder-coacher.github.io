comment was made on YouTube just now
about my previous vlog where I was
talking about successful freelancers and
what separated successful freelancers
and the guy mentioned the story about
someone who talked about how they
started developing sites in two thousand
early 2000 2002 using flash HTML PHP and
now they can't find any work they used
to make eight to ten thousand bucks a
month now that now they don't make any
money I don't know that personal that
person's individual case I don't know
what type of PHP work they were doing
what type of web work what they were
doing but they were complaining about
how templates the arrival of templates
and the arrival of smartphones or the
iphone started changing the entire game
made it very difficult for him to make a
living now here's the thing you have to
understand as a coder as a professional
developer you have to consider the fact
that technologies will change and the
demands in the marketplace will change
accordingly now the change you see the
major shifts every five to six five to
seven years something like that so now
the demand is really big time in mobile
application development you see a huge
rise in demand for JavaScript coders and
there's still that's very strong demand
for PHP app developers now the PHP work
that you used to do in the year 2000 or
90s is not the type of PHP work that
gets jobs these days these days you have
to even know wordpress joomla joomla you
have to be willing to work with
templates and if you want to get into
full app development you have to learn a
framework like symphony like laravel
something like that so the old days of
being a PHP hacker doing simple PHP
scripts those are pretty much gone so
you have to consider the change in the
technology now I was reluctant to
mention Beast
because I don't want you to get caught
up in the specifics the whole key of all
this is to recognize that you have to be
nimble as a developer you have to look
at the trends where is going so right
now it is jas right it is Jas now that
said there's still a heck of a lot of
jobs for C sharp developers or Java
developers and for PHP WordPress Joomla
guys that kind of thing so keep that in
mind Python people there's a lot of work
in that so yes the old days of designing
sites from scratch or HTML and CSS and
using flash of course / is dead are gone
those days are very difficult now
because everybody's using templates and
you should be too you should start off
your work from templates and guess what
developers regardless of the language
whether it be Java Python Swift PHP
everybody is using the essentially with
it templates essentially templates when
you are using a framework you are using
a template essentially when you're using
a javascript library like jquery you're
using a template essentially right
you're using a bunch of packaged code
that speeds up the process when you're
using bootstrap you're using essentially
a template so yes what we did back 10
years ago 15 years ago those skills are
not nearly as valuable or not valuable
at all today just like being an expert
typewriter repair guy repairing
typewriters is not a very lucrative
position today that's the nature of
technology especially now we're moving
more and more quickly in technology this
is the nature of because we have
computers and because we work much more
quickly technology evolves more quickly
as a result so you have to be a little
bit more nimble than normal you have to
expect to need to adapt with the times
that's why I keep emphasizing and all my
courses the basics because if you learn
the basics of the languages
then and the basic best working
practices in terms of coding the best
practices in terms of app development
have talked about this in other videos
these skills transcend all languages all
technologies and they carry forward the
basic principles that I talked about
today I learned 15-20 years ago in my
java days and they still 100 sent apply
today and they're still valuable today
so that's why I always emphasize learn
your basics that said you have to be
doing work in technologies that are in
demand today so keep that in mind you
can't be working in flash for instance
or 1990 style PHP and expect to get work
and chances are today unless you're
super special designer with incredible
skills the chance of you getting jobs
really developing websites from scratch
these days is over so you go to
templates yeah you don't make five
thousand dollars a job or three thousand
dollar job a job maybe make a thousand
dollars a job but you do the job in a
fraction of the time because you're
leveraging the templates because you're
leveraging the frameworks so yeah the
job changes things change with time and
you have to adapt but that's the case
with most professions these days just in
each of our times I hope that helps bye
