I'm going to tell you a little story
about how through pure laziness cost me
literally twelve million dollars and I'm
not kidding
so this takes us back way back about
eight years ago something like that 78
years ago my I may be off by a year so
and I was involved with market trading
as in the stock market commodities
market and so forth I was doing that
quite a bit if a good friend of mine
double bowls Dean doubles Dean if you
know anything about investing you know
what I mean by double bowls he was a a
guy involved in highly speculative
investments if you will
speculative is a wall street term that
means gamble and let me just say for the
record a lot of the stock market is just
pure gambling it doesn't have as much to
do with investment just say that said so
around that time something called
Bitcoin came to our attention Bitcoin so
my my buddy a double bulls and I we
decided what we're going to put a small
little little taste into Bitcoin just as
as as a speculation a long-term GAAP way
I would try it out see what happens you
never know with these things so we were
just going to put about five hundred
each into it very tiny thing maybe a
little bit more you know but everything
about five hundred so we started doing
it go getting into it at the time though
to buy and sell Bitcoin was a real pain
it was a very it was a big pain it
wasn't easy like buying stocks and
commodities that's for sure
so long story short at the time bitcoins
were about five cents apiece something
like that and we were going to put in
about a thousand dollars or more into
Bitcoin and then this forget about it so
just to put in perspective what we
didn't do it because it was such a pain
to do it I Ridge Asaf again
trouble and was literally pure laziness
pure laziness now just to put in
perspective bitcoins today are around
fourteen fifteen hundred dollars so if
you do the math you see where I cost me
about twelve million dollars to do not
buy the Bitcoin but here's the thing
though a little investment in tippier
now what are the chances I would have
held a Bitcoin from five cents apiece to
about fourteen fifteen hundred dollars a
piece
till today the chances of that happening
realistically are very low very long to
have that kind of discipline very
difficult so how do you maximize the
potential of you fulfilling the
long-term goal of your investments that
was a long way of saying how do you stay
in investments that are pushing you to
sell motional II whether because they've
gone up a lot or whether because you're
tanking a lot they're going down key is
is high diversification lots of
diversification you want to not stay in
a particular position you don't want to
have too much money rather concentrated
in a particular investment and that was
the single biggest mistake I think I
made during the 2008-2009 financial
crisis I had seen that coming and I was
getting ready to do it but I would put
way too much of my investing money into
a particular stock or a particular trade
and as a result of that when it would
move up or down few points a few points
a few percentages rather it would get me
very excited or very nervous I would
sell too early a lot of the times all
the time and if I would have just put a
small trone's a small slice of my
investment money into each position over
time it would have been far more
profitable for me in the end because I
wouldn't have been scared out of
greeted out of my positions if you will
and would have held them much longer to
let my thesis let my original idea play
out and about 80% of the time 90% of
times they did play out but I didn't
take full advantage of it so I'll give
you an example Apple stock I knew Apple
was about $50 a share that it would grow
this huge company and I knew that
because everybody is switching over
buying Mac's for the first time back in
the day when when Apple switched from
the PowerPC to the x86 Intel pcs I knew
all of a sudden that that was it
this thing was going to go now and I
bought Apple stock and I get really well
with it but because I was too
concentrated in it I instead of me I
made like 60 70 percent of my money and
six seven months or something like that
but if I had been much more diversified
and held Apple to today it split I think
a couple of times so you know the $50
purchase you know at that time today
it's worth equal to maybe 700 800 so
instead of doing 67 I was it 10 times my
money or more actually so you get the
idea so that's enough with investment
investing tips it's all related back to
business by the way you think about the
laziness about the diversification it
relates back to other business lessons I
hope you don't mind going I'm going off
code here because a lot of people want
to become freelance developers so
understanding basic business thinking is
very useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
