2008 teen now you know I'm having a bad
hair day and that's why I'm doing a
screencast vlog so I got a question
recently from this enterprising young
dude out of Canada my home country so
I'm gonna read a couple of the quotes
here which are highlighted and I'm gonna
get into it I've been following your
videos over the past month I love the
stuff you put out you've also inspired
me to get into web development thanks I
really like any of those type of emails
by the way it's great it's good to know
that I'm helping people out and if
people appreciate for work so he goes on
I've made a few WordPress sites WPA
short for WordPress with commercial
themes and also some small client sites
with site builders we all know them Wix
and so on now I know there are
drag-and-drop site builders Wix and so
on that are super easy to create no code
need in fact I did a website for family
members who I was a cleaning business
she went from having a basic terrible
looking WordPress site which she paid a
lot of money to have done by an agency
so I decided to whip out a nice-looking
site with a site builder it turned out
nicely and quickly done so here's a good
question with the rise in popularity of
those drag and drop builders especially
for smaller businesses do you think
getting to WordPress development WP
short for WordPress will be viable and
worth getting into will there still be a
demand in the near future short answer
is yes because the dragon drop site
builders they do feel particular niche
no question but what you're gonna see is
a lot of companies are gonna quickly
outgrow them and they're gonna need
something more serious they're gonna
need something custom so just in terms
of the design itself they're gonna
quickly see that using the drag and drop
tools they look good but they're gonna
look very template II you know they are
templates so they're gonna want a little
customization you have to understand
something as a web professional whether
your web designer a wordpress
professional whether your web developer
etc etc the game the role the work that
you do
we'll slowly change over time this is
nothing new I've been doing this since
the 1990s in 1990 the way we design
websites was totally different and our
roles our specific task was very
different back then
versus the year 2001 and versus today
it's an evolving field it's an evolving
career where we have better and better
tools so instead of having to do the
bare-bones minimum type of stuff back in
the 90s today we have a lot of tools
that allows us to produce much better
more advanced web sites and web apps
then we did back in the 90s simply
because the tools are there that's cool
that's cool so yes the roles do change
it reminds me of an old story back in
the 90s when I first learned how to code
a friend of mine was a coding
professionals while it wasn't really a
developer but he knew code and he was we
called them webmasters so he knew a bit
about creating websites but he knew
about servers knew about this I knew
about that it was a term that we used
back in the day the webmaster so he
stepped away from the whole web design
and the whole web world for a few years
in I believe in 98 he stepped away and
he came back about 2001 and - and he was
flabbergasted at how flabbergasted means
he was astounded amazed at how much web
design had changed just in like that
four year period it was a dramatic
change when we went from table base
design practices to CSS based design
practices amongst other things so today
in 2017 in 18 we see that again we see a
shift from design only web professionals
to a blended type of professional where
you have front-end design skills but you
have to understand a bit about usability
which is UX you have to understand UI
you have to understand how the structure
the web works if you will how Google
works how social networking plays into
all this and when you put yourself out
there as a web design or development
professional you come into it with a
broader range of skills a different set
of skills that you would have needed in
2002 it's cool it's cool so for instance
I listed my little article here one of
the things you would get into oh it's
not not new but the way you would do it
is new setting up ecommerce setting up
ecommerce now it's still a job and the
average Joe will not be able to do it
but it's much easier today than it was
just ten years ago setting up a social
strategy for your clients so they
probably have a Facebook but getting
hooked up to Facebook and Instagram and
Twitter when it's smart to use one or
the other and integrating that with
their site the templates don't do that
job the builders don't do this type of
thing setting up a content marketing
strategy you know again educating your
clients in terms of content marketing
setting up perhaps a blog situation or
WordPress where they can put out
articles a regular basis and showing
them how this workflow how to integrate
this with their social strategy as well
so you see a web professional has a
different set of skills that that they
have to have when they come to the table
it's not just design good-looking site
sketch it up in Photoshop and Bob's your
uncle I'm out of here there's much more
involved it's not more work for you it's
just different work it's actually more
fun in my opinion because you get to put
your hands into different areas get a
little bit into e-commerce a little
social a little content marketing and of
course you've got the custom design so
people who don't want that template ish
look but you get so often with these
site builders this is what you can do to
bring to bring more to the whole
equation there's a big part of it your
web professional you're not just a web
designer you're a web professional so
you will advise them okay this is where
we want to use WordPress
or maybe you don't want to go maybe some
some vacations you might want to get
into Drupal or Joomla these are other
content management systems although most
of time you can be just using WordPress
if your clients are going to be thinking
about a content marketing strategy which
they should because if you're not you're
not gonna get much traction out there so
there you go
yes there's a huge opportunity I know
people have WordPress sites business
owners and they're dying to find a
decent wordpress developer to keep it up
to date and to make changes and so forth
and they're aware of all the the website
builders and so on but they're not
interested because they got real
businesses and they don't want to look
like somebody who just started up their
company two days ago right they want
that professionalism</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
