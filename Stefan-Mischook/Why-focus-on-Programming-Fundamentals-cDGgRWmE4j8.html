I keep trying to emphasize in all my
videos is that if you want to progress
as a developer you shouldn't get so
caught up in the individual languages or
the individual frameworks or libraries
yes they're important and you got to
pick the right ones given the right job
but really what separates good
developers from not-so-good developers
is that good developers have a firm
understanding of core principles and
techniques of programming that is the
key because what you're gonna see when
you get into programming as a
professional you're not going to be
necessarily stuck on one language or
just using one language chances are
likely you're going to find yourself
hopping around into different languages
different frameworks different libraries
like somebody said in one of the
comments when your programmer you have
to change languages like you change
t-shirts that's just the nature of the
game in my personal career as a
developer I've written commercial apps
where I've been paid or made money with
apps in nine different languages nine
different languages and that wasn't
necessarily at a choice not like they
went out there so I want to learn nine
different languages no it was just that
particular jobs will come up particular
circumstances will come up and you know
was bang I'm writing in new language now
here's the thing once you have a core
understanding of the fundamentals a good
grasp of those key basics and good
working practices to learn a new
language is not that difficult the
challenge actually if you're new to this
whole thing the challenge is learning
that very first programming language
that's the hard part and once you get
past that the next big challenge of
course is building your first few
programs your first few apps once you've
done a few maybe three or four you have
under your belt you're going to start
feeling pretty confident about the
coding that you do that is for sure so
please try to keep that in mind
don't become a a language zealot or a
framework zealot react.js is the past
everything else sucks or Java J's peas
are the best everything else sucks
kind of old that's my point that's kind
of old things change technologies
progress different demands required
different needs like there's once upon a
time when ruby was one of the star
languages Ruby Ruby rails was such an
important framework in the web
development ecosystem and now it's still
round but it's really in all honestly
its its star has faded I just use Ruby
as an example because I really want to
pick on and trigger the Ruby and rails
programmers I'm just kidding I only use
it as an example because it's a recent
example there are many other examples of
technologies that once had a very
important position in the world and fell
away Flash is another one flash and a
SaaS script ActionScript was very very
important at one point but it died
2010-11 something like that these things
do occur so if you learn to be language
neutral you're not a programmer you're
not a Python program you're not in DOJ's
programmer or developer you're not a
Java developer no you're just a
developer who happens to know Jeb who
happens to know JavaScript and note who
happens to know Python etc etc now
you've seen my other videos you know
what I think is a good choice in terms
of programming languages at this time in
2018 things will change but again what
doesn't change is understanding those
fundamentals you work on that everything
else comes easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
