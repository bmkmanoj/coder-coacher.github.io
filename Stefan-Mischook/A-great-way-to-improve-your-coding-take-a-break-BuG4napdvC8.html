code it's ironic given that I got the
cold in sunny California I made a
mistake i went and visited some friends
and just before I went over to visit
them he told me that he was just getting
over a cold to sort of virus he had for
eight nine days and if I was more on the
ball i would have said sorry buddy i
can't visit you because when somebody is
coming off a code they're like a
bacterial factory actually a virus
factory and it's highly probable that
you catch it from them now you can wash
your hands a lot to help protect against
that don't shake their hands but even
then you're in if you're in an
environment around them highly probable
that you're going to get infected which
I did so when I got back to my shell the
second day I got infected it all came
out so my voice is weak very very tired
achy and pains but i figured i do a vlog
now getting a virus aside it's a good
idea to step away from your work for a
little bit and just turn off turn the
key off on your nerd activity it's good
to step away from coding or programming
and development and do something that's
the opposite what would it be just
relaxing on the beach they did or
whether it playing sports whatnot it's
really good to do that so i would
suggest that you really do that you know
I'm you know unless you're on a real
roll and you're hyper productive in
terms of your coding but even then it's
good to step away give your mind rest
give your body a rest
and you'll see that it will pay off in
dividends down the road now this isn't
just not something exclusive to coating
it comes to anything really especially
to content so let me give you the
example when I used to Train quite a bit
in martial arts and various fighting
styles I deliver a time and time again
where somebody would get injured in
class and have to take a few weeks off
and myself and then they would come back
you figure they'd be rusty and out of
shape and ironically they would perform
amazingly well they would do so well so
well and wow you're really doing well
and they and they all thought and what
happened to me on more than one occasion
you don't think LA but she's were rusty
we have been training much you know it's
not going to be good at first but
actually is much better because a big
part of training is to give your body
and your minor rest to sort of heal
itself and simulate knowledge that you
picked up previously and in fact many
years ago when I trained with the
elliptic wrestling team in Canada now I
wasn't part of the Olympic team I was
just training with these guys a couple
days a week in college and as a sideline
for my me more short any help and i
remember that journey on the season when
they were actually quite a competition
the coach would have the wrestlers train
less they would train less and it would
do more variety of training rather than
just pure wrestling and the reason for
this they want to have they wanted to
have rested bodies and rested minds when
we went into a competition when it was
offseason they were trained really hard
to make games so it same can be applied
to whether you're setting up your
business or letting your business
whether you're learning too cold or your
active developer it's good to take time
step away from a day or two
to rest up your mind in your body and
what you'll fly is when you come back
you can be far more productive you're
going to come up with new ideas and
fresh perspective you hadn't considered
before you don't want to drain yourself
and you don't want to burn yourself out
something I've done in the past anyway
that being said I gotta go get some tea
I feel would do well catch hell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
