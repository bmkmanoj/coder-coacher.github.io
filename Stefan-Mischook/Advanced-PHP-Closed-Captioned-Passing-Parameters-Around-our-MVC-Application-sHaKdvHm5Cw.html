calm and today what we're doing is we're
looking at how we can write a very
simple MVC framework from scratch using
PHP 5.3 and so I'm kind of going out of
my way to show you all the neat new
features in PHP 5.3 and soon to be PHP 6
so over the last couple videos we've
looked at how we can create anonymous
functions you'll notice that we're
dealing with namespaces at the top we've
also looked at how we can create
inheritance structures and implement
interfaces all of this stuff which has
to do more with object-oriented
programming in general and in the last
video we looked at how we could
basically create a forum and post the
results back to the controller so i have
this default PHP file which is currently
sitting in killer PHP calm killer PHP
views and it's sitting in the index
default the index folder so in views
we've got index and we've got test test
is from an earlier video when we were
dealing with an index controller and a
test controller and seeing the
differences but in the index controller
we've got default PHP which is a form
and then we've got learn PHP which is
another action and then we've got
welcome PHP which is the welcome page
that we were playing with so these were
just some simple examples of the
controller architecture now we're going
to be looking at how we can save the
data in the model using the simplest
form of persistence in PHP which would
be session so session variables are
variables that are stored on the server
and they're done so by setting a key or
a cookie on the user's browser so what
happens is you go to the website and a
cookie a tiny little text file is stored
on the user's computer and that you tiny
little text file has a very very long
and
key and that long and encrypted key
corresponds with a long and encrypted
key on the server and using that long
and encrypted key the server and the
browser the user running the browser are
able to pair up and any data that is
stored in the session variables is made
accessible to that user so that's kind
of quickly how that works what we're
going to do is we're going to rely on
this as a way of carrying data over from
one stage or 11 page to another page and
I'll show you what I mean so if I go
back to my index controller here you can
see that I've got this default action
and it's basically just bar dumping the
request so I go back here and I say
hello and world and my address and I
submit this query then I'm going to get
hello and world and my address now what
if because we're at the default action
what if I wanted to check to see if a
particular user has already put in their
name and their address well the first
thing we need to do is we need to start
up the session variable and to do that
we need to go back to our index PHP file
and the index dot PHP file is acting as
our as our boot strap in for all
intensive purposes at least in this
project so we are bootstrapping our
application where we're starting it up
we're firing it up in the index.php file
so right after we specify the name space
I'm going to put in session underscores
start and what this will do is this will
start the session variables up for our
application now if we weren't doing this
with an MVC application or if we hadn't
written this MVC architecture that every
single entry point into our application
whether was the index.php file or any
other PHP file that somebody wanted to
directly access we'd have to put in
session start so already because we have
this idea of a dispatcher and all
requests are being run through
index dot PHP we only need to declare
this once so with sessions start
declared we can start using session
variables what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go back to the index controller
and I'm going to check to see if
somebody has posted back with a first
name in the last name so I'm going to
say if request first name if this is set
and the last name is set then we want to
do something a little different we want
to go to the session variable and say
current user is equal to and here we're
going to create a new com killer PHP
models user with these parameters so
with current user set on my welcome page
instead of just creating this new random
user I'm going to say that this user
variable is actually going to equal
whatever is in session or current user
and if the current user is not there
then we're going to change the view of
it so I'm going to say that there's a
new parameter in the Welcome action
called user exists and it will equal
whatever is set session current user is
so this will be you know a true or false
statement
now if the user doesn't exist we're
going to have to show something
different right so if I go back to my
welcome action and I say index / welcome
I'm going to get a syntax error so let's
see what did I screw up okay yes so I
need another parenthesis there to close
the if statement so if i refresh this
it'll say call to a member function
render with on a non-object right
because render width can only work if
the user exists if the user doesn't
exist then the model hasn't been created
up here and if the model hasn't been
created up here then the function render
with hasn't been instantiated so there's
no way that we can actually run this
code so we'll add a statement saying
here if this user exists and if that in
fact is the case then we'll define this
user with this particular rendering
scheme which we defined down here let's
refresh this again and it'll just say
welcome to my killer PHP application now
what's neat about this is that we've
actually created a variable called user
exists and we have inadvertently passed
it to the view so if i go to welcome PHP
i can create a very simple if statement
here saying if this user exists we're
using a different style here and if and
i'll open another tag here saying else
so this is more as a templating engine
you if you were if you've done anything
with classical ASP or if you've done
anything with a you know with Ruby you
might have seen this kind of declarative
very simple to follow if else for
templating and I can say oh we don't
know
who you are please register and here
we'll just link to the forward slash so
if i refresh this again it'll say oh we
don't know who you are please register
so if I click on register and i put in
john and letting sold and my address so
i'll just say montreal canada and i
submit this and then if i go back to the
welcome it'll say address montreal
canada first name last name and
everything else so now our application
is able to detect whether or not I've
already registered and so on and so
forth so in the next video we're going
to take this a step further by looking
at how we can start passing things to
the model and let the model do the
saving rather than the setting and stuff
in the in the and the view or rather in
the controller and also how we can clean
up our name space so that we don't have
to do these really long things thanks
