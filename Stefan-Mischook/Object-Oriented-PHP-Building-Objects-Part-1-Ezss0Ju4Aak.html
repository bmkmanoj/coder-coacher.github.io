PHP calm and in this video tutorial were
actually gonna build our first objects
and PHP classes I assume at this point
that you've done the previous videos and
you understand the basic concepts the
basic theories with regards to classes
and objects in PHP and of course I
assume that you've done at least some
basic PHP so you understand what
variables and functions are and you know
how to run PHP scripts if any of these
things are hazy for you then I would
strongly suggest that you go to killer
PHP comm and watch the videos
for this video I'm going to use
Dreamweaver 7 to write the PHP code not
because it's the best PHP editor out
there it's simply because I most web
designers last time I heard about 80% of
professional web designers use
Dreamweaver so I figured it's a
environment rather that people are
familiar with so I'll use it when you
get more serious with your PHP work you
may want to look at other text editors
that may have more capability than
Dreamweaver actually I'm pretty sure
about that although I am using an older
version of Dreamweaver so I can't
comment about what Adobe did with their
latest version at this time this is the
cs3 version of Dreamweaver so it could
be a lot better anyhow let's pop open
Dreamweaver what I've done to help move
things along real quickly is I created
the first two basic PHP files here that
we're going to use for this particular
little project essentially I have a
class underscore Lib dot PHP files and
in this particular file is going to
contain all of our PHP object or a class
code in case you miss that part in the
video classes are the blueprints for
objects in PHP the blueprints or
templates or whatnot so what I'm talking
about writing class code I'm talking
about writing a code that creates the
classes and thus the objects in PHP and
of course index dot PHP is just a
standard PHP page the page that the
person visiting the site will actually
see so I'm going to introduce you to
something I actually haven't mentioned
in written tutorial in web application
development whether it be PHP or Ruby or
Java or whatnot
there's a distinction between cold
libraries in this case would be class
Lib class underscore lives live being
short for library versus view pages so
you got code pages Ice Cube you pages
versus library pages so what I mean by
view pages when you're talking about
view pages or nerds that simply refer to
them as being views those are the pages
that people actually see so it gets a
little bit more involved than that but I
just wanted to bring that to your
attention because often times I'll
mention okay let's open up our view and
what I'm talking about I'm talking about
in this project the index page because
this is the actual page that people see
whereas the class Lib PHP page is they
won't actually see that page they won't
actually load that page so if all the
class information is contained inside a
class Lib PHP how do you get that into
the index page you do that simply by
using a PHP include so what I've done
here for the sake of tutorial I've
included it already so this will
basically insert all the code that we're
going to write in our class mid file
into this PHP page
so let's actually go back and let's pop
open the class live dot PHP file now
before we actually read the code I just
want to stress one point the reason why
we have the class Lib file and the index
file is because we want to of course put
our all of our PHP class code inside of
the class Lib file and the reason we
want to do that is because well
object-oriented code is all about
modularity so we could actually write
our classes inside the index page inside
of our view for the sake of demo but I
figure at least on this basic level here
I figured we should just you know
emphasize the point that we want to
separate your view from your your logic
logic be inside of classes and if you is
just the page that displays what people
see of course so that's why we've
created two separate files so I'm just
going to actually make my life easier
and use the Dreamweaver PHP thing about
Bob's here and never go I've inserted
some PHP block so let me just hide all
the extra Chrome
I apologize things a little slow when
I'm doing videos I guess my computer's a
little old here and so things kind of
slow down
so okay so let's first create a class
much like a function I should give it a
name so I'll call the class a person so
this is pretty much all you need to do
is create a class in PHP of course
there's nothing in this class but at
least we've created a class so let's
actually add some variables we start
with the keyword var and name and we'll
just close that off there so this is a
basic class these are the
limiters of the class if you will much
like a function we've created a variable
we used a VAR keyword and we haven't
given the fire Bo any value although we
could just just as easily do so as we
would any standard PHP variable so
that's it so we create over a class but
it doesn't really do anything so the
next step is to actually add a function
so the first function I'm gonna make
function get name and again like any
other function we have their curly
brackets and dentists for the sake of
clarity and what we're gonna do we're
gonna say this function will return and
I'm gonna explain what this is in two
seconds all right so we create our class
we declared a variable and we actually
gave it a value
you notice the variables inside
contained within the class the limiters
so we know about this variable as part
of this class anyhow
function get name and we tell it to
return this not name so this is the part
that has to be explained this like so is
a special self referencing variable
built into object-oriented PHP actually
this is a common and just about every
object-oriented language I've ever seen
essentially it basically tells the PHP
interpreter the engine to when you see
when it sees this it knows that you're
referencing you're talking about the
actual object itself
so when you say return this name this
operator this is the operator here this
basically is a pointer it says grab this
named variable meaning this variable
here or let me rephrase that what it's
saying is grab the variable name and
return its value and very go so it's as
simple as that
so let's always save this already now
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
actually evoke this particular function
get name inside of our PHP View page
which is the index page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
