particular tags and as we've seen it's
sort of a universal thing right all of
my paragraphs look the same way all of
my H ones all my h2s look the same way
and that's great it really came out very
nice for us and it worked well for what
we needed to do however what if there
are certain paragraphs that you want to
have that look different than other
paragraphs well in other words here are
p our selector is styling every single
paragraph to look a certain way well
what if I wanted one of these paragraphs
look different for example what if I
wanted to create an area that I wanted
to define as a custom class so that we
can make it look more like a quotation
in our particular file well we can do
this by creating custom classes and
here's how we do it in the CSS code we
can choose a new CSS rule and look here
it says custom class right class you can
apply this to any HTML element so in
other words any HTML element can be
turned into a particular element that
would take this custom class so how do
we choose a name for our selector well
you always started with a period a
little dot first and when you have that
dot then you give it any name that you
want just make up anything now look if I
wanted something that looks like a
specialized quotation I could just call
it quotation so just remember that it
has to have a dot first and it's going
to be defined in the external CSS file
so we'll click OK and don't worry about
previewing this because we're not going
to be able to see a preview until we
apply this particular custom class and
i'll talk to you about that in just a
second so look we said verdana was the
original font for the paragraphs let's
choose something that looks you know
completely different just because you
know I want to show you the differences
here so verdana is a saucer if let's
choose something that is a serif
right so we have a lot of serif
available we've got this one here we've
got palatino as a seraph among others
right we even have MS serif or New York
among others as well let's choose
Georgia time serum it's perfectly fine
now I want my text to be smaller than my
other text so what if we said 11 pixels
and the font height instead of 18 maybe
I'll make it a little tighter like 16
and you could even choose a different
color we could even choose a background
color but we'll get to that in a second
let's just do this well we'll click OK
nothing happens why because in order to
apply this dot quotation custom class
and as you can see in the code that's
what it looks like dot quotation is the
name of the selector and there's same
property and values and stuff like that
so let's go back to our source code in
order to apply quotation to a specific
paragraph or something like it what we
can do is this we can select this
particular paragraph as I'm doing here
notice what's happening in the code view
just you know P for paragraph nothing
else well inside my property window down
here I can choose a class to apply to it
so if I click down on this before we
didn't have anything here except none
now we've created a custom class and it
happens to be available right here so if
we were to click on quotation you would
see that in your code it says class
equals quotation and let's look at it
here it's smaller it also is tighter
spaced than the other one and it is in a
different font so we can make that look
even more different now since it's been
applied to this particular paragraph I'm
going to just keep this paragraph
visible right here because if we want to
make changes at this point we just
double click this we could start
applying some changes for example maybe
the line height is a little too generous
and maybe i could say 14 instead wow you
see how tight that becomes maybe i want
the entire font to be italic to just so
that it looks even more different from
the rest of it we
can even give any particular tag in CSS
a background we did a background color
for the simple idea of working with our
body but note you can also give your
background here your paragraph here
excuse me a background color as well and
take a look-see so that entire block
which is my paragraph is now visible
inside of this squared off area right
here so all of that's kind of cool too
and many different things that you can
apply and work with in that specific
fashion well let's do a couple of other
changes among other things like for
example we can also give a border to any
of our elements so here's my paragraph
and I could say hey you know what I want
this border to be applied okay well
notice that there are little check marks
same for all alright well let's try that
first we'll say give me a solid border
with a width of 1 pixel and a color of
blue now I should probably choose the
blue that i'm using over there but i
can't pick it so we'll come back to this
later and change it but if I would apply
that check it out the entire area now is
blue at least the border around it is
blue that's cool but if you didn't want
to have a border that was uniformly the
same size well check this out right
maybe solid the whole way through but
let's vary the width maybe on the top
and the bottom you like it at 1 pixel
but maybe on the right side and the left
side you want them to be 10 pixel
instead check this out we can press
apply and notice that right now you have
a very distinctly different area the
changes are really quite nice and as you
can note as you can see here if I wanted
to I can also play with the color value
for those things as well anyways I'm
going to remove these values maybe I
don't want to have a border on this see
that and just take them all away and
perhaps we'll work with the background
color
little bit later but right now if I were
to remove this and just leave it as it
is right now and click OK you can see
that we have this custom class applied
this quotation so if I preview this in
the browser you people are probably
working at home something a lot larger
screen than I have but check it out
right I've got this particular paragraph
looking decidedly different from all the
other ones and it's something that can
be applied multiple times on the page
for example let's say I wanted to create
a second paragraph right here so I'll
just press return separating that line
and if I were to select this area and if
I wanted to apply a custom class to it
make it a quotation as well well I could
leave it like this but then I could just
say quotation and check it out right it
also looks like the one underneath it
and if we look at our code p class
equals quotation so that's just showing
us how we can work with these different
elements and make them work for us and I
don't necessarily need this to be my
quotation so if I want to remove it just
say none and if I want this to be one
full paragraph again just delete that
and it goes right inside of its area as
we saw before alright so when we come
back where we're going to do is I'm
going to ask you to create another
custom class but we're going to use it
with images and I'll show you exactly
how we'll do that when we do come back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
