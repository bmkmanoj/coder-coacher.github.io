money by not upgrading my computer
sooner so let me give you a bit of
background I just recently upgraded my
2012 MacBook Pro to a 2015 MacBook Pro
so you know we're looking at three year
change well four year because now it's
2016 so I basically ran the MacBook Pro
for four years figuring hey why nots
working it's fine no big deal
and I finally was pushed to upgrade
because during the summer especially in
a hotter months when the room was hotter
I don't like using air conditioning he
gets me sick anyhow
so during the hotter months I was doing
a lot of webinars and my MacBook just
couldn't handle it having simultaneous
video streams coming in from remote
location just tanked the whole thing and
then when doing editing video editing
and so forth it was slow and I would get
log drop drop frames on on 1080p live
video now ah but enough to annoy you so
I decided to finally bite the bullet and
buy a new computer after four years so I
was thinking to myself prior to having
purchased this computer I had thought to
myself well I'll just extend its life
outright I'll extend the life out of the
computer save myself some money in the
old days well maybe five years ago up
until about five years ago I would
upgrade my computer's every two years
like clockwork you know because I feel
at that point in time I was confident
that by upgrading every two years you
were gonna gain a lot of speed
advantages in the end saving you money
so what happened this time around when I
finally got my 2015 pearl my new one
just last week I discovered how much
faster it is compared to my 2012 motto
it is not even close with regards to the
video and the video
it's like night and day it's huge it's
huge it's gonna speed up my workflow
tremendously but what I hadn't counted
on was how fast how much faster the new
MacBook was relative to two twelve
machine now this just this just doesn't
apply to Mac's it applies to any type of
computers you'd be surprised how much
faster to three-year-old to
three-year-old new computer that's the
way of putting it is versus the old ones
it's incredibly performant just in day
to day tasks whether you're looking at
spreadsheets working with databases
remote databases local databases just
slowing web apps and websites it has a
huge impact so what I was reminded of us
even though computers are very very fast
these days if you are professional
working in the field
all those little delays those tiny
little delays but you're going to get
off an older computer the webpages load
in two seconds stead of a half a second
the database loads instead of going like
this when you press the button it goes
that type of thing multiply that by a
hundred 200 500 a day it starts to add
up so it wastes your time it actually
weighs heavily more heavily on you
psychologically speaking when you have a
super snappy fast computer it's just
much more pleasant to work with when
you're in a better mood the quality of
your work will be better the longer to
be able to work so in the end though I
extended the life of my two 12 macbook
pro for four years a little bit more
than four and a half years since when i
bought it in the end I lost money I
think because if I would have bought
this 2015 last year my ability and speed
to put out my work would have increased
tremendously
and not only would I've had a much more
relaxing process in doing my work I
would have produced better work in the
end because I would have put more time
and to be able to do better at its
cleaner edits better transitions etc etc
etc but just in my day-to-day tasks
would be much much better because
instead of waiting around for the
computer to process something just comes
in it just comes in it just comes in so
in the end saving that money
I think ended up costing me money it's
hard to measure it's almost impossible
to measure but I decided from now on
because I've been reminded by this
recent purchase that I'm no longer
they'll be extending my upgrade cycle to
four years anymore that's silly
I'm just costing myself a lot of
frustration time every two years max for
me again this applies to professional
developers professional users people who
like me who have a very limited time so
speed is everything I have unlimited
work to do if you get into the business
world whether you're a contractor
whether you have your own web apps or
websites whether have your own business
what you'll see in that situation is
that time your time is the most precious
thing that you have and anything that
you can do to to shorten up the amount
of time we have to spend to get
something done it's well worth it so
again by saving money by extending the
life of my 2012 MacBook Pro up until now
2016 late 2016 that four and a half
years of using the same machine probably
cost me a significant amount of time and
quality in terms of the end product I'm
pretty sure now that I have this ultra
fast Mac relatively speaking I will be
able to produce much better content
going forward just because the editing
is gonna be so much easier just to give
you an idea
to render out a matter 10-minute 1080p
video with my old MacBook we were
looking at 15 minutes to get it done
with the new machine you're looking at
two and a half man babies three minutes
to get it rendered out that's huge
multiply that times 5 videos 10 videos
that's a lot of time and more
importantly I would say or more
importantly is the building for me to
just like butter do all my edits and all
my cuts and scrub the videos pull up
secondary screens and another monitor so
on so forth this is well worth the extra
price that's pretty much it for this
vlog bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
