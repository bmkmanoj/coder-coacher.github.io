calm welcome to a quick introductory
video for my build content management
system course this is a course that's
available to premium members on the
killing sites video tutorial library and
i wanted to provide a brief
demonstration of what gets built doing
that quote and give you a little bit of
an outline of what we do in case you
perhaps onto a premium member and are
interested in seeing what this course is
about this course bands 40 different
videos and cover e is about 6.5 hours of
content over the course of the course
you build a very basic content
management system and let me give you a
brief demonstration of that now so this
is the very basic website that we build
just one page website my goal is not
ready to focus on that side of things as
much as showing you how we can edit the
content so to access the content
management system either you click a
login link where you can simply enter in
a question mark and login in the URL and
you get this pop-up that appears along
the user to enter in the username and
password and this particular content
management system I've called flight
path CMS no specific reason for that
have you been when I was little I loved
space and spaceships and all that but
you're obviously welcome to change the
name of you want to but if we go ahead
and enter in the admin details the
content management system that I'm
building is a little bit different than
a lot of the ones you'll see elsewhere
the thing that I think sets it apart and
it's similar in some ways to some of the
more recent content management systems
I've seen for example mojo motor
WordPress is heading in this direction a
little bit but basically what we have is
this live edit view and when you log in
you get these editable areas of the page
that indicate the type of area
and provide this hover over
functionality that indicates the user
can click on them to edit these areas so
if I do that click on it you'll notice
it opens up this modal popup window and
there are a couple different content
types that we create throughout these
videos we have this one line content
type which is a simple input box we have
a simple text area which allows you to
enter in code directly in and we also
have a what-you-see-is-what-you-get
field which I use a tiny MCE to provide
the what-you-see-is-what-you-get
functionality so this makes it very
simple we can go ahead and make small
edits we could just as an example maybe
I want to bold this line I'll just bold
submit and it saves it to the database
and the page refreshes and you instantly
see that change in place and then also
you can click the preview page button
and it's going to hide these editable
areas and indicate you know what would
it look like and then you can click the
Edit Page back again and those come back
so my goal with this particular course
is not to provide a content management
system with a huge array of functions
I'm focusing primarily on the absolute
basics to start which is creating some
sort of authorization object which
allows us users to login and logout I've
created a templating object which allows
our models and views and controllers to
communicate with each other and also the
actual CMS functionality itself allowing
us to select edible areas update the
content within them create those content
blocks etc so this course is primarily
aimed at intermediate PHP developers
people who have worked through some of
the basic tutorials already and at least
have a basic understanding of PHP and
how it works if you an advanced PHP
developer you may find this a little bit
below your level but up to you you're
obviously welcome to watch it
and even if you're a beginner who is
brand-new no feel free to dive in and
see how it works for you so to briefly
cover this as well my goals for this
particular application I want to make
sure it's very easy for people to use I
want to make sure it's modular and can
provide you a base for your own content
management system if it's something you
want to extend and I want to make it
very easy to integrate into an existing
non CMS based solution so say you have a
basic HTML and CSS website it only takes
a couple lines of code to convert that
and allow us to use the CMS system so to
give you a very brief demonstration of
that if I can view the code for this
you'll notice all these content blocks I
simply created with this one PHP line
and there really isn't very much
required all you have to do is that and
this include line and then two other
lines one within the head and a class on
the body so hopefully it's very into
integrate i'll be covering a wide range
of technologies as I go along including
PHP I'm going to be using the opie
object-oriented programming and i'll be
talking about MVC the
model-view-controller pattern in a bit I
also use javascript and jquery
extensively especially for the pop-up
modal windows and I talked a little bit
about Ajax functionality as well as
obviously the basic HTML and CSS
required for all of this so I hope
you'll be interested enough to take a
look at this course and you can
obviously feel free to email me or
contact me on the killing sites forums
at been at Quebec sites com or my
username on the forums is been as well
and if you have any questions or
comments about things that cover feel
free to email me thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
