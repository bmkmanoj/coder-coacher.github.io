alright since we have our basics covered
let's jump into YouTube now assume you
have an account login and I've logged in
here i know i'm logged in because my
cows killer PHP and what you want to do
is you want to look for this upload
video button so I click on that and this
upload video screen will appear so you
got some instructions here and they make
it easier but so we click upload and I'm
going to choose my youtube upload demo
video here I click OK so immediately
youtube starts uploading the video they
see the time remaining etc etc while
you're doing that while youtube is doing
that rather you have options of changing
title adding description adding tags
selecting a category etc etc so what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to select
a category of education and here's the
one but you got to look at privacy if
you want to embed your YouTube videos in
your website you have to share your
videos with the world if you make it
private you will not be able to embed
the videos I'm going to make it private
since this is a private channel and this
is kind of a just a dummy videos I don't
want everybody save it so i can save
changes while it's still uploading
scroll up you see it's still uploading
so the uploading process can take some
time so what i'm going to do is we're
just going to pause the video which will
be instantaneous for you while this
continues on ok our video has been
uploaded and even gives us our embed
code right here but before i do that i
just want to show you what happens next
now though the video has been uploaded
it's not ready for broadcast let me show
you so we go to kill her or PHP that
would be your accountant a now of course
wouldn't say QR PHP and if we look at
our videos down here you see uploaded
processing so though we've uploaded a
video it's still not ready to show this
can take anywhere from five minutes to
20 minutes or coral
longer depending on the length of your
video and depending on how busy you tube
is so right now it's not really siebel
by the public i click on it you look up
you see the deal not processed yet so
we'll have to wait for that so let's go
back to my videos and what I did is
earlier i uploaded this video here you
notice they set to private as well just
like the one we just uploaded right I
set it to private so I just don't want
people see on this active channel since
these are just dummy videos out let me
just press play here
so we can see the video and I can see it
because i'm logged in with the general
public can't see it let me show you so
easy meal we've seen this before so let
me show you what this looks like in an
embed page so let me show you what I
mean by that so i have this web page i
created and i did in bed that particular
video so here we go now this is a
different browser as microsoft here and
i haven't logged in to my youtube
account of this video is in bed from
that non-public video so watch what
happens when i try to view it
so that's why you have to make your
videos public if you want to use the
embed feature
all right wood we're back at you two up
you can see that the last video we put
up it says it's live so let's take a
look at what that looks like and yes it
is indeed live but as you can see it's
really a crappy quality that's to be
expected if you look up here the videos
like it's still being processed so this
is sort of like an earlier crappy
quality thing that they put out for you
go back to my videos I'll show you that
same video but fully rendered so you can
see what it looks like once it's in full
quality as you can see once it's fully
rendered we get a much nicer looking
video
all right we got the uploading done so
let's look at the embedding process if
you scroll over bomb and scroll over
here on the right hand side you see
beside the video got this URL you got in
bed this is what you want to look at is
in bed now if we click on this button
here I can customize the look of the
actual embedded video it's pretty
powerful so you can set the dimensions
the color of the control bar down here
all kinds of stuff it's pretty cool you
can include related videos blah blah
blah you can look at these different
different options but once you pick the
option that's suitable for you you just
click inside the in bed box and you
control click or right click on PC and
you copy this code and now you take that
code and you just stick in your web
pages I'm going to just jump in there
now I've actually done it before so here
it is here's a very simple web page
here's the embed code and that's all you
have to do that's that's why YouTube
really makes it easy to embed videos
into your web pages
you can even use YouTube to embed of
course into your blog so here's a
wordpress blog here's that video looks
familiar here's that branding I was
talking to you about right that's what
you can have to contend with but you got
full video very high quality if you
upload it in quality and you'll have to
pay for the bandwidth and you'll have to
jump through any hoops
so to quickly recap I showed you how to
upload videos they showed you what the
video should be made public not private
I showed you that you had embed options
with this miss maximize this here with
this button here you click that button
you got your embed options we go back
and we cut and pasted a code showed you
a code what it looks like in the web
page right here also showed that you can
use this code in blogs and yeah and
demonstrated a video on killer sites
here it is poop you know Madeline keel
on camera for a mere everything here it
is and there you go one thing you can do
actually you can go to full screen here
and it's a it's not super clear but it's
not bad to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
