taking a look a little bit more at
working with layers inside of Photoshop
cs6 so let's go to our mini bridge if
you open it up you'll notice that I'm
working with a file here called killer
sites you for dot PSD and it can be
found in your source files in the folder
called killer sites so you can get that
open double click it so that it will
open up inside a Photoshop here I've fit
it into my screen by pressing command 0
or control 0 on a PC and you'll notice
that its visibility is only set to about
thirty five percent if you press command
one and put it out a hundred percent
you'll be able to see that it's a lot
larger than we saw in just a second ago
and basically it's just a simple web
interface and we're going to be working
with this interface and creating one
very similar to what we see here so
again I'm going to press command 0 just
to get it into the size of the screen
and what we want to be doing is working
with layers and taking a look at an
overview of layers and how they work you
can expand your panels right here and if
you have things like swatches that are
open you can just double-click them to
collapse them at this point I only have
my layers open and you'll notice even if
you didn't expand your panels you can
always go to this icon just clicking on
it will open up your layers right here
well one of the first things that you
can see is that the vast majority of my
objects in this particular document are
now stored inside of what we call layer
groups here you can see in the layout
there are a number of backgrounds and
then there's a section here called
banner among other thing you can also
see that these particular layer groups
have eyeballs right next to them right
here well these icons
are controlling the visibility of these
layers and let's take a look at this if
I were to open up this layer group
called sticker and when you expand them
you can see that inside each of those
layer groups there are individual layers
some of which are type layers some of
which are pixel layers some of which are
even adjustment layers all these things
will talk about in future videos notice
here some that have effects can have
their effects be expanded or collapsed
to make things a little bit more easier
to work with and when you collapse this
you can see that if I focus in on this
sticker area right here I'm going to
press alt and I'm going to use my mouse
scroller just to zoom in a little bit
more on that area well take a look if we
were to click on this a little eyeball
we are hiding the visibility of that
particular group and all of its contents
all of the layers inside now one of the
things that we might remember is that
this does not delete the items that are
in here it simply hides their visibility
you can also see that some of these
groupings happen to have colors
associated with them and this is easily
achieved inside of a layer palette or a
group simply by right-clicking on a
group or an individual layer and then
coming down here and adding a color to
them so as you can see I've made this
grouping be red and if you open it up
you can now see that all of the elements
that were inside that group are now
color coded as red layers as well this
makes things much easier to work with
especially when you're dealing with a
very diverse and varied composition like
the one that we happen to have right
here it's not unusual for your layouts
and any type of composition for that
matter inside of Photoshop to contain
well over hundreds of layers and if you
had all these layers just opened up the
way they are like this that would be a
lot more diff
to find the things that you're looking
for so what we have to remember is that
layer groups and layers are really all
about keeping things organized and
you'll notice also that when you're
working with layers you've got to
remember that the way layers work are
simply by allowing elements to be
stacked one on top of each other so
let's take a look if i were to command
minus or control- just reduce this
canvas a little bit and then you can
press spacebar to kind of move it into
view check out what happens if we start
hiding the visibility sticker is turned
off the footer while footers down at the
bottom so there you go it's turned off
now these sub pages do not have anything
on them at the moment but here we have
the quotes section the Features section
the logo section the navigation these
sections and then ultimately that banner
so that is how these things work when
you turn one on and then another one on
top of it you're essentially just
layering elements one on top of another
on top of another on top of another
until ultimately you have your entire
composition laid out now there are many
different things that we're going to be
talking about and learning about when we
discuss our layers and in the next video
we'll be creating some layers and
walking our way through the building of
this composition as you see it right
here but take a look there's some
elements here like the layout group that
we happen to have that has an icon that
indicates it's locked and that means if
I were to take my black arrow tool the
selection tool and attempt to select
this particular element you'll notice
that yes this frog layer is being
selected but i can't select the layout
even if I wanted to simply because it's
locked so in order to select the white
area or the black area that I have
here I would have to unlock this first
so to lock and unlock a layer as you can
see here you select the either layer
group or the individual layer itself and
then all you got to do is to come up
here and either lock or unlock that
particular layer it's a useful thing to
keep in mind because there are going to
be times when we want to select elements
on this page but we really don't want to
be moving around in this case the
background or the layout something
that's new inside of Photoshop six is
the searchable layer elements here and
as you can see it says pick a filter
type well without actually picking a
filter type let's just look at some of
these icons for example here we have one
that says filter for pixel layers so if
I were to click on this you would see
that only the pixel layers are showing
everything else is taken away I turn
that off I could say show me only the
adjustment layers and now only
adjustment layers are showing or if I
turn that off I could say let's see just
the type layers now look at that all of
these are indicating and showing only
type layers or perhaps only shape layers
and there are all my shape layers that
I've got in this object the last one
that we happen to see here is smart
objects but I don't have any smart
objects in this particular file so I'm
not turning that on under kind however
you could also search by name so for
example I know there's a file or a layer
rather in here called frog so all I have
to do is to write in frog and notice
I've filtered through all of the
different layers that we had here and
now I've managed to find the Frog really
quickly and easily let's also look at
this you could filter through effect so
only the elements that have effects or
only the elements that happen to have
certain modes associated with them or
those that have attributes
well you could see those that have color
or in this case not colored and then I
could come in here and say well show me
only the reds or show me only the
oranges so these are all really easy
ways of finding elements inside your
layers and being able to work with them
let's also take a look at something else
if you were to grab a group of elements
remember how I said layers are all about
stacking things one on top of each other
but if I was to grab a group like this
one and to bring it for example
underneath the banner area you can see
that now my sticker has been moved at
the bottom underneath the banner if I
wanted to bring it all the way back up
to the top I could do so as well be
careful because sometimes when you're
trying to put something underneath
something else or in this case on top of
it you don't want to be putting it or
nesting it inside of this particular
group so just make sure that it's going
all the way up to the top and you can
see little highlights to help you along
in that fashion so those are some of the
basics when we come back in the next
video we're going to be building up a
couple of layers and we'll start
stacking them and naming them and we'll
be placing things in groups</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
