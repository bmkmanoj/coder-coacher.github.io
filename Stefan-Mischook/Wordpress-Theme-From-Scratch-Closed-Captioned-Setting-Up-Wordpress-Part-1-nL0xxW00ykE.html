video we're going to set up WordPress on
our local computer where we're going to
be writing our own very simple wordpress
theme and we are going to start building
the beginnings of a bare-bones template
so we're going to start from the ground
up and we're going to do this by first
looking at the default theme and seeing
a bit about how it's constructed so
you'll notice here that I've actually
started by navigating to wordpress.org
and you'll see right here that you can
actually download WordPress just by
clicking on this link here and then
downloading the zip file now once it's
downloaded to your computer simply take
the WordPress zip file double click on
it and it should create a new folder now
I've already got a wordpress folder here
so I'm going to delete that and i'm just
going to rename wordpress to to
wordpress so if i look at this now I've
got what you would consider a very
simple wordpress structure just
extracted the files onto my file system
if you're using a hosting provider like
GoDaddy or dreamhost or anybody with
cpanel you probably have a goodies or
one-click installer section where you
can actually just install wordpress on
your web server without having to
download wordpress at all but at the end
of the day whether you're using this
locally or you're using this on your web
server you're going to end up with this
kind of directory structure so now that
we have wordpress installed i'm just
going to go to my map control panel and
i'm going to open my start page when i
open my start page I'll see that there's
a button here for PHP myadmin now PHP
myadmin is a tool for managing our MySQL
database this mysql database is going to
be handling the configuration and also
the content of our wordpress
installation so under database I've got
a whole bunch of databases that I've
already created before but I'm going to
create a new one for this particular
project
and i'm going to call it WP video I'm
just going to hit create now because
this is running locally the username and
the password are both going to be root
so with WordPress installed and my
database created I'm just going to close
this and I'm going to close this and I'm
going to navigate to localhost which is
the place on my web server that
corresponds to what was set up with Matt
so mamp is now pointing at this
WordPress directory and this is what we
get when we hit the wordpress page so
the first thing we have to do is create
this configuration file we hit let's go
the database name is WP videos username
is root the password is root the
database host is localhost and we don't
need to worry about the table prefix I
hit submit and it says it does not have
permission hold on one second ah there
we go so it's actually WP video not WP
videos and now i'm going to run the
install now that WordPress has installed
all of the tables that it needs in the
database that we picked I'm just going
to give it a blog title and I'm going to
put in my email address so now I have a
username admin and a password which is
really quite complicated I'm going to
hit login go admin paste in the password
and the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm just going to change the admin
password to something that I can
remember and i'm going to update my
profile and now if i visit the website
you'll see that we've basically got a
very simple wordpress template this is
the default kubrick theme on the
right-hand side we have a sidebar we
have a header here and we have a main
content pane which you can see on the
default page and we of course have a
footer at the bottom
now what we're going to do is build up a
template like this one bit by bit from
scratch now in the last video I showed
you some templates that I've done in
this format and so I'm just going to
quickly go back so that you can see them
this is on again the local machine I'm
going to go to design these are two
templates that I managed to put together
relatively quickly using the method that
we're going to be doing here where we've
got basically a header we've got some
kind of sidebar you have a footer and a
bit of CSS to give it the style that we
need and here's another example same
concept we have a sidebar on the right
we have some designs on the left and we
have a nice footer with a couple of
flourishes at the bottom so the next
step is to actually create a template
that we can work with so when I log in
or when I go back to the local host the
back end which is accessible via
localhost and then wp-admin I'll get
back to the dashboard and if I click on
design here I'll see that I have the
current theme and I have WordPress
classic now both of these themes are
accessible via the WP content themes
folder so if I go back to my wordpress
folder here and i click on WP content
and then themes I'll see that classic
and default are actually two names of
folders that correspond to the themes
that I'm seeing actually here so the
first step is we're going to create a
new folder for our new template i'm
going to call this my template and
there's nothing in there right now the
only thing that's going to change now is
that there's going to be a broken theme
listed down here that says that the
style sheet is missing now the way that
wordpress
figures out all of the metadata the
title of the theme and the description
and any sort of tags is based on the
style.css file so that file is
absolutely required now let's open text
wrangler and let's create ourselves a
style dot CSS file so i'm going to start
by going file new text document file
save as and I'm just going to navigate
to my themes folder which for me is in
wordpress WP content themes my template
and i'm going to call this style dot CSS
so now that we've saved our style dot
CSS file we need to create a comment
block at the top of the file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
