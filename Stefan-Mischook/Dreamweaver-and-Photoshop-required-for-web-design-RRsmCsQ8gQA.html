killer sites calm and studio web com I'm
going to be pumping that more now yeah
so in this video I'm going to answer a
question that was it's been gets put to
me every so often and do you need to
learn dreamweaver and photoshop to be a
web designer or web developer these days
short answer to the question is no
there's a couple of reasons number one
there are many other pieces of software
out there web design software and photo
editing software out there that you can
use at this point in time a lot of these
things are very similar in terms of what
they can do and what their functionality
is that said the need for powerful web
design software point-and-click stuff
like dreamweaver are far diminished from
what it used to be if you need them at
all these days the technology behind web
design HTML the CSS CSS 3 HTML 5 and so
on these things are far far more mature
than they were you know eight years ago
10 years ago where you know definitely
in 1999-2000 something like a dream
weaver it was extremely valuable to have
because it took care of a lot of the
shortcomings if you if you will when it
came to the web design technologies how
the browser's worked and and how mature
HTML and CSS was and so on and so
programs like dreamweaver did a good job
to take care of all the mundane and
differences and so on you don't need
that anymore because the technology is
far more evolved and the fact of the
matter is the majority of web designers
and programmers won't use something like
a dreamweaver to use a simple text
editor like notepad plus plus on windows
or text wrangler on
or sublime text is another popular one
with web developers these days I'm
recording this in mid-april 2014 I was
photoshop do you need photoshop now
photoshop's this hugely huge powerful
product and again the fact that a matter
is for the vast majority of the graphics
that you're going to need to prepare to
prepare for a website you don't need
that kind of powerful software there are
free alternatives to photoshop like the
gimp that will do everything that you
need and there's a whole bunch of other
things as well that Corral has something
called photo-paint which is not free but
it's very inexpensive relatively
speaking so do you need to spend thirty
nine bucks a month or two twenty but
nine bucks months or whatever it is for
Adobe's Creative Cloud if you're just
doing web design web programming I would
argue no I know Adobe's not going like
to hear that for me probably never get
no sponsorship from them I'm not dissing
Adobe's products but I'm just saying is
it really essential no because when you
get experienced in your web design and
development you're going to be messing
around in code ninety-nine percent at a
time and beyond that the web browsers
themselves have a bunch of tools that
come with them that help web designers
and web developers these things didn't
exist before in the web browsers tools
like dreamweaver compensated for that
but now that's no longer the case so
i'll just give you a quick example so
i'm going to pop open google chrome here
and so here's one of the sites one of my
sites to CSS tutorial net it's a
shameless plug it's actually a pretty
popular site when it comes to CSS and
you see I went into let me just put this
in view so i go into where's that they
go on to the little know if this is the
control bar here anyway click on this
icon and what you want to go into is
tools and you want to go into developer
tools let me just get that into view
here so you could fully see in there we
go to lowes developer tools and did my i
just shut it down so go into tools
developer tools and it opens up and what
this does it gives you a whole bunch of
various tools in which you can use to
analyze your website and it's very cool
so you see i'm highlighting a code here
this is the code behind the page and
it's giving me information you see how
it's highlighting in the browser view up
on top like this and you can drill down
and you can go in there and you can
actually adjust styles live on the fly
so I could you know put in something 100
and they can see how things will look
accordingly so you know and this is just
you know you can drill down here there's
all kinds of things you can deal with
this with the web browser now so it's
extremely powerful I've given some
tutorials on this in the past so I won't
cover it here but that's that's the
answer to the question do you need to do
you need journey we've or do you need
photoshop now are useful sure but if 39
bucks or thirty-six bucks or 29 bucks I
figure out what the monthly subscription
is now as seems a little steep for you
yeah then there's all kinds of
alternatives I just mentioned a few in
the earlier part of this video and I'm
sure I know there are many out there
beyond that so it's up to you take a
look maybe I'll give a review of
different alternative web design tools
in the near future I hope that was
useful thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
