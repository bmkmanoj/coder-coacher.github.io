answering questions that are put to me
on youtube in in the car here and I
figure it's a community place i'm using
my pixel phone and so you let me know
what you take it a video quality and
sound quality i have an external mic i
can always hook it up it may be let me
know my voice is still very weak i have
a history of a weak very weak voice
laryngitis is something that's plagued
me this may sound crazy to you but I've
actually lost my voice for nine months
once nine months it was as bad so I'm in
my second month of very weak voice now
we're going into my second month it's
troublesome but you eventually go away
and take a lot of water anyway I
matching a couple questions off top of
my head and no one somebody said how do
I retain all this information and
learning web development how is what's
the best way to retain the stuff two
things you're going to do another one
you guys just write code he's going to
write code and don't be afraid to google
up syntax actual little cold bits if
you're using a good IDE and integrated
development environment and that's just
an app that helps you to code it will
code hint for you understand even the
most experienced programmers will forget
the specific syntax a specific code from
time to time especially if you haven't
used an aspect of a language for a while
so let's say you haven't done enough
I'll manipulation in Python in a while
you may forget the exact syntax exact
color right no big deal just go to
Google only type in Python file opening
or file manipulation you get the Kobuk
there you go up and that's it news it's
all you have to do really so don't worry
about forgetting individual little code
snippets and the specifics the most
important thing when you're learning how
to code is understanding
concepts and then the setting the big
picture how to put everything together
nicely but you still have to know some
basics like a variable declaration
declaration object declaration so forth
this will come which is practices right
Code Red Code Red Code another thing you
can do as I suggest in my courses all
the time is take notes handwritten notes
are very important because when the body
feels the pen in the hand you're
activating the tactile the feeling of
the pen in hand and I've mentioned this
other videos at a background psychology
the more sensory inputs you can trigger
during an event but more likely and more
easily your brains they remember that so
sensory employee we take in information
around the world in our lives through
our eyes such a sight smell taste touch
hearing so the more you can activate
when you're learning something the more
likely you're going to remember not
everybody's different you may be
somebody who can remember touch more
easily some people may hear better than
they see in terms of comprehension it's
everybody's got their learning style so
for you one of the things i would
suggest as when you're learning like a
key thing like let's say object class
creation in whatever language you're
learning write it down on paper keep
notes a nice note broke right now I
dated Mario but we know where we are now
March 30th how to create an object and
you just write the code out right you
know and not that you didn't necessarily
refer to these notes but what you find
is that's going to really help you to
remember things more easily but at the
end of the day they had to write more
code you can't be too concerned about
forgetting specifics because even the
most experienced programmers will forget
specifics you could always just google
it up in a second and learning you to
use Google to do that as a big part of
skill set so there are my tips next
question somebody said they were doing
courses and
they were in in this program they were
suggested that they should learn Ruby on
Rails should you do it while you can
watch my videos on should you learn Ruby
should you learn Python should you learn
PHP and you get into the specifics on
this so I wouldn't go over here because
you can just check out those videos in
the in the playlist and one of my
playlists the Tauri to search for it the
most important thing to consider is the
type of work and the type of programming
you want to do so will be in my opinion
moving rails of other great technologies
they're falling more and more into niche
and as a result you look at what will be
and Ruby and rails is useful these days
these days is typically when you go to
go work for startup that type of
business but so that might be what you
want to do on the other hand you may
find but learning JavaScript and node
might be able to choice these days to
paying or item if you want to do
freelance the king of freelance of
course is PHP no question and etc etc
and this is not a statement we say it
again I'm not saying that PHP is a
better language and will be or Python
severe language with PHP or vice versa
or whatever I'm not talking about that
because all these languages would be
typhoid will be peach peach else could
tell the C sharp and whole bunch of
others they're all neck-and-neck in
terms of your capabilities and they can
all produce good apps what it really
comes down to is what you want to do and
the type of work you want to do with the
type of place you are working now thats
it for todays vlog let me know what you
think it's a sounds cool if the video is
cool i'm trying to say if i should get
like a dedicated little mini camera
because i want to bring my dlsr my big
camera into my car and i think i'm going
to just do my mailbag on this on the way
back from my coffee and my morning bagel
run and that'd be kind of cool all right
let me know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
