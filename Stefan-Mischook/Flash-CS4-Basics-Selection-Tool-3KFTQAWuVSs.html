working with the basic drawing tool and
as you can see we worked with the
rectangle on the oval shape tool and we
created a couple of shapes here now i'm
going to show you what we can do with
this tool the selection tool it's the
black arrow tool there are actually a
number of selection tools inside of
flash and as you can see they are
separated by this line in your toolbox
there are drawing tools separated by
this line some erasers and color picking
and stuff like that and some hand
movement tools as well as a zoom tool
that we have here but what we're looking
at right now is this first and foremost
basic selection tool and as you can see
I've got the black selection tool now
the one nice thing about all adobe
products when you are working with a
selection tool there is in the vast
majority of them a properties window and
we saw the properties window when we
were taking a look at the interface
earlier and as you can see if i open it
up a little bit more when we select any
one of these given shapes it'll give us
information about them inside the
property window I'm just going to expand
that property window so we can see what
we're talking about here and I'll just
press spacebar and move my stage over
just a little bit and you can see that
when we do in fact select one of these
things it gives us information about
that thing inside of our property window
so here we have a shape and it's giving
us the X&amp;amp;Y location within the height of
that shape it's giving us as you can see
here a fill is rad but there's no stroke
and why is that because when you single
click on any given shape it's only going
to select the stroke so if I were to
move this as you can see that excuse me
it's only going to select the fill if I
move it I've left the stroke behind so
if i press ctrl Z to undo that that will
move that back into position one way to
get around that is to number one first
let's deselect by just clicking on the
stage anywhere on the stage and you'll
notice when you click on anything inside
and in this case I'm clicking on the
stage what we see is information about
the stage tells us it's got a frame per
second rate of 24 that will be explained
later on it also tells us that we have
the width and the height of the stage
being 550 x 400 that's the default so in
order to get around this when we are
selecting our objects we can
double-click those objects and now that
allows us to select both the fill and
the stroke and I can move that around
successfully whether I do that with any
kind of shape being an oval circle or a
square double click select both the film
and the shape now you might remember
that the last time that we had selected
or that we had created our circle we
created the last one is what we called
an object drawing so when I select this
just single clicking on it you'll see in
the properties window it says this is
not a shape anymore this is actually an
object drawing as I explained to you
before when you have an object drawing
you have a grouped shape grouped item
now why is that important well let's
come back to that in a little bit later
but let's also first explain what's
happening with these basic shapes here
if I were to double click the shape and
overlap it on top of one of the other
ones well let's see what happens when I
deselect first and foremost and then if
I double-click that shape again and move
it over let's see what happened well
what you can notice is is that when
objects are just simple shape objects
and you're overlapping them and they
exist on the same layer when you come
back to them and select them you may in
fact recognize here that we have taken a
bite out of our piece now that could be
interesting I mean you could use that to
your advantage for example I could come
here to the corner and I could deselect
and then if I double click it again and
select it I've taken a nice perfect
circle bite out of that square it's
actually you know something that could
be advantageous to you and if you're
wondering about a stroke and continuing
that stroke well there are other tools
that allow us to do that for example
over here we have
paint bucket tool which is used to fill
in colors but if i press down on it
you'll see that there's an ink bottle to
land the ink-bottle tool allows me to
continue that stroke so now I've got a
perfectly stroked item if I were to
switch back to the selection tool notice
that when you hold your mouse over it it
gives you a letter shortcut and you can
try it it's called V on your keyboard
shortcut and that accesses that tool if
I double-click this I could also change
information like the fill and the stroke
color I could also change the stroke
size as you can see here I can you know
increase that slide it I could give a
numeric value let's say i'll give it a
value of four just like that and you'll
see that this has a thicker stroke than
some of the other objects that we have
there we're going to come back to that
stroke in just a second but let's take a
look again at the object drawing well
main difference is is when you place an
object drawing over something else and
then you move that object drawing again
it doesn't take a bite out of the other
pieces again that can be advantageous
but to be perfectly honest I generally
prefer working with shapes rather than
object drawings and if I need them to be
a grouped item or as we'll see later on
a symbol I can do that myself
nevertheless either way which you prefer
to work is completely up to you now what
if I wanted to change this object
drawings color well you could select it
and change its color just as easily as
doing that you could also double click
this item and let's take a look at what
happened here what is happening is the
same thing that happens inside of
grouped items when you're working in
Adobe Illustrator what we have here is a
grouped item our object drawing and when
you double-click it you enter into
isolation mode and as you can see here
we are now inside the group so if I were
to select this if I were to move it
around and now it's acting like a shape
right I can separate it it's not grouped
as both a film and shape I can actually
move that shape around so if I want to
get out of the object drawing notice
everything that's on the stage not part
of the object drawing is actually faded
and a lot more opaque so it's almost as
if we're seeing what's on the stage
through the eyes of this container so to
return to the stage all you have to do
is click on scene 1 or double-click to
get inside double-click on the white to
exit so that's about it when we come
back we're going to talk about working
with strokes and working with some more
object drawings but looking at some
different possibilities that we have
available to us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
