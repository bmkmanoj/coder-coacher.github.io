PHP and today what I'm gonna be doing is
looking at how we can create an html5
site with a video background using the
video tag so I'm gonna be showing you
how you can use the video tag and
talking a little bit about its
functionality but we're also going to
use it as a background to our website so
this is the video this is the website
that we did in our last set of videos
I'm actually going to build this up from
scratch now so that we can just kind of
review some of the concepts that were
covered in the last section
so I've got here an empty style dot CSS
file and an empty index dot PHP file or
index dot HTML file rather and if I just
look at my file system over here you'll
see that I've got in my folder here I've
got an index style and then a test
MOV video and an test ogv video so if I
look at the MOV you'll see that it's
basically a an animated film this is an
open source video this is the trailer of
it or I think it's actually the whole
video and this is an OG V version of
that same video so we've got two
versions one is the oven format and one
is h.264 using QuickTime now the reason
we have two different copies of the same
video is because currently some browsers
are supporting the auger for Matt and
some browsers are supporting the mp4 or
mpeg-4 and h.264 once these decisions
and once the kind of licensing around
these issues gets sorted out we'll
probably only have one video format for
the web hopefully but anyways so if you
are interested in using the video tag
and you want to make sure that it works
in Safari and Chrome and Firefox and you
want it to work seamlessly you're going
to need two versions of your video at
least at this point but it will work on
the iPod and the iPhone
and the iPad as well so let's get
started so I've got an index dot HTML
tag or a file here and if I go 209 which
is the project file you'll see there's
nothing there and I'm going to start by
adding my doctype of HTML make my
language English and we're gonna have a
head section and a body section and we
are going to I'm going to add that meta
tag which will have a quiff content type
text slash HTML the character sets of
utf-8 and this is just kind of standard
header stuff that we like to make sure
that it exists and I'm also going to
make sure that my text editor is set to
parse HTML so that I get the right
syntax colouring and I'm gonna add a
title which will be html5 video
and lastly I'm just going to include a
link to my stylesheet let's see if the
relationship this is of type stylesheet
the URL is going to be styled out CSS
and the type is text slash CSS and then
in here I'm gonna have a head section
and I'm gonna have a section for just
general content so I'm gonna have I'll
just call it an article and then I'm
just gonna put in some text here so
article title hit save go back to
Firefox refresh it so far it looks okay
and then in my CSS I'm going to add a
global reset which is this star
basically it applies it to all the tags
and that worked good I'm gonna set the
background of my body to black
so now it's gonna be a black background
and then I'm gonna have my article and
also my section I want them to
display:block and then for my section I
mean I have a background of white say
ten pixels of padding and a width of 50%
all right there we go so with this in
place I want to start off by actually
embedding the video tech since that's
really the meat of this project and then
what we'll do is we're gonna add a
navigation on top of that which is going
to be semi-transparent just to show you
kind of some of the cool features and
maybe help inspire you to build your
next html5 website with video as part of
it
so in my index dot peach or index.html
file at the bottom I'm going to add a
video tag and I'm gonna set autoplay to
true and then I'm gonna close the video
tag now with video tags if the browser
doesn't support the video in question
then it'll default to whatever you put
inside the video tag so if you want you
can have you know you can have the first
video source which in this case for me
is going to be source SRC equals test
MOV and in states of type video slash
mp4 and if there isn't an mp4 available
then you can make it display some text
so over to example I could say your
browser doesn't support the video tag
now if i refresh this page again I'm not
going to see anything now this is
probably because
the MOV version is not supported in
Firefox however if you look carefully
here you can see that there's an mp4 and
referencing test dot MOV so let's see
what it looks like when I open it in
Chrome so when I open it in Chrome the
video seems to load correctly without
any kind of issues so one thing that you
have to be mindful of is that most
apache configurations most web server
configurations don't support ogv out of
the box so when I'm put in a source SRC
equals test ogv the aughh
and I say test video equals OGG or test
video type equals video / o G G it's
still not going to play it properly and
the reason for that is that essentially
Apache doesn't know how to deal with the
oven EO format so one way around that is
to modify your to modify your
configuration of Apache now if you don't
have root access to your web server
another way around that is to create
what's called an htaccess file if you've
ever done anything with mod rewrite or
you've ever wanted to take your urls for
your website and make them cleaner or
look better then you've probably dabbled
a little bit with HT access HT access
files are hidden files that sit on the
web server and that allow you to do your
own last minute configuration of the web
server for that particular folder so I'm
going to create a new file here and I'm
going to save it inside this folder and
I'm going to call it dot HT access and
it's gonna say oh are you sure because
usually dot files are used for system
files but we're gonna say use the dot
now in order for this work to work I
have to add a type a video slash OGG and
it needs to be of dot ogv
then I have to do header set access
control allow origin star header unset e
tag and file e tag
not now these four lines of code
basically configure your web server to
allow the oven format to be properly
handled by Firefox so with these four
lines in place if i refresh this again i
should hopefully let's see something
okay you'll see that the video loads
correctly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
