and in this video I'm gonna answer a
question that was really put to me by a
youtuber in fact so let me get to that
file here yeah little screenshot so with
the increasing presence of
do-it-yourself website development sites
like Squarespace I would be interested
to hear what your thoughts are regarding
where of us leaves independent web
developers in that market space kind
regards Steven right in that show we're
screwed man
it's over I'm just kidding it does mean
that we're going to have to up our game
and I've been saying this for quite a
while now that the days of being a pure
web designer we just design are becoming
more and more difficult over time so she
was Squarespace and wordpress templates
and and companies that provide templates
that are quite nice now these things are
not not they're not good for all
businesses are not good for all sites
that's for sure but they're good for a
lot of sites and the issue with that is
you know unless you're are really and I
said this before a top-notch designer
the chances you getting gigs as a pure
web designer are far less than what they
used to be just five six seven years ago
I would argue bad although those
probably still business out there that
said so what's the solution the solution
of course as it's always been is to
become more sophisticated in your skills
you got a no code you got to know I've
been programming you got to know how to
use frameworks and use turnkey solutions
what are frameworks things like
WordPress things like being able to
implement shopping cards so you can
understand basic coding web app coding
whether you choose PHP which is the
number one choice because there's so
many things out there in PHP or any
other language whether it be Ruby or
Python whatnot you're gonna have to do
that you're gonna have to get into that
and you're probably going to have to
specialize at some
because what are we miss specialized you
may become like a wordpress web designer
I coined that you know seven years ago
or whatever it was where you basically
you're to go-to guy when it comes to
WordPress whether it be installing
WordPress and creating custom themes
modifying themes adding extra
functionality and creating custom
plugins or just saying it up for a noob
small business owner doesn't really want
to learn web design but needs to get all
these things put into place that's an
issue that I'm sure is I know it can be
very profitable for people and so on so
so forth there's all of these different
areas so that's the thing you're gonna
basically have to up the skill set the
days of being a peer designer what
there's always gonna be a demand for
unique design there's always gonna be
demand for that but for the vast you
know especially as budgets are squeezed
you know there's even people are going
to be leveraging templates and I've been
been an advocate of website templates
for many years now Squarespace basically
takes the whole web designer out of the
process to a certain extent but both
step aside to extreme limited and you
know I think you could compete in two
respects if you if you start leveraging
again like frameworks and templates and
so on you can sell people on that fact
so for instance and it does have to be
WordPress I just use WordPress cause
it's probably the most popular out there
in terms of the content management
systems the CMS is there's true pile and
Joomla there's others as well but you
can come in there you could roll in
there as a web designer and provide a
lot of value and a lot of functionality
just utilizing your WordPress again as
an example as your your basic framework
because with WordPress some templates
throw in some plugins and you got a lot
of functionality very quick so you as a
web designer you're gonna start thinking
what long term to upgrade the upkeep's
of the sites you know the changes and so
on
so yeah Squarespace and those type of
things they're getting bigger and
they're getting better
and they used to be now they've been
around for years and I think you're just
gonna have to up your game that's all so
education is the key more skill sets and
getting into actual
web coding web programming again you
don't have to be an expert coder but you
have to know your way around the key
languages like HTML CSS JavaScript
little PHP now I'm not going to see you
in a write JavaScript from scratch
you're going to get into jQuery but if
you know JavaScript you're going to be
able to use jQuery and make little
changes to that you might need much more
easily than you would if you don't know
JavaScript and to know PHP you know like
like as so many things are in PHP carts
and shopping carts and forums and and
you know WordPress and jus proud Japan
and Joomla and a whole bunch of other
things so just knowing little PHP it
will open up a lot of potential gigs for
you so that's my two cents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
