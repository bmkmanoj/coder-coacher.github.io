somebody asked me to identify the things
that will make a freelancer successful
versus a freelancer who isn't successful
what do you do to be a successful
freelancer well it comes down to two
things that are kind of strange now
number one well it seems kind of strange
number one you need to have
interpersonal skills you have to go out
there and be able to communicate with
people and get along with people listen
to people because at the end of the day
when you're doing freelance work you're
gonna be doing freelance work 99% of the
times for small businesses so it's a lot
about interpersonal relationships it's
about contacts getting to know people
they have to get to trust you now I'm
assuming that you've done the
prerequisites you know how to code
you've done at least one or two little
apps on your own so you have the
technical skills so now how do you take
these technical skills and turn them
into clients how do you get the clients
so first thing you have to do once you
learn your technical skills and that
means let's say you decide in your area
that you see a lot of demand for
WordPress modifications and stalls maybe
a little shopping cart integrations that
kind of stuff so that means you got to
know your html5 your CSS some JavaScript
and PHP why PHP because WordPress is
built in PHP Joomla is built in PHP
Drupal's built into PHP a lot of
shopping cart apps and systems are PHP
based just knowing PHP even if you're
not gonna be writing complete apps and
PHP is going to have a huge advantage
for you as a freelancer
anyway technical skills aside you should
have a website that looks pretty decent
doesn't have to be super fancy because
you're not sewing your design skills
you're selling your developer skills but
still has to be clean and if you don't
know how to design a clean looking site
or if you don't have the the visual or
the eye to go with design something that
looks cool just get a template just get
one of these templates you get a free
one or you could get
paid one if you install WordPress versus
in size your website there's thousands
of templates you could use take a
template make some mods and if you're
really bad with design have a nice
little local and just have a plain very
minimalist design put your nice local
you know look great you have to have
some sort of site that prospective
clients can come to and they can see oh
this guy this girl knows what they're
doing even though you just put up a
template they don't know that's why
they're looking to hire you and you know
even if they asked you why'd you use a
template you could just be obviously
this is I'm not a designer I'm a
developer so my job is to put it all
together like a mechanic I'm not
somebody who designs the car from
scratch to make an analogy and that's
very legitimate again I always say in
business transparency being honest being
upfront about what you are offering is a
much better policy not just because it's
just the right thing to do but you'll
see in the medium and long term it's
actually better for business okay back
to the two major elements I think that
really impact in terms of being a
successful freelancer number one you
have to have good relationships
interpersonal skills be willing to
listen to people to be open-minded go
out meet people talk to people say hey
I'm a developer if you ever need some
work done I can help you out blah blah
blah and you see at first it's going to
take a little bit time depending on
where you live but you you just keep
knocking on doors be a nice guy nice
girl and
you will you will get the gigs you
didn't remember when you're dealing with
people at the end of the day a lot of
the reasons are going to choose you over
somebody else's because they just find
you a pleasant person an honest person
to work with one of the reasons I got
some of my first jobs is for simple
little things for instance I got one of
my biggest contracts with multiple
contracts of a company that had many
small businesses under it it's because
when they came to visit my place they
saw that my I know this is gonna sound
silly they saw that my apartment was
very neat my place was very clean and
neat and I uh I'm just I just I'm just
like that in my life and they assumed
well since this guy's got a pretty neat
apartment you know it's it's not a mess
that means his cold will probably be
clean his work ethic were probably
reflective of that so they were it's
sort of the extended trust so something
as simple as that
having a clean well-kept apartment that
they were able to see was very will help
me to get the gig they told me this like
a year later that was a big part of it
because you gotta remember a lot of
these clients you can tell them I know
this this this this this and this and
this is not but they don't know they
they that's why they're hiring you a
most of them won't know what all that
means they have no way to judge whether
you're a good coder or not so they're
gonna try to judge your ability as a
coder by other things like how you
conduct yourself how you dress if you
return calls if you polite this sort of
thing this is a very important something
that a lot of coders overlook I think
because they're so concerned about the
tech so consider bad interpersonal
relationships how you present yourself
how you treat others big part of being
successful freelancer and in all
business by the way and the other thing
this is gonna sound kind of strange when
you start getting a lot of contracts and
they will come what you're gonna see as
a freelancer it comes in waves comes in
ways you've got nothing you got nothing
else on boom you've got old cards you
don't know what to
at all the work and then it'll come down
yeah and it will be like this the key to
success I find is through rad
application development rapid have a
rapid application development strategies
and realization that the most web
projects most apps not just web most
apps they'll hit a stalling point at
about three-quarters of the way through
its very strange it's just the way I
guess psychology is in humans you're
gonna get through the first draft and
then you're gonna deliver you know
ninety percent of work and then there's
gonna be this long drawn-out process and
a lot of times projects is fade into
non-existence so with that in mind you
want to work as quickly as possible to
get those first two thirds done in terms
of feature set so that means not going
crazy to make rock-solid code first time
around you just tighten up that code you
do all that heavy lifting at the tail
end of the project because you'll find
many of times you could get paid
three-quarters of the project only right
25 to do only 25% of the work and then
the work then the project sort of fades
away I've seen that happen so many times
not just with me with other people as
well so I talked about that in previous
videos and way in the past
writing beta code up until you get 3/4
of the payment because a lot of times
that would be it you will never have to
write anything more but beta code and as
you know if you're a developer you know
that's where a lot of work is a lot of
the work is going from a system that's
fully functional but full bugs work with
bugs rather and taking it from a fully
functional but buggy state to the non
buggy state that's where a lot of the
work takes place and a lot of times
you'll never have to take it past that
beta stage because I just see it so many
times people have different ideas the
businesses decide yeah we're not going
to pursue it anymore so you start doing
that and you start
coming insanely profitable because your
time is maximized so for instance if you
follow the strategy what you files you
do 25% of the work and get 75% of the
pay and this will happen more than once
that's for sure and if you do the math
you see how your rate per hour will just
skyrocket right if I don't know if that
makes any sense if that doesn't make any
sense let me know in a comment below and
I'll address it but I hope I hope it
does so there there are my two tips
interpersonal relationship delivering
beta code and getting paid 75% and this
way you're gonna be making much more
money per hour as a developer and
finally well they went finally when
choosing your languages shoot I know
this question is going to come up when
choosing your languages which is the
best language which is the best
framework check out your area check out
what where the demand is it's very
regional oftentimes it also depends on
the type of work you want to do and I've
talked about this in other videos I
won't here so that's pretty much it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
