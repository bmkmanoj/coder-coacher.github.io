vlog so let me just load this up here so
a few days ago I did this vlog your code
boot camps in 2017-18 and in that vlog I
basically well I took shots at code
camps because I said at the end of the
day you're going to come out of a cold
camp with ten five ten twenty thousand
and debt and you're still going to be a
junior coder whether you'd spend six
months or a year at it and so Michael
Thomas right here who was a fellow
youtuber and developer he said in
response to my comment I'll just read it
you're going to be a junior coder at the
end of the day and he writes I'd say
that's a fair synopsis it's taken me
three years to feel competent at this
stuff and I still think I'm just
scratching the surface so there's a
couple comments automate now one of the
universal principles I've identified is
that three-year mark to become a pro
I've seen that in so many different
places Muslim when I've seen that in a
few different places I've seen it with
software development I've seen it with
business and if we're seeing it with
martial arts amongst other places
writing excetera excited cetera the
three-year mark is that traditional time
frame that it takes become a quote
unquote black belt in traditional
martial arts and that is the beginning
of what I was considered to be pro level
developer I seen that - of people work
for me I would bring in junior
developers and again it takes about
three years for them to become pro level
and very useful where I don't have to
manage them closely now in addition to
that since we're on the subject there's
another level the level of mastery of a
particular subject and that level is
takes about 10 years to reach where you
really are at a very high level where
you have a deep
deep understanding of a particular
subject and again I've seen this the
first time in my life with more shots
and actually remember when I was hitting
around that 10-year mark in my training
and I remember what my perceptions of
things are really starting to change
radically where I got a real deep
understanding of fighting in general
martial arts in general and all these
years later I still remember sort of
reaching that that level it's kind of a
gradual process but then it's just like
this growing awareness saving with
software development where I would have
these I had this this moment this
epiphanies aha moment where I really had
a good idea of what was going on in that
regard so these are two very consistent
principles a famous author Canadian
author Malcolm Gladwell wrote this book
called outliers where he talks about all
this
and in that book he details something
that anybody has done going poof or
kung-fu for a while would know and he
said that shows all these studies in
different professions from professional
hockey players and whatnot and basically
what the study shows takes 10,000 hours
to master any given subject and he
breaks it down and he says it on average
it takes the average person about 10
years to be able to devote to be able to
devote 10,000 hours into the training
and the study and skill development to
to hit that level of mastery which is
kind of funny because in kung fu 400
years of leaves they used to say or they
still say one of the expressions it
takes 10 years to master kung fu it
takes 10 years to master of Kung Fu and
sort of sort of goes along with that and
I did the math you train three times a
week you're studying now I'm talking
about actively pursuing and developing
your skills through continuous study and
more importantly actually building
things and doing things while martial
arts not building please actually you
know sparring and fighting and training
with new teachers and
studying new techniques and doing a lot
of drills and saving it can be said with
software development web design or web
development etcetera whatever whatever
language whatever technologies you're
pursuing I say that three in that 10
year rule does apply this is these are
two examples of universal principles
truth if you will that transcend all
disciplines yep so that's pretty
accurate three years to become confident
quote pro level and ten years to hit
total like true mastery of a particular
subject not a master a master is very
rare in my martial arts career I was
added actively for 25-30 years or
something like that depending on how you
look at it and in that timeframe I may
have met one or two true masters of
martial arts and so there's a lot of
people out there who call themselves
masters but they're not because a lot of
people with dildos will train for one or
two or three to four years and then
they'll just do the same thing over and
over again not really trying to expand
her abilities and their knowledge and
their skill sets it says something to be
considered
now people who hit true mastery they
continue to study to continue to evolve
that's why I talk about once you've
mastered a lot of master once you hit a
pro level with whatever languages or
api's or frameworks you want to work
with then I suggest it's a good idea to
start exploring other programming
languages other frameworks other ways of
coding because it's going to open your
eyes up to things and I remember like I
cut my my teeth in web development back
in the 90s and I remember what I jumped
into building dick climbs traditional
absolute run on desktop computers and I
used to think that writing apps for
desktop computers was actually harder
that was my impression of it from a web
development point of view but in fact
what actually got into writing apps for
Windows
I found actually how I was surprised at
how easy it was compared to the web
stack you know because he didn't have
all these layers and so on top to
contend with anyway that's another story
yes pro level at three years and mastery
at ten years
now when I say pro level out three years
it doesn't mean that you can't get a job
after six months of training or encoding
not at all you can get a job but you're
going to be a junior developer and
you're going to make junior developer
money at first now there are ways around
that of course so that you can jump into
maximum earning much more quickly when
you would otherwise but I'll have to
leave that to another vlog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
