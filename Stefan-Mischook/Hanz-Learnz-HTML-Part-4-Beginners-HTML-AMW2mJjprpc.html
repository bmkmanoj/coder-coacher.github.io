basic page I mentioned before I'm just
gonna shut this down let me just make
sure I'm gonna open that again edit with
no pad now this is one way you can do
you can open up an Internet Explorer and
just hit edit with notepad but if you're
using another web browser you won't have
that option on Mac you won't have the
option so you might have to go in there
just hit and then you're gonna hit open
with and then you might have to choose
no pad from there cheers notepad yeah so
choose a default program you would have
to set you would have to browse and
select it and select notepad that's one
way you can do it but the easiest way to
do it you're just a let's open up an
Internet Explorer and it hit edit with
notepad that makes it so simple yeah so
in here anything that appears in that
main window the viewable part of the web
page has to appear between the body and
the body tags right and we just pasted
some text in here not a problem with
that it's sort of just floating out
there willy-nilly and web browser is
very forgiving so it displays a text but
the problem with that is that there's no
way to now really format the way this
text looks on the page what would it
look like if you saved it let's just say
that don't take a look again as I see so
you don't you know in a code yeah and
done separate lines is all there on the
same line yes so that's where HTML will
help us out so let's jump into the HTML
now and we'll see what we're doing so
file it with notepad let me just back up
here when I go view source you cannot
edit this this view source only allows
you to to look at the code you can't
actually edit the code and save it you
can look but you can't touch exactly
easier to just go into internet internet
explore it with notepad so what we're
going to do now is learn a new tag p
so we're going to close our tag and p of
course short for paragraph paragraph so
we put yeah i know what that is a few
paragraphs in there let's say that see
what it looks like i'll just refresh
refresh and through separate lines let's
see so the paragraph tags tells it to
start a new paragraph exactly and by
starting a new paragraph in density now
some of you might be thinking while you
ask if that's what it looks like in cold
but i'll prove a point right now so it's
going to file it with notepad and i'm
just going to remove any of spaces so
i'll save that so what's this gonna do
let's put this year so you see you right
nothing happened exactly because how the
code is laid out in the page whether
their spaces or no spaces etc whether
it's like this I'll squish together or
like this doesn't matter doesn't matter
doesn't matter what matters is how you
use your HTML tags to lay out all these
things in your page that doesn't isn't
it good to make people read some messy
messy code I mean if some people will
write very messy Council one of the
things that makes a good web designer
from a bad web designers a good web
designer knows how to write clean
structured code right so it should still
look good exactly i got it we were
talking about clean code and so I want
to cover a couple quick little I don't
know how she described it nerd details
here notes so one thing we've been
looking at is how we have tags that are
inside of or nested in other tags so we
have for instance this title tag is
nested inside of these head tags right
one thing you're going to do is you're
going to properly nest the tags you
really like eggs in the nest exactly so
one of them to clip to fall out exactly
cell for instance this tight
tag here that's the opening after
closing if it's inside the head right
you're going to be sure that the closing
of the title tag is also inside the head
it's like for instance let me just cut
this out you don't know in a good half
of the egg shell outside of the nest
exactly so take that see that's wrong
all right now that can cause some
problems sometimes the problems are not
obvious and later on in the course we
may be able to demonstrate some more
obvious problems that this could cause
but essentially you just want to take
away from this point of the videos that
you don't want to improperly nest your
tag you want to make sure everything is
properly nested it tags need to stick
together now of course the web browsers
are very forgiving me know them web
designers can make mistake but it could
cause subtle problems that can become
major problems as your website's become
more complex yeah they've paid for this
video then I want to learn how to do it
right so I'm going to cut that paste
that back so it just is properly done
right and say that next I'm going to do
is modes let's learn another tag this is
exciting okay can go up and build your
own website now this is great sorry so
what's learn another tag h HR this i
knowed i had the flu once it was really
bad and that's what the same name as it
so this is the header tag editor and so
it's h1 and there's six header tags h1
h2 h3 h4 you represent headers as in
think of headers for headlines of
newspaper headlines here like a movie
headline so let's just say that will
take a look at how that looks refresh
it's big so the header makes text bigger
or the title now let's create another
header and we'll make it a header three
so I headed
listen it'd be bigger wasn't there sweet
header 13 we'll see what happens it's
smaller so the way headers work is that
header one is considered more important
than head of three so the browser makes
it being around the page but I say and
of course had a four would be less
important than head of three and so on
so this leads us to something else about
HTML and HTML tags HTML tags provide not
just a structure from a page but they
provide a logical meaning to the page so
by having a header you're telling the
web browser that this is a headline text
right and by having a paragraph you're
telling the browser that this is a
paragraph of text with talking to the
browser saving with the body the body
tag tells the browser does the body of
the document that's what should show up
in the page and we were introduced to
bed earlier on where we had HTML or HTML
the HTML tag was tolerating the browser
but this was the beginning of HTML code
I can't get it the browser is basically
dumb we need to tell it everything
exactly I got it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
