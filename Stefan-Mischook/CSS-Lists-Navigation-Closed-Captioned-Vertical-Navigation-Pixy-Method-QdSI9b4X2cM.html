work with basic images and the technique
that we used was using or utilizing two
different images one for the regular
state the a or even the a link state if
you're working used to working with a
links inside of Dreamweaver or CSS and
we had one for the a and one for the
a:hover and there were two different
images as we can see here in the assets
window
we have one that says be up and one that
says be over so in other words when
we're rolling over these the hover is
swapping out the original image and
replacing it with this second image so
why did I mention that there was another
way of doing this that might even be a
little bit better
well let's understand first and foremost
that the technique that I used here two
different images up and over what's good
about it is that we didn't write out the
text ourselves the text was actually
written out in CSS which is great
because now I could just come over here
go into my list item and create another
list or like we said before you can just
put your cursor here press return write
out some words here we go some words and
as soon as we turn this list item into
something that has a link just by
putting a pound symbol or some other
link bang we now have another a element
and it's perfect it looks exactly the
same as everything else the text is
there so I didn't need to write text on
each one of these so that's really good
it's one good thing about the technique
that we used now something else that you
would notice if we were doing this with
JavaScript is that most of the time
especially if you're working with
Dreamweaver it'll also include a little
script that says preload the second
image so in other words preload images
would ensure that when I am online if
you're previewing this locally on your
machine you probably won't have anything
of note but as soon as you put these
HTML files onto a server when you roll
over the first image
it's gonna take you know a brief you
know glimpse of time especially if
there's small images like the ones that
I have here and you'll notice you know
there's a 3k size which is not really
much but what would happen is if that
image that second image was not
preloaded then the first image that I or
the first link that I would rollover
there'd be a slight glitch a little
hiccup that would sort of blink and once
we had all of the second images loaded
once just the one second image be over
once that was loaded the other ones
would be you know perfectly fine
no problem whatsoever and as you can see
here in the live view it would work just
like this and everything would be
exactly the way I want it to however
it's just that first image if the second
at that first time if the second image
is not loaded and what's gonna happen is
it's going to take a second just load
that so one way to get around this I'll
go back to my regular view one way to
get around this is to use something
called the pixie rollover technique and
in this technique we have one long image
that represents both states in this case
it's the you know opposite way around I
should have put the dark blue first
rather than the light blue but
nevertheless we can get around this so
let's see how we can go about working
with this here if I select my first
regular state the a state instead of
using the beat up I'm gonna say let's
use the pixie rollover method if I
choose and say okay and if we apply this
let's see what's happening well look
we're still positioning it on the bottom
and we're still positioning it left and
that's perfect but we're saying no
repeat the only reason we're not seeing
the second part of this image is simply
because we have the image size exactly
the size of 200 which is what my a tags
were defined as so because of that the a
tags are 200 it's only showing half of
the image so on one state in fact I'm
going to change it I'm going to make the
position B on the right and you
see what happens when we press apply so
it's the dark portion it's it's
basically aligning things on the right
hand side so we'll click okay then if I
go to the hover State I'm gonna go to
the background choose the pixie rollover
and we'll leave this one on the left
so if we click okay let's look in the
live view and you can see what happens
look it looks great everything is just
the same and you might be saying well
what's the difference well remember
because it's loaded one image it doesn't
need to preload the second state so all
we're doing is shifting it from one side
to the next when we create the rollover
and that creates a beautiful
navigational element that you can work
with and like I said it's very easy for
you to you know take this li information
you can even come in here and copy it
paste it down here I could say more
words for example and no matter how many
of these you add what's gonna happen is
you will have more and more of these
files showing up so here in the live
view we can see that the more words is
showing up just the same words and the
rest of the ones in our links so it's
all worked out super nice very
beautifully and we've only got one image
to do it with very nice technique called
the pixie rollover method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
