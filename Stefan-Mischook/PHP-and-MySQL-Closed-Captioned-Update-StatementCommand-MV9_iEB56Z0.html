look at is the update statement the
update statement of course allows us to
update our database record so of course
I prepared something for us and I'm
going to walk you through this
particular SQL statement so update or
command and then the name of the table
in this case it's the people table
inside of killer and we set this is
another keyword set name this is the
name of the field or of a column so they
set that the name of the name column to
Jimmy the Frog again because it's text
we're putting inside of quotes here and
this is important we have to tell it
what particular row what particular
record we want to update the name so
this is where we use the ID field as our
unique key ID equals 3 remember I was
talking about primary keys in the insert
video where we needed a primary key and
a table to be able to identify a
particular record because we set the ID
field as being the unique key in that we
know for sure but there's only one
record in that table that has an ID of
three mysql is able to identify the
right record that we want to update so
let's try this out so hit go and we get
this right here this is a message from
my SQL Server saying affected rows one
Khoury took this much time and we see
the quarry so let's let's check it out
see how it works so we automatically PHP
and mine men insert to select statement
for us so we just hit go and sure enough
the record each of these is a record one
record to record three records etc
each of these records has the a new
unique ID and of course the one with
unique idea three it was valuable set to
juvie of a frog so there you go that is
the update statement what say we want to
change the value of ID three excuse me
the name record with of ID of three
right we want to change it to name feel
to something else we can call it Steph
the Frog so we just go go go back here
now we do a select again as we can see
Steph a frog so that's the update
statement again update can do much much
much more and we'll get into that a
little bit more when we're actually
doing some PHP with mysql
before we leave the update video I just
want to cover one simple thing what
would happen if we don't tell it what id
what role we want to effect so we remove
the where clause that's sort of like an
if right and if statement and PHP so now
we're just saying update the table
people set the name field to juvie to
frog so we're not saying telling mysql
what particular record we want to update
so what happens so we know what the
query was effective so we go okay we go
go and as we can see everything's been
set to Jimmy frog now this is a problem
because well you can see how we just
lost our data so it's a you can see how
having unique key can help us to
identify a very particular records</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
