day today so hot tea
is required so I'm going to answer a
couple questions that were put to me on
the youtubes and yeah so hey Steph how
would you answer to someone who says
with freelancing now you have all these
bosses your clients so when you're
freelancing are you trading up one boss
for many I'll get to that in about two
seconds what are the main reasons you
want to become a freelancer is personal
freedom nobody can tell you when to show
up when to work what jobs you're gonna
do that's fantastic
freedom is huge right because everybody
works well at least the old generation
they would work their entire lives so
they could retire and then do what they
want but if you're a freelancer you can
do that right away I think that alone is
a reason to become a freelancer but
guess what there are other reasons to
become a freelancer sorry the lens is a
little dirty I'm just gonna wipe off
this all right good
you need your video recording tools
right anyway yeah what's the other
reason become a freelancer you can make
a lot of money if you structure your
freelance business properly so let's get
back to the question as to whether or
not you are trading one boss if you work
for somebody versus many bosses if
you're a freelancer that is only the
case if you make a big mistake with your
freelancing career and that big mistake
is to have just a few clients or heaven
forbid just one or two big clients
because if you only have one or two big
clients they will know that they are
your only client and I can tell you most
of the time they're going to start
abusing you as a result they'll start
pushing you around etc etc because they
know that you are dependent on them so
something I've been saying for
200,000 years now I rather have a
hundred small clients than five big
clients once again I rather have a
hundred small clients in five big
clients why because when you have US
hundred small clients it's really easy
to fire about one client or if that two
clients why could you have another 98
clients that are paying your bills and
what ultimately happens is when you have
a lot of clients the other clients they
can smell that they can smell that in
you they can smell that confidence
especially if you if you have a few
money it's even more confidence and when
people smell that you have confidence
because you've got 99 clients or 1020
clients versus two or three they're not
going to want to push you around and
also they're going to start valuing you
more when something is perceived as
being valuable its value its perceived
value goes up so you treat it
differently so if you are a developer a
web developer a wordpress developer
whatever type of developer whatever type
of freelancer in fact and you have a
stable of clients they'll see it they'll
feel it and they will not even try at
least most of them they won't try to
push you around and if they do you just
give them the old boot because you got a
whole bunch of other ones so to answer
the question if you have just one or two
big clients it can actually be worse
than working for somebody in terms of
your lack of freedom because the big
because if you're just a contractor to
them and your skill sets are not super
super rare they're going to start
pushing you around they're not going to
teach you necessarily the same respect
that they might treat you if you're
working for them because you're their
full-time it's hard to say everything's
different everybody's different some
people will be great but if you want to
maximize your chances of maximum
flexibility maximum control match
maximum respect from the people that you
deal with as or freelancers you don't
want to have big clients you would have
many small clients that is the key to
not having many bosses or replacing your
one boss for a few small freelancing
bosses so yeah that's the key
many clients it's also just a good
safety strategy a diversification
strategy same thing and investing
investing you never know what's gonna go
up you don't know what's gonna go down
you may be a hundred percent sure that
those bitcoins are gonna go to a hundred
thousand but you never know for sure and
only a fool puts all their investments
all their eggs in one basket it's such
an old concept that they even talked
about eight hundred thousand years ago
they say don't put your eggs all your
eggs in one basket cuz you've dropped a
basket you kill all your eggs you're
finished so investing one of the things
I can tell you from hard to earned
experience is you never know what's
gonna work you know what's gonna not
gonna work and you got to spread your
money around so that you're
psychologically much more relaxed hey
you put a bit of money in Bitcoin their
money and houses but money in this stock
a bit of money and stocks in asia a bit
of money and silver a bit of money you
know what I mean if you spread your
investments around yeah you won't get
you you won't get that maximum hit if
that if you put all your money into
Bitcoin and went to the roof or you put
all your money into Apple ten years ago
and have jumped up 20 30 times of course
yeah but also if Nortel which was a huge
powerful company up in Canada 10-15
years ago if you had all your money
there like people I know and went to
zero and you lost everything here in a
bad shape so you want to spread your
money around and you want to spread your
risk and same thing with your clients
you would have many small clients so you
could roll them meaning you know when
you're getting into the projects anybody
will tell you as a freelancer you start
off with a client and they'll bring you
the basic specs and you work it out and
you bring the first draft and they'll
get back to you then you bring the
second draft and it takes them three
months before they give you a response
and you finally need to give you a
response you bring them the last draft
the second draft rather and then it
takes six months before it finally ends
because they're you know they're busy
they're doing this they're doing that to
do any other thing and you're not
getting paid meanwhile so if you have
many many many many contracts from many
different clients you have a lot of
freedom you roll them meaning
if Klein a is taking their sweet time
which happens often enough you can just
belong to client BCDE
so the key is to have a stable of
clients and to just be able to work off
of them and this way you won't be the
you won't be there I won't say the word
I was going to say but you won't be
under their control you won't be under
their thumb you have a lot of
flexibility you have the diversification
in terms of income strange of a
diversification in terms of the
distribution of work and you're gonna
feel so much more comfortable because
you know that you've got 1020 clients
that you can depend on or 30 clients or
so that makes any sense
so yes I even advise when you're getting
out there be very reluctant to try to
deal with the big companies because
they're gonna they're gonna they're
gonna throw their weight around they
usually do unless you have some super
rare skill that's really hard to
reproduce but that's extremely rare so
that's my advice on that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
