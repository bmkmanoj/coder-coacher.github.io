we're going to be talking about in this
next tutorial is working with the
Dreamweaver interface getting used to
what's going on inside of Dreamweaver
setting things up the way we like them
and getting a little bit more familiar
with what we're going to be doing in the
upcoming videos that you'll be taking a
look at soon enough so first and
foremost I guess to get us all on the
same page if you've opened up
Dreamweaver already if you've messed
around with things and if you've done
different things like that what I'd like
to show you is that you can go to the
window menu up at the top of Dreamweaver
this one right here and you'll notice
that there are workspace layouts in
other words what your Dreamweaver
interface looks like and as you can see
there are a number of different
workspaces that you can choose from app
developer app developer plus the classic
one which is the one that I'm using at
the moment coder coder plus designer
designer compact squeezing things down
dual screen if you happen to have a dual
screen setup at home or as you can see
you are also able to create a workspace
or in other words get the windows
exactly the way you want them to
eliminate remove things that you don't
often use or whatever the case may be
and then you could save this workspace
new workspace and for example I had
created one called basic recording that
I can choose whenever I want to however
what I want us to do is to choose the
classic and if you had chosen classic
and let's say you accidentally closed a
couple of windows or something along
those lines you can also just reset your
classic so if I do that you can see that
I've got this showing up in this fashion
notice that instead of always having to
go to the window menu and access your
workspace layout there you can just do
so directly from this top part of your
screen here and you'll notice it says
classic and there are all of those list
elements that we saw just a little bit
earlier so let's set our workspace to
classic and that'll give us all the same
defining environment that we can work in
so there's a lot of features and
side of Dreamweaver and some look rather
intimidating when you're taking a look
at all these buttons and bells and
whistles and things that we can see in
front of us however don't be overly
concerned about every single one of
these elements because we're going to be
approaching them in a step-by-step
fashion we'll be looking at things a
little bit more in-depth when we need to
work with them so in other words for
example Adobe browser lab is a new
feature actually it's been around but
it's a new integration into Dreamweaver
with cs5 and we'll be looking at that at
a much later date although if you have
it open I'd just like you to have it
closed so if it is closed and you want
to know how to open something it's just
like any other Adobe application if you
double-click on the name you can see
that it'll open up double click on it
again it'll collapse notice that there
are these little arrows here on the side
if you collapse that you can see things
with their icons and you can also see
their names these however can also be
made smaller just by moving them in that
fashion as you can see here so you
position your mouse right at this point
you'll see the left and the right arrow
allowing you to move that and again if
you open that up you get the regular
amount that we see here you can collapse
it and if you wish as I mentioned by
moving them down in this fashion you can
just have access to the icons as opposed
to any other elements that are in here
like the names of these files so this is
a great way for you to work if you have
a limited amount of real estate which
can be a problem especially if you're
recording your screen at 1024 as I am
but nevertheless it is just a nice way
for you to sort of customize your screen
get things working exactly the way you
want them to look I'm going to expand
this and I'm going to open them up as
you can also see these little tabs allow
you to click through the different tab
windows and that's not unusual for
anybody who's worked with Adobe
applications before I just want to bring
to your attention though that you can
move
these little windows so that their
standalone floating windows as this one
is right here let's say I want to move
it back I didn't actually want to move
this out of its confines so it's not a
matter of taking the dark screen here
now look if I were to close this bang
it's gone oh no where did my CSS window
go whenever you accidentally close a
window or do anything like that just
come back to the window menu and in the
window menu we can now open up that CSS
Styles in there it is right so the
window menu gives you access to all
kinds of windows that you may or may not
already have open so if I want to move
it back in you got to take it by its
name CSS Styles and I'll click on that
and I'll drag it and notice when I do
drag it you'll see that it highlights it
becomes transparent and you'll see like
the little blue highlighting the area
that it wants to drop into there you go
and then you can move it to be the first
one in this list if you wish among other
things again you could just double click
it and collapse it if you need as well
so all of these different windows are
going to be very important for us when
we're working inside of Dreamweaver and
I'll explain the vast majority of them
to you in this Dreamweaver tutorial the
last thing I want to talk to you about
well actually maybe not the last thing
but one of the last things I'll talk to
you about is this window right here it's
called the properties window and the
properties window is one of the most
important elements of Adobe Dreamweaver
applications you'll find one inside of
Dreamweaver as we see right here and
you'll also find one inside of flash cs5
as well if you've ever worked in those
two programs then you've seen these
before however if you're new to
Dreamweaver or flash for that matter the
properties window acts in a similar
fashion in both applications basically
or essentially anything that you select
in your HTML page or in your code view
or anything like that when you select an
item the properties window gives us
information about that item and it
allows us to do a number of things it
allows us to you know convert simple
unstyled text into something that is a
our graph or headline among other things
we can also do other things like work
with CSS as we can see here with the IDs
and classes and you know we can create
list items among other things and we'll
get into that a little bit more in
detail when we examine things closer
when we're opening up an HTML page and
we can take a better look at what's
going on with it all so let's take a
look at a couple of other things up here
at the top you'll see now I don't really
have anything happening inside of
Dreamweaver but let's say I were to
create a new HTML page if I did that on
this welcome screen you'll notice a
couple of things that we can see here
with the HTML document now I haven't
saved it or done anything like that yet
but we'll get to that eventually we can
determine how we want our screen to look
and as you can see we'll get into what
code split design and live view is in a
neck in another video but we can
determine how things look by choosing
our layout right up here we can choose
from a number of different ones and we
can decide whether or not we want to
have our code and our design views right
next to each other there's also elements
here like being able to extend
Dreamweaver with the extension manager
which of course we'll talk about later
and there's also the abilities of
defining sites and managing your sites
but that's something that we're going to
be again discussing in the next video as
well as also means of searching CS live
is a service that we'll discuss in
future but this is probably the most
readily available and widely used
element inside of Dreamweaver and that
allows us to insert elements this is
called the insert window now the insert
window can be a separate window right
now I'm in classic mode but if I was you
know for example here's my basic
recording mode that I talked to you
about before and you could see that my
inserts here I'll just collapse this and
this my inserts here are visible on this
long set of lists over there if you
don't like that you can go back to your
classic recording your classic mode I
should say rather and you can come in
here and say I would like to insert
as you can see a hyperlink or an email
link or an anchor or a horizontal rule
or tables or divs and images among other
things or media like flash and other
things like that you can see the SWF for
Flash among other things so there's a
lot of different elements also comments
and stuff like that but notice you can
also insert layouts specifically form
elements data elements if you're working
with dynamic information spry elements
which are JavaScript generated
navigation elements among other things
in context editing text different text
stylings and some favorites that you can
control click to customize however the
common ones are the ones that will
oftentimes be seeing so based on this
we've sort of taken a look at the basic
interface just a little bit here nothing
really too in-depth but what we're going
to be doing in the next one is talking
about our different views how we can
view our web pages inside of Dreamweaver
and what we're going to be doing with
all of this once we get started so we'll
do that in the next video
stick around come back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
