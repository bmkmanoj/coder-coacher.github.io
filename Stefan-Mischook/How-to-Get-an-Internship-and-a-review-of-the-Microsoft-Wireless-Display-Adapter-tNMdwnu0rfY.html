say ask they said I'd like to get an
internship I would do it right away I
mean in boot camp I would get an
internship every way if I could so what
you should do to get an internship is
number one you have to have at least
some basic skills you got to be
productive in some way so if you were
say want to get into web development you
should come to HTML and CSS you know a
little bit of JavaScript and maybe
understand at least the basics of
server-side development regardless of
the language let's say it's PHP a little
bit of PHP you know I know how the basic
process of the request response cycle
works in regard to PHP and all this kind
of stuff whatever node etc etc once you
have at least the basics so you're able
to go in there create a simple project
maybe tweak some other projects then you
can approach companies and say listen
I'm looking for an internship this is my
skillset is what I can do and I'll work
for free for two months something like
that and how do you find these people
you just look in the area look for local
firms that do what you want to do give
them a call who knows you may get
rejected 20 times but you never know
just call them up and wanted to work for
free I'm productive I'm very eager to to
help you guys out and for me I just want
to learn that's it and you see what
happens you just got to reach out start
talking to people and that's the way to
do that so let me close this video and
talk about this Microsoft thingamajigger
so what does this thing do this is the
equivalent of the chromecast and to a
lesser extent maybe Apple TV more like a
chromecast chromecast is Google's device
where you hook up to your TV by HDMI
then you're able to project from your
laptop from your smartphone you're onto
your TV and that's it so this is the
same thing for Microsoft ok what they
call it now and anyway don't buy it
don't buy Microsoft's equivalent to the
chromecast I bought this cost me like 50
bucks and the bloody thing doesn't work
most of the time and I connect it using
my surface pro 4 not quite the flagship
but right up there
very similar most powerful machines and
it's stutters so you're trying to play
video or audio and then it just drops it
just stutters it doesn't buffer properly
so you're listening to you're watching a
video doesn't matter if it's in SD or HD
and the thing just dropped click click
and start sputtering along never works I
just got the chromecast couple days ago
for video it's flawless it's flawless
from my phone I click Play HD video no
problem never stutters doesn't buffer
very long it's almost instant I got a
moderate Wi-Fi connection works
amazingly well so don't buy this doesn't
work Microsoft once again dropping the
ball as they always do it's unbelievable
you know it's unbelievable it's just
through legacy that they're able to make
it by because the products are so
inconsistent you know they're so
inconsistent reliability is just not
there I remember I remember when dotnet
came out whatever 1999 if it was or 2000
it was 99 and I at that point I was
heavy into Java and so I'd say I'm going
to take a look at dotnet specifically
c-sharp dotnet so I took a nap that I
built a web app that it goes in
Java gem DSP service with Java beans and
I basically cloned it in asp.net c-sharp
to see how would go and as is typical of
Microsoft on the outside looks shiny and
cool we can do this could you back but
whenever you deviate just a little bit
from the core the whole thing starts
falling apart it's just like a disaster
I remember at the time the driver to be
able to connect from asp.net c-sharp -
sequel server Microsoft's database
server it didn't work at the time I
couldn't get the connection could it
just didn't work so I remember so
frustrated that you have to do with JDBC
Java the job away is they put no problem
so even within Microsoft ecosystem it
was falling down it was failing whereas
Java connecting to Microsoft's database
server it was no problem eventually I
got things to work with dotnet but it
was it's difficult Microsoft they if you
stay within their narrow confines and
things weren't good as soon as you want
to go outside of me you've done and
that's why like I was talking about the
surface pro by a year ago is really good
yeah it many respects the user interface
and you know and touch all this kind of
stuff with surface pro and Windows 10
it feels very advanced it feels like
love is a great operating system this is
like the new way of doing things and you
go back to Mac OS Mac OS seems a little
antiquated now like the windowing is not
as good as it is on Windows and so on
but at the end of the day Mac OS is
1,000 times more stable
it just works it's just solid it just
works
that's the big difference between
Microsoft products and other companies
like Google chromecast it just works
which really well Microsoft's version it
breaks doesn't work it's not usable not
usable just clips and Falls and I've
done all the update chromecast fantastic
same thing with Windows it seems
when those ten keeps updating itself
every three minutes and sometimes the
updates are really great and sometimes
the updates are they're terrible and
it's unbelievable to me that they do
that your recent update of Windows 10 I
just updated a few weeks of the watch a
few days ago person it's really nice it
really did a good job as time around but
then I think to myself what's going to
happen in three weeks when they do
another update and they start breaking
everything it's hard to use a platform
where you're constantly faced with
frustrations because of instabilities
and so forth with Mac it just works yeah
you pay more but you know what it just
works
anyway things no it's not a Windows
bashing thing I was here to patch this
thing here so don't buy this windows if
you want to project video from your
laptop or your smartphone to your TV get
the chromecast 100,000 times better
all right Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
