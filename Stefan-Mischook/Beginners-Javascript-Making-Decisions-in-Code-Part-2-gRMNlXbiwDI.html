getting this really strange behavior
where you know string index of hello
which should return one right because
age all right that's the first things
first letter in a string at sea so it
will give you will give you zero and it
was still giving me true I was like
class has given me true it makes no
sense I thought did I forget to me about
JavaScript see it's it's a it's true
right ouch ouch even though and I'm
saying and then I said okay what's
console.log daft to confirm sodastream
index of hello right hello spring hello
and it should it should be we should get
zero right because disappeared right
I'll just make it simple let's go ahead
love H so we know that in string we have
h and it should work right so we go back
here yeah why is it give me a lot-
when's it going to index of H doesn't
exist in this string but it does and you
can see how the console can come in
handy when you're debugging so there's a
little bug here I'm wondering what the
bug is and I just remember to look at
this line here right we changed it to
uppercase C string is equal streamed out
up okay so now it's not hello it's
actually all uppercase so doesn't make
any sense so if I make this upper keeps
age then watch what happens now we get 0
right position 0 so here we go so that
was the key right so what I'm going to
do you go back to North lowercase so i'm
going to show you something called a
comment now comment is this something
you creating javascript by credit
putting two slashes in front of your
code to forward slash slashes it's
called a forward slash chris is kind of
leaning forward think of somebody
standing lean forward to for slashes and
you see the text editor here that's
JavaScript's ave Nils that this is a
comment so graze it out for us what this
basically does when you have two slashes
like that it tells JavaScript to skip
this line of code here and don't process
it
so now that I've done this this should
work out as we expect so string that
index of hello we know it there is a
value of heirs of this it's not equal to
minus one so we should see ouch see what
happens there we go ouch and refreshes
again oh I go save excuse me let me try
it again okay that makes x0 right string
right buyers at 0 because it's not equal
to minus 1 so we should not see out
right so that makes sense as you can see
sometimes when doing the videos i even
get confused with the logic here i'm not
a very logical guy but you can see that
things are working now so it's pretty
cool so index of H console dot log do we
get its get position 0 and this didn't
appear because this of course was minus
one was not equal to this is going to
help put in this looking output 0 of
course how about we say put the
exclamation point here and this is not
this means not equal to biz this is like
a shorthand saying saying not equal to
so double let me review that double
equals is is this equal to this right
this is a comparison operator or
comparison we're comparing rather and
then if you put a little ! in front this
is comparing negatively basically we're
saying is this not equal to this and if
it turns out that this is not equal to
this then this will evaluate the
javascript will call that true right
because we're looking to see if it's not
equal so this is not equal to that if
minus 1 is not equal to this then it's
actually true and this should far off
here see what happens let me just say
that launched the page see it fires off
because this becomes true
I hope that makes sense it's a I'm just
curious so you guys see what's going on
here what's going to grab this coffee
that and you'll see if the log spits out
so we'll see what the logs bit self and
in terms of result of this and that
should be interesting see it outputs
true right Castle dialogue and we have
you can do a couple consoles will do
another console here console dot log so
the answer now I have synthesis text I
want it to be text I have to put it in
quotes of course right so let's let's
try that now answer is true there we go
so we know that this returns true now if
I go like this and ago equals so now
we're just comparing if this is actually
equal to this and this being they return
result of what index of will find and
will pull out of the string variable I
hope this is making sense if not go over
again go in previous videos where I talk
about the index of function that's built
into JavaScript and of course we see
false right so as you can see the if
statement is a very first conditional
statement that we've looked at so far
let me just save this and in the if
statement we're able to check to see if
something is true or false sometimes
true or false can be in the form of the
actual true or false the words sometimes
it could be 0 or 1 it really depends on
the specifics and again I know this is
hazy the coin here just to get the basic
idea of the if statement and if it's
used all over the place and it's
probably the most used control flow
statement that's nice what they call it
our conditionals
rather in JavaScript and it's used in
many other languages as well I hope you
got something out of this and in the
next video we're going to get a little
bit deeper into it get some more
