discussing one of the most popular and
widely used of all of the commands
inside a Photoshop and that is the undo
command as you can see here under edit
it's great app temporarily at the moment
but it says undo ctrl Z and there's some
other ones that all show you in just a
second as well for this particular
tutorial I've just opened up ducky TIFF
which was located in the photoshop
samples folder which came with your
program will be looking at ducky a
little bit more when we start fooling
around with some things for this moment
though I'm not really going to be
explaining the tools that i'm using i'm
just going to be explaining how to undo
a particular move that you've made if
you do something that you don't like so
for example if i was to just draw
something on ducky and I recognize that
this is not something I want I can press
ctrl Z or command Z on the mac apples ed
and you'll notice that if i press ctrl-z
again it just comes back well that's
because defaulted inside a Photoshop is
only one undo command and if you want to
go back more than one step as you can
see in your history actions which I'll
show you a little bit later you'd have
to press ctrl alt Z + ctrl alt Z will
allow you to go back more than one step
so notice if I draw something step one
two three four and five if I was
depressed control Z it would only go
back and if i press controls that again
it will bring back that last move but if
i press ctrl alt said that allow me to
go back more than one step so that's a
little bit about the undo command it's
such an important command that you
should not get used to using it through
the Edit menu up on top although that's
where you can access it but take that
well note that you can use ctrl Z alt
ctrl Z to go step backward or shift ctrl
Z to go a step forward remember those
shortcuts you're going to be using them
so often that
you might even want to consider getting
them tattooed on you so that you'll
never forget</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
