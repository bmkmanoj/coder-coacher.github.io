vlog I'm going to try to make this quick
it's like my fifth take on this what are
the four elements of a successful
entrepreneur if you're a nerd programmer
you still want to listen to this because
it's gonna help you to understand the
business world a little bit which will
help you to understand how you might get
a job more easily how you might start
freelancing more easily great
freelancers by the way have some
business skills so that they can
communicate with their target audience
because there's a freelancer most likely
either to be working with small business
owners so you can talk a little shop
with them you can talk with a little
understanding of business with them
you're going to be headed a competition
this survey I haven't mentioned before
but that's a key thing when when nerds
developers understand business
considerations give me a much more
effective freelancer first tip okay the
four elements of successful
entrepreneurs four things you have to
know four basic skills so number one you
need great communication skills written
in verbal I mean that's self-evident I
have spoken to that in the past you need
something called domain knowledge domain
knowledge I will get into that in a
second
you need technology skills believe it or
not now I'm not saying you have to
become a full-fledged developer but
having basic technology skills basic
coding skills will be hugely valuable
for any entrepreneur I will allow you to
make better business decisions be able
to communicate better with any
programmers or developers or web
designers you might hire allow you to
make decisions in terms of what
technology better decisions in terms of
what technology you may implement for
your own business
my recommendation is of course the web
stack because every business needs a
website so your mouse will learn the
languages that make websites and then
the final skill is of course business
skills no I had to get clients how to
manage money how to manage employees
when to get employees all these other
things which I talked about in my course
so I'll leave that aside so let me go
back
number two domain knowledge this I
should explain this is something I don't
hear ever maybe other people are talking
about it but I don't think they do and
this is something that's so important
having domain knowledge and fortunately
for you guys I learned this the hard way
since I started my first business when I
was 18 so that's about 8,000 years ago
so between then and now I've had several
businesses in different domains and
different fields the domain is just a
field a sector so one domain may be at
restaurants I've never domain may be
yoga studio another domain may be
massage to you another domain may be a
web development studio you get the idea
another domain may be manufacturing of
cleaning products right a domain is just
a market sector I think that's clear now
right so why is domain name domain name
why is domain knowledge is so important
for entrepreneurs because having a deep
understanding of a particular domain is
the only real way you will be able to
identify a market opportunity let me say
that again having a deep knowledge in a
particular domain is the only real way
that you might you might be able to
identify a market opportunity a niche
within that domain so when we give you
an example maybe you work in coffee
shops maybe you understand coffee shops
really well because you've been working
with them for a couple years as a waiter
or manager or who knows but you know
coffee shops you know how coffee shops
operate and having worked there for a
couple years perhaps you've identified
identified a consistent problem with
coffee shops something that they don't
do right a product that they don't
provide a type of layout that they don't
do that would appeal to coffee drinkers
I don't know I'm just throwing it out
there again being in the game being
knowledgeable of that domain
allows you to see potential
opportunities right so this happened to
me when I started my very first company
way back in the day pre-internet believe
in a pre-internet I was able to identify
a particular market niche in my domain I
was involved in and I know this is gonna
sound weird by used to keep very
expensive tropical fish as a hobby for
several years and there was a particular
problem in terms of keeping the water
clean for a particularly very popular
species of fish and I'm trying not to go
down this nerd fish rabbit hole but bear
with me anyway so there was this
particular need and I ran across this
obscure product that came out of the
came out of Africa actually through the
US through a US distribution and it
worked amazing has solved this problem
which I knew people like me or would
would love to have this problem solved
in terms of a type of water purification
so by having this deep domain knowledge
I was able to identify a particular need
that needed to be filled I saw an
opportunity in the form of that product
and I knew what the competition might be
because again had domain knowledge I
knew what the other vendors out there
were selling so I proceeded to acquire
exclusivity it rights to distribute that
product up in Canada and Bob's your
uncle that started my business but I was
only able to identify this opportunity
because I had deep domain knowledge in
that particular hobby and I actually had
worked in that industry just for a short
period of time just to get a feel for
what was going on behind the scenes so
yeah I took some really crappy job
working a big tropical fish - stupider
and I went in there and it worked just
three four months just to get a feel for
what it is I worked like the lowest end
of the
terms of the jobs like the lowest end
job but I was in the mix I got to know
the managers and the owners I got to
know what their business was like in a
short period time was extremely useful
in terms of me being able to launch my
own business so domain knowledge domain
knowledge and of course at the time my
partner
it was very experienced on the retail
hand he had worked in high-end pet
stores and stuff for several years so he
had really didn't know it from that
perspective so together we're able to
actually put together enough domain
knowledge be able to assess several ooh
niches to find several niches in that
business in that industry to
successfully launch and grow business
when we were just 18 years old so domain
knowledge is key so that's I hope that
makes sense I hope this lesson comes
through you don't hear people talk about
it domain knowledge is super important
keep that in mind and that's how you
approach business domain knowledge first
you look you develop domain knowledge
you don't just jump into anything blind
which I've done stupidly cost me a lots
of money and lots of headaches so you
don't want to do that domain knowledge
is first and foremost in the meantime
you can still develop your linguistic
skills you're speaking written skills
you can develop your business skills you
can develop your tech skills as well
there you go I hope that's useful and I
hope you like this set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
