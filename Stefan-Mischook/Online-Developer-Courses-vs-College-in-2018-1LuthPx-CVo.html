discuss the pros and cons of learning
with an online platform like Studio web
or going to college or university there
are pros and cons to each and the path
that you choose largely depends on your
personal learning style and your
circumstances so let's quickly get to
the pros of university or college you
have a structure you have set timelines
and schedules so you have to complete
the project by set date you have classes
to attend to so it forces you to to show
up to actually learn you have to go
places to get to class again a lot of
some people anyway need that kind of
structure to motivate themselves that's
cool I have to say though that if you do
need that kind of motivation because
it's boring to you you might not enjoy
the career as a developer as much as you
think right because you're not motivated
the people have the most fun in whatever
career that they pursue it's something
that they do on their own time because
it's fun when I was first learning to
develop in the early 1990s and when I
got really hardcore into it into the mid
nineties it was something that it was a
hobby for me I just like doing it it was
just something I would do Friday night
people what's called party and I think
I'm writing some code here I'm bringing
some coding at this cool new messaging
system I'm building here and you know
sometimes I show up three hours late
sometimes I wouldn't show up because I
got caught up in the coding I was really
into it and because it was fun for me
but then feel like work so hours would
pass like this it was cool though what
happens in that situation not only
you're having fun you're it's like a big
puzzle that you're solving when you're
writing code it becomes extremely
profitable because you get really good
you get really productive all of a
sudden your time is worth a lot more you
can charge a heck of a lot more
a freelancer as a developer it's really
really cool so back to college so the
advantage of the colleges they give you
the structure that you need and they
they lead you there nicely the downside
is that college can be extremely
expensive it does force a particular
structure on you and sense that you have
to show up at particular times to go to
class you have to show up to get your
exams etc some people don't like that
some people would rather have the
freedom house if you're working full
time and you just don't have time to go
to school right this is where the online
classes like mine become extremely
advantageous just a little there no
colleges and lots and lots of school use
studio web in new curriculum so go
college and get the added component that
College provides and you can do studio
up there or you could do it directly
what makes the city web system unique
out there like unique out there in the
world is the way it structures
interactive etc it's like having a
teacher sitting right beside you
teaching you quizzing you giving you
instant feedback anyway it's something
we've developed over seven years with
literally hundreds of thousands of
students we've refined everything that
we do including the software and
curriculum and the content that we
provide in terms of the learning
experience with studio web versus
college or university what's to do web
is very much focused on the actual stuff
that you need to actually move forward
and produce real co-production code it's
very much oriented towards the real
world where as a college which could be
beneficial if they provide a lot of
supporting material around it so you're
going to go off in all these different
directions it'll make you learn this and
make you learn this make you learn this
make it or not they give you a taste of
everything that's the point of college
university is to give you a to expose
you rather to a whole bunch of different
things and what you'll find those you're
only going to use a very small subset of
what you're exposed to in university in
fact you're going to learn
more afterwards probably in terms of
job-ready skills whereas 2d web I teach
the core and that's huge the foundation
as you know you need to have that to
really learn this stuff properly but
because of my two decades of experience
as a professional developer I've
selected the key components that you
need in each of the languages and each
of the frameworks and each of the well
the whole thing to give you that solid
foundation that you can launch into real
world coding so with studio web the
downside is pose is that you have to be
a little bit self-discipline you have to
teach yourself you have to set schedules
it's focused on real world so if you
need to if you feel like you want to
explore all kinds of different things
you're not going to do in studio by
myself but once again if you learn the
core of and all this stuff is all out
there for you fairly cheap or for free
so it gives you that kind of flexibility
so college structure a wider field of
exposure if you will those in terms of
knowledge and that they present to you
the studio web much more flexibility but
you need discipline and it's very
focused on real world coding it's very
focused on getting you up and up and
running quickly so that you can actually
make money with the code and the reason
it's structured that way is because
that's how I did my coding that's how I
learned to my coding that's how I
learned my program it was always always
there for me to use in production I
would learn a new language a new
framework because I needed that to get a
certain job done because I was always
looked at myself rather as entrepreneur
first business person first software
developer second although a lot of my
work was in software development so
those are pros and cons also like the
obvious thing if you used to do EV is
much much less expensive than going to
college and so I don't want disparage
colleges because I work with them and
because for some some college programs
are fantastic but at the end of the day
when you're looking at any type of
course whether it be in college
university or
on line at the end of the day it's the
quality and the knowledge of the
teachers the professor's involved really
make a big difference in terms of the
overall learning experience so if I were
you in terms of whether I would choose
to go to a college or just City web look
at your personal situation do you have
lots of flexibility in terms of your
schedule meaning you can you can
allocate the time and show up and go to
the classroom do you need somebody to to
give you that structure and you want to
take your time and sort of explore all
kinds of different avenues and you've
got the money to spend then you might
want to do the college route but if you
want something that's flat scible
something that you could work on the
weekends or at nights maybe your stay at
home mom maybe you work at a factory and
you want to learn this while you're
still earning and you're learning
earning a living you don't want to get
into debt so she stood alone that I
warned against student loan debt it's
the worst debt you could possibly find
yourself in so don't let yourself get it
to that at the end of the day though the
more you learn the more effort you put
into learning whether it be one of my
research is online or a book or a
college course or private tutoring it's
all gonna help it's all gonna help you
have to choose what's better for you
based on the things I just discussed I
hope this is useful and we shall talk
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
