things in this video first of all I set
up this entrepreneurial and business
playlist and it contains a bunch of
videos right now thirteen evil 13 anyway
we're gonna have to add some more in
here let me know if this type of
playlist is interesting to you if you're
a regular viewer of the channel then
you've probably seen most of these and
also just give me a general idea whether
or not business-oriented an entrepreneur
oriented videos are interesting to you
because I've been a developer since the
90s but I've actually been a
entrepreneur for longer so let me
dovetail in to the subject a bit connect
you've heard about this it's a crypto
currency Ponzi scheme where they promise
I think it was 1% return per day
guaranteed you know that brings up the
oldest rule in business if it's too good
to be true a lot of people got nailed on
this and it's bad I think that financial
illiteracy desperation to make quick
money is the reason why you see these
type of Ponzi schemes exist and I work
in education as you may or may not know
I work for a whole bunch of schools one
of the things I have been talking about
for years is that they should have basic
financial literacy taught from
elementary school why so that this stuff
is absorbed is understood so that people
will be much less likely to get scammed
if they just have a basic understanding
of business now an extension let me just
say that cryptocurrencies in my humble
opinion the cryptocurrencies are all bs
as well and a lot of people get angry
I'm not saying blockchain is BS
blockchain is a technology a distributed
database and they don't claim to be an
expert in blockchain tech but it's a
database it's distributed and it
definitely has application in the real
world now the resulting coins quote
coins and quotes tokens whether it be
Bitcoin if there
Ripple whatever a coin this is just a
classic psychologically driven mania you
have to ask yourself at one point a few
weeks ago the founder one of the
cofounders of ripple one of the top four
or five kryptos this guy this founder
was worth as much as Mark Zuckerberg for
a while and Mark Zuckerberg is the
biggest shareholder of one of the most
profitable and one of the biggest
companies in the world that makes
billions and billions and billions of
dollars every year so on the flip side
you get this guy's a CEO of a
cryptocurrency ripple where it doesn't
actually do much in market doesn't do
anything there's anybody can find it
anybody can create a competitive version
of ripple or any other coin in an
instant
it's silliness that was the as an
ultimate example of how silly this whole
space is again run a point of view of
somebody here me who's been in business
for twenty eight years I've seen
speculative I've seen manias like this
occur on a few occasions and the reasons
that they give you what you read here
about all these YouTube guys elsewhere
why it's going up is the same exact
reasons that they gave for all those
other manias that have peered in time
and the results are always the same but
they'll take my word for it of the most
famous and parently most successful
investor of all time Warren Buffett
believes what I believe you see an acid
is something that has a value based on
its ability to produce some sort of
service or social moocs some sort of
good in the parlance of the Wall
Streeters of the traders you're looking
for a yield what kind of money can a
particular asset throw off so stocks you
buy stocks in theory you get a dividend
you're getting a piece of the company's
profitability in the dividend you buy
bonds you're getting
just paid to you by some government
entity or some big corporation you buy
gold and silver at least gold and silver
there's a speculative gambling aspect to
expect you'll ative speculation is a
fancy Wall Street term for gambling just
like you're gambling on the horses that
go around the track or in China where
they gamble on whether the praying
mantis wins the fight or not
so speculation another word for gambling
and in gold and silver markets there is
an element of speculation there always
is it's human nature why is gambling so
prevalent in human kind mom because of
something basic to all animals basic to
chickens and rats and chimpanzees and
humans and what is that basic instinct
is something called in Express in
psychology rather something called a
mixed variable payoff matrix I study
psychology in university so that is why
all the speculation is so addictive to
everybody cheap easy rewards quick
rewards of uncertain value coming at you
at an uncertain time is very addictive
to even rats so in gold and silver 70
years ago there was this huge run-up not
as much as Bitcoin and crypto but there
was a huge run-up and again all the
people who were pro gold and silver were
all giving the same exact reasons just
about but you see the crypto guys are
giving about cryptocurrencies and
eventually the speculative bubble burst
poof you never know when because it's a
psychological event speculative
when you see stocks bitcoins crypto
currencies gold silver oil whatever when
you ever see something spike up and
value super fast well he saw in cryptos
you know that's all emotionally driven
as opposed to the
boring stocks like ExxonMobil or I don't
pick pick any of these old stocks Mike
big Donald's Exxon where they're kind of
boring they don't go up very fast or
slow but they pay you a dividend that
you know is based on fundamentals you
know that when the stock is just
hovering along not very exciting you
know that it's price is actually a price
based on actual fundamentals based on an
actual value in the underlying assets
whether it be stocks or commodities or
whatever but when you see something go
parabolic when you see something spike
up like crazy I'm talking about the
chart you know that's an emotional event
and anything emotional is very volatile
so you have to be very careful about
these situations and as I said in
previous videos videos vlogs on
cryptocurrencies I had mentioned that
you had to be very cautious about the
cryptocurrencies and since that video
came out the price of Bitcoin has been
basically cut in half now the Bitcoin
proponents say it's going to go back up
no manias can hack it continue for a
while but I'm telling you there's really
no value to Bitcoin because it's
valuable
remember you scratch that the value of
bitcoins in cryptocurrencies is that
you're expecting somebody else to pay
more for them but in of themselves they
don't really do anything special the
underlying blockchain is interesting
technology which will be implemented
most of the people that are invested in
cryptocurrency is based on I report a
read if acquire in a major banks Wells
Fargo I think did the analysis our young
guys 20s early 30s and they're the ones
that get caught up in this because
they've never seen these type of manias
before and as I said manias could go on
for a while but eventually they bust
because again you have to ask yourself
how special are these coins if anybody
can produce a coin pretty easily and why
would a bank financial institution pay
you a huge amount of money for the
ripple coin so that they can do
transactions when they could just create
their own their own database of coins
and call
whatever they want to call it and back
it by whatever they want to call it
mediums of exchange currencies are not
good currencies if they fluctuate like
crazy and that's the that's that's why
the crystal currencies are there such a
mania because they fluctuate because
people want to buy into that huge
growing volume Bert and kryptos now here
you hear about the cryptocurrency
millionaires yeah it's like you hear
about the people with lotteries people
do win lotteries people who do come out
of it and some people will come out
winners in the cryptocurrency bat I
think most of the winners of already
took in their position taking their
position years ago but it is what it is
it is what is most fortunes are made
through slow and steady the slow and
steady process and as a friend of mine
said who I used to play a lot of poker
with he says when you gamble and you
gamble heavy eventually you're going to
lose</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
