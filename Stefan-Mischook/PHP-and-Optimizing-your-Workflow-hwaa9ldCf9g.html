sites you know with his new camera video
camera here one right here the video
quality may not be as good as by ultra
expensive camera which I just sold by
the way and I sold it because and it
goes to a large appointment it has
something to do with web design and web
programming nothing to do it Cameron law
has something to do with cameras but
it's all about web design a we pulled on
Oh as you if you guys have been
following me for a while you've noticed
I have to I am we put out videos but in
terms of video blogs like this they were
scarce and the reason they were scarce
as though as this kick-ass beautiful
camera shot amazing video is a real pain
of the but to set up to actually film
and because it wasn't really designed
for a guy like a solo guy like me who
just wants to come up with an IDE I got
an idea okay let's put on the camera it
literally took me 10 minutes to 15
minutes sort of set up a shot and so the
workflow was really really slow besides
that with the old camera to then to
render the video and so on it was real
painted by because of incompatibility
with the video types anyway I'll spare
you the details bottom line is though
the other camera produced really great
images a great video quality it was very
very difficult to work with so my number
of videos I put out was far fewer than
there should be
so what I decided to do is that you know
what I'm gonna go for a much easier
faster workflow with the camera where
I'm currently using and and as you guys
I'm sure seeing I'm putting out videos
like crazy I can't stop myself because
it's just too easy with this camera it
literally takes me 10 second uneven test
here three seconds were used to take me
15 minutes just to set up a shot and the
rest of the production workflow and
creating the video blogs and the video
it's just so much easier so the quality
of the video is a little bit less
although I think most people think that
the video is very clear and it looks
good but because of the the superfast
workflow that this camera is a
no-brainer because I'm getting out the
content and it's cool this lesson can be
applied to web design and web
programming you got to be careful to not
let yourself get caught up and trying to
get the absolute best quality ever but
then slow the whole process of getting
the site's done or the application
running bringing that to others with - -
to its knees slowing it down to a crawl
you know there's there's the good enough
principle and Microsoft's of course was
masters of that you know put out
something so it works may not be perfect
but to get it out there and get it out
quick so but people can use it work it
and give you feedback tell you what's
wrong what's not right and so on and
this has many advantages number one
getting out there into the market quick
is huge and let me give you an example
let's look at ps3 playstation 3 vs. the
Xbox 360
now with the Xbox everybody will
acknowledge it's a piece of junk
Hardware you know this thing fails
constantly it's it's it's ridiculous how
badly designed the thing was you know
Xbox is being trashes is so common
whereas the ps3 it's like it's beautiful
engineering it's a solid as a rock but
despite the fact that the ps3 is far
superior it took them an extra year or
two to get out after the Xbox 360 so the
Xbox had 360 had a had a head start in
terms of establishing market and so on
and as far as I know still to this day
the Xbox still dominates sale
or the ps3 despite the fact that the ps3
is a far superior piece of hardware so
again the good enough principle now that
again the good enough principle I play
excuse me
now I think X I think Microsoft you know
they didn't get it even good enough with
the Xbox but the point is if they got it
out there so this function always
working and they just dealt with the
problems now the same thing with
software now I'm not saying you should
put out something that's breaks like an
Xbox no it shouldn't work should we saw
it so on but you don't optimize to-to-to
too much it's been you know you know I'd
double the time to your projects
development time because you want to
optimize everything get it out so it
works you know fairly clean and
ultimately you want to get any website
or any web application application into
the hands of your clients or end-users
in case you're building something for
your own business you want to get it
into the hands of the end users as
quickly as possible because they're
gonna give you the best feedback they're
ones are gonna find all the bugs and
break things and ultimately they're
gonna tell you how things have to be
changed so it works more efficiently for
them trying to come up with the master
plan and have the perfect software but
won't be changed is it's not only not
realistic it practically never happens
everything has to be upgraded everything
has to be changed your Mazal get it out
there as quickly as possible so that you
know you can get that feedback getting
back to workflow what I'll tie it all
ties in what are the reasons you want to
get into maybe a code editor if you're
coder or maybe a web design program is
that you want that quick workflow and
that quick turnaround you know just
having some hotkey some color coding for
your PHP code or your JavaScript and
HTML code completion is FTP built into
your app so you're gonna check in at you
know upload upload content
quickly without having to go through all
these you know different programs this
all plays into the workflow and over
time it will really speed up your
production process saving a lot of time
yet you gotta remember if you can get
something done with one or two clicks
versus ten you know or two keyboard
strokes versus five this may not seem
like much at the time but yeah you do
repeat this these savings you know times
you know five hundred times a day a
thousand times a day all sudden you're
talking in real time here but you're
saving or wasting depending on you know
your situation and that really plays
figures prominently rather into how
productive and how profitable you're
going to be in the end so yes
consider workflow sometimes it makes
sense to point number two sometimes it
makes sense to sacrifice a bit of
quality a bit of polish so that you can
get things up and out and writing as
quickly as possible so to conclude that
all said I hope that this slightly less
quality but easy to produce video is
acceptable to you guys and I expect to
be putting out more of these things on a
regular basis so that's it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
