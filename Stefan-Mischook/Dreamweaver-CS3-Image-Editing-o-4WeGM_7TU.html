to go over one last thing about images
that to be totally honest I really
forgot about in when I was doing the
main images video tutorial and
specifically let me just select an image
here when you select an image you can
see as you know and the properties bar
here or panel at the bottom you see
these edit buttons so I just want to go
over a couple of these things and point
out a few issues number one if you have
photoshop installed you see this PS
button if you click this and you have
photoshop installed on your computer
dreamweaver will launch Photoshop which
will allow you to edit this image in
Photoshop if you don't have photoshop
and install of course this won't work
but these little things will now what
are these these are image editing
capabilities so that you typically would
not see in a web design program actually
these image editing capabilities or
something which you would typically see
in a program like photoshop so for
instance if I click the optimize button
and you see the same whole thing pop
open now this allows you to tweak your
image and to optimize it and a whole
bunch of different ways which are if
you've ever used Photoshop or paint shop
pro or any photo editing program you'll
see a lot of these things are common
you're able to make changes to this
image and once you understand is when
you'd make these changes to the image it
actually affects the underlying image
permanently so for instance let's go to
this file tab and you see have a scale
capability here so i'm going to say
scale this image
fifty percent you're taking you see how
much smaller it gets now to give you
perspective this is the original size of
the image so what's what's let's click
say okay and as you can see our webpage
the image has indeed been scaled and
unlike where I showed you in the
previous video where I was just
stretching stretching the image using
the handles but the underlying image
wasn't actually changed when you use
this button here these buttons here you
actually do change the underlying image
and the proof is i'm back in the file
system here and you can actually see
indeed a Dream Weaver has it resize the
image as you would expect an image
editor to do let's look at a couple of
the other buttons for instance you have
the crop button so I hit that and dream
we were in fact here gives you a warning
town you've at the action you are about
to perform or permanently all tovar
image so understand that you're actually
permanently altering image so here I can
write in my page crop the image like you
would expect in something like Photoshop
so once you've found whatever area of
the image you want to keep you just
double click over a crop and you see you
got the crop happening now this is
pretty ugly and you're not going to want
to do this in real life well you know
here it is but I just we're just going
over things here let's look at another
thing let's look at the brightness and
contrast again and getting that same
morning look out these changes will be
permanent so by the way a lot of these
warning boxes you can tell dreamweaver
to not show these messages over over
again because it gets kind of annoying
by checking it off and then hitting ok i
leave it on because it is you know for
the sake of this video so here we go we
get this dialog box and again like any
image editing program you can increase
the brightness and you can see
dreamweaver
updates the image for us real time you
increase the contrast so you have pretty
good image editing capabilities basic
very very basic image editing
capabilities were you able to do little
tweaks to your images so you can find
that Dreamweaver may save you a trip to
photoshop or pay chopra or something
over here if you noticed while while I
was talking I was I opened up the
sharpen option here the sharpen tool so
you can sharpen images and now you see
it's a subtle effect now anyway you see
what you see what's going on so the
point is is that with dreamweaver cs3
you do actually have basic image editing
capabilities built right into it where
you actually affect the underlying image
as we see here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
