style sheets now you see what I mean a
second so what we've done is looks like
select all when we've slowed us down
here a little bit now when we've created
our three heading rules right you know
is that I didn't select any particular
font for them actually did we set the
font anywhere so you didn't set the font
anywhere so let's actually do that let's
let's create a new rule and we're going
to re-define a tag and a select body
which is if you if you recall a body as
the root tag in terms of the visible
page and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to set the font to Georgia does it
apply if you notice the fonts have all
changed now so I'm going to go f12 where
you see that again if 12 and here we go
we have our page you know it's not auto
font or in Georgia why because we've set
that this is the old font right we set
the CSS rule in the body and the body is
the outermost tag of the visible page
right body body everything else that is
seen in the page by people by actual
people seeing your site is in between
the body tags so whatever rule that we
apply to body will affect everything
else in here so since we said in body we
look over here font family is Georgia we
know that every other element in between
the body tags will have a font family of
Georgia does that make sense because
it's underneath or it's inside of body
opening body closing body I hope that
makes sense so that rule that CSS rule
where we stated that the font family
should be Georgia to anything in body of
course gets applied to anything inside
of the body
now what the Cascade also allows you to
do it allows you to override global
rules so let's say we created in this
case rather we've created this rule for
body where we said a font families
Georgia right but if we wanted to we
could say well okay font family is
Georgia except except for anything
inside of P tags and how do we do that
while we can do that by did we be
defined a P tag here let's check no we
can create a rule for P tags and we can
change the font so what's let's do that
right now and we'll see what happens so
again when i create a new rule redefine
a tag and we'll look for the P here P
for paragraph I'll ok so all I want to
do here is I want to change the font in
the P tags tip to area and then let me
try that again area i'll hit apply so
let's say that and went to preview so as
you can see now this is ariel and this
is Georgia if you don't believe me let's
actually change that again let's go to
pee so I'm you go to pee I'm going to
change the font family here i'm going to
change it to verdanna see how it's
changed again again this is the only one
to change not this not this particular
font here and to make to prove that to
just pay attention to fonts here as I
change it so now i'm going to change it
back to the Georgia font notice how this
is not changing at all right because I'm
only affecting the peas here so what
happens what you can learn from this
rather is that if you have a rule a CSS
rule that applies to a tag or a class
that wats an ID actually or even to an
ID whatever is closer to
tag if you will we'll have or override
the over-riding rule so the best way to
explain this is actually just illustrate
the example so we had a rule for body
saying that the font should be Georgia
for the page anything in between body
and body we should have a font of
Georgia right font Georgia but I also
had another rule that said anything
inside of a paragraph P tag selected
over here PHP tag will switch versus two
or Donna anything inside a P tag should
be verdanna since the peas are closer to
a text right that means that this rule
this P tag rule over I'd the body rule
right so I hope that makes sense
that's the point of the Cascade in
cascading style sheets where it allows
you to have rules CSS rules override
other CSS rules this may be a hard one
to understand but to just think of it as
a level of command in this case the
general the General's orders do not
override the sergeant's order in the
battlefield the sergeant's orders will
supersede will be more important than
the generals why because of sergeants
talking to the guy directly where's the
generals a few steps away one thing you
want to take away from this is that
these rules is cascading rules in
cascading style sheets in CSS they apply
to any rule that you can apply on a web
page so it's not just BOTS it could be
background colors it could be margins
padding could be anything so you have to
understand that cascade so you have to
so you might at one point set your on
your body tag since it's the uppermost
tag it's the outermost tag right you may
say okay I'm going to set my fonts to
Georgia for the page but then at some
other point you set your foster verdanna
and a paragraph and you're asking
yourself well why are my paragraphs for
dinah when I set the page font to
Georgia what you're going to know that
because the P is going to override the
body rules because the P is closer to is
sitting right beside the text that it's
affecting right this doesn't make sense
just play with it a little bit and I
think it will sink in overtime
the last thing I want to cover in this
video is the visual aids that you get
when in design mode so let me show you
by collapsing these first I want to
create a little bit of real estate for
us she recalled when I selected let's
say this damn you see how we had this
visual representation of the margin
right and we have all these lines and
the padding so we see what's going on
but sometimes especially when you get
really experience with this kind of
stuff it gets in the way and it's just a
new sense so what you can do is you can
go into view and you go to visual aids
and you can choose all kinds of
different things that you can decide to
hide and show the painting on what you
want to do so let's say I want to take
out box model so let's try that you see
you don't see the outline the house so
let's like go back here and I go to view
visual aids layout CSS layout outlines
so also we don't see the grid pattern
that we saw before right we see a closer
approximation to what we would actually
see on our web page I hope that makes
sense to you so let's let's turn them
back on just so that you get an idea
outlines now you see the outline right
right here the dashed outline we go view
visual aids box model so now when we
select the box we actually get our
margin representation here there are a
lot of other aspects in terms of the
tool sets that you haven't Dreamweaver
and explore a few more of them as we
close out this video course that said I
want you to understand that I'm not
covering everything that you can
possibly do in Dreamweaver this is a
beginners course designed to get you up
and running and I want you to understand
the most important things so that you
can actually put out pages but once you
have this basic knowledge you should be
able to a lot more easily explore all
the various tools that you have in
Dreamweaver and a final point with
regards to that like any other piece of
software depending on your
working style and depending on how you
like to do things you will probably end
up only using a fraction of the tools
that you find and remover or a lot of
things in Dreamweaver but I'm not
discussing and the reason I'm not
discussing them is because they're
things that I don't use myself very
often and I don't find them very
important I may have additional videos
at a later point if I get enough of a
demand but at this point time I wouldn't
be too concerned and I'm not don't be
too concerned rather but I'm not
covering all the drop-down list and all
and every single button because that
would put just about everybody to sleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
