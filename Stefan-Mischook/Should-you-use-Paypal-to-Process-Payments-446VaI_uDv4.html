want to process online payments short
answer yes PayPal is probably the most
known system out there it's not the best
necessarily the reporting is and their
fees are a little high in my opinion but
the thing that PayPal brings to the
table is that people know PayPal people
been using PayPal for a long long time
so they feel a sense of security when
using PayPal so I've been processing
with PayPal for I gather whatever 15
years now is I'm going to make that and
it was always my secondary method now I
used to well I still do have a custom my
own product gateway if you will on
processor and so I add my own merchant
account and stuff which is a pain in the
butt to set up relative to PayPal that's
for sure but the the fees are far less
but is this more work so if you're doing
a lot of volume then you might want to
go with your own merchant accounts and
you have to talk to banks and stuff set
all that up depends on your country so
you can look that up but PayPal is a
quick way to just get up and running
with online payments and away you go and
it's pretty good another option and I
would actually use it in conjunction
with PayPal would be something called
strike striped is relatively new but
they really make it easy to deploy they
have much better reporting much more
advanced systems in PayPal and so I
would be using stripe as the primary
method of collecting payments online and
then I would use PayPal as a secondary
again to give people confidence because
I've been using PayPal for so long 15
years and the verified guy that gives
people confidence to buy I haven't I
actually have many people still will say
man can I buy for PayPal I just they
prefer PayPal so yeah if I was setting
up some online service we wanted to do
sales I was just
bing-bang-boom
with paypal first cz if you see you're
getting traction that I would move over
to something like stripe and if you're
starting to do some really big volume
you might want to look at getting old
merchant accounts and setting up
something like that but again that's
more work alright that's it for this
little tip ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
