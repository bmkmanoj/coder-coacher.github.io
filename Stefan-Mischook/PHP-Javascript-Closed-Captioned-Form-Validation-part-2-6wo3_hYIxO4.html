PHP and JavaScript based form validation
in part one we set up a basic form
template I'm going to go ahead and show
you how to use the JavaScript validate
plug-in and how simple it is to add
basic JavaScript validation to your
pages so to briefly go over this again
we've included jquery and the validate
plugin and we have our form all set up
now just a matter of telling jquery
which forms we want to be required you
know that what validation rules do we
need to apply and this particular
plug-in makes it pretty simple we can
just add a couple of CSS classes and the
JavaScript plug-in will figure out
automatically what needs to be done with
each of the inputs so let me go ahead
and add a couple classes I'm just going
to keep things simple for the sake of
this tutorial I'm going to just add a
class required to the name for the phone
let's do the same thing class required
for fax I'll just leave that alone for
email it's also make that required but
we also want to specify that it's an
email and get it validated as such so I
think that should do it for now so I'm
going to go ahead and save that and then
all you need to do is add that class and
a little bit of JavaScript here and we
start with a standard document ready
like so that's just standard jquery and
then all we need to do is go as such
form i need to put it this in quotes and
this form obviously refers to the ID of
the form as such and dot validate that's
simply all we need to do one thing i
noticed just left over you can clear
this action attribute i'll probably
remove that from the source files ok so
let me go ahead and preview this and see
what we have so far okay so that looks
good
ha sorry it's validate not validated
there we go so it's working as it should
all we've specified is that the name
phone email field she'll be required so
you'll notice they aren't fill in filled
in will give us an error message so I'm
just going to go ahead and fill that in
as such and then let's see looks like we
need to enter a valid address and submit
and looks like that's where I'm
perfectly so obviously this particular
plug-in has a wide range of options so
feel free to look at that either in the
jQuery documents or if ice go back here
on this website vass ist a nce de and it
seems that pretty good documentation and
it's quite expandable so the last thing
I want to do to discuss javascript-based
validation with this particular plug-in
so i want to show you how to extend this
plug-in to add additional rules i should
note that if you download the file this
is a zip archive it comes with a wide
range not just only the plug-in itself
but also demo files additional
additional validation rules etc so it's
quite useful and pretty well documented
so what I want to do is I want to go
ahead and add some validation for that
telephone number field so I did notice
if you check the plugins validation page
on the jQuery site they actually talk a
little bit about it
so let me just find the section on the
page
me one minute let me find what exactly
it is
that's right here okay so pretty simple
this is what I was looking for all I
need to set this up is this section of
code right here so i just need to place
that within the document ready section
maybe that's okay and you'll notice we
have a regular expression here which is
checks that's how it figures out whether
the phone number is valid or not and
then also the message so you can easily
edit it if you want to change and have a
different message display if the user
needs to correct this field and so this
particular method is called phone us
with uppercase you and s4 obviously
United States style phone number so to
go ahead and add this validation rule to
our form just go ahead select the phone
and underclass required we're going to
put phone us like so so let's go ahead
and test this and see where we are yep
and it seems to working fine asks us to
specify a valid phone number if I enter
in some something invalid and you'll
notice the error message goes away if we
enter in the correct value
okay so that about covers it for the
JavaScript section as I said earlier
this particular plug-in that I'm using
is quite powerful has a wide range of
rules that you can use as a full list
here I'm acquired I can add a minimum a
maximum length you can have a range
email date URL etc so it allows you a
lot of different rules to excuse me it
allows you to validate against a wide
variety of rules and makes your life
just a whole lot easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
