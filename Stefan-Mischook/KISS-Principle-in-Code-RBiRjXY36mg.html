morning for me it's 5:00 a.m. in
Montreal and I fell asleep really early
last night because I had some french
fries and salad and the glycemic index I
think it's called in french fries kills
me
puts me to sleep and another side of
middle-aged existence so here's the city
at 5:00 in the morning
sunja is coming out now so it's looking
pretty good out there and as you guys
know I really love to head off in the
morning to get a coffee and a bagel yep
I'm back on the coffee now my voice is
not a hundred percent but I realized the
thing that was really affecting my voice
and my ability to speak was talking to
friends of mine who are not exactly the
most reasonable people we get into
arguments with different screaming
matches so I've had another that I've
cut them out no more stupid arguments
with people about ridiculous subjects
and here it is and a morning light looks
really good I hope you could see it in
the video anyway that's about it so I'm
off to get my coffee still really cool
out here but yeah hey guys how I asked
so I been working this morning on the
the infamous Python course and yeah I'm
in the last few videos I'm actually now
working on the object-oriented portion
of it which is kind of a last stage
we're teaching object-oriented
programming principles and I'm showing
you how it's all expressed now when
you're building a course you have the
same considerations that you have when
you are building apps and that is what
to leave out that is so important you
see when you're building a course
there's so much you could teach I could
go on on and on
but if you do value get it gets pretty
bad so as a teacher it's my job to
figure out what's important what needs
to be taught what does the student need
to know to be able to move forward so in
a beginners course my main goal is to
help you understand the basic principles
of programming and the basic techniques
so variables functions arrays loops
variable scope in Ariens Opie
accelerator to editor so when you're
building apps it's much the same way
because if you have if you had any
experience building apps or website you
could find yourself going down this
rabbit hole of feature creep I've done
this I've talked about this in the
previous video future creep is basically
where new and new and new and new
features are added to the app or to the
website or to the web app your whether
it be you or your clients going on I
would be great we could do this we can
have this we could add this we could do
that and next thing you know you have a
frank an app and Frank an app just goes
out of control and kills everybody you
know what I mean
you don't want to kill your app and I
don't want to kill any of my courses by
overloading them way too much the key is
is to provide what is needed and nothing
more this is an old principle in
engineering I learnt it when I was a kid
for my father mom nothing for my father
anyway I learned from somebody and it
was a kiss principal ki SS keep it
simple stupid old engineering principle
simple is better of course
I think most people get that these days
largely because Apple Apple kind of made
simple chic and that's good because
that's what separates a lot of times the
good apps from the bad apps is the
simplicity of the app so talking to a
former mentee of mine about the quality
of apps what makes a good app and what
makes a good app again is a simple app
it's an app that does exactly what the
user needs and not much more
more because you overload an app with
too many functions too many capabilities
and it gets confusing there's too many
options people know where to click and
it becomes a you a less useful app and
these days which separates the great
apps there we go I had lost my train of
thought before
if you hadn't picked it up there's what
separates the great apps for not so
great apps as the great apps are very
simple very clean it's all about UI and
UX and that of course is reflected in
the simplicity of the functionality if
you have too many functions that you
have to expose through your user
interface through and then help you
manage all that with user experience UX
it becomes very difficult you have many
many many features so the key is to
identify those key features and many of
time many of the times most applications
most business needs I require a very
finite set a limited set of features to
get the job done and so I'm very
reticent with for instance reticence of
a word I'm very reluctant rather listed
you have to add more features I've been
working with teachers for 6-7 years now
with our schools and we we talked to
teachers all the times especially I
talked to teachers all the time I'm
monitoring things I'm always refining
and refining it it's very a very
hesitant to add anything to the system
in terms of functionality unless I
really see an overwhelming need of
consensus amongst many teachers because
if you start adding or feature this
person here a feature a person here and
a feature for this person here again
you're gonna have this giant console all
kinds of buttons and features and it's
just going to be confusing for everybody
simple is better but simple is hard and
going back to my course same thing
simple is hard when do I cut off when do
I stop teaching Python because you know
python such a fast subject you could
after the basics you can get
to drawing animations and game design
you can get into machine learning AI and
get a wet into web development you can
get into data analysis oh so much you
can do so what I decided to do with this
beginners course is again to concentrate
on the basics I introduce a lot of these
basic concepts with you know drawing and
animation with Python it's pretty easy
to do in Python again my main goal with
the beginners course is to teach you
those basic concepts so if I was
teaching out of box I wouldn't be
teaching you advanced combinations when
first teaching that box I teach you the
basics give you that foundation and then
you can get into those advanced
combinations and tactics and so forth
that will take you to that high level
same thing with my Python course the
idea there is that get the solid
foundation and from there you can jump
in if you want to go into AI you have
the foundation to jump into AI to start
that journey if you want to get into the
web you have that foundation to start
the web and the etc etc etc so I decided
because there's a question to do how
much do I add into this beginners course
all these extra aspects of Python so I
introduced of this and I introduced that
to introduce it is andesite I'm already
in for we're looking it's going to be
you know I'm at lesson number 48 and
it's probably going to be about 55
lessons by the tolerant on the the old
component and O's object-oriented so I
think I'm you know what I'm going to
hold off on the AI and hold off on you
know programming Python raspberry pi
maybe in a sip of course or something
but again once you have that foundation
you'll be able to as a coder as a
developer who learnt the basics of
Python through my course everything else
will be easy to approach whether it be a
subsequent Python course for me or you
just at this point you'll be able to go
to the docs
you'll be able to pick up things much
more easily and ironically once I've
taught the basics to have a to teach a
student you know web and etc etc etc the
more advanced stuff is actually less a
lot easier for me as a teacher because
then they become
a lot less having to explain concepts
and more just showing them you know
walking them through libraries of code
right oh yeah that's pretty much it we
shall talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
