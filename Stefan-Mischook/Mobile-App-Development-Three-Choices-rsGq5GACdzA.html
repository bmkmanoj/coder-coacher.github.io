sites killer PHP in this video blog I'm
going to talk about mobile app
development and two basic strategies
that you can use when you want to
develop applications for iOS ipad iphone
and android devices before i get into
that thought I just want to comment on
the style of this video blog very
quickly I haven't done very many video
blogs lately because I just been really
busy and the way I used to do a video
blog that set up a separate video camera
and set up my one of my good mics and
you know and it takes a lot of time to
do that so what I've decided to do is
just use the webcam and use the built-in
microphone so the quality may not be as
pro you know let's say the quality of
super professional begin with but anyway
it's not as good as it could be but it's
gonna be a lot easier for me to put out
context I figure it's better but I put
out a bunch of content more content than
to put out much less so here we go so
when it comes to mobile app development
there's two basic things that you can do
you could either develop natively
meaning using the native language of the
particular device you want to work with
and there's two big schools there's two
big captures the iOS cap ipad iphone and
android of course so if you're
developing for iOS you have to write
everything objective-c which is an
object-oriented language but predates a
Java quite old in fact and I think it's
from the 80's it's based off of another
object or demand on small talk and then
you have for the Android platform of
course you use Java now there's two big
things going against developing native
apps for either platform first of all to
learn objective-c it's not a trivial
tasks not like learning PHP is not like
learning JavaScript it's is much more
difficult as much more of a challenge
there the other saving with Java on the
on the Android side we have to learn
java
Java is not a trivial language to learn
either it's um it's called a strongly
typed language the libraries are quite
complex see it's a very verbose code
meaning the code is quite long so if
you're used to writing JavaScript PHP
Java is going to move it's going to be a
lot of typing you know say what
objective c I don't know too much about
objective seeds and just looked at at
klein senate javim quite low versus a
state for years and years of my java
apps j2ee so the other big disadvantage
besides an extremely steep learning
curve of each platform iOS versions of
Android is that with when you write an
app rather in either platform you're
going to have to then poured it to the
other platform so if you write something
iOS without with Objective C then you
have to rewrite it in Java of course
copy an app but to see one language to
another is much easier from doing from
scratch but then it's still a big big
job the big advantage though of writing
native apps is you get to take full
advantage of the hardware that you're
working on so if you write something
objective c you can taking full
advantage of e of the ipad or the iphone
or the i leave a touch there versus a
touch device from apple if i get the
ipod touch there we go you could take
full advantage of that hardware but
again you have to convert over same
thing on the android so you write in
java for android device you get to take
full advantage of your device so you
have another option really the second
options that are writing native is to to
just write using html5 css3 based app
and you use a server-side backend like
PHP or movie or something to power it
the two big advantages are a i think a
lot of you probably may already know PHP
and JavaScript you may be familiar with
HTML
so to learn html5 and to make that leap
into season three is on it's not a big
deal I just learning curve is not nearly
steep so it's a lot quicker so you can
get to developing mobile apps pretty
quickly any other big advantage is that
when you write and mobile app for your
Android device they will probably work
pretty good using you know this web
standards html5 css3 you know JavaScript
it's probably going to work pretty well
in your iOS device and even make your
Windows Phone for instance you know if
you want to hit that two percent of the
marketplace there so the disadvantage of
course is when you're writing in html5
and css3 you won't have full access to
the hardware and all the power that you
would if you wrote natively you know iOS
move Lee objective c and java html5
excuse me Java for the Android there's
pros and cons but for many many many
many many apps you really don't need
access to that full power so I was
strongly suggested before you
necessarily jump into iOS programming or
java android development you consider
whether or not your app really needs
that and in fact you some people's in
fact when you write some in html5 and
css3 a lot of times the amount of work
it would take to adapt it to a pad and
android pad or an iOS pad is minimal if
anything so for instance we one of these
been working on is our interactive
JavaScript excuse me interactive
training systems to do a web here and
it's a webapp interactive trailing cold
courses and so on for school schools are
using it now in
everything but the thing is it without
any work really it works on Android and
iPad to make it totally hunter something
really sexy for the ipad or some of the
cold cold editor would have to have some
ipad and android specific buttons rather
than because it's kind of hard to get
into the keyboard but angry and the
major point for ninety-nine percent of
functionality we basically had to do
nothing to make this studio web app work
on Android iPad because it's designed
properly and according to standards and
to make it a hundred percent that
require maybe a couple hours of
development work to really just add that
little extra needs to be done so no need
in this in this case with a pretty
involved application no need to write
native objective c or java to get things
done so you want to may want to consider
that when you're making your choice
under that if you're looking for work as
an iOS developer is probably going to be
plenty of work there for a long time
then you gotta learn your objective c
there's a third option so i have native
html5 development and then i had the
third option is used there's these
third-party programs which i have ever
used i can say oh good they are where
you write in there and it's like and
it's like using a dreamweaver some
program you're right out your your app
in there and then it will output the
objective-c code or a while put the BB
android java code I don't know how well
they work but they're out there and it's
another option as well to consider the
problem with that kind of code
generating systems traditionally you're
locking yourself in because they're
going to doing certain things
proprietary proprietary way meaning in
their own way and you may have a heroine
you may have a lot of limitations and
may be difficult to debug some of these
things that's it that's my discussion of
Android and iOS development and I hope
you liked this video blog and hope you
don't mind this
