block now if you've been following me
you know that I've been doing my shorts
like in martial arts for nearly 30 years
give or take a couple years depending on
time off because of injuries and because
of laziness so I did it for a long time
although I haven't trained actually
about three years now so take it for
what it is I'm pretty rusty so in this
video what I want to do is I want to
point out the biggest mistake the single
biggest mistake the most traditional
martial artists make what they don't
understand about the major flaw in how
they train so let me point out one thing
it has nothing to do with the technique
the technique all technique was it be a
punch was it be a grappling movie kicks
elbow head bless they're all relevant
they're all good at the right moment so
the mistake that most traditional
martial artists make is in the way they
train their techniques because any
experienced fighter tell you is that the
technique in striking arts especially is
is important but it's not nearly as
important several other things that
separate the difference between good
fighters and not so good sliders because
and this is something used to perplex me
was perplexing to me confuse me when I
was much younger because I had done
several arts doesn't start with judo
like so many people in Japanese karate
Thank You coach in karate which another
jockey spell then I did Taekwondo catch
crumble or the wrestling boxing and I've
so many other things so what I notice is
that despite the fact so many styles
dispute about how you should throw a
punch some will say a punch should be
thrown like this for power some will say
no that's stupid you're leaving your
head open the boxer we'll just go boom
with that and so on so forth now but I
would when I did notice though even
though they caught you did
contradicted themselves in terms of the
basic techniques and body mechanics they
all seem to produce not all but they you
know you can find good fighters and just
about any style you know some exceptions
you can find people can fight so that
made me realize that is the techniques
are not so important it's the training
methods that is important right since
since you know one style says you should
punch like this and the selfish punch
like that but both styles can put
together good fighters if that makes any
sense so the greatest single mistake
that traditional martial artists make e
is assuming that that first attack is
easily intercepted see you see this all
the time go on youtube check out all
kinds of videos where you know Wing Chun
against a boxer or Tycho no against
answer it silly stuff because what
they'll do is they'll say if the guy
throws a punch and then they'll go uq
block and then you do this this this and
you build this and you didn't you do
that and that kind of stuff now here's
the problem with that any ring fighter
will tell you any sri spider would tell
you the hard palate about a fight one of
the biggest motor hardest part is not if
you don't know what they're gonna throw
and you don't know if it's going to be a
punch you know it's good if you can't
kill this could be elbow they might
faint and then come in something else so
going who I blocked a punch or I grabbed
the punch all right I block and I hit
like that and he sort of just gloss over
that first attack is this now I just
feels the first attack day then I do
this is it let me tell you something if
you're good enough to be able to stop
that first attack so easily you don't
need anything else right if you if you
know that punch is coming or you can
you're so good you can anticipate the
punch or kick or the attack or to take
down or whatever it a technics is what
you do to the person afterwards is not
that important because guys guys
and i'm so glad i can go like this then
he is this person to toast the person is
toast so that's why you saw in when the
US he came about all these traditional
martial arts came in and they just got
their bloods handed to them because they
never actually trained how to fight they
trained technique that's not fighting
fighting is learning timing tactics body
mechanics mental physical conditioning
speed power then technique you see if
you got most of those attributes i just
mentioned really well developed all you
need is a punch and you're going to
destroy people who have 10,000
techniques right the reason you learn
more techniques is so that you
understand what people can do to you so
you can defend against a grappler will
tell you that they try to get a wrestler
or freestyle wrestler in a wristlock
armlock it's next to impossible it's
next to impossible because they be
trained they spar so much it's like it's
like it's babyish for them because they
know what's coming right they know
what's coming try to take down a
grappler very difficult why cause it's
what they trained they learn they know
how to prevent themselves from being
taken down yah yah yah yah yah yah yah
so keep that in mind the single greatest
mistake is they make as they ignore or
they just assume that first blow that
first attack water maybe whatever it may
be some house is intercepted by then
they cost showing everything else it's
silliness right the hardest part is sort
of dealing with that that tackle you
know Laura's coming from a good it can
go low and low high boom but you don't
know so keep that in mind go watch the
videos and recognize how they do service
again they gloss over if I first attack
it's like okay now the punch is there so
now I'm going to do this and I'm going
to do this that's silly it's that
dealing with that first plug but these
low what's coming and it has it Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
