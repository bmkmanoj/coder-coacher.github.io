talking about is working with another
image adjustment and you can use that as
an adjustment layer or you can go to
image adjustments up here and the one
we're talking about this time is color
balance well to begin with what I've
asked more what I'm going to ask you to
do at this point is to go to file open
and you can navigate to your sources
images folder and open up women in red
jpg and here we see three women in red
their robes are in red and their skin
tones are red and the backgrounds are
red so there's just an overabundance of
red in this particular image so one of
the things that we can do is again
either go through image adjustments and
say color balance or this is also
available as an image adjustment layer
so we can go to the adjustment layer and
click on this particular one right here
which is create a new color balance
adjustment layer a couple of things that
we can do with that for example if you
want to name it something else just
press on the option key if you're on a
Mac or the Alt key on a PC and this will
open up the new layer dialog box here
you can call it color balance one or you
can give it any other name if you wish
so we can diminish the Reds and as you
can see here it's just doing something
along those lines if you wanted to you
can also delete the layer mask in this
case I want it to be affecting
everything so you can just right click
on that and say delete layer mask nice
and easy so at this point what I'm going
to be showing you is how the adjustment
layers are going to be affected here
with the color balance well notice that
there are a number of tones mid-tones
and highlights in this well we talked
about that when we were looking at the
histogram and how that was reflected in
that little graph that we saw well here
if we work with these mid-tones we can
see we have an overabundance
have read so cyan being the direct
opposite of red we can slide this down
and in this case even if we slid it all
the way down and minus 100 it still
seems to be showing up all right now
that's generally you know a little bit
too much in certain instances so you
should be careful of that unless of
course as this particular image has a
real overabundance of red so I'm just
going to slide that down just a little
bit more and as you can see our Reds in
the and the actual robes themselves are
not really affected all that much I mean
certainly they are affected to some
degree but really this is helping to
take down the Reds that are in an
overabundance on their skin tones and
while their skin tones should have read
it should not be you know too much red
in there well notice if you wanted to
augment some of the Greens you could
just pump this a little bit higher and
notice that elements do become green
including skin tones so you got to be
careful about that we don't want to go
to too far with it so as you can see
here even if I were to you know bump up
some of the greens in the backgrounds
well there's too much green in here well
let's see what we can do if we wanted to
eliminate that while certainly we
wouldn't go into the yellows but we
could go into the blues and enhance some
of the blues so that's still enhancing
the greens and to help get that green
out of those skin tones you can enhance
some of the blue color and in doing so
you get the best of both worlds so you
really do have a very very different
looking image and we can check that out
just by coming over here and clicking on
the visibility of that remember what it
was like before my goodness that's
really much too much red in there but
bring it back wow it's really nice
balance of color and it works out so
much better than what we had in the
original image all done through the
color balance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
