universal basic income will come to pass
without an inflation of the currency
this is a question was put to me by
somebody on youtubes that he proceeded
to insult me Steph you should stick to a
tech because you know nothing about
economics I remember in college I took
macroeconomics and microeconomics and I
remember my professors both said yeah
all this stuff for learning all these
calculations none of it actually works
none of it predicts with any accuracy so
then I would ask myself why are we
learning this stuff right why are we
learning this stuff if it doesn't really
predict anything so that my criticisms
of economics aside my position visa vie
Universal Bakic basic income is largely
a business a business source decision if
you will or a business based not
decision of the prediction and also my
understanding of tech both come into
play so here's the situation
why does give you a very direct example
a good friend of mine who's been an
engineer for longest since he graduated
but he's been working in a particular
field of engineering where they do a lot
of analysis for companies to produce
some very detailed reports that they
then submit to government's for tax
credits and other things like that
highly detailed work highly skilled
people involved in it so he has a team
of technical writers who put together
this documentation we're talking about
200-300 page reports very very specific
very detailed very technical and so the
last three years with his team they've
been developing an AI base system to
write up these reports based on the data
submitted to the system by the by
scientists and by the engineers running
the experiments and doing the work and
he's told me like I just actually spoke
to him last week he was telling me that
his AI now is pretty good not a hundred
but put in perspective his highly
trained highly paid
technical writers when they submit a
report to him he tells me it's about 75
percent down 70 75 percent done with the
good ones meaning there's a lot of
editing to be done changes to be made
and so on so it's a bit of work but 75
percent is pretty good 70 75 percent
well his AI now is able to generate the
same reports with about a 90% accuracy
so the AI is already better than the
highly experienced highly trained
technical writers and the AI is able to
generate these reports in about a minute
whereas it takes the technical writers
weeks and weeks and weeks to produce one
of these documents so in a short period
of time as a system becomes more and
more refined and more advanced as to his
AI his algorithm to come better it's
going to replace all these jobs just in
Canada it could be 10,000 jobs I guess
and you have to be ten times ahead
100,000 jobs these are not you know
low-paying low-skilled jobs these are
jobs by highly trained people who read
out all this technical documentation and
this is just the beginning so we
discussed about what's going to happen
when all these companies like his
smallish company are developing all
their own custom a eyes are in very
niche specific what's going to happen to
all these people who are not going to
have work right it's a it's going to
come out in waves we're going to have
any hive to this AI does that ai does
this so for instance you have an AI out
there now that can detect cancer in
x-rays at far better accuracy rate than
the average doctor I think the average
cancer specialist doctor is a 70 75 %
accurate and their diagnosis when they
look at x-rays the AI and the IVA came
out it can do it like 95% so the AI is
already better and it's just going to
get better and better and better and
you're going to see more and more and
more this is a eyes Corral so what is
going to
and when this happens when this stuff
really starts to roll out well a huge
amount of jobs are going to disappear
and they're never going to repeat be
replaced because the AI is just going to
get more and more sophisticated over
time in fact the rate of acceleration in
terms of the development of AI is
increasing much faster than they
originally thought so this this is a
huge wave is about to hit us
now some people are like oh my god I can
have work on matter work while outside
of my friend of mine who has developed
the AI and he is a capitalist to the
bone and I am as well and I haven't
worked for anybody since those eighteen
years old I've been entrepreneur my
entire adult life last job I had working
for somebody I was a bouncer in a
nightclub so you know I'm not exactly a
communist I'm not exactly a socialist I
don't you know these ideologies don't
work because if you don't have
production you don't have motivated
people
everybody gets lazy and the cars fall
apart on you try driving on the street
but this all changes with AI and
robotics because a I doesn't get lazy
they don't need to be paid
they're always efficient they don't make
mistakes so the whole game is about to
change and people have no idea so the
the baseline that we've been used to up
until now in terms of how economies run
how things things work is all about to
change because of the ultra cheap or
practically zero cost labor and the
diminishing cost of energy with more
efficient solar and point is the input
costs are going to drop like a stone and
that's the nature of technology that's
the whole point of technology that's why
today nobody sells their socks anymore
like my great grandmother did these days
are still cheap and guess what with
robots in the eye the plant the price is
going to plummet just incredibly so how
does this relate back to universal basic
income it's a necessity it's a necessity
necessity is going to happen I don't
know the specific details but the cost
of everything is going to is going to
collapse like you know with AI is
building houses ai
building the roads and a is magnified in
doing always work the cost everything is
going to plummet and my friend who has
is AI he believes he's going to make his
money and for several years because it
would replace all these jobs but
eventually not a very quickly people
going to see what he's doing and they're
gonna come up with their own and then
it's going to drive down the cost so a
report of it used to cost $40,000
generate will cost five bucks because
because the I I will approve it's done
right and then all the competitors will
come in and if you look at the cost of
our TVs look at you know you can buy a
huge TVs today for a thousand bucks at
ten years ago those TVs wolf didn't
exist but the best of the TVs are ten
thousand dollars like ten fifteen years
ago I know I bought them so it's that's
just a way of it goes so you don't have
to be a master of economics to realize
that with all these jobs disappearing in
unless the government wants to set up
like a Mad Max road warrior type of
situation which they want because they
don't want revolution this is going to
be a massive just going to just going to
deploy robots you know have robots we're
going to be farming robots are going to
be cleaning streets robots and repairing
hollinger some top guys out there I read
on Bloomberg or summoner's they are
thinking that within 10 years half of
all jobs will disappear
half half so you know it's going to
happen but it's going to be because of
the rise of this technology AI and
robotics and so forth the disparity
between wealth the super wealth the
wealthy and the poor will shrink
considerably because the cost everything
is going to shrink like we've never seen
before in the history of humanity and my
prediction on that is based on just
observation of history if you look at it
today Heyliger mentioned a previous vlog
friend of Mines of belong welfare he's
got high flat screen panel 50 inches
he's got high-speed Internet it's got
unlimited
he's got unlimited entertainment he's
got plenty of food he was a comfortable
place he's safe and it's this is just
going to accelerate you know
times 10 if not about more I don't the
exact numbers but you get the idea so if
you look back 120 years ago a lazy bum
like him a drunk like him he would have
been in the street and shredded clothes
and begging for food not today
but today you know and Canada is not
some you know disaster country we're
very wealthy country or debt levels are
actually pretty reasonable well it
should be zero in my opinion but
nonetheless all this is going to its big
game changer I'm not sure what the exact
details with the exact dynamics of it to
be how it's going to exactly play out
but it's inevitable if you start wiping
out all these high-paying jobs gonna
start with low-paying jobs so what are
you going to do what you're going to do
have them live on the street another
thing with the AI though with the
robotics he won't have to because the AI
robotics within 10 15 years we'll be
able to build houses for a fraction of
the cost of today right if you think
about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
