killer PHP and today what I'm going to
be doing is looking at how we can build
a html5 web site we're going to be
looking at the nav tag the header tag
and also the footer tag and we're going
to be designing a site that looks
similar to this but we're going to be
doing away with a lot of the HTML and
CSS that and also images that we were
using before and trying to make this
sort of a simpler design to create so
let's get started I have this domain on
my local machine k PHP and I'm going to
be creating a folder for this project
I'm going to call it 02 this way at the
end I can send this all to you or you
can download it off of the killer sites
university or killer PHP whatever Steph
decides where Steph decides to publish
this and i'm just going to save an empty
text documents in that 02 folder i'll
call this index dot HTML so far html5
looks just like regular HTML and i'm
going to call this style dot CSS so i'm
going to create a CSS file and an
index.html file now the first thing
about html5 is that the doctype is
really really simple it's just doctype
HTML HTML lang ikaw ZN and then your
closing HTML tag and just hit save from
there we can have our head and our body
tags and that is a valid html5 document
now something that also helps is to
specify the character set
this basically tells the browser that
you're using you know Kenji if you're
using a doing a chinese website or
you're using utf-8 if you're doing
something that's either part of you know
Western Europe or America so this is
also the kind of stuff that people write
once and then sort of copy paste from
one website they do to the next
character set equals utf-8 excuse me let
me just I'm not going to in debt this so
much because then you won't see anything
there we go okay what's next well just
like regular HTML you've got a title tag
so I'll say my html5 page and then we
need to link out to our style sheet
again this is exactly the same let's
looks like bbedit is too smart for its
own good okay rel stylesheet' type text
/ CSS and the URI is going to be styled
at CSS now just to make sure that this
is working I'm going to say hello world
and then put my browser here refresh
this I can see that there's now an 02
click on that and I see HTML I see hello
world if I view the source of this page
select it all and then go to the
validator this is a service provided by
the world wide web consortium and I say
I want to validate by direct input and
paste this in hit check and it says this
document is successfully passed html5
there was six successfully checked as
html5 so that's a really good that's a
really good sign in fact it's even
saying that utf-8 is character assumed
and this is an experiment
checker but those are only two warnings
but that's a good sign so with that in
place let's get started instead of using
in the other example I had something
like div equals head and then I put in
my header here now instead with html5 we
can create a header section and then i
can say that there's a section here in
fact I don't even need the section tag I
could just say there's a header and then
there's an H to say Acme website ink and
tagline here so now I've got this header
section and you'll notice the mark up
makes a lot more sense refresh this
everything looks the same but the
mark-up is substantially more
substantially cleaner now in my style
tag here my style file here for my CSS
I'm just going to create a star
declaration which is basically
everything and I'm going to do a global
reset and then for my h1 h2 h3
paragraphs and let's say list items and
hyperlinks I want my font family to be
Ariel and song serif refresh this again
you'll notice that everything is now
hugging the top which is a good sign and
everything looks good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
