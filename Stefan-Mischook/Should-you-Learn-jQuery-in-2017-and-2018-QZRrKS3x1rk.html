me an interesting question today should
they learn jQuery or should they just be
going to pure JavaScript there seems to
be this move away from jQuery and to
pure JavaScript my position has never
changed about learning jQuery or any
other framework learn them on a
need-to-know basis so what does that
mean that means in real life development
work real life programming work you're
not you're always gonna be exposed to
new tasks new challenges where you're
gonna have to investigate different
frameworks different modules that you're
gonna need to implement depending on the
needs of that particular job so with
regards to jQuery and any other
framework I have preached that you
should just learn the basics of it just
learn the basics understand install it
configure it use a CDN content to the
delivery network and just play with the
very basic functionality of what jQuery
provides understand how it's used in
Twitter bootstrap and just again the
basics and you know at our to with it so
at least from it and that might be too
much just enough so you know what you're
talking about so that when you come into
a project at least you're gonna be aware
of the jquery option you're gonna be
aware of what jquery can bring to the
project and then at that particular
moment you can decide whether or not
you're going to use jquery for your job
and that's why in all my courses what
i've been teaching since 2003 the key to
all this is in the basics and i learned
this through hard experience as a
professional developer going back to the
90s you know what this is a universal
principle something i talked about
before universal principles or
principles concepts that are universal
meaning they're they seem to hold true
no matter what area of life what
technology what discipline you look into
so if you're looking at this idea of
sticking to the basics and the
foundations i got that originally from
martial arts why was a kid
in martial arts you have two basic
stylists there's many ways you can cut
up martial arts and categorize things
but one way I look at you've got the
technique guys who are concerned about
the techniques something some people
call them technique junkies well that's
some people as me I call them technique
junkies and then you got the people or
into the principles or into the
foundations and I can tell you 99.99% at
a time the people who study the
foundational skills who developed the
foundational techniques that knot
techniques the foundational abilities if
you will I'll get into martial arts here
they always wipe the floor with the
technique junkies a fight is not won by
a series of techniques it's won because
you have a mastery or at least a better
higher level of ability with regards to
basics and in fighting that's timing
tactics be power mental physical
conditioning etc etc with programming
the difference between the great
programmers and the not-so-great
programmers is that the less experienced
programmers are concerned about the
latest and greatest framework or module
and they assume that if I know this
module or that module that would make me
a great programmer no no what makes you
a great programmer is that you
understand the fundamentals really well
and then to learn any framework whether
it be jQuery whether it be react or
reactive system a library whether it be
an MVC framework whether it be a Django
or flask and Python spring Java laravel
and PHP world regardless what's going to
make you a great programmer is your
knowledge of the basics let me get back
to that point and when you have a really
good knowledge of the core aspects of
the language other languages that you're
working with also to learn any of these
frameworks becomes really easy so for
example I know MVC very well because I
know MVC MVC is short for
model-view-controller it's a design
pattern it's a way in which web apps and
all apps are created as a struck
I won't get into the details here but
they use it everywhere to use it real
being using Java these a.net they use it
in PHP these are the Python these are
everywhere and once you understand the
MVC paradigm paradigm design pattern
once you understand that you know why
people do it then I'll set it to go and
learn Ruby on Rails or to learn Django
or to learn asp.net or to learn Java
spring or PHP layer but whatever it
doesn't matter because it's all the same
thing just with sub-variants depending
on the particular language so that's my
answer I wouldn't spend too much time on
jQuery now especially now that you know
people are saying why I shouldn't learn
jQuery shouldn't use jQuery no no no
lots of jQuery is out there and you're
gonna probably run across it at some
point in your career so you should at
least be aware of the basics of jQuery
so I would just learn yeah I spend like
I said an hour maybe two hours max learn
the basics of jQuery play around with it
understand what it brings and you'll be
ready to go and whenever you run across
something you may go I don't that's the
jQuery thing or you may say up that's
there using jQuery here I understand why
they're using it blah blah blah blah you
get the idea I hope this blog is useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
