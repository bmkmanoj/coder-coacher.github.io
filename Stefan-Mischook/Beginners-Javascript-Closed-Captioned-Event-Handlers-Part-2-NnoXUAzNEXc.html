event handlers I of course assume that
you've done the previous video so what
we're going to do now is actually I just
want to demonstrate something you notice
how i was able to use this javascript
here inside the event handler now watch
what happens so that you understand
we're just going to copy this JavaScript
I'm just going to put out here in the
middle of the page willy-nilly so that
it just seems so you see what's
happening a few firefox on its update I
must say don't bother me teaching from
teaching the people here I'm just going
to hit refresh you notice now our first
script work and doing a mouse over but
you know sir so your code here watch
this so your code now the reason this
code is showing up here just being
printed page as normal text whereas over
here it's actually I'm being fired off
as JavaScript well first of all well
let's look at the source code in those p
on mouseover it's going to be in the
source code huge page source right you
see it all right go to the source code
it is these on please these mouse overs
are really get online nerves let me just
change that to unclick so it doesn't
keep doing now you know as I was able to
do on click with a lowercase C and it
worked and a capital C and also there we
go thank you see capital C work fine too
in JavaScript they there's a convention
where they like to name function names
and event handlers and solve on with
this camel case method here this is
called camel case cases in between each
word the next word has a capital on
click that's camel case like a hump
right this is no captain ahaab here
capital c makes it look like a howl on
click I mention this because later on
when we're getting deeper into
JavaScript
in certain parts of JavaScript its case
sensitive it may not respond to this
where it's actually looking for this if
that makes any sense anyway just
understand this camel case understand
how this has to be you know for this to
run it has to be within script tags so
just to be totally clear script I go
language say JavaScript and it pulls it
off you see how dreamweaver makes it
easy for us now watch what happens
you're going to see how the on get this
alert I'm just going to go automatic
this alert gets fired off no matter what
because it's not in any event handler
it's not in a function we looked at
function briefly this just gets auto
fired so let's just pull this up refresh
see automatic alert where is this other
event that don't click on me one Raptor
click I'm going to click now on clicking
see how do you collect me so you see how
event handlers in a way allows you to
control when a particular piece of
JavaScript actually happens does that
make sense
one global concept you want to take away
from our study of event handlers is that
essentially they are a mechanism that's
built into JavaScript where you can have
the web browser scan for events so you
can say here let's now scan for any
clicks Arlen Marron we did mouse over
let's now scan for any time to Mouse
actually passes over this paragraph so
this is like a built-in mechanism in
JavaScript sort of a free tool that you
have access to and I say free tool
because in other languages you would
have to manually build in your own event
handlers and it's pretty tedious so
JavaScript does this for free for us so
it's kind of cool and we have access to
a whole bunch of event handlers we saw
the list before
so this is just a short list of some of
them wanting to dissolve them and so
well now it's not all of them this is
all of them I could be applied to the
paragraph right Dreamweavers just making
this easy for us let me just point out
that you don't need Dreamweaver to do
this you don't you could just write this
all out manually so if you're using a
text editor like notepad or something
don't worry just type it out and
everything's cool by the way if you're
watching this I would pause the video
now and type out this line of code that
you see here and test it out play with
it once you get it working break it see
what happens when it breaks and this
will go a long way to helping you learn
how to code I'm just nail that
I want to look at the body tag and look
at event handlers on the body k i'll go
on so you notice our event handler list
is different on blurred error focus on
load on those on page load on resize
when the page resizes on unload etc so
you see that the list of event handlers
really depends on the particular element
that you're applying the event handler
to that all said on the body typically
you're going to use the onload
when you programming you have to
understand the whole process is bug
prone bug field even when you really
know what you're doing you're always
going to be coming across situations
where it doesn't work the first five
times and you got to figure out why and
this is normal par for the course people
with 20 years experience still run into
problems I've been programming for many
many many years now and you know what
can you do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
