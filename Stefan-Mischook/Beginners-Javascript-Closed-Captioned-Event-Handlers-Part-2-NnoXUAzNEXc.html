event handlers
I of course assume that you've done the
previous video so what we're going to do
now is actually I just want to
demonstrate something you notice how I
was able to use this JavaScript here
inside the event handler now watch what
happens so that you understand we're
just gonna copy this JavaScript I'm just
going to put it up here in the middle of
the page willy-nilly so that it just
seems so as you see what's happening a
few Firefox ones update I'm gonna say
don't bother me I'm teaching from
teaching the people here I'm just gonna
hit refresh you notice that our first
script work I do a mouse-over but you
know sir I see a code here watch this so
your code now the reason this code is
showing up here just being printed page
as normal text whereas over here it's
actually I'm being fired off as
JavaScript well first of all well let's
look at the source code in those p
onmouseover it's gonna be in the source
code
huge page source right you see it right
I don't know source code it isn't these
um these these mouse overs are really
get on my nerves let me just change that
to one quick so it doesn't keep doing
now you know as I was able to do on
click with a lowercase C and it worked
and a capital C and also there we go
Thank You C capital C worked fine too in
JavaScript they there's a convention
where they like to name function names
and event handlers and solve on with
this camelcase method here this is
called camel kiss kisses in between each
word the next word has a capital on
click that's camel case like a hump
right
this is no cat no hump here capital C
makes it look like a how on click I
mentioned this because later on when
we're getting deeper into JavaScript
in certain parts of JavaScript its case
sensitive
it may not respond to this where it's
actually looking for this if that makes
any sense anyway just understand this is
camelcase
understand how this has to be you know
for just to run it has to be within
script tags so just to be totally clear
script I go language say JavaScript and
close it off you see how truly fur makes
it easy for us now watch what happens
you're gonna see how the on get this
alert I'm just gonna go automatic this
alert gets fired off no matter what
because it's not in any event handler
it's not in a function we looked at
function briefly this just gets auto
fired so let's just hold this up refresh
see automatic alert where is this other
event that don't click on me one Raptor
click I'm gonna click now I'm clicking
see how do you collect me so you see how
event handlers in a way allows you to
control when a particular piece of
JavaScript actually happens does that
make sense
one global concept you want to take away
from our study of event handlers is that
essentially they are a mechanism that's
built into JavaScript where you can have
the web browser scan for events so you
can say here let's now scan for any
clicks Arland memo we did mouse over
let's now scan for any time - mouse
actually passes over of his paragraph so
this is like a built-in mechanism in
JavaScript sort of a a free tool that
you have access to and I say free tool
because in other languages you would
have to manually build in your own event
handlers and it's pretty tedious so
JavaScript does this for free for us so
it's kind of cool
and we have access to a whole bunch of
event handlers that we saw the list
before
so this is just a short list of some of
them well I think to dissolve them and
so well no it's not all of them this is
all them that could be applied to the
paragraph right Dreamweavers just making
this easy for us let me just point out
that you don't need to remember to do
this you don't you could just write this
all out manually so if you're using a
text editor like notepad or something
don't worry just type it out and
everything's cool by the way if you're
watching this I would pause the video
now and type out this line of code that
you see here and test it out play with
it once you get it working break it see
what happens when it breaks and this
will go a long way to helping you learn
how to code
let me just nail that
I want to look at the
tag and look at event handlers on the
body tag so you're on
so you notice our event handler list is
different on blur error focus unload on
those on page load on resize when the
page resizes on unload etc so you see
that the list of event handlers really
depends on the particular element that
you're applying the event handler to
that all said on the body typically
you're going to use the onload
when you programming you have to
understand the whole process is bug
prone bug filled even when you really
know what you're doing you're always
going to be coming across situations
where it doesn't work their first five
times and you got to figure out why and
this is normal par furred of course
people of 20 years experience still run
into problems I've been programming for
many many many years now
and you know what can you do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
