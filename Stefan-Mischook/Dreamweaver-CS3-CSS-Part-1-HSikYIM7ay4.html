cool video because we're going to look
at for the first time we're going to
look at a very powerful technology in
web design something called CSS just in
case you don't know in a nutshell CSS is
the sister language to HTML that allows
you to add style to your web pages so
what do I mean by adding style I'm
talking about changing fonts changing
font sizes adding color tree pages
background colors background images
positioning elements on your page
elements whether it be text or
paragraphs or images so CSS is a very
very powerful part of web design and
it's one of the key linchpins if you
will it's something you have to learn
so to give you an idea CSS will take
something like this and it can turn it
into something like this as you might
imagine CSS is very important and it's
something you got to learn that said
this is a dreamweaver cs3 video and not
a dedicated CSS video so I'm going to
concentrate on the CSS tools in
Dreamweaver along the way i'll throw in
it here and there some CSS concepts that
you should know but again we're going to
be concentrated on how Dreamweaver gives
you access to the CSS language
like so many other things in Dreamweaver
we have many different places where we
can access the CSS capabilities so let's
start off by popping open our familiar
page here and I'm just going to point
out a few things so let me just
highlight a piece of text so right here
let's go down in the properties panel
you see you have a CSS button which will
allow us to open up the CSS panel we
also have some drop-down list so it
gives us access to the CSS related stuff
just so that you know whenever you see
style CSS stylesheet that's all related
to CSS we go away up here in our panels
here you notice here we get the CSS
panel now if you don't see as CSS power
you can go into a window and you can
select it here and the CSS panel pops
open and of course we have all kinds of
options in here which we're going to get
into in time finally if we come up here
we have some options up here yes it's in
the text drop down option it's in the of
course CSS styles and it's different
room style here so anyhow we're going to
get into this and with some practical
work and along the way this stuff will
become much more understandable actually
you know what let me just select this
image as you can see here we even have
you know class member i told your class
has to do with CSS here again we have
the option of applying CSS to our image
that's it let's what select a piece of
text and we're going to start off by now
we can go here we can hit the CSS button
which will open up the CSS panel and
once here but you can collapse and open
these things of course and what we're
going to do is we're going to go down
here and we have a few options we have
new style rule new CSS rule
attach stylesheet well get into what the
style sheet is later Hollander let's
just start with something practical so I
click that button and we have a new CSS
rule dialog box that opens and it sets a
default to this thing called class and
we're going to get into class and tag
and advanced very quickly so what we
want to do is we want to let's give it a
name when they call it header one right
so we're naming this class now you know
don't just fall logging you you
understand soon so down here you got
defined in CSS rules this is code write
CSS it's just cold just like HTML is
just code and one of the things you can
do with CSS you can actually create put
all your CSS code rather in a separate
document and then you would link to that
document from your web page there so let
the CSS will do its magic on your page
along the way if any of this stuff is
unclear don't worry just just go if they
will clear up as we actually get into
doing things so what am I going to do
now is I'm actually going to say this
document hauling so what this does it
will get dreamweaver will then insert
the CSS into this page only as a post
into a separate style sheet and reason
I'm doing this is because it's just
simpler for now
so first thing that we did is we
selected the selector type and we'll get
into this and I said take a class when I
get a class and I gave it the name of
header one could call it anything i want
i just wanted to call it header one for
now and I said let's define this in this
document only so what that means the
dream weavers going to write this CSS
code in our index dot HTML page so I
just hit OK and our CSS rule definition
for dot header one pops up so what is
this this is basically dream weavers
tool to allow you to write CSS rules
instead of you having to write it by
hand dreamweaver will write it for you
so let's say remember I selected a piece
of text so header one is going to be CSS
rule CSS style CSS code that will affect
the look of our headers obviously we're
talking about a font here so we can
leave it to the page default font or we
could choose one of your other fonts I'm
going to choose another font just for
the sake of making it look funkier so
i'm going to choose verdanna arial
helvetica so you know your HTML reason
the other three is because first is
going to try and display the pitney
header one with verdanna can find a spot
and we'll go to area of careful on that
final go athletica Helvetica I can't
find out font it will go to style font
called salsa Reeve if you don't know
this mosaul sorry if it's just a anyway
forget about salsa brief but basically
that's why you have three in a row
because it tries to find this font on
the guys system when you use your web
page can't find it just goes to this one
and so on that's why they're always
three in a row three in a row so I'm
going to go in for donna for no
particular reason we can set the size we
can set it in pixels we can set it in
named sizes and people argue with you
which one is best we again this is
beyond the scope of this video but i'm
just going to go with since I want to be
a big head Irma say 18
pixels of course you can change the
units of measurement this is pixels then
you got centimeters and you got all
kinds of different sizes again beyond
the scope of this video at this time so
we're just going to go a pixel so the
text any text what has the class header
one applied to it will have a size of 18
if that doesn't make sense again once we
use it you'll see what I mean we can set
of style you can say make it a taluk
oblique let's leave it normal you can
actually add line-heights to it which
we'll get into later you can underline
it you can / line it you can make it
blink you can do all kinds of different
things there's also wait you can make it
bold lighter you can actually set the
boldness by a number here we're just
going to leave it you know what just for
the sake of our video I'll say wait 400
in case you can tell CSS which kind of
cool no matter what you type in to make
it all capital or make it all lowercase
or all uppercase or leave it finally you
can you click on this little box your
little arrow and you can give it a color
so I'm going to give it a nice
and I won't do a puke green how about
dark orange ok that's it for now so this
now if you look at the CSS rule
definition box ok I'm not going to get
into this now get back to this stuff
later but so we've selected our rules
for the dot header one style I'm just
going to hit apply and I'm going to hit
OK so they see dreamweaver has updated a
page we know that because if you look
you see a little star here that means
the page has changed and that's
dreamweaver telling us that if we want
to save those changes we got to press
save so let's go into code and see what
dreamweaver has done it's going to
minimize this properties window here and
if you look up here this is some CSS
code this probably looks like gibberish
to you but don't worry about it we will
get into some of this anyway and I just
wanted you to know and understand for
this first video of this CSS series in
the dream of course that dream we were
through that dialog box has now inserted
CSS code into our pages
so let's go back to design mode I'm
going to save this file save so let's
pop open our properties again so let's
select some text now I just hold my
mouse cursor selected if we go down into
properties box style drop-down menu look
here and there is our style called
header one which is nice dreamweaver
actually renders in the drop-down list
the way to font the style affects the
text right there so we get an idea of
what we're looking at someone hit header
one click click it and as you can see
our header now is styled with that
particular CSS code so I'm going to hit
save again and what would just do a
quick little preview in the browser so
you get an idea so there you go simple
but with just a little bit of CSS we
styled our pages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
