site.com that's me in this video what I
want to talk about is this recent
facebook purchase of Instagram and
there's a few issues about this that
make it a curious by as far as I'm
concerned first of all Instagram is just
a photo sharing and tagging application
it's been around since 2010 so just
couple years old it's got like 10
employees it makes no money there's no
defined business model as of yet as far
as I understand and started by a couple
of 20 year olds hey it's interesting to
me what makes me think that this is an
unusual purchase is I wonder why
Facebook would pay a billion dollars for
a company that's just a couple years old
the the technology that they developed
is not proprietary it's not what's
proprietary but it's easily reproduced a
photo sharing app for Android and iPhone
it is not that difficult to make they
have 30 million users which is a lot but
compared to Facebook it's it's nothing
so first question I ask myself is why
would Facebook pay such a huge amount of
money for something that they could
probably pop out themselves within a few
months if that long you know they've
been around for two years but much of
that two years has been on things that
you know really not related to app
development so you figure you know two
years so you figure the first you can
knock off six months of that two years
on sushi parties and sushi and sake
parties you take another six months off
the company's time in securing financing
and so on all the business and
things so you eliminate a year so you
got a year left so in that year you know
you're looking at let's say maybe you
can eight months of development software
development and that's being generous
because a lot of that time would be sort
of trying to figure out the UI specifics
about how the application will operate
and so on if you're coming at it having
already seen it you know it functioning
so Facebook was looking at Instagram and
boy okay what are they doing here okay
it seems to work to copy it its
functionality into integrated into
Facebook wouldn't be such a big deal so
there I guess they're buying a community
but they're buying you know relatives of
Facebook a relatively small community so
they're going to spend a billion dollars
on that so it's not because yeah you
know again let me let me just recap this
it's not that the technology is special
it's not that it's very hard to
reproduce it's not and I'm a software
developer i can tell you that it's not
that you know they have a solid business
model it doesn t and they're not making
any money it's you know so you gotta
wonder it's not because they have a huge
user base that Facebook is worried about
in 30 millions a lot but compared to
Facebook you know hundreds of millions
what's the deal so you have to ask
yourself what's the real reason why are
they buying this thing for so much money
and maybe I'm a conspiracy theorist or
something but I have to tell you you
know something smells here and what's
interesting interesting about this is
that you see many of the same venture
capital guys the VC guys as I say are
involved with who are involved was in
Instagram they're the same a lot of the
same people involved with facebook so
what I'm thinking having there's a bit
of an insider
back scratching going on here a little
bit of you know Facebook is going public
soon they're going to fleece the public
i mean i'm going to offer their stock to
the public and then so you got these
guys with the instagram guy has only
been around a couple of years they're
growing quick in terms of user base you
know again this whole thing about
evaluating companies based on how many
users they have it's very reminiscent of
during the 1990s during the dot-com
bubble days where businesses were
evaluated based on how many visits they
had to their sites so instead of visits
we have now users and I guess you can
argue and this is in my opinion really
stretching it I guess you can argue that
users or a bit more valuable than
visitors I suppose you know it takes
takes two seconds I suppose more to
enter your email address in your name
and narrow your user now but you know
after the.com bubble crash and everybody
realized it was just a giant scam you
know all these companies are evaluated
tremendous values based on nothing
except they have a lot of users and I
think we're seeing the same thing with
this whole social networking fad I think
and this is just speculation my part I
think the VC guy is a month the money
guys are in at the bottom of Facebook
and Instagram I think they're they're
worried that the end may be near with
the scam I think people are starting to
realize slowly and maybe slowly slowly
but surely that this is just pretty much
like the dot-com bubble days starting to
see more and more articles out there
people start to recognize this whole
idea of evaluating companies based on
their user base rather based on actual
revenues is a stupid like you know
Facebook itself its evaluation is
astronomically high
I think it's a total rip I think the VC
guys original funders are looking to get
out and cash out anybody buys a Facebook
IPO is taking a massive risk it's priced
to perfection you know their pricing at
basically a hundred times earnings a
hundred years of earnings it's
absolutely astoundingly ridiculous you
know in terms of you know how how much
of a premium they're giving this company
it's crazy because as we've seen with
previous social networks like Friendster
and MySpace these things can fall out of
favor in a moment's notice and so I
think with the Instagram my guess and
it's just my guess is that you got the
same VC guys the same money guys or in
on facebook saying listen let's roll the
Instagram into Facebook because I don't
think we're going to be able to develop
this ain't quick enough to IPO it and
that's what net is just a quick cash out
look at Groupon Groupon I warned against
that and look at all this all this dirt
is starting to come out as far as I
understand where there's inconsistencies
shall we say with their accounting look
at Groupon you got to really look at
these technologies there's not much to
it to build a social networking site is
very trivial there are there software
packages out there but it will give you
all the capabilities or a lot of the
capabilities of Facebook for 200 bucks
and use install it away you go yes
Facebook's of value is in its brand its
name and so on but again what myspace
has taught us and friends to has taught
us these two very large and dominant
social networks in their day that this
this can fade very quickly very quickly
there's nothing on facebook that's so
special that's going to keep people
there and it doesn't take much and these
things are
garbage back in the 1990's yahoo bought
something called geo cities and
Geocities was kind of you know it's just
a basic you know build your website type
of web place it was pre facebook type of
thing there was no social networking but
anyway the point is it was a free
service they had a ton of users and yeah
who bought it for a billion bucks and
they eventually shut it down because it
was just a bunch of junk you know it's
easy to get a lot of users when you give
something away and this whole business
model that we see now where it's about
pump up a company get a bunch of users
then try and gin up the sales of ads you
know everybody's selling ads like you
know it would be cool somebody actually
sold something some product instead of
just ads and something tangible
something real you know but anyway
that's on top of my rant so yeah again I
look at this Facebook Instagram deal
four billion I cv's this little cabal of
venture capital guys funding these
businesses and selling these businesses
back and forth to other businesses but
they're all have their hands in and then
they're putting out as quickly as it can
putting it out on the market on you know
so that wall street you can get in on
the gig so that they can sell shares and
cash out themselves that's my
interpretation it is this is all
it really puts a bad in a bad face on
technology if you ask me I think this
whole this whole social networking
bubble is going to fall apart at some
point I'm not sure when I don't like it
it reminds me of the the wall street
housing hustle remember remember that
houses can never go down in value
remember bad houses are a great
investment remember that remember that
whole thing then we find out it was a
giant wall street scam wherever pumping
up valuations and they were getting
people into the market to push up
evaluations meanwhile they were skimming
making her money on the transactions
making their money on the fake
evaluations and then the whole thing
crashed and then they had it to bill
over to John Q public to bail them out
and then they continue to make their
bonuses this is not too far off from
that as far as I'm concerned this whole
thing I anyway that's just me I'm a
renter here my apologies again I would
be very wary about getting involved in
any Facebook IPO they are priced to
perfection in that paying a hundred
years worth of projected earnings for a
company and this is rough numbers is
absolutely crazy considering historical
averages people pay no more than ten
years worth of revenues for any asset
whether it be a company or a house or
anything so whenever you see this kind
of crazy stuff happen you just got to
step aside and let the madness ensues
without your money going down this pit
so there you go that's my rat story
about it gets on my nerves these type of
things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
