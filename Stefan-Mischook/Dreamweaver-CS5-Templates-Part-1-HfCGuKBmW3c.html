talking about working with a great
time-saving feature inside of
Dreamweaver called templates and at up
to this point you've really seen some of
the advantages of working with CSS
especially external CSS if you remember
making a change in your external
stylesheet and then applying that change
to multiple pages all at the same time
because they all share the same
stylesheet
well Dreamweaver templates if you can
think about it in this fashion is the
exact same functionality except instead
of concerning itself with CSS
Dreamweaver templates specifically
address what to do inside of an
environment with multiple HTML pages so
what I want to do to start with this is
I'm going to ask you to come up here and
say manage sites inside of your files
window or you could go to site new site
and we're going to create a new site and
if you're following along with the
downloaded files that I've provided for
the tutorials you can just name this
stitch in time and will point to the
local site folder I'm just going to
point to the desktop where I asked you
to put your stuff if you go to the
practice folder you'll see chapter 6 6
excuse me there is a stitch in time
folder in here and as you can see it's
just got the basic skeleton of a web
site index web images and CSS so we'll
choose that and I'll click on save
alright now that we're done with that we
can see that we have a number of files
in here and you'll notice if I open up
the index page first and foremost you
can see that I've got you know the basic
structure that we've been working on and
if you follow it along with us when we
were discussing things like form
elements and playing with the contact
area you can see here I've opened up the
contact area and as you can see it's
just blank well I'm going to close this
but I'm just keeping the index page open
for a second let's assume that you've
created the index page and you've
created it pretty much as I've mentioned
you know do the lines share the work on
the index page almost 100
if not the entire hundred percent of the
index page should be finished before you
save as all of your other pages well in
this case with Dreamweavers templates we
can do the same thing we're going to be
saving as and we're going to be actually
adding some things to that save so
here's what I want you to do to get
started first of all I have a page here
which I'm going to now save as a
template so if we do this notice it's
inside of the site that we called stitch
in time that's cool there are no
existing templates already in this site
which is fine description I mean we
don't really need one but quite
literally it's for the hypothetical
stitch in time website now I could save
this with the name index and it gives
you that suggestion because I'm saving
the index.html page but remember
whatever you're saving here is going to
be a template so it's going to have the
DWT Dreamweaver template extension so
it's not gonna work like a HTML page we
don't actually you know point to a DWT
page online it's a HTML page so it
doesn't need to be called index I'm
gonna call it stitch in time in other
words same name as a root folder same
name as everything else so I'm gonna
click Save and now it's gonna ask me if
I want to update these links so you
could say yes sure update these links
and basically what you'll end up seeing
is not really anything different but you
will notice that this now is looking
here as a DWT page and what you might
also notice is that inside of your site
window you can see that a new folder has
been added it's called templates and
inside of it a stitch in time DWT this
page right here so here's how they work
when you're working with a template the
first thing you want to do is define
which areas on this particular page are
going to be editable in other words what
we want to do is there are going to be
certain areas that are not going to
change for example I don't want people
to be able to you know go in and in
discriminately changed what's in the
navigation areas but from page to page
this area in here may change in fact
even the sidebar may change as well so
this is what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna
scroll down and you don't even need the
code view open at this point actually
I'll just go to design and if I scroll
down here and notice you'll see the red
box for the main div and you can notice
here it says div main is the ID name for
this div so this div here I want to
define as an editable region in other
words when people are using this
template they won't be able to change
what's in here but they will be able to
change what's in here and later on in
here as well so we're gonna go to insert
template objects and I'm gonna say make
this an editable region so we'll give it
a name since this is our main area it's
got the div name main I can give it an
editable region with the same name as
well so I'll click OK and take a look at
what's going on inside of Dreamweaver
here it says main and nothing else has
really changed but now what I want to do
is to also define the sidebar as a main
or as a editable region as well so I'll
say insert template objects editable
region notice there's also the shortcut
of alt command V on a Mac or alt ctrl V
on a PC so here's one I'm just gonna
call it sidebar all right so now we've
got two editable regions to work from
all right well what does this do well
first of all we're gonna say save and
we're saving this page does nothing else
it's just saving this one page that's
great
now what we want to do are to make new
pages so in other words here's what
we'll do I mean technically speaking I
can even close this Dreamweaver template
page I don't even need it open at this
point right remember it's still there in
the templates but now check it out if we
are going to be building the rest of our
website let's do this we're going to now
create a new file and notice it's not a
new blank page it's not a blank template
we're creating because we could have
done that as well
for example everything that we had done
in our index.html page to build our
stitching time website could have been
done from a blank template to start but
here I did it kind of backwards since we
had a page already so I'm going to
create a page from a template well in
the stitch in time site as you can see
I've got three sites here and one of
them is called stitch in time so in
there there is a template called stitch
in time and here's what it looks like
alright great so we're going to create
this particular template so as you can
see here's a page and look it's untitled
and if you're to look inside your code
view it's got these weird things going
on where the well first of all let's
notice one thing if I have an editable
region like Maine I can put my cursor in
there and I could select things and make
changes same thing with sidebar area
notice but check it out here I cannot
make any changes in the nav section why
because it's not editable same thing
with over here right so it's given me
the big Ghostbusters symbol right I
afraid of no templates so that's what's
happening here it doesn't let you work
with it also let's notice something else
the area that is editable we can see it
and selectable even in your code view
but the area that is not editable check
that out right you can select it but
it's grayed out it's not letting us make
those changes also notice you might have
like these weird long a links in here
don't worry about that because as soon
as we save this page all of these links
will be set up the way we want to I'll
come back and show you this in a second
so just to show that this is made some
changes right so here my design view
instead of exciting headline I'm going
to say and again just for our purposes
index just to let us know that this is
the index page and I'm going to say
index sidebar over here just so we know
that this is in fact the index pages
sidebar now you could leave the text as
it is or whatever so I will now come in
and say let's save this
page AZ index dot HTML so if we save it
it's gonna say one exists you want to
replace it yes we do so we will replace
it and now this is our index page and by
the way let's look at our code perfect
you see how the a tags now don't have
all that yucky messy code these are all
perfect and they work exactly the way we
want but again we can't change them from
the index page directly you'll see why
in a second the only thing we can change
are the editable regions okay so if
we've got these editable regions in
place now all we need to do is to make
the same changes in the rest of our
pages and we'll do that as soon as we
come back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
