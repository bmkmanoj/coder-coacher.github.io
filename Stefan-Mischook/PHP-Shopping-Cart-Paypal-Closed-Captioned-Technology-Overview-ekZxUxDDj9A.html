second video in a series of videos where
we're going to be building a very simple
paypal shopping cart using ma'am on the
mac which is a stack of technologies
which sit on mac OS x that's the first m
apache my sequel which is the third m
and PHP which is the p there's an
equivalent on Windows or there's several
equivalents that has take the form of
wamp w.a.m.p and on Linux it's lamp
which is la MP but the technology stack
is essentially the same and we're not
going to be doing anything with my
sequel databases so it's just going to
be essentially at patchy and PHP we're
also going to be storing our data in an
XML file so I'm just going to bring up
this is eclipse which is going to be the
development environment that I'm going
to be using and here is a file called
store XML where I'm actually storing the
data for our store so what is an XML
file an XML file is a bunch of nodes
which you can see here they're basically
just tags which can hold other tags and
all XML files will have a root node
which in this case is called items and
then you have a whole bunch of sub nodes
which in turn can have other sub nodes
and basically we've got three products
here and we are describing them using
tags that make sense for our information
architecture to put things simply these
tags describe our data so we've got an
ID a title description an image tag in a
price tag now if you're looking at this
in your saying oh this looks a lot like
HTML well you're you're right the only
difference is that we're HTML describes
text that's being presented for a web
page on a web browser
here we're using the same style of
language to describe data and so we've
got tomato soup we've got pasta and
we've got fresh cumin which you saw in
the last video with their respective
prices the other thing that we're going
to be doing is we're going to be using
this tool called eclipse which you're
seeing right here as opposed to a text
editor now I'm a big fan of this text
editor on the Mac called bbedit and I'll
show you that you know you can basically
open files in the same way however it
can be a little cumbersome when you're
dealing with a lot of little files or
you're like I've got a shopping cart
class here what you're seeing and you
know I've got maybe a functions file
here and while you do get syntax
highlighting like the blue and the pink
here what you don't get is you don't get
Auto completion which I find really
handy when I want to describe the code
that I'm writing so if i open the same
functions file here in eclipse the
advantage of using something like an ID
or an integrated development environment
is that it manages the whole project for
me so if i type get underscore i do
control space i'm actually going to get
a whole bunch of different functions
some of them are functions i've written
like get xml catalog and some of them
are functions that are provided by PHP
so that's for example get magic quotes
GPC hopefully you're not using magic
quotes but there it is get call stack or
get browser these are PHP functions and
the same thing applies to objects so
what we're going to do in this video and
I'll go back to this is we're going to
be creating a shopping cart object a
shopping cart class and when you're
building out classes it's really helpful
to have auto completion so I can type in
something like SC equals new shopping
cart and then I can do SC and if the
shopping cart class is actually
referenced then I'll actually see things
like empty cart or get item cost or get
item quality and so on and so forth so
it becomes really handy on let me just
do that again so you can see so you have
add item empty card get item cost how
we're essentially building a language
that describes our application and auto
completion and having an integrated
development environment just makes that
a little easier and it's free so why not
in this video series you're probably
going to hear me use the word
refactoring and refactoring is this nerd
term that refers to refining the code
that you've already written and you
refactor so that your code has more
meaning so that it makes more sense I
also when you refactor your code you
provide yourself the opportunity to look
at what you've written and say well
could this be written a little better
does it really do what I'm actually
trying to do and also it lets you make
sure that you don't repeat yourself and
that's one of these programmer
principles which is called dry which is
basically just don't repeat yourself so
I'm going to give you an example of this
right now assuming that now this is in
our functions file but this could be in
any PHP file I'm just going to echo a
list item now list items are pretty
standard in PHP and I'm going to have a
variable here so it's going to be list
value and I'm going to create another Li
there now we've all done this before
list item is basically just one node in
a one-column list in HTML so if I had
something like list value equals hello
world
then this would echo a list item with
hello world in the middle so far so good
now let's say I want to echo a whole
bunch of different values I could do
this and then I could change what list
value is to be hello world to and hello
world three and every single time list
value would change and it would echo
itself but you notice if you looked at
this that there's actually a lot of
repetition and we can clean this up
quite a bit so I'm going to provide i'm
going to do a very quick little
refactoring of this a little quick
refinement i'm going to create a new
variable here called list values and
it's going to be an array i'm going to
have hello the world and i'm going to
have hello world too and i'm going to
have hello world three and then i'm
going to use a for each statement to
essentially refactor this i'm going to
say for each list values as value echo
now you and we don't need this anymore
and so what we've done is we've
essentially refactored our code we don't
even even need these curly braces so
we've taken something that was
originally six lines of code and we've
made it three lines of code and actually
the code is more descriptive we can very
easily get a grasp of what this pattern
does it means just by looking at these
three lines rather than having a whole
bunch of duplication in our code now we
could even take this a step further if
we noticed that hello world was being
repeated and actually there was
concatenation involved then we could
have a prefix calling it hello world and
here it would be a prefix and this would
be a prefix plus the two and this is the
prefix + 3 or concatenated with three
again same coat another refactoring so
if we change hello world now we only
have to change it in one place and
that's oftentimes what you'll see and
what we're going to be doing in these
videos when we find configuration
variables variables that define for
example where our catalog is being
stored we don't want that to be muddied
around everywhere we just want to have
one place where we can define this
constant variable and we can refer to it
so that's a bit about refactoring you'll
see me do it many times but I just
wanted to give a very simple example of
what that looks like and the last thing
we're going to be doing is we're going
to be looking at PayPal and the PayPal
sandbox and we're going to be creating a
developer account with paypal I
personally find their website for
developers is a little confusing so I'm
going to go through and I'm going to
create pre-configured accounts for the
buyer and the seller and we're going to
look at very briefly what the different
offerings that PayPal has are and where
this particular shopping cart fits into
that
and it's a very simple shopping cart so
we're going to start by using their
buttons and we're going to modify them
to build a bit of a shopping cart page
and then from there we're going to send
that data to paypal and then from there
that's how we get our money so in the
next video we're going to start looking
at XML and practically and using it to
build out our shopping cart thanks for
