PHP and today what I'm gonna be talking
about is left joins and right joins or
they're also known as inner joins and
outer joins and we're gonna be building
off of an example from the first video
where we created a category table and a
post table so we're just going to I'm
just going to go back to my wonderful
script that was written in the last
video and here you can see that we've
basically got code to create a category
table and we've got code to create a
post table and then we've just got a
bunch of insertions into the category
table and then a bunch of insertions
into the post table so far so good so I
just select all of this and I paste it
in then I should be able to do a very
simple join by doing something like
select star from post P left join
category C on P dot category ID equals C
dot ID which was the last thing we did
in the last video so if I hit enter as I
mentioned before you're gonna get an ID
and you're gonna get a category ID and
so on and so forth now this isn't
exactly this the best way of doing a
select statement because you'll notice
that now we've got these two ID fields
which can be very misleading if you were
to run this query in PHP and then you
wanted to grab everything from the ID
field PHP might actually get confused as
to which ID column you're talking about
so we've got one ID column on the left
which is going from one to six and the
other one on the right which is
basically the join on categories so one
way of mitigating that is to actually be
a little more specific in our in our
joins we can do something like select P
dot title comma P content comma C dot
name
from post P left join category C on P
dot category underscore ID so you'll
notice that this is exactly the same
thing that we just did except that now
instead of this star
we're actually replacing that by being a
little more selective about the columns
that we're asking for the only part of
this select query that's changed is the
star the star has been replaced by title
content and category name and so now I'm
getting something a little different oh
whoops
I forgot the on category underscore ID
is equal to CID there we go sorry about
that so here now I'm getting something
that looks a little more useful to my to
my PHP application the advantage of
something like this is that let's say I
want to change politics and I want it to
be uppercase now I only need to make a
change to one table in one place so if I
do an update statement and I say update
update category set name equals politics
wear name equals politics and then I
were to rerun this query then you'd
notice that both of these categories
automatically changed and that's really
the power of a relational database is
that you can change the way that the
database is relating information and
making sure that at the same time you
only have one copy of every single bit
of data and by ensuring the only f1 copy
you're going to make sure that there's a
high level of integrity to your data if
somebody changes something then
everything else is going to change as
opposed to you know if you had an
employee's table and you had you know if
you had like an employee with an HR
department and then you had a project
manager who also had their own you know
listing of the employee and one person
decided to change the
salary of that person and the other
person didn't get wind of it then you
would have the scenario where you'd have
the same data but it would actually be
different in two different places and
relational databases mitigate those
problems tremendously through building
these kind of relationships through
primary and foreign keys which is what
we're doing so that is a left join let's
go back to the first left join that we
did which was this one right here now we
can also do a right join which is
actually the opposite so if I do a
select star from Post P because you
might see this the right join are also
known as the outer join on category C on
P dot category underscore ID equals C
dot ID and we're gonna get something a
little different in that now we're gonna
get null values and the reason is is
that we're joining the category table to
the post table and we end up with
something like this where we've got all
the categories including the categories
that aren't even being used if we wanted
to take this a step further and we were
absolutely adamant about doing a right
join then we would want to filter that
out and we could do that just by saying
where PID in other words where the post
ID is not null and this would of course
clean it up now
I want to illustrate one more kind of
caveat in all of this what if we have a
post that doesn't have a category it's a
good question so in my script over here
I'm gonna just do that and see what
happens so I'm gonna create another post
here and the title of this post is going
to be our favorite sandwich recipes and
it doesn't really belong anywhere well
probably belongs in other but just to
illustrate my point I'm gonna set this
to null so we're not going to have a
category ID
select all copy paste and we're good to
go again if I say select star from post
I'm gonna see that I have my category
IDs and then I've got my favorite
sandwich recipes that are unfortunately
not going to be represented here so I
think it's a good time now to actually
start remembering these join statements
in my script I'll go back to the one we
just did so select star from post P left
join category C on P category underscore
ID equals CID C it becomes like a second
language and I'm just gonna paste this
at the bottom here so we don't forget
about it so here what we're getting is
the opposite problem where we've got a
category or we've got a post but the
post doesn't have a category now
depending on the kind of business rules
that you have this might or might not be
a problem and this is really the
flexibility that the database offers you
you know if it's not relevant to a
particular post then you might just want
to say where is not null for the
category ID much like what we did in the
last bit and the last example with the
right join so that's a quick wrap-up of
left and right joints</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
