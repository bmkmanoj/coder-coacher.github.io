nerd it up big time alright somebody
asked a question on the youtubes they
asked whether or not I could define the
basics of programming or as I like to
call the core concepts now I jotted down
a few notes on my joint pad let me start
off by saying that this is a look at all
these concepts from overhead few like a
flyover I'm not gonna get into too many
details and as you listen to this stuff
and you're a beginner or you're just
learning don't freak out don't go home
and I got to learn all this stuff it's
unbelievable a lot of his stuff you've
got to learn over time and the whole
point of a good course a good course
does two things number one it simplifies
all these concepts and techniques and
number two and identify the key
components in the right order so that
you can get up and running as quickly as
possible as a coder as a developer
that's what a good course does
ultimately these foundational concepts
these basic concepts and covering
totally everything because some of the
foundational concepts will depend on the
type of coding that you're going to do
the type of programming that you're
going to do but this is going to give
you a pretty good overview of what I'm
talking about what I'm talking about
foundational concepts so let's start
with number one you look at language
types now you have different computer
languages you have markup languages the
most big one is html5 of course you have
styling language is CSS that's the only
one I've I'm aware of and then you have
full fledged programming languages
there's differences between these types
of languages they each have their
purposes now programming language is a
language actually provides functionality
actually does something it provides the
brains if you will of an app that you
create in programming languages could be
JavaScript could be Java C++ C Python
PHP Ruby Swift and many many others go
etc and what you find is that different
programming languages will have
different specializations they have
different
says so let's go into that in
programming languages you can have
compiled languages versus interpreted
there's many pros and cons by the way
what you're going to see when you're
going through these foundational
concepts you have to understand not one
particular language not one particular
framework if you will not one particular
approach is universally best it really
depends on the type of work that you're
doing but it's good to understand these
basic concepts so you can make proper
decisions based on the type of work what
you want to do and be the type of
project you're working on so you can
come to that project with the right
language with the right approach was the
right thinking so yes so you got
compiled languages versus interpreted
right you look at runtime speed versus
writing speed so for example let's
explore that little concept run time
versus writing time or write time run
time is basically the speed of the
language as it runs when it runs so
let's say you're reading an app a
program in C++ it writes really slow
meaning because it's a highly the type
of language that it is C++ requires but
you spent a lot more time writing it
versus other languages like a Python for
instance where it's much quicker to
write and but the trade-off is that
Python runs much slower than C++ so
there's runtime versus right time and
depending on the type of work that you
need to do you might choose a language
like C++ or even assembly which is super
fast at runtime but very slow at right
time and many situations in most
situations these days you're going to
choose a language that is faster to
write with but maybe a little slower at
runtime again these are just basic
concepts and don't expect you to learn
all this is just a Sunday morning vlog
I'm having my coffee I'm just going over
basic concepts here I just want to give
you an overview in terms of language
types you can get into things compiled
which interpreted strongly-typed verses
loosely typed on the inside a little
later then you can get into things like
type type conversion versus coercion etc
this is all related to data types which
is a part of the fundamental language
constructs these are universal
constructs across programming languages
so what are these language constructs
you look at functions variables arrays
memory management objects loops
conditional data types that you get into
things like ol P versus procedural
programming you can get into into an OPA
self object-oriented program procedural
vs. ol P by the way if you're a total
beginner it's just a style of
programming we'll just leave it at that
within Opie there's these things these
basic concepts that you have to
understand inheritance composition
interfaces objects versus classes and
then there are considerations in terms
of how you would use an oo P style
language in terms of something called
code reuse again code reuse is one of
the basic concepts in programming you
want to reuse as much code as possible
because of a it saves you time and saves
errors so there's different approaches
to doing them in object-oriented
programming you have something called
inheritance which is one way which I say
use very sparingly and then in other
ways they use something called
composition and interfaces that's the
way I prefer and this comes to another
basic concept tight versus loose
coupling of your objects or of your code
base what are the basic concepts in
programming is that you want to write
chunks of code in object-oriented
programming that would be her objects
again this may be total nerd gibberish
to you just try to take away two basic
concepts when you're listening to me
here so when you got loose coupling
versus tight coupling in your code
essentially our goal is as programmer is
to as programmers is to keep our code
very loosely coupled meaning having our
chunks of code having them able to
operate independently of each other so
you have a chunk of code
you have a chunk of code here when they
communicate but they're not dependent on
each other they you so you can move them
around and there it just gives you a lot
more flexibility in terms of when you're
writing your apps so again these are
basic concepts that as you become more
experienced as you become an experienced
developer you you keep this in mind so
house you in terms of this the
decision-making as you're developing
your apps in terms of what's the better
approach based on these concepts right
yeah so let's pull out of the languages
now and then there's this infrastructure
around the languages now a lot of times
these days a lot of people are doing web
based coding because everything is
communicating over the web so you have
to understand basic concepts like client
or the server server-side programming
versus client-side programming is very
much related then you can get into the
basic mechanisms of the Internet of the
web so we call HTTP the hypertext
Transfer Protocol there's FTP File
Transfer Protocol and there's other
protocols just a method of transferring
wealth information over a network the
biggest network in the world of course
is the internet so you have different
protocols there's different reasons why
you would use it and see and there's you
know there's there's a there's things to
learn about that can affect the way you
rate your app one basic concept about
the web is that it's a stateless it's
it's a stateless paradigm if you will
again I'm going down the nerd rabbit
hole here my apologies but just this
this is one of the key concepts that the
web is stateless and as such you have to
design your apps in a very particular
way this used to screw people up in the
90s a little web first came about
traditional coders who did C++ or VB
Kodi who did something called
client-side code programming they they
had a difficult time dealing with the
stateless nature of the web and how apps
had to be constructed had to be built
based on that reality anyway this a lot
of these some of these concepts a lot of
these concepts and I introduced actually
in my
courses now of course is I have one
called beginner's HTML beginner's
JavaScript beginners CSS beginner it's
PHP I'm renaming them with the release
of studio web 4 because they
misrepresent what they're about they
should be instead of calling beginners
HTML 5 it should be from beginner to pro
you know because I cover the basics but
I get into things like HTTP client
server request response model in an HTML
course and there's a reasons for that
and I get into all that anyway see me
with the JavaScript in a PHP so on from
these foundational concepts you build up
into other felt a little higher up a
little bit more advanced and you got
something called design patterns and
programmatic design patterns these are
ways of organizing your code ways of
structuring your code and design
patterns allows programmers to
communicate each other communicate with
each other in terms of how they feel
certain aspects of an app of a pro of a
program how it should be designed and
the biggest ones out there well the
biggest one is called MVC Model View
controller you see most modest man just
about most web apps are created with MVC
style and there's many many other design
patterns but there's some big ones out
there MVC is the most important and then
you have what you find
just like with martial artists martial
artists will have favorite techniques
like as a martial arts I learned many
many many many techniques many many
different ways of attacks and defense
but at the end of the day add a few
things that I'd like to do and you see
that you've champion fighters as well
they they're trained in all kinds of
different techniques or they're aware of
the possibilities but you'll see in
competition when they actually fight
they may use one or two or three things
over and over and over again with
different setups same thing with
programming programmers will learn all
kinds of different design patterns
different approaches but they will tend
to focus on a few things that tends to
work for them and I'm no exception so
MVC of course everybody uses MVC just
about and one of my favorite design
the filter design pattern McCaul
decorators i have aryan - that it would
be dependency injection again this is
high-level nerd stuff so if you're going
oh my god what is this guy talking about
don't worry this is just a Sunday
afternoon vlog near discussion so you
know don't worry about it this will come
easy this will come with time as you
progress deeper and deeper finally I
just want to end off with this because
this is something point number seven
here this is something that a lot of
academic programmers don't recognize and
I call it the developer workflow a
developer workflow is is literally that
it's a work flow how your work flows and
how you structure the software building
process and one thing that maybe
developers don't recognize or don't
emphasize enough is how your client
figures into the work flow so people
will think about workflows developer
workflows in terms of the code structure
and and the infrastructure around your
code and how you're going to sort of how
you're going to deploy that you know
using repos and all this kind of stuff
and development cycles but one thing
that has to be considered it's not
recognized enough is how the type of
client you're dealing with whether it be
a small business client will be another
department in a large organization
whether it be a large client how your
interactions with the client will have
an impact in your workflow because
ultimately in real world programming the
client will be coming back at you with a
change request with feedback in terms of
how the app or how the program runs and
this injection from your client if you
will this participation of your client
and how your client participates in the
development process is going to have an
impact in terms how the codebase rolls
out and you have to consider you have to
consider all that for efficiency sake so
when I'm working with my developer my
lead developers well my lead developer
right now and my support developers
around them
I have to consider the long-term
trajectory of my software
and because I know both ends of the game
I'm a client and I understand the
business model very well and I also
understand the development model I
structure the developer workflow
accordingly so that we don't waste our
time we don't have work that's
overwritten if you will because of bad
communication and we don't overload also
the developers with too much information
about what's coming forward so one of
the things I've talked about in previous
vlogs is how important it is for small
business owners to have at least some
knowledge of coding not necessarily not
to become coders but just so that they
can understand the process a little bit
better so that they can better
communicate with the developers saving
time saving money saving headaches and
that's important at the end of the day
all this coding all this programming all
it's there to do is to save time and to
facilitate a certain process right think
about it Facebook as elaborate as it is
just a way to communicate and to sell
ads and to expose the ads to people
YouTube it's you know pretty elaborate
app but it's a basically a video based
social network it's there again to share
information that's at the end of day
that's all it does that's pretty much it
so what the last point I want you to
what I would suggest rather that you
take away from it is that you have to
consider your client interface your how
you're doing with your actual clients
people I'm not talking about client
software for actual people how their
interactions with decoders what the
developer team weirdest things develop
or how this impacts in terms of how you
structure your app and how you proceed
in terms of building your your your
software this is again I'm gonna close
off here this is very high level I'm
just jumping around here I just wanted
to give people an idea what I'm talking
about what I'm talking about core
programming and again in my courses I
expose these things but not all these
things some of these things require a
little bit more experience to get into
the job again of the teacher is to a to
simplify into
to expose to the student what they need
to know at the right time to establish
that solid base that's foundation so
vatican's much more quickly move ahead
to produce good production code at a
professional level I hope that makes
sense
