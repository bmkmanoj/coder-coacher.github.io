created our container div or our div
with the ID called container we've
separated inside of our code view notice
it's there at the top it's hard to see
because there's no text inside of it so
it's also hard to select so what I want
you to do is to make sure that in your
code view if you're following along and
dreamweaver you can even tab that in if
you prefer I want you to have your
cursor and make sure that it's inside of
the div called container remember we
also added a little bit of a code at the
end here so that our comment will tell
us where that container div ends so now
that we're right here we're going to
insert another div and this particular
div tag we're going to give another ID
to and we're going to call it a header
and the header will define a CSS rule
for as well so here we are with our
header div it's going to be defined in
style dot CSS that's excellent come in
here and say ok and what I want to do is
we don't have to worry about positioning
or anything like that with regards to
absolute fixed or relative or anything
like that but we will define its width
and the width is going to be 960 exactly
the same width as the container itself
now I didn't even have to do that
because as a block level element it
would have stretched out for the actual
width of the container itself and that's
fine but while we're here there's really
no reason why you can't introduce this
particular width now normally I don't
really give a height value however I
will in fact give a height value this
time just so that we can actually expand
what's inside there and i can give you
guys the opportunity to see how big we
can make the header area be however we
want it to be so you know i could come
in here and i could say just give me
like a hundred hundred pixels you can
change that based on your design
or whatever else you want to be doing
and at the same time we're also going to
go into the background area here and I'm
just going to give it you know simple
background color you don't have to be
very fancy at this point just choose a
very simple color and proceed from that
point so what you can see here is some
very basic information I haven't really
defined anything else so I'm just going
to click OK don't really need to define
anything else at this point because the
header is doing some very simple stuff
for us so we're just going to click ok
now what you'll see is we have content
for ID header goes here and that's fine
nothing wrong with that we can have that
information in there as we go along it's
perfectly great to do so but do notice
that we have our content and what I'm
going to do is to just go into my code
view and just clean things up a little
bit more so we can see what things look
like remember you could put as much
spacing as you want in here it's not
really a problem everything will be a
little easier to sort of look at if you
know what's going on inside of it so
I'll also at this point just follow my
own advice and at the end of their i
will say end of header all right so with
that information in place and hit the
refresh go to Safari and preview this
and again we'll have to save the index
page and notice the CSS is not saved so
we'll save that as well now we can see
our header inside of this window and
notice because the header is inside of
the container the container is as we saw
always centering that information so
that's great now that we've got the
header in place all we need to do is to
define the three columns that are going
to go underneath the header and we'll do
that in just a second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
