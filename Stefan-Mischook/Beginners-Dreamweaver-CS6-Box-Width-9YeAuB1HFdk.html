CSS layout by looking at the box model a
little bit closer than we did in the
last chapter for example first thing I
want you to do is to define a site will
go to new site will create a new site
that we can just call layout so give the
site name layout and let's point to
local site folder so wherever you've
placed your dreamweaver cs6 folder
source files let's point to chapter five
right now it only shows the box model
but I'll have some other ones in here
soon enough we'll save that and we'll
click ok now that box model has an index
page inside of it as well as an empty
CSS file so let's double-click the index
page and you'll see that I just
basically have some very simple
information there's also these two lines
here now let me show you how to get that
working if you go to your view menu I'm
going to uncheck my rulers but what I
want you to do if you don't have your
ruler showing just do this go to view
rulers and show once you have rulers
showing what I would like you to do is
to go to the side over here and click
inside one of these rulers then drag out
this line to about 300 there you go now
this little ruler is going to be visible
don't worry it won't be visible in the
browser it's just there for you for
visual aid so it says 300 now we do have
a CSS folder here but it's empty so
let's open up our CSS style sheets and
will create a new CSS rule now notice
that the object that I happen to have
right now this blue box has an ID called
container if you don't already see the
ID in your selector choose it and then
select your name give it the name
container so start with the pound symbol
or the hash marks and then container
where do we want to save it this
document only well I
wouldn't really mind doing that in this
situation because it's just a one page
example but just to emphasize the fact
that the external style sheets are the
most effective I'd like you to click on
this new style sheet will click OK and
we'll go to the box model and will
choose the CSS folder here and what
we're going to call it is box dot CSS
I'll save that so what do we want to do
with this container graphic here well
first of all I'd like to just go to the
box model category and in the box we're
going to give it a width of 300 pixels
height not really all that important at
this moment because the text inside of
it is going to define what the height of
this is however let's give it a
background color just so we could see
what it looks like and make some changes
if need be so I'm going to give it a
fairly bright color as you can see here
i'll click apply and then ok now you may
notice that we don't really have 300 at
this particular moment in time so if
you're not at 300 make sure you position
this at 300 still seem a little bit off
and that's because the body still has
some inherent default margin and padding
in here so to eliminate that and to
really emphasize the point of our
example I'm going to ask you to click on
the new CSS rule right here and let's
just go to the tag and the tag that I
want you to work with is in fact the
body tag so you could write it in or you
could choose it from the drop-down menu
still in the external stylesheet
clicking ok the only thing I need to do
to the body is to set the padding 20 and
the margin 20 will click OK now
everything should fit very nice and
neatly inside of this particular 300
pixel ruler alright so that's perfect
and it's fine now the point that I want
to make is this we've got some text
inside of this
containing div if you look at the code
you can see there's the div ID container
in the closing div and there's two
paragraphs inside of it well those two
paragraphs are touching the edges and
generally speaking you don't really want
to see your paragraphs looking like this
so the simplest of things for us to do
would be to say hey no problem I'll just
come to this container and what I want
to do is to just move it off the edge
now you remember from our previous
chapter that to move it off the edge we
would have to just create a little bit
of padding inside of this container so
i'll double-click the container and I'll
open up the CSS definition for the
container and I'll go to the category
called box and look at the padding and
same for all sure why not let's say well
actually i'm going to say just on the
left and the right let's say i want to
put in 20 padding on the left and right
hand side 20 pixels of padding and I'll
click OK all right well it's done its
job it's it's moved the text away from
the edge and it's done so over here as
well but look at the problem no longer
now is the size of this container 300
pixels in fact if I were to go over to
my ruler and drag out another ruler
let's see what it tells us notice it
says now we have a box that is 340 but
let's look at the definition for this
container here if I click on it in my
CSS styles and I have all showing you'll
see that the properties for the
container still says a width of 300 it's
not a width of 340 but we can definitely
see that the width has been changed to
340 is that and that's a particular
quirk of the box model when you add
padding or margin for that matter to any
specific element that inherently changes
the width of that element now this may
not seem like a big problem at the
moment but later on when we get into lay
out a little bit more in depth what
you're going to be noticing is that
sometimes we're going to have to be
pixel perfect if I want three boxes
across the top and they all need to be
the exact same size because the
containing element is only so big let's
say I had a containing element of 900
and I have three boxes of 300 pixels
each well it's perfect because they
would all fit but as soon as I add
padding to those boxes they start to get
bigger and then those three boxes that i
had perfectly next to each other now
will not fit and i'll start moving
either underneath each other or bust out
of its containing box and that is a
problem so this is generally a very
common issue with a lot of beginners
when they're dealing with CSS layout so
it's important for us to understand that
this may in fact happen if we add margin
or padding to a containing element as
opposed to the element inside so let's
get around this and we can do so by
going to where it says container and
i'll double click it and i'll come back
in here and i'll go to the box model and
i'm just going to remove the right and
the left padding that we had I click OK
beautiful now it's back to 300 but I
still want to have my text moved away
from the edge so what do I do very easy
all you gotta do is target not the
container itself but rather target the
containers paragraph if you go to
compound based on your selection and
your cursor is inside one of these
paragraphs it should automatically say
hash mark container space p if it
doesn't just go to compound and write
that in yourself I'll click OK and now
what we're going to be doing is
dictating what the paragraph looks like
so I could go to the box model I could
work with paragraph padding however if I
want to move it away from the edge a
very common thing for us to think about
is outside of the edge would be margin
so I could go to that paragraph and I
could say hey you know what let's put
margin on the right-hand side of 20
pixels same as we did before and 20
pixels on the left only difference is
we're targeting the L
inside the container the paragraph and
not the container itself if we click
okay well you know it's gotten a little
bit higher the height has changed
because we've squeezed this down a
little bit but be aware that the size of
the container is still 300 although the
paragraph inside the container has been
pushed away from the edges by 20 pixels
yes so come back in the next video we're
going to start discussing a little bit
more important information about
different types of positioning in CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
