sites and killer PHP so in this video
we're going to go over the basics of
object-oriented programming in PHP this
is just a quick run-through it's not
meant as an exhaustive course but if
you've been wondering about
object-oriented programming whether it
be PHP JavaScript c-sharp Python whatnot
this is a good little intro video that
was going to help you to understand what
object-oriented programming is all about
and why you'd want to do it so let's
just jump into it so object-oriented
coding object-oriented programming is a
style coding where you write all your
code in the form of objects now a code
object kind of looks like in code it
kind of looks like a function where you
have the name of your object just like
you have the name of the function then
you have a little curly braces opening
and closing and everything in between
those curly braces is part of that same
object so you might have an object
called bananas and everything so bananas
then curly brace curly brace and
everything in between that those curly
braces is part of the banana object now
I assume for this video that you've done
basic PHP programming so you know the
basic sort of function as a variable
arrays that kind of stuff if you don't
go do my beginners PHP course which is
going to help a lot of course so I'm
going to show you well let me show you a
quick example right here you should see
some code on the screen that's why it's
like I'm off on the side here and you
see to create an object in PHP you use
the class keyword so you're asking
yourself why class keyword why not
object keyword I don't know why no I
actually do why it's kind of complex and
nerdy we'll get into it later on maybe
in another video but all you need to
know now is that in PHP and in Java and
other languages to create an object you
use the class keyword the class keyword
so you go class name and then you have
your curly braces and we go you can see
in the example here now this is just a
very basic so inside
of your classes for a sick of this
argument not argument for the sake of
this video consider a class an object an
object is a class a class is an object
for the sake of this video there is a so
differences there is a subtle difference
between the two but pretty much the same
so anyway so I might use object on my
use class I mean the same thing so when
you got your class code here which is
used to create objects in code the class
the class name is kind of like the
function name we'll use a class name to
refer to that chunk of code in between
the curly braces so why create an object
in the first place how is it different
from functions well first of all inside
of a class you can have functions you
can have other classes you can have a
range you could have any type of code in
there it's kind of cool but more
important than that inside of a class
when you use a class keyword to create a
class downards we'll call it declaring a
class PHP all sudden on its own gives
that chunk of code that class code that
you just created it gives it a whole
bunch of extra capabilities it's like
super sizing your code for free and
we'll get into that when you get into a
proper object-oriented Court you're
going to learn about all the extra
capabilities but this chunk of code will
will get because you've declared it a
class you've created a class so why is
object-oriented programming the most
popular way to program today there are
others types of programming languages
functional there's procedural and
there's others but by far and away the
most popular type of coding out there is
object-oriented and it's a style it's a
type of programming it's a way of
writing code and how do you rate your
code you write the code by writing a
whole bunch of classes or a whole bunch
of objects and inside of all these
objects and classes you have all the
capabilities of your app so what hap may
have hundreds maya dozens may have
thousands of objects in there and they
all work together to make your big app
and the reason that you're right
object-oriented code is that it helps
well there's many reasons but the big
reasons I can well top of my head is a
it helps you to better organize your
code
into nice little objects also you get
extra capabilities that come with
automatically by creating objects like I
said before when you use the class
keyword PHP automatically gives those
classes extra capability another reason
you want to write object-oriented code
is because it makes it easier for you to
work with other people to build apps so
you can have five developers working
together and you can assign different
tasks to them by giving them sitting you
know more easily by using an object
style of cat of app creation now of
course some people are out there and may
say well a procedural called old style
PHP is better because it's less code and
blah blah blah this could be true answer
to certain arguments that I suppose but
these days if you are writing advanced
PHP commercial PHP there's a 99% chance
you can be ready object or object
oriented code and though there are other
non object oriented languages that are
slowly becoming a little bit more
popular they don't come even close they
don't come and even close 99% of modern
coding that these days would be c-sharp
Java Swift Python PHP JavaScript it's
all object oriented because there's so
many advantages to it now I'm closing
this video I just want to point out one
thing I'm gonna point it out because
nerds out there may go nuts if I don't
point it out JavaScript though it has
objects and it works in just about every
aspect it works like an object-oriented
language it's in fact a prototypical
based language and there's some subtle
differences between a pure
object-oriented language versus a
prototypical based language that all
said and done it has been a long while
since I've written really complex
JavaScript code so to be totally honest
with you I didn't have a chance to go
look on Google to remind myself of the
subtlety in the differences for instance
as far as I remember you don't use a
class keyword with JavaScript to create
a class you actually use it with a
function but anyway I'm going down a
rabbit hole it shouldn't all you need to
know I just wanted to point out that
just because technically not a pure
object-oriented language although it has
many
hunting capability it is object-oriented
for all intents and purposes but some
nerds some sniping nerd might come after
me if I don't point this out you know
how it is alright that's it for now
