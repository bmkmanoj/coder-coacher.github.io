such an important vlog that I'm bringing
out floor markers now it was pretty
important I bring out three markers but
since I brought out four
you know it's super important all right
so let's alright let's get to it so one
of the things we're trying to bring to
YouTube and to the larger developer
community is an experienced point of
view in terms of how to look at software
development of how to look at web app
development how to look at programming
in general and technology in general a
lot of the people were active out there
are people who don't have a huge amount
of experience it's pretty clear to me
let me give you some science of somebody
who's still learning the trade who's
still learning the business if you will
somebody who is a language zealot if you
have somebody who says this language
sucks and that language is the best and
this library is the one you gotta learn
everything else it sucks that's a sure
sign of somebody who's still learning it
still needs a little bit of noodling
training indeed so what you learn as you
become more advanced as a developer
you're gonna learn that the language of
the framework is not universally good or
bad what whichever one you happen to
choose as I been saying for years now
every single programming language out
there was some very minor exceptions
things have really gone out of date but
generally speaking they're all really
good depending on the circumstances and
depending on the developer that happens
to be writing a code ultimately the
skill of the developer is going to
determine whether or not the program
that you're writing the code that you're
writing is going to be any good so you
can produce amazing products in C++ in
Java in PHP in Python and Ruby in
classic ASP with VB script you could
produce some pretty good apps as well
any one of these now what determines
which language to choose largely depends
on what your focus is what what type of
work you want to do and what you what
the market is and what the job is at
that time right so if you wanted to
build a high performance gaming engine
you're not going to do this in Python
you're going to do this since you put
low in C++ on the other hand if you want
to crunch a bunch of data and produce a
lot of charts though you could do it in
C++ you'd be much better off do it in
Python because Python has all these
libraries and it just makes it super
easy to do and as you well know I know
some of you are going to be cringing
when you hear this if you're developing
web apps for small medium-sized
businesses I'm a huge advocate of PHP
even though I used to do a lot more work
in Java back in the day anyway just try
to keep that in mind I'm suggesting you
that you try to embraces to be language
agnostic actually that's one of the one
of the things are gonna be discussing
today all right so what I'm gonna talk
about today is the top three developer
skills for 2018 yes I know we're
December 2017 but I'm a forward-looking
kind of guy and so we're gonna talk
about what you should consider for 2018
you know number three is gonna surprise
you and might make some old school nerds
very angry too but number three is the
is the weird one that said number two is
kind of weird to anyone just kidding
so number one what was the number one
skill set but I suggest that you should
learn for 2018 yeah you know we're gonna
start with the green pen number one
so what does that mean learn the core
I'm talking about digging deep into
programming in general it's more
important that you have a really good
grasp of the core concepts and
techniques of programming that are
universal across all the languages more
important you learned that then to learn
some new framework or some new library
in fact by learning the core more
thoroughly and deeply spending some time
having a really good understanding of
what's actually going on when you're
writing code it'll be much easier for
you much quicker for you to learn any of
the new libraries that come out what
you're going to discover as you become
more advanced as a developer regardless
of web development mobile development AI
what you can discover is that your
ability as a coder is going to be highly
dependent on your deep understanding of
coding in general best practices the
core concepts etc etc well another thing
going to decide you're going to learn as
you go into more and more languages is
that all these languages whether it be
JavaScript C sharp PHP s with Ruby
Python etc they all share about 95 to
98% of the same concepts and techniques
the differences is in the little
idiosyncrasies within the languages
meaning certain languages are better
suited in some very specialized cases so
for example PHP was designed from the
ground up to build web apps so it's the
easiest language to use to build web
apps I'm not saying it's the best
necessarily it has many advantages over
say Ruby or Python or others out there
but it is the easiest to get up and
running with it's the best in in many
respects not just in terms of the core
language itself although that is
debatable and you're gonna get some Ruby
zealots or some Java salts are going to
get really angry at that statement my
assessment of languages has a lot more
to do with global considerations not
just technical merits of the language
because one of the things I keep
emphasizing is that technically speaking
all these languages are
very very good it just depends what you
want to do so I was getting into web app
development for small medium-sized
business I would go to PHP for a lot of
a lot of it's for business reasons if I
was creating into game engine
development score C++ will get into data
sciences in AI Python and Ruby you get
the Python Ruby Python and mop I thought
and maybe go get the idea I've covered
this in other videos all right let's
jump into number two orange marker there
it is become language agnostic I hinted
at that in number one and essentially
what I was saying to you is that if you
want to really expand your skills as a
developer as a programmer you should
learn to let go of your language
prejudices you should learn to embrace
that all languages have advantages and
disadvantages this is something I
learned in my own experience as a
developer going back to the 90s I used
to be like any young nerdling sapling
noob I used to think that one language
is better than the other and everything
else can go and suck and so at one point
I was the Java programmer that's all I
would do everything had to be gentleman
as I said in another video when I had my
Java hammer everything was a Java nail
to hit and reality a situation what I
learned through experience actually
writing code for clients and building
commercial projects that you had to let
that go so as I got more advanced I
would walk in to see a client as a
freelancer instead of thinking I'm a
Java coder I would say I'm a developer
that's it and I'd walk in I would assess
the project see what the client needed
depending on their business requirements
on the app requirements their budgets
etc etc etc and then I would make the
assessment in terms of which language
which framework which libraries I would
use for that particular job so sometimes
you go in there and you see that they
are your client maybe a small business
who leverages a lot of Microsoft
technology and they want to be able to
do they want to have their web app as an
example interface with
some Microsoft Office back-end stuff in
that situation it makes perfect sense to
want to get into asp.net c-sharp dotnet
framework because the dotnet framework
will provide all kinds of Atilla tees
and tools you know to hook in to
Microsoft's back-end tools to look into
Microsoft comm or whatever so it just
makes sense in that situation to look at
Microsoft technologies on the other hand
I've been in other projects where
they've already developed a significant
amount of tools their website was a PHP
driven and at the time I remember this
one particular project really switched
me over from being a nerd laying sapling
where I was like job is the best and
then I realized that I shouldn't have
that point of view because in the
situation with that particular client
because of situation that they were in
it was much better off just to use PHP
so what I do because I knew the core
program at this point I have several
years experience I was able to learn PHP
and start writing production code in a
few hours no big deal and then I learned
by writing PHP for the first time even
though in many respects at that time it
was inferior to Java at that time things
have changed since then I still learned
a few interesting things about how the
PHP community approach things how the
designers of that language of the PHP
language how they looked at things and I
saw there's some pretty clever things
that Java guys Java guys that do so by
learning different languages by being
open about that you're gonna get a
deeper understanding programming in
general but you're also going to open
yourself up to becoming a better
developer and opening yourself up to
different projects and more projects in
other gigs I did a gig for a huge
pharmaceutical and again I walked in and
because of their requirements I wrote an
app for them and something called an HT
a hypertext application which is
basically an early form of client-side
web app I wasn't sir so I was a
client-side using Microsoft technologies
Microsoft had exposed Internet Explorer
in the day gonna called HTA so you turn
your website into a an
today application hypertext application
HDA and by doing that I was able to
leverage comm objects inside of windows
itself so I developed a web-based
utility or an app that was able to
generate PowerPoint slides
via web interface and so forth now again
at that time I was Java boy but I
realize given what their needs were and
given everything concerned it was much
better off for me to actually do it in
HT a some with some weird wacky thing at
the time it still is I guess alright
number three number three
I saved the red pen I saved ripping the
Sun is going crazy so don't mind that
okay number three communication skills
this is the one that's probably freaking
out a bunch of people communication
skills are such a huge part of being a
good developer and it's just not worked
on enough one of the most lucrative
positions to get into lucrative means
you make a lot of money is to be that
person who understands code and who
understands how to communicate with the
people who are not coders those are the
clients so I just adjusted for the light
stupid Sun is going crazy on me anyway
communication skills huge if you're one
of those individuals who understands
code but can also speak nan and nerd to
the suits your clients the people who
don't know code you will be in a great
position because you're going to be that
interface and to be able to figure out
what the requirements are for the
particular application that you're
building a particular programming
program that you're building and these
people are rare so what you should
consider working on is your ability to
come to communicate in a non nerd words
and in a simplified way both writing and
verbal it's huge it's huge it served me
so well in my development career and as
an added bonus will help you to get
dates Cheers
have a good weekend bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
