tools that are specifically related to
coloring items inside a Photoshop what I
want to point out now is the paint
bucket tool and as you can see here the
keyboard shortcut associated with the
paint bucket tool is G so when you're
using this you'll notice as with any
other tool you have options available at
the top over here we can see that we can
either fill the paint bucket as if we
were pouring a bucket of paint on to
this picture I could fill that with the
foreground color which in this case is a
green you can click that once or twice
and choose a different color you want a
blue duck for example and you'll notice
that you can also choose a pattern I can
fill this information with patterns
there are a number of defaults that come
associated with Photoshop and we'll take
a look at both of those options as well
we can place this in a specific mode for
example or in normal mode right now but
these blend modes will be discussed much
further you should look into the video
chapter on layers and blend modes
nevertheless as you can see here you can
apply different blend modes which will
allow you to effect this in a different
way as well we can also affect capacity
of our how how much opacity of that
particular Paint Bucket if it's halfway
through or more as well you'll be able
to notice that there's an area here
indicating tolerance and what tolerance
indicates is whether or not this
particular film is going to address one
specific color or as many different
colors as possible and i'll explain that
first and foremost as we go along also
there's anti alias and anti alias
determines this sort of chunkiness that
you would notice at the edge of
something R to view this at a hundred
percent you can see here that the edge
of duck looks very very sharp very crisp
right and that's because if you were to
zoom in on this particular object you'll
notice that it's not just a perfect line
at the edge here but there are some very
soft little pixels as we go along that's
the anti a
effect that you would notice and if we
were to take in some of this paint
bucket here tolerance at 32 which is the
default and that's you know gives you a
fairly good range of tolerance but you
can increase or decrease that and I'll
show you in a second contagious means
whether or not the color that you
particularly have selected is going to
be a connected color to exactly the same
color or if we remove that even if the
colors are not connected it will turn
all of that specific color the color
that you're determining here so let's
take a look if I were to go in here
you'll notice that it doesn't really do
much for us and simply because there's a
wider range of yellows that are being
used you will recognize however that you
know as we continue along in this
fashion we can get a better crisper edge
as we move along so let's increase the
tolerance for a second let's see what
doing something at say 77 tolerance does
you'll see that that reaches out even
wider and let's also take a look at this
area here you'll notice that there is an
anti alias effect that is underway and
you'll notice that it's not just pure
blue it's got that fuzzy effect as well
if I go back to normal and let me undo
that for a second
and if we were to use no anti-alias on
that effect let's take a look you'll
notice that the edge is a lot chunkier
looking and that's simply because look
what's left here is the yellow anti a
base there's no anti alias for the blue
see there's no light blues associated
with it that's why it looks chunky so
just be aware of that that's a little
explanation for what an anti alias
effect is actually so if we keep that on
and increase the tolerance even more as
you can see here it's much more
forgiving as to like how much of that
yellow it takes and certainly come in
here and fill in the rest of the
information and as you'll see you paint
bucket dropped in a lot of paint with
the paint bucket to color this
particular picture blue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
