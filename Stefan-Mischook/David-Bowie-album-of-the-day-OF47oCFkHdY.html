day David Bowie let's dance this is a
1980s David Bowie album yeah it's got
lots on I don't like but it has a bunch
of songs side one this is side one side
one great songs on here great songs the
best song and one of the best songs is
let's dance and China girl modern love
all really good tombs the rest of tunes
they don't like but just those three
tunes alone are worth are worth the
album especially if you just get it on
YouTube again this is a Japanese vinyl
pressing this thing here is called the
OB and it's just the the album
information in Japanese and when you buy
these 19 these were printed in nineteen
eighty by boy he's out this was printed
in the 80s when you buy these if you got
the OB this paper sash here it can come
off it can rip it's worth much more when
you buy it with the lb the slide massage
in place it's kind of aesthetic you know
looks good anyway yeah great album David
Bowie 8080 sound you know some people
like it some people don't but let's
dance it's a very good tune well and
highly recommend it upbeat tune good
good music for a party at least from my
perspective but I'm an old geezer so
there you go David Bowie let's dance
Japanese pressings check it out on
youtube but if you like it you may want
to get the vinyl and even normal vinyl
normal LP much cheaper non-japanese
pressing will still sound better than
mp3 if you got the good speakers cha cha
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
