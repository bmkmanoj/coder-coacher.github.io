time we had just inserted some Flash
content we saw how to insert a number of
different things and we were doing so
all through our template and if you
remember we added not only flash but we
added some JavaScript and we even had
some spry JavaScript driven menu systems
well that's great I'm going to ask you
to close the template if you have that
open because what I now want to do is to
work with a page that is based on that
template however I've created for us a
new page actually it's not in here so
great we're going to do it together so
what I want you to do is to create a new
file and we're going to still go from
that stitch in time one that we were
working with good so it's connected with
everything else that we have in here
however what I want to do I'm just going
to go to the design view for a second
and what I want to be doing in this case
is to select everything that's inside
here and we're going to remove a lot of
this editable content in that editable
area and I'm going to replace this title
with the title video example and if you
have not guessed as yet I am now going
to show you how we can insert video into
flash
excuse me into Dreamweaver rather so a
lot of different ways that we can
approach this now one of the most common
ways in for a very long time was to go
to your common inserts and you'll notice
right next to the insert image or the
rollover one and in exactly the same
place where you would insert SWF you
could insert an FLV file now FLV file
stands for flash video and flash video
used to be extremely popular and one of
the best ways to deal with video but as
of late not very many people are using
flash video anymore there's much more
people using mp4 or h.264 among other
things so a lot of different video
formats even for that case if you wanted
to work with a an MOV QuickTime movie
the better way to do it other than
working with the FLV is - well now
certainly don't get
wrong if you have an FLV and you want to
use it by all means go ahead but if you
don't probably the better way is to work
with the plug in insert so here I'm just
going to click on the plug-in insert and
you'll notice that we happen to have a
video folder here and I have this great
Superman cartoon from the believe it's
1940s that is available to us in the
public domain so I'm going to be using
it here for us and you'll have you know
you can use and abuse this as much as
you like so I'll choose this and in
order to do so it says first we have to
save our path and that's a good idea so
let's go about doing that
first and foremost so look I'm even
going to delete what I have there it's
as easily as just selecting it and
deleting it like that and let's just
save this video file page first so we'll
go into the web folder and in that web
folder we're going to save this as video
dot HTML I'll click Save so good now
that we've got that in place what I want
to do here is to position my cursor will
insert the plug-in go get the Superman
video we'll choose and notice it's not
large enough so first thing I want you
to do is to recognize that the movie was
320 by 240 and 320 by 240 is perfect
you're going to get the size that you
want it to be when you press Enter the
only problem is is that if you do also
want to include the little bit of
controller information down at the
bottom the default controller that will
show up what you can do is to just add
16 pixels to the bottom of your movie so
instead of 240 let's put in 56 now if we
preview this in our browser it's going
to ask to save so yes certainly we will
save it check it out now have a Superman
cartoon
inside of your web along with the other
information that we have here look up in
the sky it's Superman so as you can see
it's that easy for you to implement your
video you've got a pause you've got some
volume control in there back and forward
and even in here it's just saying about
the QuickTime plug and it's using the
QuickTime shell here so it's a very easy
way for us to insert something and in
this case we were inserting an mp4 video
and not really that difficult to do but
again I would not suggest you use a
video like this because it's rather
heavy in can be a little bit too
difficult to work with there are other
ways of working with video but and again
the M the FLV is a great way to work if
you have an FLV available or if you want
to convert something to an FLV and it's
got some great controllers in it and
what's nice about it is that you can set
it to stream now the only problem about
working with your plugin as we saw here
is again you may not be able to control
as much but if you knew some parameters
you could say loop and you could give it
a value of true among other things right
autoplay Falls true so all of these
things are things that you can also
manage with the parameters inside here
so it's as easy as that to just insert
your video into your Dreamweaver page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
