upcoming Happy New Year I'm recording
this on December 27th today Princess
Leia
died which is yeah very sad as pulls six
sixty years old heart heart problems
George Michael died a couple days ago
and yeah I would guess probably from
heavy duty partying partying when they
were young weakens the body dart and
comes to get you later on life depending
on how much you did in terms of party
and it's clear that both these people
were heavy duty partiers anyway so in
this vlog I want to talk about why I had
shut down my forums I had forums on the
killer sites website koat.com slash
forums and I had them going for well
over a decade very popular forms either
at its height we'd have a thousand
people visiting the forums every half an
hour and the reason I shut him down is
because it was a lot of work we'd have
anywhere between five to ten moderators
working on it
volunteers most of them and just to keep
everything clean I deal with spammers
mostly spammers and always having to
update the software I was just a pain so
now what I'm seeing since I've been more
active with the YouTube channel since
July if you notice the YouTube the
amount of views I get on the channel has
tripled in lost by six months going from
30,000 views in aggregate well over a
hundred thousand views a month ain't
growing so that's kind of cool so thanks
if you are subscribers it was an
experiment as you know so with this
activity on YouTube I figure we can have
all the foreign conversations there
within the YouTube comments and they
have all the moderator tools
then and people could initiate
conversations within the comment so
that's kind of cool and I think that's
probably way to go what's something I
noticed in the last several years is
that people like their particular social
media site or service so for instance if
you are youtuber you tend to interact
mostly on YouTube you might do a little
Twitter or you might do a little
Facebook you might do let's grab it
depends but generally I find that people
tend to favor one particular platform or
the other so youtubers do - YouTube etc
etc except I have a Twitter feed but
it's like I gotta call only a thousand
followers there I post you know I just
link it up to my YouTube channel and
this auto post but I'm not really a big
Twitter user and no no no offense
towards Twitter it's just the way it is
I'm much more in terms of social
networks it's pretty much YouTube for me
I suppose Facebook you know my
grandmother's on Facebook according me
so it's it's not exactly you know I
don't think it's the audience for tech
people although there are bunch on there
as well I got the Facebook as well but
anyway quite often attached it what I
found is that a set of people going to
sites they rather engage with
individuals like me through their
preferred social media outlet some on
Twitter or so on YouTube Facebook etc
etc etc so having them come to the fore
so people want to try to join the forum
I have the the newest forum because I
had different versions of the forum when
I wanted to upgrade from one forum
software to the other I would just
archive the old forum and then move on
to me what anyhow we went through three
I believe in the lifecycle of killer
sites
the last forum I just have it now on
lockdown where people can't really post
any can't post any questions I can't let
people don't can't join I don't confirm
any memberships today posted all over
the forum I said we're not taking any
more subscribers if you have questions
for me do it on youtubes I mean email
Twitter and I answer there and it's kind
of cool saves me a lot of headaches in
terms of managing this
community so it's kind of cool that way
it was interesting
years back for me and the old model of
the web was to bring people to your site
and have them come to your website and
that's still applicable for many people
but I think that today I'm not so
married to the idea of having them come
to my site as long as are consuming my
content whether it be on YouTube or
Twitter or my site add my vlogs on kill
sites comments do you have that's cool
with me I don't doesn't bother me any
particular wherever whatever choice you
make in terms of where you consume my
content that's all cool to me so yeah
that's my thoughts on that in terms of
forums just in case you're wondering the
Python course is coming along very
slowly I've been distracted by all kinds
of different things related to work but
I did get my final prop for the Python
course this is cool now I couldn't find
a Python specific coffee mug so I had to
go with this rattlesnake bug but
whenever you take what you can and so
this is the the final prop for the
Python course very important for my
course so I had to I was very happy to
get this and that I had to prep this
special delivery because they wouldn't
ship it from the US to Montreal to
Canada so at that ship it's somewhere in
the States and have it shipped up here
that's how much I wanted this mug the
last bit of this vlog I want to talk
about something that was a couple
conversations that were going on in the
some of the comments with regards to
coding languages and syntax and the
individual was taught asking about what
it makes sense to go with nodes since
it's you write your node apps near node
based apps rather with JavaScript and
then you can use JavaScript on the
client meaning in the web browser so
this way he would say you don't have to
worry about syntax of having to use two
different languages say use JavaScript
on the web browser which is your only
choice and maybe if you did PHP on the
server
Python surgery the Java on the server
and perhaps having it all be JavaScript
saves you some headaches in terms of
syntax so my comment on that is that
syntax generally speaking is the least
concerning aspect or at least difficult
aspect of working with languages
generally speaking it's more of the
structure around the languages of the
frameworks in the libraries that's come
with the languages the API but behind
the languages that are much more of the
problems loss if you will so I
personally don't see any major advantage
of using JavaScript on the server ie
what nodejs or expressed yes if you want
a full MVC framework on top of the note
engine versus say JavaScript on a client
in Python Django or Python flask on on
the server or JavaScript on the client
or PHP on the server etc character
because at the end of the day the syntax
the actual code that you write is not
the difficult part it's it's
understanding how the language works and
the API and the libraries and the
frameworks the frameworks that come with
the various languages and how stable
they are and how mature they are and how
consistent they are is what really
separates easy-to-use languages versus
more you know headache prone languages
so JavaScript node is something you want
to use if you really need high high high
performance type of web apps or apps and
that's where that comes in but you can
get pretty good performance with very
good performance of PHP and other
environments and in terms of other
languages like Java or some Java web and
so forth again for 99% of apps I would
argue about you don't need super high
performance that you get with no that's
really for some very narrow narrow type
of work I think for again for most of us
out there
p7 special Petri said I'm just much
faster php5
you know and then Python jangle Ruby
rails Java spring you're gonna get
plenty of performance in all of these
languages slash frameworks
you know for just about 99% of apps so
there you go that's my take on that
don't be so concerned about the syntax
be concerned about all the libraries and
frameworks that come with a particular
language choice that you make and I'll
close with this
having been a JavaScript coder since 96
I have to say that I would argue that
I'm not gonna argue a Python code both
doesn't run as fast as JavaScript
especially server as far as I know there
may be some new developments in the
Python world but as far as far as well
Python 3.5 for 2 which is version I'm
building this course on the Python codes
the fact the Python syntax is actually
easier a lot less work to do in that
regard it's a little bit more intuitive
to work with and in fact Java code
though is much more verbose means a lot
more code to write Java code is actually
much easier to work with because it's a
more consistent language in terms of how
turns how the code is written how you
access the libraries and so forth
I know it's I'm not gonna get into
examples here but anybody who's done
Java and JavaScript will tell you that's
the case even though Java is far more
complex than JavaScript Ruggiero speak
