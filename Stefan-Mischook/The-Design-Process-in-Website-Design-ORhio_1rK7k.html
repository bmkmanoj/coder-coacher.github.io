killer sides killer PHP Studio web comm
and other sites as you know I've been
incognito for a while and super busy
with work a lot of this work you're
gonna start seeing coming out on YouTube
channel and elsewhere so what are things
I've been doing is a little bit of
design work now my background prior to
becoming a full-fledged
nerd programmer was in graphic design
and so I had the design training in the
background not that I'm great at it you
know I get by but when you get into
coding at least for me when I got into
coding my interesting design graphic
design diminish as I was more into
system design architecture design
programming the design and building
really nice software rather me you know
as you get as you move through life your
taste change you know when I was a kid I
used to like playing with GI Joe and now
when I'm older I like playing with other
things so in this video I want to get
into the design process for people who
are new to web design maybe you know if
you're graphic design well I guess
you're watching this chance gonna be web
design and web development you have to
understand the process of design is it
iterative meaning it's about trying
something and in trying something else
and try something else trying to and
building off of each iteration all right
so let's first level okay let's make
some changes make some changes and I
think one of the keys to be able to
being able to put out really nice work
or at least your best work is is that
process of iteration but where you don't
get caught up and trying to make every
single version of a layout be perfect
you just want it to be good enough and
maybe go on one direction and try
another direction in terms of the design
and then you let it sit for a day then
you come back
- what fresh eyes and you start playing
with more variations and so on let me
give you an idea so recently I've been
working on a new layout for a new site
on the Swift programming language of
apple just released a week or so ago and
I've I was going to be doing Ruby and
other languages but I decided you know I
want to jump into Swift now because it's
cool it's really interesting and and I
you know we need my and we need we
needed an iOS development course anyway
so I figured what the heck we'll get
into that so if you were waiting for my
Ruby courses my apologies that's been
put on hold until I get the Swift thing
done yeah well anyway like I've been
saying in many of my other videos
whether you learn PHP Swift Ruby Python
Java JavaScript all these languages
they'll play into each other so if you
learn one the rest will come easier yeah
so let me show you some of the
iterations I've been working through for
this latest project and these are just
some of them but I kept here and none of
these are the final design of a one or
two are very close but I just wanted to
give you an idea of how I jump around
different styles and just to show you
what it is that we do so let me just go
into full screen here well we do whether
to show you what it is I do so here's
one layout style and then I make some
changes you can see that the difference
is here and then I said okay what's
continue very quickly and again I'm not
trying to make it perfect I'm just
experimenting with different ideas
quickly to see how I like it sees all
themes excuse me it's all variations on
the same theme you know here I got a
gray background here here I have it here
too
once the dear sweet needs to and there's
Sweeney's - is the that's another one
you see no good gray background very
large logo here with the
now I changed it see I took the bird out
of the button here here it's an inking
okay it's like in an iOS icon here and
now it's outside of it I stripped it out
just to see what it would be like anyway
you get the idea see seat now I go to a
different look I get the same basic two
column top banner and lower banner and
I'm just playing with things you know
here's something you know not too good
again another variation so I'm not gonna
walk you through it now I introduced
texture here you know some other icons
down here these are the official Xcode
icon and the playground icon playground
is a tool built into Xcode with version
6 that allows you to interactively
interact with the Swift language so it's
kind of cool actually anyway so here
we've used a triumph of tech another
texture you know back to the Big Bird I
won't talk about everything but you can
see now we go to a different style here
now I got the big image again none of
these are meant to be final drafts or
just me experimenting with general ideas
right here now it's all centered image
there's a centered image right yeah you
know you get the idea now on these are
not different color schemes and these
are not trust me these are not all the
iterations and you see how many I go
through so you got to be quick you know
you got to be quick with what you're
doing so that you can start really you
know experimenting with different ideas
there there you go the design process
what to take away from this video it's
many iterations meaning many cycles try
you know you saw how I went with one
style tried variations I went with
another style tried variations and
that's the whole process and you don't
want to get caught up with all let's
make this what perfect heroes meaning
the first level is sort of just want to
really just establish your basic look
your basic structure for the page and
then once you've decided what that is
then you can go into then you can go
into
and fine-tuning the layout that you
decide to go with I hope you found this
video useful will be more coming out
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
