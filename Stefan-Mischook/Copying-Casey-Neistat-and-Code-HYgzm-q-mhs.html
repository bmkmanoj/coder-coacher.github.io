app development vlogging and his famous
vlogger Casey nice that now this guy
Casey nice that you may or may not seen
him on youtube he's shot up become
hugely popular and he's hugely popular
for a few reasons number one he's got a
very distinct style his cuts his jump
cuts and really cool cinematography he
this guy is a true Pro out what he does
now his style is very distinct on
YouTube but it's not something that came
out of nowhere and I'm not taking away
from he's really good at what he does
it's the best vlogger i have seen in
terms of entertainment value he vlogs
about seemingly mundane things like you
know going to buy baby clothes but he
makes it interesting partly because of
the style but the main reason why people
i believe stick with this casey casey
nice that guy and i started watching his
Rob's are entertaining it's because of a
substance so there's style and in their
substance style brings you in attraction
but it's the substance that keeps you
there and this Casey guy just has an
interesting life and interesting
interesting perspective and he's just a
good guy see while at least he seems
like a pretty good guy when you look at
his vlogs and so forth so that's what
keeps people around now what I see this
go it's all going to come back to coding
a second just give you a bear with me
for a minute so what I see now on
youtube I see people copying him
verbatim it's it's it's really pretty
obvious like same style same everything
now the difference is they do it
sometimes you see that when they're
copying this guy nice diet when you're
copying him it looks pretty good all the
time not quite as good skazi still you
know they're here and he's up here in
terms of execution but what they all
lack is first of all Casey's the first a
popular to make that style popular on
YouTube second he's he's got a lot of
substance wears a lot of other people
there's no substance to them
unfortunately so that just comes with
experience life experience it comes with
being an individual being a free thinker
which is kind of rare these days now
with regards to his style Casey nice
that style as he has said himself I seen
one of his vlog it didn't come out of
nowhere he he wears his sunglasses all
the time he got that from Jack Nicholas
right it's sort of it's a defining thing
about him he's always seemed with these
glasses in terms of how he films the
angles and how he edits everything it
kind of reminds me of the movie boogie
nights I don't know if you may have seen
this came out about 15 years ago this
guy mark wahlberg I think that was has
come out more this big come out movie
and Burt Reynolds is in it and Casey
uses very similar cinematography stat
very similar editing techniques in his
vlogs and I don't know Casey copy that
that movie or they bore the or the
director of that movie in kc have the
similar influences I don't know but
again at the end of the day the style
tracks the viewer but it's a substance
that keeps you there and that's what
Casey has over everybody else is trying
to copy him on YouTube is that he's got
both and he does both much better that
being said how does this relate to Cody
well coding these days is much more of
an issue of you x UI and content than
that it is technical execution back in
the 90s up into the early 2000s I would
argue a lot of the challenges with
coding apps was technical how can we do
this I don't know how to do this you
know can we do this can we generate
graphs can we can we send an SMS there's
all these challenges that are now
trivial because the technology has
evolved as matured we're at a point now
where the differentiator between
technology a technology be or a baby has
is not the technology it's not the
coding end of it is it's the user
experience
it's the content if you will it's the
environment that the app provides so
when you're looking at app development
don't be one of these Casey nice tat
copiers when you are looking at
developing your own that I'm talking to
people may be interested in coming up
with a concept for a start-up of their
own or you know creating their own apt
for scratch that's trying to solve some
sort of problem I talked about this
before when you're writing apps you're
always trying to solve a problem in the
end so don't copy other people's don't
copy them you can borrow ideas from all
kinds of different app developers
everybody does it Apple does it apple
doesn't invent anything out of nothing
they see what's out there they see
what's interesting what's kind of
working in this and they see if they can
improve improve upon they make it look
good they integrate it within their
ecosystem and they improve upon what's
already out there so nobody invented
anything out of a vacuum but don't just
say I'm going to copy x y&amp;amp;z up i'm just
going to do what they do and try to make
it look a little bit better you're gonna
fail you're going to fail because the
first to market is a huge advantage and
if you're not the first to market
because you know obviously if you're not
even copying somebody you're not the
first forget about it so it's better to
step back before you start trying to
just copy somebody else's app and try to
consider how you can come up with
something that's better in a substantial
way and as an is your own today writing
apps and writing code is much more it's
much more similar to an artistic
expression believe it or not than a
engineering expression because the
engineering problems have largely been
solved encoding these days I hope that's
