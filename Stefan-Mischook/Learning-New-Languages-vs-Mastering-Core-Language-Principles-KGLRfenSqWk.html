reading an article where they were
talking about the current trend in
software development whether it be
languages or frameworks like angular
react well reacts library different
languages PHP Ruby node etc etc well you
know what I'm talking about and it was
interesting because when I see a lot of
young developers or intermediate loads
of intermediate level developers is that
they're chasing attempting to chase the
trends based on what they see on
articles on websites or just global data
usage data from like Stack Overflow or
something like that
or from a get what you ought to be doing
is really two things number one as I
keep emphasizing you have to really have
a great understanding of the core
aspects of programming and programming
languages in general so if you're into
web app development you should really
just understand how to create really
good web apps regardless of a language
regardless of the language if you're
programming in general you should just
really have a good understanding a deep
understanding of writing good code if
spoken to this a few times so instead of
being concerned about the latest and
greatest framework you sort of go back
down to basics and really get a super
good understanding of that thing of
those things in addition to that you
should be looking at what it is is
popular in your part of the world now
or wherever you want to work you have to
look at that because in certain regions
different languages different frameworks
will be popular in other regions they
won't be popular so you're going to have
to sort of focus in on that as well so
don't be so concerned about the latest
trend be more concerned about going to
just discuss number one having a deep
and solid understanding of the core
our technologies with underlines all
these frameworks and all these
technology developments talking about
programming languages and frameworks and
libraries and you should also have a
good understanding of what the local
demand is for you know with the local
demand is in terms of programming that
all said have done one thing that people
don't emphasize nearly enough in the
programming world is the need for good
interpersonal skills communication
skills good writing skills that sort of
stuff organizational skills these are
things that are not necessarily directly
related to writing apps and software
development but they go a long way the
individual who can write code and has a
solid understanding of the core
techniques and principles of programming
languages and so forth combined with
good writing skills good interpersonal
skills good organizational skills this
is somebody who's going to succeed very
nicely because that type of individual
is kind of rare in fact now we'll get
you into managerial positions rather
being just a pure coder and even if
you're just a pure coder being able to
communicate well so that you can convey
your ideas and so that you can
understand what your clients are looking
for in there in terms of the work that
you're producing for them is also huge
if you can master that or get better at
that that will go a long way it will
serve you much more long term and short
term it'll serve you much better learn
those skills and to develop
ability versus the latest library or the
latest language with some exceptions of
course so keep that in mind as you can
see as I do with so many of my videos
I'm not just talking pure code here I'm
not just talking pure programming I'm
talking a business world of programming
or the business of programming to help
you understand what the big picture is
and there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
