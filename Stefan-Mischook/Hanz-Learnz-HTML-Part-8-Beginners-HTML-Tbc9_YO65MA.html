we're going to learn what I think is the
most important tag in HTML what's that
it's the link tag link oh when you go
from one page to another page exactly
that's what made the web so interesting
the fact that you can click on a link
and sumit everybody knows little link is
you know it's in case ya come on you
guys you got another link is there's a
link you click on this lenders it takes
it to another page yes I know what the
link is that's a link and so that's what
makes the web very very powerful
initially anyway and that's really truly
the heart of the web is that
interconnected nature of it the fact
that you got links that link from one
page and eggs and so on yeah that's what
makes it fun so we can create links on a
text or we can create links out of
images and you can even create links out
of video if you wanted to but most of
the links that we see our text or images
you mean you click on text and it takes
it to another page exactly alright so
let's build a very first text link and
then we'll take it from there yeah
that's exciting so save time once again
I'm just going to pay some code and so
you don't have to watch me type it up
and here is your basic link tag here's
the opening right here's a closing so
this one has opening and closing yes it
does and this is the text I get turned
into a link and this attribute here is
called the href attribute and short for
hypertext reference so what do I mean by
a hypertext it's short for hyper active
text you mean they get there's a slow
down well no it's more like if you this
text doesn't do anything but this text
is hyperactive it's a link doesn't click
it it actually does something so hyper
me does not just text the text that does
something
exactly and if you think about what HTML
stands for hypertext markup language
that should tell you how important links
are things sound really important for
the web well they're so important fact
that the inventors of all this web stuff
chose to include hypertext in the name
of the language Wow hypertext markup
language closed tml we better learn how
to do this then exactly so this age
referee at review once again it's a
hypertext reference so transport like so
many attributes and ecology BHT value
have opening and closing quotes need the
quotations yeah and here's the value so
now we're telling this link to send us
to this webpage that's the web page that
you want to go to exactly alright so
this information basically HTTP colon
slash slash wws the web browser we're
going to a web site on the web so you
always have to put that information in
if you're going to a web site on the web
if you're going to pages inside your own
site you don't have to put all this
informational if it's on your own site
that's it's not as much info yes we'll
get into that a little bit later all
right but for now what you want to take
away is it this is HTTP issue or for
hypertext transfer protocol that sounds
very complicated it isn't it is what it
is and so what all it means is hypertext
remember hypertext read and transfer you
know need to transfer something from A
to B use from one place and eggs and a
protocol is just it's a fancy word a
nerd word for method I see you know like
you know you have a certain protocol
when you do go to and you go to court
you have to conduct yourself and certain
waiters a certain product that there's
rules there's rule otherwise the judge
puts you in jail so this all has to me
once all this tells the web browsers
that we're using the hypertext Transfer
Protocol it basically gives instructions
to the web browser like all tags how
we're going to be linking or how we're
going to be navigating to this new
website all right now we won't get into
this right now it's real nerd details
but this is interesting here w WH are
for World Wide Web because it's around
the world yes we've all heard of the the
web right well my web well that's what
that is the world this tells the browser
going on to worldwide road web and this
happens to be site we're going to we're
going to kill the sites com that's your
site so there's a bit more to it but
that's enough for now so i'll just run
this what does it look like there it is
I've seen this before with the underline
click through and takes us to your
website that's fantastic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
