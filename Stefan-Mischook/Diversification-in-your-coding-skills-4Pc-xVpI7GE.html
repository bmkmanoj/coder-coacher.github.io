diversification so diversification is a
basic concept a universal principle that
frankly sometimes I don't pay attention
to enough now how does this apply to
coding and technology well if you're
learning to be a developer whatever type
of developer you want to be web app
developer a mobile app developer Oh make
cetera the key to being successful is to
have a range of skills that might be
markable now that doesn't mean you know
to be a jack of all trades and master of
none
you still need to become an expert in
one particular area or another but you
should be open to learning new
technologies so for instance if you
happen to be a web developer I don't
aspire a web designer and you're working
on your HTML your CSS and then a little
JavaScript and maybe PHP because you
want to do freelance you want to do
freelance PHP is still the King language
that's for sure especially it comes to
web apps but after you do this after you
comfortable building web apps with PHP
as an example I would suggest that you
learn you start poking around and
learning another language or maybe your
PHP guy is using the laravel framework
it might make sense to look at another
PHP framework to compare or better yet
look at another language let's say I was
just for instance Python and look at how
Python those things and maybe once you
get used to just basic Python maybe work
on a the Python wanted a Python web or
frameworks like Django is a big one
another one is flask for instance the
whole point is is by expanding your
skill sets once you've mastered your
basics again you should always master
the basics you should expand your skill
sets horizontally as they say
meaning try to learn different things
make learn
script on the server which is node.js as
an example again this is what you do
after you've you've really become quite
comfortable with a particular technology
that you choose to study so in my
example saying learn the web doing web
development for freelance PHP is your
best choice today
Magne so because PHP is the best
language as I said in many many videos
each language each environment if you
will has its pros and it's cons you know
so don't get caught up in the language
wars it's silly yeah so diversification
though is a very useful thing so let me
give you a quick story in terms of well
number one story in terms of coding by
being flexible about way myself when I
was doing freelance work it just opened
up a huge range of possibilities in
terms of the type of jobs I could do I
would be approached in the saying we
need to do this we need to do that and
it got to the point where I would choose
the language based on the type of job
there it was I wasn't trying to always
take my java skills and make it apply in
that particular job I would look around
okay what language
what framework would work best given the
client's needs now before I did that I
was opening myself up to new jobs by
learning new languages but it gets to a
point where you've done many languages
it's easy to jump into one thing or the
other it's not a big deal so by opening
myself up to new technologies new
languages I was able to get different
types of jobs so sometimes I was doing
you know back in the day
DVD work where I would produce the apps
it would run on DVDs and another day I'd
be doing web app work and another day I
reduce custom windows type of
development so I just jumped around
depending on what the man was by having
this flexibility it just gave me a lot
of job opportunities as a developer
because in the end I wasn't a Java
developer I wasn't a PHP developer I
wasn't an HTML Apella / and I just
worked with whatever languages or
frameworks that I needed to work with at
the time this same principle of
diversification you see that so many
other things in life where I really
learned it was in business and later on
in the market the stock market if I had
to pick out the singles biggest mistake
I've ever made in the markets and it
cost me a lot of money not in terms of
money I lost of all I sort of did okay
and I'm stock market great when I was
actively involved in in buying and
selling stocks on my own and so forth
and trading the biggest thing mistake I
made I think was not being nearly as
diversified as I should have been and
the reason that was a mistake because it
sort of blinded me to opportunities
because I would get caught up and die
this is gonna be the best start it'll be
the best come he should invest put a lot
of money into that and when it comes to
investing you never want to do that
because even if you're hunter cent right
you could be wrong and actually in
business that was one of my expressions
going back down 20 years they used to
say if you're a hunter scent right your
new product or service is going to do
well you probably got a 10% chance so
when it comes to the stock market the
biggest mistake I made was not
diversifying my investment so even if I
was a hundred percent sure that this
stock was going to go up this company is
going to do well I should have not put
so much money into that because when you
do it becomes very nerve-racking mature
you've got too much invested in a
particular position the position of
buying a certain mouse stock and and
what happens in that situation makes it
very difficult for you to play out the
thesis so I had I would say okay I think
this company is going to do well Apple
whatever pick a couple SiriusXM Ford
whatever because of this and this reason
but a problem is nothing goes up in a
straight line meaning the stock price
will never go up two straight it will go
up a little go down go up go up go down
etc and if you have too much invested in
a particular stock and you see it starts
going down you get really nervous
ah you freaked out so you can't play out
your thesis because it's you're seeing
your financial situation on paper go up
and down
drastically sometimes but if you have
those well a little position in a
particular stock if it goes up down a
little bit whatever it doesn't be you
know if if 5% of your money your
vegetable money rather is in a stock and
the stock goes down 10% you've only lost
point five percent of your money right
but if you have 25 percent of your money
in a particular stock and the stock goes
down five percent you've lost you know
whatever it is two and a half percent I
don't they're not math as you do the
math you see what I mean it's a lot more
pressure on you so by having those small
positions spread out different stocks
that you cautiously pick you're much
better off you won't be so nervous if
something goes up or down and when it
comes to programming if you're so
heavily invested in just one language or
one framework and that starts that
framework and that language starts
losing market share
you could freak you out cuz you're like
oh man where am I gonna get work where
I'm gonna get work well if you had a
different position you were more
diversified in your skill sets and you
said to yourself you know what I'm gonna
be an expert developer not an expert
Java developer not an expert JavaScript
developer you know what I mean not an
expert Python developers I mean an
expert developer but to become an expert
developer you have to pick a particular
language you have to master that and
then you can start spreading out across
horizontally your hidden pure PHP for
instance you learn some JavaScript maybe
some node or maybe you go some Python
where you can do Python Django and flask
or maybe you do Python machines machine
coding because it's getting hotter and
hotter etc etc etc etc so there you go
diversification and code and investments
and in life it's a good universal
principle Chacho</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
