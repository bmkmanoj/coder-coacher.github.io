PHP and today what I'm going to be doing
is building on our last tutorial where
we essentially created this very simple
top navigation and header and we're
going to be flushing out some content
and building a fully-fledged website
using html5 so if I just jump into my
coat right now you'll see that I've got
this index.html file and we've got a
body and then a header and then a
section for our header and then we've
got a nav tag and inside that we have
our nav and then we have a section for
content which have we haven't really
explored and then we have a footer tag
so now let's actually you know sort of
put these to work first thing I'm going
to do is again I'm just going to take my
project here in the K PHP folder I'm
going to create a fourth copy for this
particular video I'm going to open these
two files in here ok and I'm going to
point my web browser 204 now i'm also
going to rely on some lorem ipsum text
and you can get this stuff at lipscomb
com basically this is just a text that
looks like Latin that is a dummy text
which is really helpful if you want to
just you know mock out your website and
you just want some some dummy text to
get a sense of what the design is going
to look like so there's my lorem ipsum
text i'm going to copy and paste that in
just a minute now if we go back to my
editor here i'm using bbedit I've got
this left section and in it I want to
have a couple of paragraphs and one of
them is going to be a pull quote get
into that in a second and then I'm going
to have a actually let me think about
this for a second
because we can actually do this more
intelligently we can use some more of
the mark-up that's available to us in
html5 for postings and so on and so
forth so let me just take a look at
something here alright so let's say we
have a section here I want to create
first i'm going to create an article
does that would be the semantic thing to
do and inside that article i'm going to
have an h1 and that's going to be my
post title and then i'm going to have a
div call it meta it could be also a
section we could just use section
instead of div and we'll have a
paragraph here that'll say by author and
then i'll have another span tag here
and it'll just say jun 16 sure why not
2010 and that's about it so we've got or
let's say on jun 16 2010 we could use
the time tag in HTML 5 and i'm going to
talk about that in a bit but for now
we'll just use a span tag which is
something that we're familiar with and
that we've used before probably in
regular HTML and i'm just going to go
back here refresh this so I've got this
post title and then I'm going to have
three paragraphs here go back to my
lorem ipsum i'm going to copy this this
paragraph here it was actually quite a
bit of text here and then i want part of
that to be a pull quote when you're
building a template of course you don't
want to design it specifically to one
kind of content you want it to be
relatively flexible and by using lorem
ipsum text you're adding to that
flexibility because you're not concerned
with what's being written but just sort
of how it's going to how it's going to
flow on the page so now we have a post
title and we've got our texts so far so
good not very interesting but let's see
if we can style it a little bit so first
thing I want to do is I'm going to
specify a width here so my article is
going to be sitting inside some sort of
box and that box is going to have to
align up with this design over here so
I'm going to start by based basically
saying okay we've got this content area
here this section called content I'm
still trying to figure out how I want to
mark this up semantically so it makes
the most sense okay so we've got
a section here let's say actually I
don't even think we need a section here
and here I'm going to put the aside tag
outside and we'll just call this left
content you won't notice any difference
but basically I want to make sure that
this section is one part of the site and
then the aside is going to be a a
sidebar and then we're going to have a
footer that's what that's kind of the
design I'm going for here so now that we
have left content i'm going to say we're
going to go down to the bottom of our
document and say section left content
and we're going to set a width of 599
pixels and let's see
we're also going to have to display lock
there we go so now our section is
confining this container and you might
as on me check to see what was what
essentially I did display element
information using the web developer
toolbar which lets me see how the
document is in fact structured so now
that I have something that's 599 pixels
I also want it to appear right
underneath I my the rest of the content
on my page right so I'm going to have to
have another section which is just going
to keep everything together in one just
package so that it's all aligned in the
center so that for example I've got this
left content section I've got this right
content section and then I've got this
footer but they all need to be in the
right space on the page so for example
if I take my footer and I give it a
background of red oh and I display block
and let's say give it a height of 100
pixels there we go like right now it's
appearing underneath but I also have
this aside tag and the aside tag is
going to have to float left let's say
it'll have a width of 200 pixels and
it'll have a background of blue and
let's say put something in the aside tag
just to see and now you'll see that the
sidebar is actually in the completely
wrong place so we need to fix that now
in order for the content of our site and
the sidebar to appear next to each other
we need to make sure that the left
content section is floating left and
that our footer is clearing the float
and when you clear a float it means that
you want it to appear underneath so this
is more layout stuff but if you're
coming from an HTML background an HTML
or XHTML background you've probably done
a little bit with floats but essentially
if I set this to float left and the
other thing to float left then they're
going to appear next to each other
except that now the background image or
the footer is just going to jump right
up here which we don't want so the
footer needs to have a clearer left
associated with it and what that means
is that we want the footer to appear
after well that's good we got our
sidebar we've got our post we've got our
footer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
