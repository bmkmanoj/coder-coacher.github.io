again ok that one's getting old so I got
an email today somebody sent me a whole
whack of PHP files and said I have a
problem please check over my files and
help me fix it besides the fact that I
can't be debugging everybody's work the
student was missing a major point about
learning web development and that is you
have to learn to understand the error
messages that you're getting back when
you are writing code whether you're
writing PHP code JavaScript code python
cold whatever code you have to learn to
pay attention read and understand the
error messages because the error
messages will tell you where your
problem is a lot of the times at first
with a little bits a little bit cryptic
hard to understand but that's why God
invented google and it is unbelievable
how much easier it is today to debug
errors with Google down so I bought a
brand new google phone this is the
google pixel XL and it is the best phone
i've ever bought i think that these
smartphones are getting so close to the
point where for many users a home
computer a laptop even will not be
needed because these folder just getting
so powerful and capable now the big
story about google pixel is that the
google pixel has a very powerful AI
artificial intelligence put into it it's
pretty amazing it's better in serie in
many respects Apple Siri and it's
because it's better because it has
context it provides context now this is
a very expensive phone out of the box
but because of some deal making
what's going on here I got a call hold
on ah my my google glasses bit got
interrupted by a phone call so yeah I
bought this phone because I was
switching from one carrier to the next
because I put it under a business
account because the person in the store
liked me I got it reduce reduce reduce
reduce with the credits off my bill
ended up costing me zero dollars in fact
it cost me minus fifty dollars i got
fifty dollars of credit and i didn't
have to pay anything for the phone i
have to pay a few hundred dollars up
front but then i get all these credits
that come off after a few months and the
phone is zero dollars zero dollars of
amazing foam highly recommended and
these glasses these are the daydream vr
glasses that i'm going to get to see it
there we go put them on you get this big
VR virtual reality view and you have to
slap your phone in here you got to pull
off this you pull out this little paddle
you stick the phone in here blah blah
blah you put the glasses on where you go
I'm not a big fan the resolution it's a
little pixelated kind of looks like
watching in a 480 p or a TV from the
from the 80s and if you are susceptible
to motion sickness forget about that
kind of stuff so yeah I'm not I look at
this VR thing again this was given to me
free I was lucky I walked in and they
said hey today Google December twelfth
has given away these things or freedom
comes a remote control I don't have it
here and I don't know it's interesting
it's fun if you get it for free it's fun
to sort of have the idea is you put it
on you can surf the web watch videos and
if it prob with me it's not super clear
you have to play with the angle of this
thing and yeah and the resolution is not
very good
apparently the expensive vr headsets are
much much better but you're looking at
huge price and lots of money to drive
those so I'm not sure from a big
believer if it gets a niche product kind
of like 3d televisions Mary habit a very
eclectic and unusual vlog today I have
to head out I gotta go meet an old
friend of mine and a very good developer
and for another coffee and that's about
it I guess I'll vlog between now and
Christmas but happy Holidays to
everybody just in case you miss any
subsequent videos and our merry
christmas if that's applicable to you
and that's about it it's getting really
cold up here in Montreal Canada minus 13
degrees Celsius and very windy and cold
not liking it problem with the cold is
it really wears you down physically
especially if you're a geezer like me
and I think I gotta go visit my family
in California that sounds like a plan
all right we'll talk soon ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
