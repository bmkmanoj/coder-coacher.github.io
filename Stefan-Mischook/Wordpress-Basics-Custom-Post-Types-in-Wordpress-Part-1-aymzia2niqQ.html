sights calm today I'll be talking about
custom post types a new WordPress three
feature perhaps when working with
WordPress in the past you have felt that
the two main content types
posts and pages were a bit restrictive
maybe you needed to hack WordPress a
little bit to get it to do what you
needed it to custom post types aims to
solve this issue allowing the WordPress
developer to create custom content types
uniquely suited to their content perhaps
you've wanted to build an online product
showcase a portfolio or an event
calendar custom post types gives
WordPress the flexibility and power
needed to make this happen
over the course of the next few video
tutorials I'm gonna be demonstrating how
to build an online product showcase
using WordPress basically an online
store without the e-commerce
functionality it should look something
like this when we're done you'll see
we're working with the standard
WordPress 2010 theme the default theme
that WordPress ships with and on the
left hand side we have normal blog post
on the right hand side we have a product
navigation and if you click on any of
these items you'll get a list customized
view of the products with the thumbnail
the name the price and if you product
link also notice if you click within any
of these categories the items are
filtered automatically so some items
have more than others or some categories
excuse me have more items than others
and if you click on any of the items
it'll bring you to a product page
specific to this particular product so
that'll give you a basic overview of
what we're doing in order to follow
along you're gonna need a couple things
you'll need to have a server set up on
your computer in my case I'm running
MAMP but you'll need either a up or WAMP
whatever you're comfortable with I'm
assuming that you have at least some
knowledge of PHP and probably have some
experience with WordPress as well I'll
do my best to explain things as much as
I can
but some of this stuff is a little bit
complicated so if you do have questions
however you can always check out the
WordPress documentation at codex
wordpress.org they have pretty good
documentation on most of the
functionality that I'm gonna be talking
about today and you can also check out
the killing sites community at kill
sites comm slash community you can feel
free to post a message or send me a
private message if you want if you have
questions or need help so to get started
I have cleared my database I'm working
with a brand new database and I have
read downloaded the files from WordPress
comm so I'm working with a brand new
clean install of WordPress and it should
look something like this for you I'm
gonna open up coda and you'll notice
here that I have the 2010 folder open
which is available within WordPress
content and themes so the first step as
we get started is to actually create our
custom post type and just to be clear
when I talk about custom post types they
aren't actually related to posts in any
way they're basically custom content
types that store content you know they
hold your information so just keep that
in mind whenever I talk about it so I'm
going to go ahead and open up functions
that PHP and I'm gonna scroll all the
way down to the bottom and just add a
couple blank lines like so and just to
keep things organized I'll start with a
comment
so in this section I'll be creating the
custom post so the first thing I need to
do is I need to add a hook into
WordPress which I use which I do using
the add action function and I want a
function to be called when WordPress is
initialized so on in it and I'm going to
call the great products function and
then just below that I'm going to
actually create the function itself like
so and custom post types are created
using the register post type function
like so
and we need to include a couple of
values first of all we need to include
the name of our custom post type in our
case I'm going to call it products or
just product specifically and then it
takes a variety of arguments here so I'm
going to create an array and and we need
to set certain labels and I'm going to
set that to the labels variable and I'll
come back to that in a second we want
this product to be public we set that to
true we want to show the user interface
in the admin section of the site so we
set show you why the true we need a set
capability type and in this case
basically what this does is it specifies
existing post type that this is going to
be based on either posts webpages and in
this case I'm just going to refer to it
as a post and I'm also going to set
hierarchical we're going to set that to
false we don't need that in this case
I'm gonna usually write I'm gonna pass
in an array and this allows us to set
the slug they misspelled this basically
to specify what in the URL or they
specify what the URL looks like when we
access these products so I'm going to
set the slug to products and finally we
want to use that support and this too is
an array and we're simply going to
include any values that we want or any
specific capabilities that we want this
custom post type to support in this case
we're going to support title editor
and thumbnail and you can check the
WordPress codex for exact list of all
the different items that custom post
types can support there quite a few
others revisions author etc ok so that's
the basics there and then just above
here I'm gonna set the labels variable
and I basically save this as a snippet
from so weird press codex so I'm just
gonna paste that in here under WordPress
here we go and I'll be including all the
code so you can simply copy and paste it
if you need it
all the labels attribute does is it sets
certain language within the WordPress
admin so it refers to the custom post
type correctly so as you'll notice it
refers to either product or products
throughout so let me go ahead and save
this let me just double check for any
issues looks like that's wrong I think
we're good so let's go ahead I'm going
to go back to the wordpress dashboard
and i'll refresh the page and you'll
notice that we have a new post type here
called products if you click on it I
don't have anything set up yet let's go
ahead and click add new so it looks like
we have a title you have the main
content block and we have a featured
image so if you go back to our code
those are the exact things we told this
custom post type to support title editor
and thumbnail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
