our image in place to me it's kind of
boring sitting here just on top of stuff
yeah so I was thinking maybe we could
jump ahead and learn a little CSS and
move this image to this side of page
here with CSS CSS is the sister language
to HTML and it's short for cascading
style sheets just skating style sheets
just think style sheets it basically
allows you to style your web pages to
move things around that's one thing you
can do and a lot more so let's take a
little sneak peek ahead and we're going
to look at some CSS great so what are
cold here and we're going to just apply
a little bit CSS to our image to move
around and you do that by using the
style attribute style attribute is an
attribute that exists can be applied
rather to any tag in HTML applied to the
image you can apply to date the headers
the paragraphs etc anything anything all
this tells a web browser is that in
between these quotes we're going to put
some CSS style information ok so one
we're going to put in something called
the float float like a root beer float
and it floats elements and an element
could be an image can be a header it
could be a nh2 it floats it to the left
or to the right of a page wow so this is
called property me go float and then
colon yeah and then we tell where we
wanted to float too I notice you left
the space after the colon doesn't matter
ok I just left it for sake of clarity
write any more like that as long as you
have your colon here and at the end you
have your semicolon and that acts like a
period those are just the rules
exactly so we'll learn more about the
CSS stuff later on there for now you
know basic so let's take a look at what
I eat is put it on the right exactly now
you you watch the image folks keeps
flowing it stays with where you put it
on the rice even though we see here it's
it's pushing up against this but as we
expand the window it keeps floating
towards the right you tell it to stay on
the right and it stays there so that's
pretty cool but let's say we wanted this
to not float so close to this edge over
here right give me the right edge is
right edge you need a little space here
who margin yeah so we can do that with
CSS again I like CSS so let's do it so
we're going to go right after her period
which will our semi colon which is a
period in CSS bread and we're just going
to say margin margin dash right so
basically margin on the right side
budget on the right and we're going to
say 150 PX 150 pixels exactly so we want
to leave a margin on the right of 150
pixels so let's take a look and see what
it looks like leaves the space now if
you make the Box smaller what happens
and the space is there keeps this 150
pixels here that's a lot of control that
it gives you it gives you XO accurate
control Wow so it's pretty cool so this
is one trip we can use we can also
margin is 150 pics so what this does
this applies its margin to every side of
the image so we go back to our image
here everywhere so under fifty hundred
fifty hundred fifty hundred fifty you
mean all around only the image exactly
so let's do that so was launched this
red run hie oh it said any images is
flowing out there it's completely
isolated like a planet in the moon so
just moves inside
and that's it so that's a very powerful
tool that we have in CSS and it's used
often times to move images and text
around it's also used to build actual
pages left right columns and everything
so for instance we go to one of my sites
yeah right here skip to some you and you
look here this column here is actually a
division that's another tag in HTML
we're going to learn it's floated to the
right using CSS so creates this such as
column layout it's separate from the
rest of me exactly so we have a little
bit of file organization and in fact
this entire layout that you've seen on
this web page is actually made possible
largely because of HTML just excuse me
because of a CSS you need HTML to of
course very practical and it's not so
complicated right no is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
