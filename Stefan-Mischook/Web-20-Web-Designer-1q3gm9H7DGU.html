killer sighs com in this video or
podcast depending on how I out put it in
the end I'm going to discuss the modern
web 2.0 web designer I want to go over
the skill sets that 2010 you as a web
designer have to know and you as maybe a
small business owner or manager in terms
you have to know what skills you should
be looking for in your web design
candidates
the skills of a modern web designer is
largely dictated by what the technology
is at the time and I went into great
detail about this in my podcast in my
video on the evolution of web design so
I'm going to go into any detail here
essentially what we have to do is look
at the modern web today and what we see
is a web 2.0 which is filled with Ajax
which is dynamic parts of your page is
loading with you know this type of stuff
here or if I actually know what let me
just go into my university and you see
here dynamic menus things pop it up you
know some good stuff let's see here
let's see we got here videos popping up
you get the idea the web of today is
about blogging is about always type of
interactive social networking all those
kind of stuff so a modern web designer
has to understand how this technology
can be implemented in web design work
what they do days of being just a visual
designer is I think I think are gone I
think that if you want to really compete
you want to really be able to provide a
full service in terms of your web design
work you have to really think about
adopting these skills so what I did in
the ER sites magazine I wrote a article
where I described my list actually all
the various skills that a modern web
designer should have now a lot of these
are pretty common basic you know basic
elements domain hosting and then HTML
you know CSS principles but what is this
depart from the traditional web designer
well traditional web designer since a
2002 we have things like I say when I've
been saying for a few years now that a
modern web designer needs
no basic PHP needs no JavaScript and
some JavaScript libraries I me called
jQuery you should understand a
modern-day web workflow you should
understand blogging and how to implement
blogs that you install WordPress for
instance of how to modify your WordPress
and make it you know part of the site
you know whether it be a wordpress or it
could be another CMS engine like Drupal
or Joomla these are all common these
days and it's expected in many websites
but they're going to want this type of
extra functionality that a CMS a blog
engine might have or they may want
widgets like I've showed you on this
page where you know click through
widgets or like i did in the university
these type of dynamic drop downs and
stuff these are things that modern web
designers should know and when I'm
hiring people to work for me they all
have to know this if they don't you know
they become juniors the superior guys
the guys who get more gigs the guys will
get paid more they understand this so if
you're a student of web design go to a
professional web designers roadmap
you're going to see a detailed list of
what you need to know and if you're a
current web designer and you don't know
PHP or if you don't know JavaScript I'm
not saying you have to become a
JavaScript programmer I'm not saying you
have to become a PHP programmer but you
need to know your basics you need to
know how to work with the code so you
can make mods and changes because in all
these blogs is you know we're press and
Drupal and Joomla girl written PHP many
forms during PHP web design forms you
know if we go our forums you know this
is all it's all done in PHP so knowing
PHP will give you an ability to be able
to go in there edit these things make
changes giving your clients needs
so there you have it that's the web two
point oh web designer they're much more
sophisticated than the traditional web
designer but they also have a lot more
opportunities there in much more demand
and as such you will be able to make a
much better living if you become this
modern web designer when I call the web
two point O web designer I'm Steph miss
Chuck with killer sites calm and I hope
