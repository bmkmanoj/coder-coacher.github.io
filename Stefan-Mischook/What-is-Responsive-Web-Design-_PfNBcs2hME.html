other sites in this quick little video I
want to introduce you to the idea of
responsive web design and responsive
websites for a lot of you visit maybe
beginning basic stuff and you don't
really need to learn this so you can
stop the video now move on for those of
you are not sure what that is basically
a responsive website is a site that
responds and changes and reconfigures
itself based on the particular browser
or device that happened that the person
happens to be using so if their visits
your site an iPad or an iPhone or or a
big screen or small screen on your
laptop doesn't matter the responsive
site will adjust itself accordingly so
we take a look at this and this site
here studi web was built to be
responsive so now we're we have a pretty
wide screen out and now watch what
happens as I shrink it and increase it
you see everything's adjusting the
images or resize knows how the image
gets smaller and i'll text gets refloat
and get smaller and smaller and smaller
and smaller smaller so it's pretty good
it will even do that on video set bishop
I'll just turn on the vine watch out a
video even shrink now based on the size
of the the screen so this is pretty cool
stuff and this is modern-day web design
now there's different ways of doing this
the basic way the bare-bones way so you
something called CSS media queries and
i'll be covering that in other videos
another way to do it is to use a
framework framework we prefer something
called Twitter bootstrap this is what
this was made with yes the same Twitter
of the social network there they put out
a framework that makes it really easy
for you to create these type of
responsive websites the Twitter for
instance creates this menu all for you
automatically
which is kind of reminiscent of the
chrome menu here that's pretty much it
as just a quick introduction so when you
hear responsive websites you know what
it is sites will change depending on the
device that you're having to be using to
view the website this is very useful
used to be a real pain in the butt to do
back in a day now what frameworks like
Twitter bootstrap and the CSS media
queries it's a no problemos I just
decided to tack on this little bit too
my little responsive thing i know i've
talked about responsive design before
but sometimes it's good to change to
revisit rather a particular topic and
change the title of the video sort of to
get to the point sometimes they bury
things in the lead if you will so I yeah
I'm sure if talked about responsive
sites before I buried it um yeah so
another thing I've been do have been
trying to improve the production quality
if you will of the videos increase the
the workflow basically increase the
workflow improved my workflow my video
creation workflow because we're actually
starting to work at a whole bunch of
your stuff so we wanted to have a nice
streamlined process now in the process
of exploring technologies and looking at
sound and stuff of course you got to be
careful when you put a nerd together
with let's go out here when you put a
nerd together with new technology you
can find some stupid things will happen
it's very tempting to to do stupid
things so as you explore technologies
because there are all kinds of gadgets
these days but you can utilize to
enhance your videos or enhance your work
a lot of the times it just gets in the
way it's just kind of stupid so we got
to be careful in any work that you do
but you don't put unnecessary elements
even if it's cool at that particular
moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
