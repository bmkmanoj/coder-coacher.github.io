answer email all before I get into the
email they just point out somebody asked
me said your autofocus is really good
stuff
hey guys another email to answer
somebody said to me Steph your autofocus
is really amazing because they were
impressed that my camera could did could
do this yeah I'm using the ask for
camera I'm using I'm using the Canon a
DD and I'm using the lens of the 24
millimeter 2.8 is usm lens the canons
are they have this dual pixel autofocus
which is the bomb
it's the killer autofocus in the
industry nobody is as good except for
sony sony is close but in terms of
autofocus Canon is Caine their King with
autofocus Canon is and their King with
color in terms of how the render color
they call it color science and yet so
Canon is king they're the only public
Adams that they won't do 4k video with
their mid-range cameras is like the
Canon DVD you can get it now without
lands like things like 1,200 bucks or
1,500 bucks us two thousand Canadian so
it isn't cheap but the quality of the
video and the quality of the camera with
this dual pixel autofocus which rocks is
key so that's why I use it anyway people
ask that I'm answering so have another
question here practicing cone and
portfolio advice again I'll keep the
questioners name anonymous so he writes
to me I'm just going to cut to the chase
there there's a lot of coding project
available over the Internet
complete with source codes is it okay to
copy and tweak them to include in a
portfolio
where is the line drawn between copying
salon and Solon's Cove for a project and
actually writing the project code from
scratch the line is is just blatantly
copying it not making any significant
changes just tweaking a few things but
here's a reality about coding as I have
been teaching for many years now coding
the top three rules and coding is reuse
reuse reuse just like the top three
rules in real estate are location
location location so if you're writing
code the smart programmer first thing
that they do is look to see if somebody
else has already done it
writing from scratch is the last thing
you want to do typically you want to use
frameworks you want to use templates you
want to use what's already out there why
because the freely available or paid
stuff that you can utilize for your app
development for your projects are
usually far more refined than anything
you're going to put out because many
people have contributed to it I'm
thinking about open source projects so
I'm a big believer that in terms of
portfolio you know take it out but use
you know code base let's say somebody
you get my shopping cart PHP shopping
cart tutorial that we put out learn it
learn from it and then create your own
variation of it add some new
functionality maybe improve things where
you see where there could be some
improvement and then you can do that
that's perfectly legitimate just don't
just you know purchase a course and then
put it out there first I wouldn't care I
wouldn't care but you know there's an
integrity issue you shouldn't do that
when it comes to code and functionality
it's going to be next to impossible for
people to identify that you copied
somebody else's code base so that you
have to be some Fuki situation for them
to see that but in the end you kind of
be robbing yourself if you just did that
but but again we emphasize writing from
scratch is something you should only do
an absolutely
necessary don't worry there are plenty
of opportunities for you to learn how to
build apps from scratch so you don't
have to go looking for them that's the
thing that comes up and it came up with
me remember back in the day or like wow
you know shouldn't I do this from
scratch and even though back in the 90s
when I was cutting my teeth in
development there was much less to
leverage in terms of frameworks and
api's and so forth so you had to write
from scratch much more often than you do
today we still were writing from scratch
because we weren't writing our own
database apps from scratch we're using
MySQL or post graduate abase we want to
use at the time we're using somebody
else's web server Apache here Microsoft
is etc etc so don't fool yourself when
you are a developer you're using other
people's work just make sure that a but
you don't blatantly steal it a lot of
times a lot of open source projects it's
you're perfectly fine to use it it's you
know they put it out there it's under a
good new license meaning you can use it
how you like just look at the licensing
so again as I said before one of my
course projects I don't mind you use it
to put up your portfolio but you know
make some changes that are reasonably
significant so that somebody you know
doesn't catch it you know it's not a
good thing you know maybe that is
exactly what happened it would stepped
in on his killer sites of course you
don't want that to happen right kind of
takes away from your credibility but at
the end of the day it a big part of what
a good developer does is that they
utilize all the resources that are out
there
meaning code bases templates etc and you
put these all together and to create a
nice coherent app nice coherent
presentation so I won't worry too much
about this how can I use them reading
his email how can I use coding projects
from your course in a portfolio I think
I just meant I just mentioned that would
I be able to customize them or just send
the finished product as part of
portfolio a lot of portfolio should
probably not probably will be mounted on
your site so let's say you're going to
demonstrate you're doing a shopping cart
so you check out on my little shopping
cart app which I put together you'd have
to mention you base it on my courses and
the show it does you know and
she'll let you them work it makes a
little bit of changes so your constable
crews remember when you're dealing with
clients you're gonna have me make
changes according to the client's needs
so you should be comfortable at least
doing that but again you'll have to
worry about every single potential thing
that can happen one rule about being a
developers you're always going to be
running into things you never thought of
so that's why I keep stressing in all my
basic courses all my courses I stress
the fundamentals more than anything else
because my two decades plus as a
developer and entrepreneur has taught me
that you never you're never going to
know everything needed for a particular
project but if you know your foundation
your foundation concepts and techniques
well you'll just learn as you go as you
need you know it's not a big deal so
yeah so what's next maybe going to how
to play propose together attic so that
the process
what's okay might be a good YouTube
video yeah there might be a good YouTube
video I might do that but I think I just
answered right here hearted shell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
