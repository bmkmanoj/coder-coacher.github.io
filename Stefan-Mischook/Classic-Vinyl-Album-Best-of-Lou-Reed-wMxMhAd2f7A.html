forgetting to always do my vinyl classic
vinyl album of the day it's becoming the
classic vinyl album of the month so I
figured I'll just do a dedicated video I
do several of these I'm just using my
webcam here on my surface pro 4 pretty
good webcam right anyway so here's the
vinyl album of the day this is Lou Reed
Lou Reed best of Lou Reed and I think
it's big a song on here would be walk on
the wild side and one of these and it's
a great great song now Lou Reed was a
founding member of a very important
group called The Velvet Underground from
the 60s they believe and they influenced
a lot of bands Lewrie did and the velvet
underground although that band itself
wasn't super popular in terms of their
music amount of albums they sold Lou
Reed was so yeah I would strongly
suggest this album here's the vinyl or a
cool this is it this is not a fancy
Japanese pressing so I'm so as a result
this only cost me a couple bucks but it
was really well recorded now here's the
thing about vinyl now vinyl the pay on
where is manufactured and how often is
played and so on will affect the quality
of the sound although vinyl always sound
richer and better than CD or mp3 just
about all the time if you got the right
speakers and the key to it really in
terms of the quality of the pressing I
think has to do with the run rate
meaning when they would create a vinyl
on LP it create a lets you like a cookie
cutter template for the vinyl and this
cookie cutter template is made of metal
it was made a meadow most of the times
and they were just like stamped the
vinyl as is going through boom boom boom
boom but as they're pressing more and
more vitals the template gets dollar
dollar dollar dollar and the sound
quality lessons and in Japan where
they're famous for high quality albums
and LPS they were I think the big thing
that they did was to use they would
throw out the plates after 10,000
pressings it was pressed 10,000 trial to
play use a new plate whereas in North
America they would print up to 75,000 so
you were very likely to get one of those
pressings you know when when the plate
was really worn down after fifty
thousand presses right whereas Japan
you'd always get a pretty clean press
because he throw out the plate after the
cookie cutter after 10,000 and but
sometimes this is a Canadian pressing it
must have been an early run meaning
within that first 10,000 because it
sounds really amazing sounds really
clear as good as any Japanese pressings
if you don't know Japanese vinyl
pressings from the 80s and 70s are
highly prized by audiophiles because of
the sound quality so anyway Lou Reed
this is the best of you could probably
find I'm sure you could find the stuff
on on YouTube big a song I think of his
career as walk on the wild side other
huge song sweet Jane white light/white
Heat heroin heavily influenced many
bands including David Bowie and that in
fact David Bowie work with Lewrie but
David Bowie was very much a fan of Lou
Reed's and even Kurt Cobain Kurt Cobain
they covered one of their songs one of
Lou Reed songs Cobain did in some some
tracks that were released after Cobain
passed away so anyway Lou Reed big
big-time important artists that affected
a lot of musicians although his
development underground the banner II
originally came from din
too many islands with he had some huge
hits the biggest one being walk on the
wild side which is an amazing tune all
right that's my album of the day bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
