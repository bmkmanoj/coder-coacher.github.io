killer sights calm and killer PHP calm
in this video blog I want to tell you a
story about one of the most ridiculous
stories rather that you'll probably ever
hear about programming or web design and
it's something that happened to me many
years ago and there's there's a couple I
think really important lessons in this
story so bear with me for about two two
minutes here Paul minute and you
understand why so let's go back I guess
about 1998 1999 way back and maybe even
before that anyhow so I was approached
by a company who had built basically in
a very early social networking type of
system wasn't really social networking
but anyway it was a piece of web
software and they had hired a company to
build it before me and after a year it
still didn't work properly so these in
frustration they decided to find another
web developer see if they could fix it
and get it working so they called me and
I came in took a look at the software
and musti's and so I went and I looked
at the software and I found that it was
written in a language called Perl now
just in case you don't know Perl is when
are the older languages out there and it
was actually a language used a lot of
times on cert UNIX server systems and it
was adapted to become a web programming
language and Perl is one of the original
languages used to create dynamic
websites it's kind of old so if you're
if you're if you're interested also in
Perl don't be because all the advantages
of Perl can be found in in PHP Ruby and
Java
and there's a lot of disadvantages to
Perl but I don't want to get into
language war so pearls an old language
so don't worry about it
anyhow so it was written in Perl and one
of the problems with Perl is that it's
very very terse and what do I mean by
terse meaning very compact very
difficult to read so you know one of the
jokes in the Perl community even was
that if you're you know the Perl
propagate the D difficut the exact call
but basically pro programmers you write
something in Perl and six months later
you're not even three months later
looking back at your own code it would
be a disaster to try to figure out what
was going on and it was just the nature
of the language at the time since then
things have matured in the Perl
community I know they have a whole
object-oriented parole as far as I
understand and so on but anyway I don't
that's not the point of this story so I
looked at the code base it was done in
Perl it was a bloody mess so I said
forget it they said I told the client
said listen we should just redo this
from scratch and we'll be able to do
I'll be able to do it in 30 days there
and they were pretty surprised by this
because the Perl version they had been
working on for a year and still didn't
work and I was able to save 30 days and
because I was going to build it using a
much more modern language or environment
at the time so we call ASP today we
called ASP classic active server pages
which was Microsoft's first dynamic web
page technology again Aspen's not a
language it's an infrastructure at the
tie you would code ASP tip typically
with VB script or JavaScript although
the vast majority of people who use VB
script anyhow despite all the
shortcomings that ask has and especially
compared to today you wouldn't want to
use ask today it's very old-school
it was lightyears ahead of Perl in many
respects so I was so I got I got the gig
I got the contract indeed I was able to
rebuild their thing for
scratch using ASP and I got it done in
30 days in a work fine and it's not a
testament to me being a great coder I'm
okay I know my stuff but I'm not some
genius code or anything it's just you
know here's the first rule to take away
it's just that certain languages are far
more productive in certain circumstances
and in this case Perl because it wasn't
does design from the get-go to be a web
dynamic web language it was sort of
tacked on afterwards you'd saw that that
you saw those that you know
discontinuity if you will within the
language that's why it wasn't so
efficient at writing cold compared to a
pure web programming dedicated
environment like ASP so anyway so I
produced the language I print this user
produced a product with ASP everything
was fine now here is where the story
gets really ridiculous
so a few months later I get a call from
the client and he says they asked me if
I would see their lawyer because they
were being sued now by the previous
contractor the previous company rather
who had built the software using Perl
and they were being sued for breach of
contract and and they were basically
accusing Mike me and Mike's by Cline's
and by extension me of basically reusing
their code and stealing and putting in a
new project and it was totally
ridiculous of course because I wrote the
thing in a totally different language
and I couldn't make heads or tails what
they were doing in Perl anyway it was it
was a bit of a mess anyway so they
called me in cedar lawyer and you know
this is a there's a lot of small
companies this company had you know you
know it was a huge company but they had
many other companies under it so they
had their own lawyers and everything so
I went in to see the lawyers did now
they want to take my statements and so
on so what they wanted me to testify in
court to say this software is
not the same software it's totally
different you know I wrote the software
and so they're taking down my
information they say ok words where'd
you go to school
I mentioned my university you know and
it's okay what did read you get like why
I said why did I never graduated you
holy you never graduate well what were
you studying at is it a computer genome
sigh computer science I go no no no no
psychology anyway whoa got a problem
here I know what it means it's what we
can't put you on the stand as an expert
witness because you're not technically
an expert like oh I wrote the software
you go dad but you have to have a
technical degree to be an expert that's
just the way the system works it doesn't
matter that you built it you're not an
expert because you don't have to degree
so that's the ridiculous aspect of the
story though I have been programming for
years self-taught all these languages do
all kinds of things in the court of law
in Canada it's where I am and that's
where I am as in Canada because I didn't
have the technical degree I couldn't be
acknowledged as an expert so in that
respect Steve Jobs who doesn't have a
technical degree
Bill Gates who doesn't have a university
degree they would not be considered
experts they couldn't they couldn't
testify because you don't know what
you're talking about you don't have a
degree and the big irony to all this is
that in fact many times people come out
of school Kampai computer science or
engineering Computer Engineering and
computer engineering degrees there we go
they actually are not very good
programmers they probably just know a
little bit they're not very good at what
they do
well Comp Sci has their did more program
but there's still not very good because
it takes experience school is just the
beginning of knowledge school is just
the beginning of knowledge that's what a
lot of academics don't
stand where you really learn where you
really cut your teeth as they say is in
the field it's doing it's like fighting
I used to box and I was a martial artist
I still am over you know 30 years now
I've been doing it still a little kid
and I could tell you one street fight is
worth a six six months or so of training
a couple of ring fights you know is
worth you know months and months of
training you learn so much actually
doing something rather than sitting
there and being an academic and you know
it goes back to something else I
remember back in the mid 90s just in my
early programming days like 95 or 96 and
I knew JavaScript it was the first
language I actually learned was
JavaScript and it was like it was a very
new language at the time and I remember
theoretically I was like a master
because I had read a lot about it and
then I done a lot of research on it and
I read books that I thought was
fascinating know I'm a geek but I had I
hadn't written much code and so though
people would ask me so how do you do
this in JavaScript I could tell you what
function and you know even with the
method signatures were and so on but
when actually I remember when I first
sat down to actually write some
JavaScript code for the first time it
was terribly difficult for me okay I
still remember that was a real hard time
and I realized wow you don't really know
anything until you do it any sex just
say it's just like more shorts just like
business you have to do it so if you're
learning web design you're learning web
programming the best way to learn it is
to do it you have to do you have to
write code that's why in our courses and
all emphasized especially in my
particular the courses I create myself
where I'm the voice if I'm voicing them
I'm always talking to me shits pause the
video at times and you should write code
write code and then when you get it to
work break it break the code and see how
you know how things react when the code
is broken
you learn a lot by breaking code when
it's working after it's working and this
way that's how you learn
that's how you learn so going back to
the ridiculousness it relates to jobs
and web programming web design if you're
working for large multinationals if
you're going to go multinational
corporations big corporation or if
you're going to go work for government
unless you have lots and lots of
experience you're probably going to need
some sort of degree or certificate
because that's what they look for but
that's a very small percentage of the
jobs out there you know that's what
people that understand the vast majority
of the jobs are working for small to
medium sized businesses those are the
vast majority of companies out there so
these guys they couldn't give a rat's
butt whether or not you have a degree
they're going to fill up they want to
know what your experience is they want
to see what have you done show us a
portfolio equate in the case of web
designer show me some software you've
written and it's much more practical and
pragmatic in a small to medium size
business world versus large corporations
or government work you know it attracts
a certain type of person whereas a lot
of red tape and bureaucracy that are
content with rather than the meritocracy
and if you don't know what a meritocracy
as a meritocracy is a system where
people advance based on their merits
based on their accomplishments not based
on who they know or based on pieces of
paper that they get so anyway I hope you
found this video interesting and
instructive and there'll be more to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
