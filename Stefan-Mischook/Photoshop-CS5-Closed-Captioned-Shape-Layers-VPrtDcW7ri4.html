drawing inside photoshop I'm going to
ask you to delete any workspaces that
you have any work paths that you have
and here's a blank canvas once again and
at this point I'm going to go back to
that pen tool and instead of looking at
creating actual paths I want to explore
this thing here which says shape layer
well we're still drawing and we're still
using the same skills that we acquired
in that last tutorial about working with
the pen tool and remember there's a
number of shortcuts like pressing alt to
move handles and things like that so
let's say I create a very basic shape
similar as to what I was doing in the
last exercise however unlike the last
exercise I'm not just making a path I'm
actually creating a shape layer and I'll
just come in here and make that a little
bit more rounded now choose your black
arrow tool and look what you've got
you've got a shape but this shape is
something that you can move around
unlike the path that we had before well
we still have a path that's one thing
that we did create but notice now we
also have a layer and what is this layer
well really it's just a mask it's
imagine this entire layer is red and
what we drew is acting as a mask for
that layer for example if I right-click
this and say disabled temporarily notice
the whole entire area is red but I am
enabling a mask out of that basic shape
that I created so it's pretty
interesting as you can see here you can
work with those basic shapes and when
you do so as I'm doing here this is
something that you can move around like
anything else it's also something that
you could double click on the icon right
here and choose a different color for as
we saw when we were looking at pixel
based things well working with the pen
tool or something like it is so much
infinitely better than working with the
fixed pixels for drawings because we can
fill it in with a different color as I'm
doing here
I can also scale it command T I can make
it smaller which wouldn't really be a
problem
pixels but I can make it larger as I've
done here and look at these really nice
smooth edges and you don't like the
color no problem let's just come in here
and choose a different color very simple
to do simple easy effective and the
shape can be given an effect a layer
style any number of different things to
make it look the way it does so that's
what a shape layer is and you can rename
this you know call it puffy or whatever
and that's something that you can do
very easily with the pen tool because as
you can see you're making a shape layer
out of the drawing that you've made and
you can use it inside of Photoshop
however you like
so let's come back and learn a little
bit more about some of the other things
we can do with the pen tool like working
with some of these subsections and
looking at how we can work with
selections of that particular path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
