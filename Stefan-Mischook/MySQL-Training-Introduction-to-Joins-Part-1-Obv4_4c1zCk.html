PHP and today what we're going to be
doing is looking at how we can perform
some more advanced operations with MySQL
so this is going to be probably a
ten-part video where we're going to be
starting with just looking at what joins
are in a relational database from there
we're going to be looking at how we can
create constraints to make sure that we
have integrity in our data then we're
going to look at what many people who
design databases call one too many and
then many too many and then creating
views we're going to look at timestamps
we're going to look up back we're going
to look at how we can do backups and
restore data and we're also going to
take a little bit of a peek into the
MySQL search engine so to start off
today what I'm going to do is just look
at joins with you and before we even get
there I'm going to have to introduce
some of the tools I'm going to be
working with today as you've probably
noticed i'm using the i'm using a mac
however all this information and all
these different tools have equivalencies
on a pc whether you're using Linux or
you're using Windows I have a very
simple text editor here I it's called
bbedit there's an equivalent free
version called text wrangler which you
can download if you're on a Mac I'm also
using a a map stack which is to say
essentially I have essentially i have
mysql apache and PHP running on top of
mac OS x there are equivalent versions
of this stack of open source free
software usually if you look up examp
xam PP you can probably get yourself set
up on pretty much any platform again
this is free to download and lastly
we're going to be doing a lot of work
with the terminal and we're going to be
working on the command line because
we're dealing with advanced topics we're
going to want to have to you know we're
going to want to interface directly with
mysql and using the terminal is at the
end of the day the fastest in the
simplest way of actually doing that so
on one
I'm going to be creating SQL scripts
that we're going to work with back and
forth so that we don't lose our place
and on the other hand we're going to
actually be interfacing with MySQL at a
command line level you'll also notice
that I have PHP my admin open just to
show you that you know yes we can
actually double check things using PHP
myadmin so with all of that I say let's
get started so the first thing I want to
do is just show you a bit of some of the
tools we're going to be using with on
the command line the first one is MySQL
and because i'm on a mac and because i
am working specifically with the MAMP
version of mysql i am going to have to
be a little more explicit with my
connection to mysql now I already have
the map server running which you can see
right here so I know it's running but I
want to actually use MySQL s command
line tool to perform all the operations
I need to perform just a note about SQL
in general now a while back Stefan me
shook put together an excellent beginner
introduction to mysql with the focus of
being able to run SQL queries from the
from PHP mainly if you wanted to you
know create records update records and
delete records the goal of this video is
really to kind of broaden that knowledge
and make you kind of more comfortable
with how how to do kind of complex
queries with SQL really use the
relational aspects of relational
database like MySQL where you're
actually using different tables and
you're relating data from one place to
another and lastly if you do get into up
you know object relational mapping
frameworks Oh RMS as they're called
where you're not even dealing with SQL
anymore you've got some other package in
PHP like propel or doctrine that's doing
all that for you that you can actually
debug that code and understand a little
bit of what is being generated for you
on the fly so you won't be totally at a
loss
so in order to access my mysql data is
ql database i'm going to have to
actually use the client and in this case
it's sitting in the map folder under
library under bin for binary and it's
going to be mysql so if i just hit enter
then it's going to show me it's going to
log me in and everything looks okay
however something that I need to kind of
check is if I go show databases I'm
going to notice that there's actually
nothing there whereas if i go back to
get to my PHP myadmin you'll see that i
have a whole bunch of different
databases that i use for development
purposes on my local machine so in order
to make sure that I'm properly accessing
my database I'm going to specify a
username and a password and in this case
it's going to be we're going to use dash
you which is the username flag and then
password is root now this is the default
username and password for mamp and i'm
just going to hit enter so now if I say
show databases semicolon and hit enter
I'm going to get all the databases that
I'm getting here so you can see the same
thing in one place as well as the other
now the first thing I want to do is
actually create a database that we can
work with and then from there we'll be
building up our examples together so I'm
going to create a database k PHP with a
character set of utf-8 and a collation
of utf-8 underscore general underscore
CI now let me just explain that for a
minute essentially the create database
is pretty obvious we're creating a
database it's going to be called k PHP
the character set being utf-8 is just a
default in other words we want to make
sure that all the texts that's being
stored in our database is going to be
encoded using the utf-8 encoding
structure which means that if we have
accents and we have
characters or French characters that
they're going to be rendered properly
the other thing here is the utf-8
underscore general under CI and this is
how the ordering of those characters in
the character map this is a pretty
standard collation so it's pretty much
recommended the CI at the end stands for
case insensitive and the utf-8 is just
because it's a utf-8 collation so I'm
just going to finish that off with a
semicolon and now if I go show databases
you should see that there is now a que
PHP database so I'm just going to quit
and this time I'm going to log in and
I'm going to specify my K PHP database
at the command line by just adding k PHP
at the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
