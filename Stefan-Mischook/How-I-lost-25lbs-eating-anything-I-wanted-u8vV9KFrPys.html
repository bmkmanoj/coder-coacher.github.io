going to talk about how I lost 25 pounds
actually a little bit more than that 35
pounds eating all the foods I like to
eat and hardly exercising at all well
I'll just get to the point the big myth
out there is that you get a train like a
mad man or a mad woman to lose weight
and that's just not true or trust me
I've tried it the key to losing weight
is actually just controlling how much
you take in its calories in calories
burned burnt and exercise or walking or
whatever let me give you a little
perspective here if you try and let like
a mad dog you can maybe burn off
whatever 300 calories an hour depending
give or take some of us can do more some
of us less you know but understand you
got trained pretty hard for like an hour
to burn off 300 calories 400 calories
whatever a Big Mac is gonna be about 550
calories so by cutting out the Big Mac
you don't have to train for that one
hour same thing with a Coke or Pepsi or
whatever can of coke is what 200
calories something like that man you
drink three of those cokes a day you're
drinking 600 calories that means you
have to train for probably a good two
hours like a Mad Dog just to keep that
burn off that excess sugar sugar breads
that is the evil for apples that's
what's going to get your fats all the
foods I love pizzas and submarines
that's what gets you fat what doesn't
get your fat are vegetables and meat
grilled meats not deep fried grilled
meats grilled chicken grilled ribs
grilled fish that kind of stuff all that
being said it's not necessarily the type
of food that you eat of you know
avoiding the breads and the sugar just
helps a lot it's actually just a number
of calories that you take in that's it
number of calories that you take in so
I'm six-two and at my age to lose weight
I have to burn I have to have skews me
I have to eat less than like 1,500
calories a day on average 1,500 calories
yeah it could be 16 if it could be 14
actually but you get the idea this is
assuming very little working out just
walking around half an hour
and that's it to eat less and you
started losing away but you know really
triggers it triggers it from my
experience is periodic fasting 24-hour
fasting where you just drink water have
some coffees maybe you have a little bit
they can handful of raisins and your
palm and that's pretty much it and I
went from fat Steph two hundred twenty
five to thirty I was actually hired
before and then I went down I'm like 199
now I fluctuate between 195 199 and that
was my college weight to be totally
honest with you so that's a pretty good
way for me and again this is not
training like a Mad Dog
I just walking every day you know I do
some handstands you know I do some
push-ups I do some chin-ups but nothing
major no major gym workout in fact I
think that if you workout too hard then
you start raising a metabolism and then
you start eating a lot to maintain you
know the energy output and then what
happens is when you you get a little
lazy stop training appetite still there
you start you keep eating a lot and you
get fat again it's better to train very
moderately and to and and and to be
moderate what you're eating to start
curving or even get like one of these
apps that you are on the cell phone that
MyFitnessPal so when I would use it yes
you know you start entering your food I
don't use it too much anymore cuz I
don't really need to because I know now
like how many calories things are I have
a pretty good idea although that's why I
need a refresher but I remember when I
first started using MyFitnessPal I had
no clue how many calories I was taking
in I felt like that chicken leg with
thigh was like 150 calories turnt I was
like 400 calories something like that so
I was a whole big revelation and so this
is a way to get into habit to be able to
just watch which you eat and I'm telling
you man one of the biggest things for me
was the fasting was to do us it's
painful at first you you at first time
as you do it you're gonna feel nauseous
you're gonna headaches anxiety I have
trouble sleeping and it goes away after
a day or so and just drink water and
coffee and I'm telling you man you start
feeling really
afterwards you started losing losing
weight and fat and drink a lot of water
to flush out toxins oh and you just feel
just relaxed in your skin not like
psychologically because you look good
but I'm talking about the literally feel
relaxed in your skin because you're
taking pressure off the body I think and
yeah there you go and I'm telling you
it's so important like for me in terms
of you know priority people think about
mental happiness health wealth you know
always going to let me tell you health
is much more important than how much
money you have I rather be healthy and
poor than sick and rich ten thousand
times over again ten thousand times over
again I'd rather be healthy and poor
that sick and rich so you know and a big
part of that is losing weight now
somebody put on a youtube comment under
one of my vlogs where I mentioned but
somebody commented about my weight I
think and they said they saw this BBC
show or talking about how fasting has
very beneficial now I learned about food
just moderating your food intake from
the study that has been go ahead been
going on for like thirty or forty years
and I read about a long time ago and
what they found was that when they put
them they got these monkeys one set of
monkeys they fed him from the normal
diet another set of monkeys they fed him
the normal diet plus twenty percent more
food and in another set of monkeys I
think it's like ten percent less food or
twenty percent less food something like
that and what they found is that the
monkeys that ate 20 percent more food in
the ate the exact same diet so no
difference the food the exact same diet
the ones who ate 20 percent more food
had age much quicker they looked like
they they showed the monkeys it was on
60 minutes they look terrible and they
had all kinds diseases heart diseases
and diabetes and all these of arthritis
they had all these diseases not
associated with being overweight or
being slightly heavier but they had tons
of diseases now the control group mean a
group where they just gave them the
normal amount of food they had a normal
occurrence they don't look as bad
the ones are eating 20% more but they
were kind of normal and then they had
that was very surprising then the group
of monkeys that ate 20% less food
something like that they you see they
were showing the monkeys the monkeys
look younger they look much younger and
they had much less heart problems they
had much Lolly's diseases but the
monkeys eating a lot more food had
hardly anything in the monkeys ate less
and they're actually even
psychologically in a better state they
found the monkeys were much more relaxed
more you know cheery happy monkeys so
the amount of food that you eat seems to
be more important than anything else the
amount of food that you eat so you know
I was about to put out the blog I might
call this vlog which we're going to call
it but I might say how I lost 25 35
pounds whether it is eating Big Macs
eating burgers of fries eating chicken
grilled chicken and steaks that's true
but I just need less and I have
intermittent fast
I used to do weekly I started
reintroducing a little bit like tonight
I think I'm gonna do a fast I had a
bagel this morning with an egg and then
I just had a little bit of oatmeal today
and that's it so it's it was like five
o'clock in the afternoon so I think I'm
gonna do a fastness though tomorrow
morning so it's that 24 hours or 18 hour
fast but still good you know the body
you know now at first when you first
dude fast to reiterate the first time we
do is I go if you get sick you feel
nauseous dizziness just power through it
power through it because it passes and
now when I do my fast it's a little
off-putting there's no question but it's
not new as bad as it used to be because
I think the body and the brain are just
kind of used to it now I hope this vlog
was useful this is a a weird lighting
here very dim lighting this is like you
know how will youtubers I got all this
crazy lighting I got the crappiest
lighting as you know Canadian Tire
lighting which is a card we're store of
garbage lighting and but this camera
it's a very expensive camera is so
supposed to compensate anyhow that's it
for now bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
