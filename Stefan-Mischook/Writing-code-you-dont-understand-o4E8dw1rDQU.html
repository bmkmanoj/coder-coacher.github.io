in this quick little V block I'm going
to talk about coding in the dark now I'm
not talking about how dark your room is
I'm talking about writing code and
you're not exactly sure what the code is
doing now this is actually very very
common especially for juniors guys are
just starting out and my advice to you
when you're writing code and you know
copying it from something you saw online
or from a video or whatever and you're
not exactly sure how it's working as
long as it's working you can move
forward and I don't both sweat it too
much because that's just kind of normal
at first and you can write some pretty
good apps where you there are chunks of
code you don't know what's going on and
now to make you feel better just
understand that when you're using
frameworks which you know say you're
doing some PHP and you're using a lair
eval or some other PHP framework it's
doing all kinds of stuff for you you
don't understand any of that code right
so or maybe you're using a database in
the database you're writing SQL and the
database is handling all that SQL and
doing all kinds of stuff behind the
scenes you don't understand what's going
on in that code behind the scenes where
it's all written in C++ so you know
that's kind of extreme examples but the
principle holds that you're not
necessarily going to understand all the
code that you're using even code that
you happen to be writing especially when
you're a beginner and I don't
don't sweat it in time it will come but
that's just you know I just want to put
this short little video to let you know
but this is very normal
no big deal and yeah that's it don't
sweat it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
