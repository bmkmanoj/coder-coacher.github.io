we started to get our PHP file set up
and we're ready now to start working on
the PHP validation so just to briefly go
through this file again we set up a
couple basic variables to start with we
went ahead and set up two arrays one to
hold all the form elements and excuse me
the names of all the form elements and
another one to hold just the names and
the form elements that we have to
validate and I do this primarily so we
can set all these elements to nothing so
we don't run into errors however it is
nice to have it as a reference just to
keep it fresh in our minds so the main
part that we need to start working on is
this section here what happens after the
form is submitted what do we do so the
first step that we need to do is we need
to get the form data and because we have
each of these form elements in an array
like this it makes really easy so I'm
gonna go ahead and copy and paste my for
loop again and this time what we need to
do is we need to go ahead and so form
elements as element and we need to set
form element equals and we want to make
sure we use HTML special characters like
so this will help make sure there aren't
any invalid characters in the input and
then we're gonna do post
and element so what this is going to do
is it's going to loop through each of
our form elements and it's gonna set our
form array that'll hold all the form
data it'll grab that from my form so
that's the first step and then the
second step is we need to actually check
those form elements I'm gonna skip the
check step for now just in case excuse
me I'm gonna I'm gonna step the check
form element section for now I'm gonna
come back to in a minute
and what we want to do we're going to
assume that we've checked through all
the form elements and then let's go
ahead and see if the form is still valid
so it's how we're going to work this is
if you'll notice we have a valid form
variable up here and it starts out being
true and we're going to check through
all the form elements and if there's an
element that's invalid we want to
display the form again and we'll set
this value to false so down here and
we're going to go ahead and check if
it's valid and so if valid form
so if it is valid we want to redirect
because the form submitted successfully
at this point for example if you were
building out a full function in contact
volume this is probably where you would
go ahead and put your mail script or
however you wanted to process it but
just for this simple example I'm not
going to do anything with the data I'm
simply going to redirect the user so I'm
gonna redirect using header and I'll be
location redirect like so now for some
reason the form does not pass validation
we want to go ahead and display the form
back to the user so what we're gonna do
is we'll do an include actually we don't
even need to write it out we can just
copy and paste so I'll copy and paste
might include here okay so that's a good
chunk and the last thing we need to do
is go through and check all of our form
elements so let's go ahead let's assume
for some reason that our form elements
come back well I'll put that on pause
for now let's let's go ahead and start
checking our form elements and I'll set
up the code at least some of the basics
and I'll go ahead and show you how it's
working so far so the first thing about
let's go ahead and check any required
fields so that's pretty simple I'm just
gonna do if form I'll start with the
name variable and make sure that is set
up properly so if one name equals
nothing so the user didn't input
anything I'm gonna go ahead and set an
error message
their name equals and I'm going to say
please fill in all the required fields
hey like so and then like I was talking
about a little bit earlier I'm gonna go
ahead and set that let it form equals
false
okay so then I'm gonna just go ahead and
copy and paste this two more times like
so and so we need to check the name want
to check the phone
and finally the email
can I save it and let's go ahead and
preview it and see how things are
working so far okay so when the form
first loads we get a standard blank form
so I'm gonna go ahead let's say that I
somehow made a mistake and I hit submit
let's see what happens please fill in
all the required fields it doesn't look
quite exactly right might have a bug
here so let me just double check
let me check the source code and see
what's going on oh I know what happened
let's go back to the code itself and I
realized I missed something this error
message needs to include they are open
and error closed variables so I missed
that there we go so I'm gonna just
briefly copy and paste the section save
it and now let's preview and it should
be working fine now there we go looks
like one is missing somehow so let me
check that too maybe you have a table
let me check my phone
believe it was entering in a couple
extra spaces and those spaces were being
picked up so let me go ahead and double
check and make sure that was the case
okay there we go so yeah I had a little
bug in my forum code
I had tabbed this in earlier and I guess
he was adding some extra spaces that
were messing up the value so just doing
that took care of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
