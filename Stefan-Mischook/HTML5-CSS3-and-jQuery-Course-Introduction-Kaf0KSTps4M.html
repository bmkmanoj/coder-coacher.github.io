sites video training tutorial this
particular lesson is going to be dealing
with html5 css3 and jquery it's
primarily a project-based video that
will look at how to take an existing
XHTML document and convert it into html5
document that utilizes the newest css3
techniques as well as working with
jQuery in other words we'll be moving
from this very simple document and
transitioning into a document that looks
a little bit more like this and as you
can see we'll be discussing how to work
with css3 to do some interesting things
like provide some rounded edges to take
fonts and substitute them for fonts that
you may not have on your particular
computer or your client may not have on
theirs but will ensure that they'll be
seeing the font that we want them to the
way we want them to using css3 as well
we have some animation techniques like
working with transforms but we also have
things like transitions that will allow
us to fade in documents and create
different styles of animation that
perhaps you're unaccustomed to inside of
a html5 environment without the use of
flash as well I'll be talking to you
about how to work with some jQuery so
that if some of those techniques are not
available on certain browsers will
always be able to work with jQuery to
create something like this slider or as
you can see here to also work with these
modular style of opening windows inside
of this environment I should mention
that this video is primarily aimed at
beginner level to intermediate level web
developers so for those of you that are
completely new to HTML development you
should find yourself at the killer sides
video store calm and get yourself a
couple of preliminary videos that can
help you before coming to this
particular video that you're watching
right now for those of you that are
members
don't even worry about it you probably
already gone through these videos
already but for those of you who are new
do remember that basic web design is a
very important thing for you to know
before you can come to this video as
well CSS layouts is a video that I've
recorded it also and as you can see here
the video that were or the file that
we're going to be working with and
converting into a html5 file can be
found in this particular video here as
well while we will be talking about
html5 and CSS obviously there's a lot
more in-depth material on these subjects
that you can find in the html5 and css3
video also available at the killer sites
video store in order to work along with
this video all you're going to need is a
simple text editor all the files are
going to already be provided for you and
as you can see there's going to be an
old XHTML section and a version 1 2 and
3 of our progress and finished files for
this particular tutorial however on your
part all you will need is a simple
editor so you can choose from any number
of different editors that are available
online absolutely for free if you're
working in a windows-based environment
you'll probably be wanting to look at
something like NetBeans it's nice and
easy it's a free little text editor and
it works just great for those of you
that are a little bit more familiar with
working on a Mac you may want to look at
text wrangler text wrangler as it says
here's the little brother to BB edit and
it is a great HTML and text editor for
the macintosh as well there's a lot of
other ones that you might want to look
at there's this one here called HTML kit
and it's got some free work that you can
take a look at and work with my
particular favorite being on a Mac would
be working with text wrangler but of
course if you prefer you can always go
to adobe com and you can download the
30-day trial of dreamweaver and even
though we're going to be working inside
a dreamweaver ourselves i'm only going
to be working in the
text view and we're going to be simply
looking at the code for this particular
file so you can follow along with any
HTML editor so let's fire up that editor
and will begin in the next video by
taking a look at XHTML and comparing it
with html5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
