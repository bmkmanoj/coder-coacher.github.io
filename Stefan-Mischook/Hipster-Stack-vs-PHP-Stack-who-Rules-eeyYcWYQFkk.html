the web stack I wish I would have coined
this but this guy here what's his name I
think is it tech arachnid on YouTube
left a great comment with regards to the
web stack and he said I can totally
agree I chose to learn the hipster stack
and now passing by on so many PHP SQL
jobs in the freelancer world WordPress
Joomla Drupal and laravel are all
powered by PHP and plenty of jobs out
there choosing that route in stead yeah
so thanks for the great comment just
reaffirming what I've been saying for a
long as time now so when you are a
developer or an aspiring developer you
have to consider it not just the merits
of the technology now Joe node.js has
some amazing things about it and post
gray has some amazing things about
etc.etc Center you can look at any
particular technology and you're gonna
find really good things about the
technology but what you ought to do is
not just look at it from the point of
view as a nerd terms of the technology
you should look at it from the point of
view of both the technologies merits
relative to the job and also the market
out there for the particular tech that
you might be jumping into so as this guy
pointed out yes he was studied he
studied the hipster stack as he called
it but he found that all the jobs are in
peach feed Joomla Drupal WordPress
larvox @r etc etc what you're gonna find
and I've been doing this for over two
decades now what you're gonna find is
that all the modern programming
languages have their pros or cons all
the modern frameworks libraries etc have
their pros and cons and the fact that a
matter is yes node.js as an example is
very high performance and
fast in very particular applications
relative to PHP and it could blow the
doors off of PHP in certain areas but in
other aspects PHP is much better event
note so it always comes down to the type
of job that you're going to be doing the
type of work that you're going to do I'm
going to be doing when you choose your
technology try to keep that in mind but
more importantly more importantly try to
keep in mind what the market is like out
there it's no point learning the latest
cutting-edge hipster language if there's
no jobs I'm assuming that most of this
most of you are interested in coding and
programming because you want to make
money you want a career out of it and
that's what I try to bring to YouTube
here is the perspective from somebody
who was entrepreneur first software
developer second so I've been
entrepreneur for 28 years
a software developer sorry : 20 23 years
ago something like that and I've always
looked at programming languages and
frameworks and all these tools within IT
as tools tools to help me get the job
done at the end of the day all these
apps and these web apps all the software
all these programs are there to
facilitate some sort of process whether
it be a business process whether it be
just something for the average Joe at
home keep that in mind it's all about
productivity at the end of the day and
whether your app is written in PHP
laravel or nodejs
or Python Django or Java springs etc
Sarah people using your app are not
going to care they're not going to care
as long as it works and you can produce
great apps and any of these technologies
so just be careful when the hipster
nerds who have very low real-world
experience or telling you how great a
particular technology is because some
technical issue cool but look at the job
opportunities as well now if you are an
academic programmer someone who's just
interested in this stuff or you're
interested in doing this stuff
because it's just it's a hobby for you
and I totally get that I was there
a long time ago and they still have an
interest today perhaps you can do you
could figure out where the jobs are so
very likely for me peach bee larva or
PHP or plus or PHP what CMS is that's
how you make your money and then on the
side you can learn Kotlin if you're
interested in that or maybe do some no
if you're just in that etc etc so again
keep in mind the real-world application
of all these programming languages and
frameworks consider what the job
prospector prospects are in terms of
going to work for somebody or becoming a
freelancer I'm going to be really
pushing more into that whole aspect of
the freelancing aspect of coding and
development and the job market as well
but really always trying to relate back
to that because there are plenty of
tutorials on YouTube that once you know
your basics once you know your core to
fundamentals you Google do a walk
through a marathon you're gonna go
easily do a walk through one node you
could do a walk through one on reacting
cetera those are plenty out there so
what I'm trying to do I'm trying to fill
in the gaps I'm trying to bring in that
real world perspective I don't want a
couple of decades of programming
experience can teach you and nearly
three decades now a business experience
could teach you so I try to bring that
together in this channel anyway keep in
mind when you're considering hipster
stack the hipster stack or a hipster
stack versus productive web stack
alright bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
