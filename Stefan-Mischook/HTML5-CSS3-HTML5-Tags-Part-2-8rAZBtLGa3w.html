tag business the first thing that I want
to do is I want to set a width for my
header now unlike divs where you know if
I say 900 and let's say I say 800
actually will stick to 960 pixel width
you can though this video is a different
frame size and then I say margin:0 auto
if you look at this and you're an
experienced XHTML 1 CSS 2 web designer
you know that this means that this is
Center aligned and that there's a width
of 960 pixels tell prove this theory I'm
gonna make my background red now if
everything goes well we should see a red
background but we're not seeing anything
no reason to get scared by default these
new tags like header section article nav
are not display:block and what that
means is that they are in line so unless
you in and what I mean by in line and
block is that you know if I look at the
h1 here and then the h2 these are block
level elements so the browser knows that
one has to appear under the other and it
doesn't make the assumption that you
know tagline here is going to appear
next to acne website Inc so block level
elements have backgrounds and margins
but inline elements don't now if i
refresh this again you'll see that I
have my red background and it's actually
centered we can see that because there's
a bit of a border on this side and
that's about it so now we can start
building out this page as normal so I
have a header section and then I have a
nav section
just gonna create some navigation here
since most websites have navigation and
also you can think that you know a
screenreader when it comes in it looks
at this page it's not gonna have a very
hard time figuring out what's your
navigation what's your header what's
more important than what you know h2 is
obviously more important than h3 there's
a list of navigation inside here so it
becomes a self-describing document which
is really the the goal of xml so i'll
say that this is product a product b and
there's some services contact us there
we go so these guys are hugging the left
side if i want to make mine ab
display:block just have to add it here
with a comma and there we go so now
they're part of this now I want my
navigation to be to appear like a top
bar like you saw in the last video and
to do that I'm just going to add some
additional declarations first of all I'm
going to start by making the background
some kind of gray and we're going to add
some gradients down the line but for
starters let's just get it looking
normal using regular old CSS to
refresh this again so now we have a bar
running across the side there and now I
just say now have ul you'll notice that
we're no longer using the dot syntax or
the pouncing tax because the tag is
actually called nav we don't have to do
that anymore
and I'll just say a list style is fun
that'll get rid of these guys on the
left side and then nav ul Li we're gonna
float them left we know that they're
block level elements because they're
appearing underneath each other now
they're gonna appear along the side and
we'll had a bit of a margin on the sides
so I'll say zero pixel top and bottom
and 24 pixel left and right
now there's a little more space now
we'll go further into the Dom you'll see
that I'm just going further and further
up the chain so there is the nav tag
style that one way then the unordered
list inside the nav tag then the list
items in the nav tag and then the actual
hyperlink and in another video what
we're going to do is some advanced CSS
selectors we're even going to create a
table with very little HTML code and
just using CSS and the advanced
selectors that are offered in these
newer browsers like Chrome and Safari
and the latest version of Firefox now if
you're trying to do this with Internet
Explorer and you have a you know a
strong Internet Explorer audience then
html5 is probably not the best thing for
for you know a site that where you're
targeting age you know Internet Explorer
users however you know you can have a
website that kind of degrades gracefully
with html5 a lot of what you're doing
and a lot of what you're writing is very
similar to the stuff that you're
probably already writing now and so you
can add some of these features slowly
without having to adopt html5 completely
and do it sort of transitionally so I'm
going to set a font size of 15 pixels
maybe make them a dark grey get rid of
those ugly underlines I want my
hyperlinks inside my nav to be
display:block and in doing so it becomes
possible for me to not only set padding
but also set a height as well as borders
which we're gonna see in a minute
so now already it's starting to look
more like navigation I'm gonna say
border width whoops
we'll add a border on the left and right
and a style we're gonna make it solid
and we're gonna make the border color
let's make it I don't know like a dark
grey
I mean maybe make it white so we can see
it okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
