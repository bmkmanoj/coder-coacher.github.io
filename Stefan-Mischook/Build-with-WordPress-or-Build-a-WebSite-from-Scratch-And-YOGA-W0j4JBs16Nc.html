an email that was put to me by a guy
named a computer that's his name is
Peter he was wondering whether or not he
should use a wordpress for his business
site and therefore get a dedicated
hosting plan dedicated to WordPress or
should he build from scratch and build a
website from scratch and and he puts the
question to me what would you do in my
place so to round it up again he has a
small business idea once put together
and he's very busy he's learning all
kinds of stuff he's wondering whether he
should build from scratch or put it in
the WordPress site well if you are
building a content specific site where
it's you and maybe one other author to
other authors 90% of time I would say
just just go for WordPress site because
we're press which is a content
management system used to be a blog but
now full content management system if
you don't know it's a system that allows
you to easily put up websites add new
articles and videos and documents and
the thing about WordPress it has this
whole ecosystem around it so you can
have plugins that make it easy for you
to do ecommerce and etc etc etc so so
many small businesses use WordPress for
that reason it just simplifies the
process of updating and maintaining your
website now you could all use a little
bit more work in the beginning because
you're going to install WordPress on
whether that takes off two minutes and
then you get to learn WordPress which
Matt's not that hard to be awesome to
just run WordPress it's kind of like
we're using a word processor a little
bit more we're pressing get more complex
if you're putting in different
capabilities like plugins and stuff like
that but that's a whole different issue
but even then it's worth it because
dropping in a wordpress site where you
might want to have comments and under
your articles is like goes right into
WordPress is easy you can add plugins
and have all kinds of functionality to
make adding
like e-commerce or or social media feeds
easy now you have to be careful you have
to do your research you don't know which
plugins are good which hard plugins can
be a source of vulnerability to the site
to get it hacked so you can be careful
about that but that being said we're
press is much more solid than it used to
be that's for sure and as long as you
keep it update and with modern WordPress
it updates itself easily I said it
update yourself it'll update itself so
you should be ok and if you had a decent
hosting company they'll do daily
automatic backups of your database and
so that everything is backup just in
case you get hacked and you should
backup your site your whole site I don't
know whatever if you're doing changes
you're not doing major changes once a
month backup the whole thing really just
to be safe
if you're doing regular changes you
might want to set up something called
cron job on your server that will back
up everything if you have sea paddle
which is very common control panel for
web hosting then you'll be able to set
this up automatically so that's kind of
cool a yeah yeah yeah so yes if you're
starting a small business and you try to
decide whether you should use a
wordpress site and build it for build
website from scratch I would say most of
the time use a wordpress site because
once it's in place boy it's going to
make your life so much easier
do you need a hosting that is dedicated
WordPress hosting I don't really think
so I take any standard hosting with
cPanel or any control panel by the VC
pad or Plesk
there are others out there it will make
it really easy to install WordPress even
without a control panel but they excuse
me let me back up if you got a small
business website and you're doing a
hosting you better have a control panel
like cPanel you know they all do it's
not a big deal and yeah so you don't
need dedicated WordPress hosting because
there's nothing special about that
really because any standard hosting with
a control panel ik+ for cPanel will have
one click repressive Sol's and even if
they don't to download and install
WordPress
through your web hosting control panel
it's really not that difficult and
you're up and running so it would be too
concerned about it and just in case
you're wondering WordPress the app
itself is really just a bunch of PHP
pages with HTML pages and CSS and some
JavaScript in there and it's just a PHP
app really at PHP apps are just a bunch
of pages of code and you upload those
pages to your web server your web
hosting account just like you would
upload HTML pages except before pressure
uploading PHP pages so there you go hope
that helps - ciao just a quick addition
to this log so I just did my very first
yoga hot yoga class initially in a few
couple years - three years maybe I'm
ashamed to say and I say I'm ashamed to
say because when I was doing yoga I did
for about a year and a half solid which
for me
welcome to my martial arts just like a
miniscule amount of time but in that
time when I was doing yoga I never felt
so good like in terms of it just
physically it feels is great because it
really strengthens and stretches and
relaxes you and you'll be amazed at how
improved your cardio is going to be when
you do yoga I know that sounds
counterintuitive how could sitting
around doing poses and yoga can improve
your cardio remember cardiovascular
system it's not just your heart it's the
efficiency of the adult and all the
muscles and everything so hot yoga will
improve your cardio let me tell you
unbelievably you'd be surprised to take
your take you know for five months
before you start really seeing the
effects but it's pretty crazy and the
great thing about yoga is it doesn't
damage any of you joints doesn't wear
them down you won't twist Reiko you
won't hurt your knees it's a really
really great exercise so I just did it
today and let me tell you though I
didn't biking around a lot and I do like
my hanging from a tree toke up my spine
so forth I'm not a good shape man let me
tell you when it comes to like doing
yoga really tired me out so I went to
yoga
and I was fasting but then I went buy a
chicken rib place I just bought some
ribs
I couldn't resist my friends buying ribs
I bought some ribs no no potatoes no
coleslaw just ribs so low-calorie
really and so I got only had my ribs and
then between the yoga and the ribs I
just wiped me out wiped out but I feel
pretty pretty relaxed so when's the next
time I should do yoga my body will tell
me my body will tell me people have
these ideas that you should do something
two times a week or three times a week
or four times a week everybody's
different your body may just need five
times a week
it made me two times a week who knows
let your body tell you so when my body
doesn't feel sore when it feels relaxed
and not sore then I'll go back to yoga
because when the body is sore when you
feel sore that's your brain saying to
you hey we're still working on the
repairs to their muscles so there you go
part of what I talk about in this
channel is the importance of being
healthy physically healthy for me that
means drinking lots of water
cutting down as much as I can sugars and
breads and eating lots of greens and
meat and not a mile on meat but lots of
greens I have blood issues I have to eat
red meat every so often otherwise I
become like I totally backed out so
there you go I hope this is useful
