with Steph I'm just kidding so I watched
the Google pixel presentation just in
case you don't know Google pixel is
Google's new smartphone and it's got
some nice Hardware looks kind of nice
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah now
to me as a developer and a general
technologist Google's pixels hardware is
not the story the story is the google
assistant so Google assistant is
Google's AI artificial intelligence
integrated right into the Android
operating system and this thing is
pretty incredible in that it's able to
read the context in that you are in and
able to present to you information and
help you along and essentially assist
you in whatever it is that you're doing
so if you're having a chat message about
going to see movies it can you can read
that it can display theaters it can
respond to all kinds of very complex
commands and based on the presentation i
saw i haven't used a focus it's not out
yet it's pretty impressive and in fact
it makes Siri Apple Siri look like an
old broken-down typewriter in respect to
its a I its ability to assist you with
that capability and that to me is the
store behind Google pixel not so much
the hardware because would it be apple
samsung google pick any brand that you
want the hardware is all neck-and-neck
now some have slightly better cameras
sometimes slightly better screams etc
etc etc but this AI that Google is
putting out with its new google
assistant it's pretty impressive let me
tell you it's pretty impressive so that
is to me the big story behind us now in
their presentation Google talked about
the different evolutions in technology
over the last one over 20 years 30 years
or so so it talked about first the pc in
invention of the pc and 80s personal
computer then the rise of the internet
the web then mobile mobile apps mobile
devices rather and now they think it's
an AI world where AI has really didn't
have a huge impact in terms of computing
and i think they're right about that
because with AI and we're starting to
see the beginnings of that what Siri and
Google assistant which takes it to a
whole new level it really transforms
your ability to work with your computers
for instance i have android on my old
nexus and it doesn't have the assistant
of course does that Google assistant has
whatever be what's called a precursor to
that and it's very useful a simple
little thing I just noticed i parked my
car and i walked away from my car and I
pull up my phone in the coffee shop and
I noticed the phone was telling me where
my car was parked relative to me I
didn't have to tell it to track where my
car was at el it just was able to read
how fast I was going i'm guessing and
then when the car stopped it must have
figured out well that's where his car is
and that made set it seemed like a
useless little feature but to be honest
with you I've actually lost my card
occasion like what I park my car anyhow
besides the fact that I lose track of my
car once in a while it shows you how AI
based systems can really help out in
terms of productivity remember all the
software all this information technology
all these computers are there really
just to make your life easier to speed
up things to want to make your life
easier so that to me is the true story
behind the Google pixel is this whole AI
this google assistant the hardware looks
nice you have to wait for the reviews
who knows what people are going to say
about it looks kind of cool but i'm very
much think it's an AI thing and if for
you young developers out there if you're
looking at the future you may want to
start poking around
in terms of AI implementations see how
that might be something you can get
involved with there might be an
opportunity there for you I'm not sure
if it's something widely available for
all developers I'm sure this type of
technology will come out very soon if
it's not already there there's just
something to look into and I tend to
agree with Google the AI is almost like
the new it is the new interface if you
will into computers all right well talk
soon ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
