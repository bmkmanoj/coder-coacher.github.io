want to ask you guys of course a quick
question would you be interested in I
don't even know if I asked this before
or not would you guys be interested in
discussions that were pure blonde
sharpener torial ism or oriented towards
being an entrepreneur opening up
businesses and so forth so as you know
the coding since the 90s but I've
actually been in business for longer and
so I'd learned a lot over the years and
you know this there's a lot of stuff out
there on small business and business
startups and stuff i suppose but i have
my perspective having been doing this
for i guess for 20 25 years or so and so
i'll just curious if you guys people
watch the chat on regular basis is this
at all would interest you or if you
would prefer that I just stick to the
coding and over the technology and of
things let me know about that beyond
that just very busy with 20 web work the
Python course and other stuff as well
marketing and so on sales so that's stay
up a lot of my time and I'm still have
this bug in my throat from this cold at
school it's two weeks now unbelievable
the worst a bug had gotten in as far as
I can remember there's what I finish off
this log discussing workflow I mentioned
this in other videos but I want to bring
it up here from a different perspective
you see I do that I will take a stab at
a subject i will look at a subject from
a different point of view because it's
interesting how people remember and
learn things different things will
trigger a response or we will give
people that moment of understanding oh
now I understand that they take a moment
depending on how you you you tackle
particular subject
so that's why I do that sometimes if you
see maybe I'm repeating something or
covering the same topic that you heard
me talk about 10 videos ago or something
bar reasons because I forget I don't
keep track of everything I need to do on
YouTube and at least not that closely
and also because I just want to look at
it from a different perspective so one
of the things I talk about is how
important workflow is in your coding and
in your business and everyday life
having a workflow will save you a huge
amount of time make you far more
efficient and allow you to move forward
in whatever what are you whatever your
long-term goals are so optimize workflow
rather is something to really look at
and if you want me to explore some more
details about that let me know about
that would work flow related videos be
interesting to you as well in my career
where there's a web developer whether as
a coder in general whether entrepreneur
I found myself having to develop
workflows that really benefit the aim
goal will it be as a developer as a
business owner or something so that's
kind of a important subject to look into
there's a lot of things in life that
really make a huge difference in terms
of the success and failure of things
that you do and these things like things
like a workflow which are not
necessarily directly directly related to
the subject at hand so you'd figure in
workflow encoding is not really strictly
coding but it's so important to being a
successful coder or developer and then
much as my example if that's just one
example a bit of a meandering vlog here
as I said I'm really caught it before it
now so my vlogs are a little less
frequent but you know how it is with me
I might get information and you see a
whole bunch of you vlogs go out and I
will be releasing some more
python videos from the Python course as
I said in other videos having just a
series of videos which is fine but in
terms of the learning in terms of the
how quickly and how easily you learn
having a series of video study doesn't
even come close to learning experience
that you get within the city web app yes
a shameless plug no no doubt but true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
