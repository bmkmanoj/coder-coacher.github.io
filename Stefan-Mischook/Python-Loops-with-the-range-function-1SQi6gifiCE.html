Python loops and let me launch the IDE
again so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a new document so I'm
going to file new file or ctrl n let's
get this in place why am i doing this
now instead of just using the
interactive shell as we did before is
because the code is going to be a little
bit more complex now and so it's a lot
easier just to create a separate p/y
file so first of all let's just create a
basic for loop for and we're going to go
I use lower case this easier to read for
I in and here something new is called
the range function the range function
allows us to generate a series of
numbers so we'll see what I mean by that
figure so print I so what's going to
happen here so I'm using the four right
we know the four because we get the for
keyword plus the in keyword and I
created a variable I inside of the for
loop and what happens this range
function will generate numbers 0 1 2 3 4
will generate 5 numbers and every time
it generates a number of every loop
remember it's circular 1 loop 2 loops
really etcetera it's going to insert the
value generated by the range function so
this range function is going to create
five numbers stick it in I and we
printed here so let me just hit enter
twice I'll save that we're going to save
it as the desktop I'm going to save it
as a loop and range as in the range
functions so we've got that so now I'm
going to run this code by run logic 5
and 0 1 2 3 4 now as I set the range to
10 it's going to give us 0 to 10 so I
say that run loss using 0 is 9
now remember E and Python like so many
programming languages it starts counting
from 0
that's why when I said 10 it didn't go
to can because it's still 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 that's altogether these are 10
numbers right so cool now the range
function this is a very simple example
of a range function range function can
do different things let me just go here
remember spaces like this make a
difference in Python right so to break
out of this loop here we have this loop
right here if you go like this and we do
another print statement this is still
considered in loop in the loop let me
say that and run it again
see it's in the loop but you see there's
no indentation here print I would say
and of the end of the loop see that we
run that code again you see end of the
loop only appears once because we have
no space here now if I go like this say
that then we run it again watch what
happens and in the loop is no longer the
end of the loop the end of the loop text
right here because we did not break the
indent it's considered part of this for
loop so this is one block of code here
well right from the excuse me this is a
block of code but if I take away this
intent say that and then we run again to
run it you just go to the run menu run
module or just press f5 you see end of
the loop appears here because it's at
the end of the loop right now we could
do something called escape n and that's
I'm going to say that run again f5 she
had space here now that's because of
this now this backslash
right because the slash is backwards
it's linked like a guy leaning backwards
this is a forward so forth this is a
four slash to some what we want we want
this backslash and that's called an
escape so basically when you do a
backslash in n like this that tells
python to create a new line that's why
we had a new line here just like when
you press the Enter key on your keyboard
so I just want you to know that now we
can put a space like that just to be
more clear save that and then we f5
again everything is cool so you see
we've created a loop with the range of
10 so we'll go from 0 to 9 now with the
rain function will be more precise so we
could say we want to count from 1 to 4
with this code here say that and we run
it a module
see one two three four so we told it to
start from one and it's weird why did is
go to four because the way Python works
if you want to go to four you have to go
to five you want to go to five you would
have to put six so to run that again see
one two three four five here's another
way we can change the range function we
could add two numbers in here separated
by a comma to tell the range function
how we want to count our numbers if they
count from two to two the number six
that means we have to type in the number
seven we run that again boom right to
the six so we've seen how the range
function can be used with four loops to
write out numbers print out texts on the
page so let me just comment this out
member a comment like this now Python I
just say that we'll run that I'll pipe
lines go to ignore C ignored print in
Luke right just one two three four five
so if I want to start from one I'm going
to go one through six save that again
run module there we go pretty good so in
the next video we're going to learn how
to use the range function combined with
a for loop
combined with the turtle module to
actually draw shapes quickly with Python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
