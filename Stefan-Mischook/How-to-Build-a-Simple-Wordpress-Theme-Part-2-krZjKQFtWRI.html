slash in a star and they end with a four
star and a forward slash and you can
make them as many lines as you want the
next step is we're gonna type theme name
and then colon and then my template if I
hit save now and i refresh this page
you'll see that my template is now
appearing as the theme name but the
theme is still broken it's broken
because the template itself is still
missing
let's go through and figure out some
more information that we want to include
in this little block here so there's the
theme URI which is the actual URL for
our template so I'm just gonna put my
own domain and if I had the template
somewhere then I would probably put my
template and you could download it there
but unfortunately it's not there and
then a description simple WordPress
theme for killer sites and a version
which is very important if you're gonna
be offering up your template to people
online and an author I'm just gonna save
that there hopefully refresh that again
the template is still missing and what
it's complaining about is that there's
no index.php file now the way that
wordpress is structured is that you can
create different pages for different
styles of content so let's go back just
for a minute to our page here what we're
looking at here is the default homepage
if I click on hello world then I'm taken
to a particular post in the WordPress
theme now when I go back if I click on
about I'm taken to an actual page in my
WordPress configuration and if I do a
search that I'm taken to a search
results page
now if our theme doesn't have all of
these different kinds of templates it'll
eventually just default to the index.php
file now because our wordpress theme
doesn't have an index dot PHP file it
still says that it's broken so let's
make an index dot PHP file I'm gonna go
back to text Wrangler and I'm just going
to create a new file I'm gonna hit save
and I'm gonna just say index dot PHP now
there's nothing there but if I go back
here and i refresh it will actually see
that my template shows up and it's no
longer broken however when I click on
WordPress classic I can see what my
theme is going to look like with the
content and when I go back to the kubrik
theme or the WordPress default theme I
can also see that however when I go back
to my template I don't see anything the
reason for this is that we haven't
actually used any of the code that is
available to us through the wordpress
api the wordpress api is basically a
collection of functions that wordpress
provides template designers so that we
can basically build our own themes
without having to worry about the
nitty-gritty of the wordpress content
management system basically we can
create themes without having to worry
about accessing the database or
manipulating posts so that they're
hierarchical or any of these kinds of
tasks that would be better spent or
better done by the actual WordPress
framework or WordPress installation so
if I go back to my index dot PHP file
and now what I'm gonna do is I'm just
going to start creating a very simple
PHP page
first thing of course is you need to
have a doctype I'm just gonna put that
in and I'm going to put in an HTML tag
and a head tag I'm gonna close the head
tag a body tag I'm gonna close the body
tag and then I'm gonna close the HTML
tag and just in here I'm gonna put hello
world very simple so far now if I hit
save and I go back to my template you'll
see that it says hello world in fact if
I go to anywhere on my page or anywhere
on my website I'm gonna see hello world
there's no way for WordPress to figure
out where it is right now so I'm just
gonna close this and we're gonna add a
little bit of logic so that we can
figure out some things like the proper
title of our page I'm gonna go back to
text Wrangler and the first bit of
WordPress code that I'm gonna introduce
is the blog name so I'm just going to
use the PHP block here and I'm gonna
close the PHP block so whatever you see
inside here is actually PHP code and in
here I'm just gonna say blog info name
and now what this is gonna do is it's
going to output the name that I've
specified in the settings of my blog so
I should get my new template in my new
WordPress theme and that's what we're
getting again very simple so we're
already starting to see a bit of dynamic
content appearing now there is another
thing that I'd like to put in there
which are basically all of the little
chunks of code that are made available
thanks to the RSS and subscription
services that WordPress offers so I'm
just gonna actually paste this in from
another theme and I'll briefly touch on
it right now
so in the head body or in the head
section of my HTML page I'm just going
to paste in three lines the first is a
link tag alternate application RSS plus
XML title is equal to a blog info name
now we've already talked about blog info
name that's the name of the actual blog
and then RSS feed and then blog info RSS
URL now if you guess that blog info RSS
to URL is the RSS feed then you're
correct so basically we're just adding
some helpful information for the browser
so that it knows how to subscribe if
this is in fact a blog to this
particular WordPress installation and
then we're also going to have this WP
underscore head section which is going
to be used by WordPress if there's any
kind of dynamic content that it wants to
inject and it does this in the WP
underscore head section so it's just
good to leave this here now I'm gonna
click on this again and I'm gonna
activate and you'll notice that we
haven't actually changed anything but if
I visit the site and I view my source
we're actually gonna get a little bit
more information than we saw in our
template we're gonna get some meta
information we're going to get some more
XML information we're also going to have
the generator which in this case is
WordPress and so blog info you our blog
info name has been replaced with my new
template RSS feed and then the RSS feed
has also been dynamically created for us
now in the next video we're going to
talk a little bit about the loop and the
loop is a concept that WordPress
template designers tend to refer back to
and it's often seen in a lot of blog
posts dealing with styling of WordPress
themes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
