actually up at 5:00 a.m. this morning
because I'm getting ready we'll have
some work to do I'm getting ready to go
for first time in a long time to a yoga
class now how and why is this relevant
to a tech and business vlog channel well
as I stated in previous videos being in
shape physically is an important part of
being able to be a productive developer
or productive entrepreneur or just being
productive period if you don't have a
healthy body then you're gonna be
putting extra stress on your brain to
manage your analysis body which will
reduce your capacity to think I truly
believe this I've seen that with myself
when I'm even 10 15 pounds overweight my
ability to think is hindered so you lose
weight what happens is the stressors on
your bodies diminishes and you have less
overall stress which makes it a lot
easier for you to do your work so if you
want to be successful in development
software development or you want to be
successful entrepreneur just getting a
job
I'm telling you getting in shape will
pay dividends in ways you you know if
you're not aware of it now to trust it
way beyond your expectations and so I've
also found and I used to train at a very
high level for a couple decades or more
in a couple decades and when I found out
like so many weekend warriors and
professional athletes is that most
people over train their bodies they put
too much and they break their bodies
down over time so the key is to find
that right balance between a good amount
of exercise with proper eating eating
good foods
lots of water with giving your time
giving your body time to rest and relax
them just as important as the time you
spend exercising is the time you spend
resting your body after the exercise
give your body a chance to heal and to
recover so my basic rule has been that
if you feel even a bit sore
two days later don't train the body is
sending signals that it's sore because
it still hasn't finished repairing
itself so if you go back and push the
body you'll be hindering things and let
me tell you I used to ignore that for a
couple for two decades and I've made
lots of games and so forth but when I
sort of decided to listen to not sort of
what I decide to listen to my body and
say okay honest or my training and I
train much less but what happens the
performance the gains increased quite a
bit more and it's funny because I
remember what I used to be doing a lot
of hardcore martial arts back in the day
I remember was a teenager and we'd
always you know not always we
periodically get injured and I remember
people would get injured and we would
take two weeks off and they would come
back and they would they would come back
thinking and I happened to me a few
times that oh I'm going to be rusty of
training to three weeks but in fact the
opposite happened we found a performance
was incredibly much better and we always
you know I guess we worked to break
through those real selves we used to
always go through that's really weird
that's really weird it never occurred to
us but the reason we were coming back to
three weeks later and performing way
beyond our normal level because we just
our bodies were listed so I'll close off
this video if I remember when I was
training with a Canadian wrestling team
I wasn't a member I was okay but I would
train with these guys for about a year
or two and I just one of these guys who
trained there but I wasn't part of the
team
and I remember the coach world famous
college
my nephew's world famous anyway he won a
gold medal I think in the Olympics old
Russian guy and when they were on season
when the team was on season meaning
they're going to competition they would
train much much less they would train
much much less because they wanted to
rest the body and then offseason they
would train really hard so keep that in
mind
so yes I'm up super early to go do your
yoga for a first down a while and some
of you are going yogi so what are you
going to yoga aren't you got guy who did
boxing in Thai boxing and catch Campbell
and yeah I get all those but I find that
yoga and the core training that provides
which is hot yoga it's really good
exercise and it's very relaxing relaxes
the mind you come out of there and you
feeling pretty pretty chill and that's
the months that you want to be relaxed
chill so that when you sit down from the
desk so you can start writing code or
learning to write code or you going to
start going into meetings with our shoot
business then that's part of it so this
is all part of this move I'm going to be
introducing more entrepreneurial of logs
by the way and this is part of it being
healthy eating well sleeping well is a
big part about being productive in your
career regardless of whatever it is
you're doing
so anyway but we're going to be moving
into that over time as people have
requested and because I'm interested in
it in fact I'm involved in a few things
a few startups and what it might be
doing is logging about this process so
that you get a feel for what it's like
so that's three different ventures
without I'm launching with partners so
I'm going to get into why I would do
this
I shouldn't every concentrate on my core
business well I'll just leave this video
and say by having
partners that allows me to concentrate
on my core business and still have my
hands in other businesses because it's
diversification is where those basic
principles that should be a year to
whether you're investing in the stock
market looking at skill sets or setting
up businesses all right
