to do a quick test and check this
website in multiple browsers to make
sure everything's working correctly when
I did that I did notice a couple things
that I wanted to point out how to fix in
my particular case I've decided to go
ahead and support IE seven eight and the
modern browser is Firefox and Chrome and
I noticed a couple minor things on ie7
that I probably should fix first off
what you're seeing here just to give you
a quick overview I'm running vmware
fusion which allows me to run windows
while i run my mac operating system and
if i try to access the login page from
IE 7 I get this pop-up will appear in a
second it indicates that there is a
unresponsive script here we go and it
asked me if I want to stop writing the
script and what I discovered was that
running the most recent version of
jQuery which has just recently been
released in the last maybe a week or so
which is 1.6 there is some sort of
incompatibility between jquery 1.6 and
color box and apparently the developer
of color box is working on a fix but in
case you are having issues specifically
with this it only seems to happen in ie6
and ie7 but if you have are having
issues with this here's how to go about
fixing it so i have a forklift open and
this is the program that i use to ftp
files and back and forth so i'm going to
go ahead and open up its under app core
templates and i'm going to edit the t
underscore login file and rather than
using the latest version of jQuery i'm
going to specific i'm going to specify
jquery one point five point two min Jae
s so I'm going to copy this line
save this file and do the same thing for
T underscore head and perhaps this issue
won't be a problem I mean it's a May
seventh today and it's possible by the
time you watch this and by the time you
download the files there won't be any
compatibility issues but just thought
I'd point it out so that will fix the
alert that we were having let me go back
there and refresh the page there we go
so that's working fine I also did notice
an issue here with the login form seems
to be fine on all other browsers but ie7
has an issue so let me go ahead and
tweak this input so I'm going to go to
app resources CSS
and i'm going to edit the row here i'm
going to remove the float left instead
do overflow hidden because the two
elements within these rows are floated
so i want to make sure that row
inclusive and closes them properly
there we go so that's a bit better and
then one other thing if you click login
you'll notice these error messages have
margin that appears in again don't know
why it doesn't do it on firefox but
firefox doesn't have this issue so to
fix that and go back to Kota I'm edit
that CSS file again and rather than
using a mojin bottom of 20 pixels move
that and I'll set the rest to 0 and
while I'm at it I'll change the font
size to 12 pixels let's try ie7 again
and that's a bit better so I guess the
only last thing that I want to cover is
this little close button that appears
i'm not sure why it only appears in ie6
and ie7 but to fix that is one other CSS
tweak but this time to the color box CSS
within resources javascript color box
and in addition to the display none on
the cbox close ID also add a ! and
important and that'll make sure that
it's hidden properly
and hang on one second it looks like my
browser flows unfortunately let me see
if I can restart it quickly
yeah so you'll notice we're missing that
close button that was there previously
so that's working correctly now so
hopefully those are a couple things
that'll fix ie7 compatibility issues for
you I'm not going to go out of my way to
fix ie6 issues there shouldn't be
anything too significant but at this
point I six is a ten-year-old browser so
if you choose to support it or not
that's up to you but if you have
questions related to ie6 compatibility
you can always email me or contact me in
the forums email has been at killing
sites column or on the forums I go by
the user name is Ben and you can find
those at killer sites calm / community</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
