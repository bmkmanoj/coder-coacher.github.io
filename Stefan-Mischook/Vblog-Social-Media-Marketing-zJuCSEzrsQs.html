PHP calm killer sighs calm in this video
blog I'm going to go over a few points
about social media marketing or using
social networks to promote your business
this avenue of advertisement is becoming
very popular these days and in fact
there are many companies out there that
are offering social marketing services
and I am NOT a thorough expert in it I
have to do my research a bit more but I
do have a bit of experience with my own
websites with killer sites and killer
PHP and so forth and I can least give
you some real world advice from what
I've seen in terms of results so I got a
bunch of points here listed on a notepad
in front of me and yeah I use a notepad
sometimes I prefer writing you know i'm
a nerd i like typing but i prefer
writing sometimes anyway so let me go
over a few points so we've discussed
with social media marketing is using
various social networks to promote a
product or your site or your services
why not so you got the big one to get
facebook twitter people think of those
two right away and then maybe linkedin
and then there's of course there's
youtube whatever one's stumbleupon
google+ is a new one and they're all
social networks i just mentioned but
each one has their own specialization if
you will so for instance facebook is
really about people connecting with
friends and posting photos of playing
games linkedin is more much more about
business contacts youtube you do is sort
of a free-for-all because it's a lot of
people don't think of it as a social
network against these days but it is it
is a social community
we're video is the medium of
communication as opposed to image
posting and so forth but it's very large
and there's a lot you know you set up
your YouTube channel and then you can
upload all kinds of videos that you want
and so it's quite it is it is social
networking it just is it in a sense that
you know you can make friends and
subscribe to friends and so it is very
much that but youtube is a different
beasts or the others because in YouTube
you have to have something to talk about
or something to present typically so
which you know which social network is
best for your business that you know it
really depends on the type of business
that you're running so for instance with
my example I use YouTube a lot because
we produce and sell web training videos
so it's just a natural fit and our
YouTube channel is although it's a
relatively small audience given when our
websites do in traffic what we do get
5050 or thousand or so new views a month
so that's pretty good exposure that
wouldn't be there otherwise and we just
show our stuff so you might find YouTube
as an advertising Avenue fig of it as
putting your stuff on a network TV
station you know if your stuff is good
your presentations are good people talk
about it and it could go viral not that
that's happened to me but there is an
audience a big audience that YouTube
delivers so it's something really worth
pursuing especially if you're in a type
of business where there's something
visual you can show so if you're a
carpenter who builds boots furniture or
no you're you don't do massage or some
athletic thing if you can demonstrate a
skill or result of your skill YouTube's
a great way to go and even if you're
selling you in technical services are
you to be a way to go and I advise
people nowadays to use youtube if they
want to embed video on their site to use
YouTube I was against in the past but
the tools now but YouTube provides where
you can have HD video a detailed
tracking of statistics and so on it's
um-- also use it because when you embed
videos directly in your site whether it
be MP mpeg-4 s or whatnot unless you've
got a media server and so far if you
don't get all the detailed tracking and
all the data that you get with youtube
and on top of that by putting your
videos up on youtube you get the added
benefit of the social network you get
that potential extra exposure so
facebook marketing now a lot of people
out there thing but facebook is a great
vehicle for advertising and so on but
it's it's actually not for the most part
i'm sure some people might have success
and that's just an assumption of mind
but from what i've read and from what i
can understand about the nature of
facebook from my own experience getting
to that a second I don't think I don't
think for most people facebook is really
a good place to want to unless too much
ad dollars that's for sure simply
because the of the behavior of the
people heading over to Facebook they are
there to interact with the friends to
upload photos or to check out photos of
their friends they're not actively
searching to buy stuff or for the most
part or not interested in on in another
message their minds are not open it's
you know think about facebook when you
go to Facebook versus going to say
Google would you go to Google your
active
looking for something and that's why you
search and that's why Facebook that's
why Google traffic rather is worth much
much more of an facebook traffic because
of the nature of the visitor going to
each of these sites you see Facebook is
just a very big and glorified user
community it's it's a forum on an online
forum there we go I've been running
forms for 8-10 years now and I can tell
you you know not that huge for us but I
can tell you that form traffic is very
very very unresponsive to monetization
meaning people going to forums they're
you know they're not going to be
clicking on ads or paying attention to
ads just not the nature of that traffic
it's very unproductive traffic that's
why you see the amount of profit for
facebook makes on our user per user
basis is really crappy so and to and as
further evidence to mice my thinking if
you look recently some big-name
advertisers a turn off with JC Penney
and others they're actually pulling
their Facebook campaigns or at least
severely reducing them because they've
seen no no effect you know but they're
not really it's not really an effective
environment for advertising again it's
because it's Facebook was really a forum
just the four old forum software reef
angled with some social kit social
features built in and I'm not taking
away but I don't think it's really a an
effective place to put a lot of effort
in terms of online marketing unless
you're really willing to spend a lot of
time building a brand or your brand is
based on a personality but if you're
like you know
Oprah or an Amy Winehouse or something
where you just want to connect with your
fast you know in that regard yeah maybe
but if you're somebody selling some
random services or you make furniture or
something or Facebook is useless you
know Twitter again twitter is another
social network you have to look consider
but again twitter is all about immediate
news something happening so unless you
have a type of business where things
happening has an impact then I'm not
sure how effective Twitter will be so
you know again if you make furniture
their dog groomer or sell catering
services or something I'm not sure how
how good Twitter would because I don't
know if anybody's going to be going to
care whether or not you're grooming a
dog today or something or you're making
a new piece of furniture if you're an
artist again I'll go back to what Amy
White House of course she's dead but if
you're assuming you're alive and you're
you know he sell music or something the
Twitter might be interesting because
then you know people might be interested
if you're putting up their songs or
whatnot you know Twitter might be more
useful for me a lot I haven't really
used it so much I got a smallish twitter
feed but maybe people might be
interested in my new video course would
put out or do v blog or something so
that has its use but yeah so when you're
looking at the social networks you know
people get excited about things they're
all social networks and they get into it
but it's you gotta really think about it
you know you know calm down what's the
reality of the situation here and we'll
see what happens it kind of reminds me
when the iphone app store first came out
and everybody went nuts now initially
yes it was good time to get him like
anything new because there's you know if
you're one of the first apps out there
you got
you got attention that you wouldn't have
got another way otherwise and a lot of
soompi some people very few people made
a lot of money and you hear about these
stories about this kid or that's person
made a huge amount of money but they're
there they're very rare it's like you
know it's like assuming hearing about
the guy who wins daughter lottery and
then rushing out to buy a whole bunch of
lottery tickets it's very difficult
especially now that that mark is very
well established you have to you have to
you know I'm not saying don't produce it
at an app for the iPhone or the ipad not
not at all but or Android but you have
to understand it there's a lot of
competition and you know I I haven't
looked at the data but I would imagine
there's really no advantage to putting
it putting your an application or
service on the app store or the Android
Marketplace versus just put it on the
web itself you don't directly so i would
say 2003 if if it makes sense but don't
think it's something special or some
huge opportunity it's not it's it's an
opportunity but i don't think it goes
much beyond that what's really cool is
because the social networks are you know
they recognize their importance what you
can do now is you can actually bind
accounts from one social network to the
next so for instance I've bound my
youtube channel to my Facebook and my
Twitter feeds so so whenever I post a
video on youtube it off you to
automatically post it to Facebook and if
you can post it to Twitter I'm not sure
sometimes it doesn't seem to fire off
but anyway so you can look at that you
know when you're sort of planning your
social media marketing efforts you could
look at okay what will be the primary
social network that I'm going to use to
launch my campaign and for me it's
YouTube and then from YouTube I let
YouTube broadcast out to the other two I
don't use
then maybe I should but I don't at this
time and so that's that's one thing to
consider how you you how you can use the
tools within the social networks to
connect to other ones so I'll leave you
to look into it to pay on the type of
business you have again it depends your
type of business will dictate whether
you should use Facebook although as I
said I think Facebook is the least
effective youtube twitter or google+ etc
just consider that saves you some time
the last point I want to cover is the
frequency of post on your social
networks I think it's pretty much the
same as posting on your blog or updating
the site your own website I think you
should have a steady regular flow of
data if it makes sense one point I want
to stress is that you should not put out
filler information that's the first
mistake people make just think all you
got to put out you got to put out
content you got to put out content if
the content is no good if it's boring or
if it's just filler then it's your not
only wasting your time you probably are
hurting yourself because information
scarcity is not the problem today and
what I mean to say is that there's
plenty of information out there there's
unlimited content out there and your job
as a marketer of your services or
products or whatnot is to be a filter
for content your job is to make it
easier for people to find what they want
to find within your field of course so
you don't want to give them a bunch of
garbage you want to give them quality
less is best go for quality and I said
you should try to be regular in your
postings what's regular well you know it
depends on the type of business that you
have
and I admit for myself I'm not as
regular as I should be alone trying to
step that up now I would say you know
for me and i'll just use myself as an
example for for me you know they're two
three times a week maybe four times a
week sometimes do more sometimes i do
less just so that the audience knows
that okay baking they're going to get
new content from you that's interesting
and so you keep them around you keep
them interested it's uh that's pretty
much it that's my advice beyond that try
to be honest no don't try be honest be
honest straightforward about what you do
and and these days unless you know
unless unless you have something totally
unique some unique technology nobody has
like the iPhone was at one time or the
iPad you know it's about it's about
establishing trust with people your
audience with people who know you and
they come to know you if they like you
and they trust what you do and they like
what you do they do they may give you
their business and if they don't there
you go so I just say be honest what you
do try not to overload them with
unnecessary useless information so
anyway that's it with that in mind those
are my basic social social media
marketing tips and once I want to have
time once i finish my move we got some
new projects we're finishing up i think
i will put out a more serious series on
this you know based on my own experience
there's a lot of stuff i'm not talking
about right now nothing you know I'm
trying to be secrets just you know I
have to organize the better so that's it
that's my feet blog I hope I didn't
ramble too long thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
