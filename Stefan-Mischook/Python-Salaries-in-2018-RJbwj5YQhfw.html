beginner's killer Python 3 course page I
decided to add information about Python
just up-to-date information so people
have an idea what the courier potentials
are and so forth and the reason I do
that is because in this course I not
only teach you how to write Python code
quickly I get into career
specializations and job oriented
training so you understand what it is
what's out there in terms of getting a
job
becoming a freelancer etc that are using
Python for your own business with that
in mind what I've done is I linked to
the latest stats in terms of Python
salaries so you go here - indeed comm if
you're not aware this is a job site very
popular so based on 29,000 employees so
this is pretty good data and you see as
of today November 2017 24th average
salary is a hundred and sixteen thousand
per year that's the average and most
reported but you look he can get way up
to hundred thousand a year one hundred
sixty thousand year hundred forty nine
thousand years hundred fifty thousand
year one hundred fifty two etcetera
etcetera etcetera so you can see Python
is a very very lucrative field to get
into so what I'm going to be doing on
this Python course page my beginners
killer Python 3 I'm going to be keeping
up-to-date information for you guys
as a reference another thing I've done
I'm adding more free content here choice
videos that you can get a feel for what
my course structure is like and that's
pretty much it I just thought that was
kind of interesting I was surprised at
how large as the salaries are getting in
the 200,000 area I knew Python people
were making well for 100 grand but to
see that you've got people doing two
hundred and hundred and 60 hundred fifty
250 this is a pretty serious money as a
developer let me tell you up here sir
parently some people making two hundred
twenty one thousand again this is based
on twenty nine thousand five hundred
employees so you know that this data is
very very accurate of course
these salaries will both fluctuate
depending on where you live in the world
what part even but part of the u.s. you
live I imagine people living in San
Francisco gonna make a lot more money
than people living in Ohio simply
because the cost of living is hot much
higher in San Francisco nonetheless
Python very attractive skill set to have
very attractive skill say if you look at
a junior Python developer guys just
coming out of school you start off at
nearly 74,000 this is the average but I
tell you what if you learn business
skills on top of just Python skills and
a few other things that I teach so let's
say you do a Python and then you do my
interactive web developer course where
you learn full stack web development
more importantly you understand how the
web works how HTTP works how the
client-server model works you see in my
cold course is unlike so many out there
I actually teach a whole bunch of
fundamental core concepts and techniques
that underlie all the coding so when you
go in to get a job you're gonna be in a
great position you're gonna have all
this knowledge that your competitors
won't have there you go bit of a
shameless plug I know but still
nonetheless very interesting information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
