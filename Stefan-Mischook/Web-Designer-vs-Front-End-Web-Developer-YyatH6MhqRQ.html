your somewhat YouTube questions here let
me know if this camera is pretty far
away the mics pretty far away and I
forgot to bring out my little free mic
so let me know if this sounds ok and if
you don't say anything assume it sounds
ok so questions what kind of martial
arts are you doing well the question is
what kind of martial arts did I do I did
martial arts from the age of 10 years
old up until about 40 and start with
judo then karate and Taekwondo then
Kukushkin karate that I did catch
Campbell for quite a while I got a black
belt in that I did five years of boxing
and wrestling etc cielab because it's um
what I did some wing chun a couple years
Ryoka kemple bla bla bla bla bla so I
did a lot of different arts and when I
discovered over the years at each of the
Arts have something to offer some arts
are far more practical than others like
boxing and Thai boxing and judo and
wrestling in terms of actual combat are
much more practical than a lot of karate
and Kung Fu is out there but every style
has something to bring to the table
anyways that's what I did I don't train
much anymore I do stuff on my own of
course my wife cream just for
flexibility and strength and so forth
that's about it next question can you
make a video that explains the real
difference between a web designer a
front-end developer and mostly like when
a developer and a designer working
together in a company what are the tasks
that each one does okay um a web
designer is somebody who builds the
front-end the visual component of the
website and they deal more with the
aesthetics the user interface the
designer literally designs it to look
good also to make it have good user
usability good you axial UI UX whereas
the front-end developer
we'll make the front and more of an app
we'll give it AB like functionality
these days the most popular framework
about library for guys react of course
and so a front-end developer would write
all the logical code if you will that
would connect to some back-end whether
it be a PHP back-end a Java back-end a
node back-end etc so you can dig up the
developer or silly eyes the
functionality to the front end of the
site to the visual components of the
site and the web designer designs it
makes it look good and and places things
and in such a way so that it's logical I
hope that makes sense
I just finished learning the basics of
HTML CSS JavaScript with those languages
can start doing pro I can't I guess he's
trying to say can I start doing projects
so I can become a back-end developer and
what can you try to read this what can
you make a video about what type of
projects got a bigger make ok well yes
you know HTML CSS that's enough to
become to start working on your back-end
web development to be clear if you want
to become a web app developer back-end
you have to first learn at least HTML
and CSS there's no question about that
then you can pick your server-side
programming language whether it be PHP
Java C sharp Python with Django or flask
Ruby which I'm going to do of course
server-side JavaScript with node and
some MVC framework that sets atop a node
an MVC framework MVC is short for Model
View controller it's a framework that
makes building web apps easier and much
quicker so yeah once you know just HTML
CSS you can go forward trying to learn
to learn rather a server-side
programming language and what kind of
projects start with simple projects you
know you might start up with a simple
ecommerce site that hooks up with paypal
or hopes up with stripe and that will
get you going in terms of building a web
app I'll answer this final question a
lot more but whatever that carpet on the
wall is not Slovak it's actually Indian
and I just bought it because I like the
colors at that time that's pretty much
it well I bought that because I like the
cars at the time because when you're
buying furniture for your house your big
pieces of furniture it should be neutral
in terms of color I used to have this
giant big red leather couch you know
very stylish but it was it became too
much you got this huge red couch in your
rule it overpowers you and get you angry
so what I learned is that when you
decorate your place your big pieces your
couches and so forth should be very
neutral and then if you want to add a
little splash of color pizazz you do
something like buying a carpet like this
it's all shiny because you can just take
it down or avaaz it's shiny and it's red
you know accent pieces have splashy
color and your main pieces your big
pieces are neutral all right there you
go Chuck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
