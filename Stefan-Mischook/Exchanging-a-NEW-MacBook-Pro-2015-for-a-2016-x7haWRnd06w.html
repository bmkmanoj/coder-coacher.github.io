2015 MacBook Pro which I bought about a
month ago and exchange it for a new 2016
MacBook Pro contradicting things I said
in previous videos but let me explain
first of all whether I by 2016 MacBook
Pro or 2015 or a Windows machine or a
horse shouldn't affect your decision in
terms of what computer you or you are
going to buy because everybody has a
different use case you may be looking
for a computer for particular needs that
are very different but my particular
needs so that's a big issue you may have
different budget requirements you may be
maybe making much more than me maybe
making much less than me if you are
student or just taking notes as well you
had a program you probably don't need
the fastest computer there is out there
that's for sure on the other hand if
you're doing video work every day and
that's your main work lots of video work
or maybe you're doing a lot of
development and you got virtual machines
running it's very intense
well maybe you then you need a faster
machine depends on your particular use
case so I was watching all these reviews
on the MacBook Pro and I got influenced
by them especially the negative ones
with regards to all the dongles being
missing not all toggles being missing
all the ports being missing so he needed
dongles and the other complaints you
heard about like you know I'm not being
a touchscreen which again to me it
should have been a touchscreen but you
know you know the bike safe and then
people are really getting into
nitpicking things I didn't even think
about was like whether the Apple logo on
the back it was glowing or not so at the
end of the day I was listening to all
these reviews and I was influenced I
said I was getting a 21
Dean but here's the problem with that
problem is that when you buy a 2015
MacBook Pro when the 2016 is out the
2015 does not have a USB C port it has
all kinds of other ports all the old
legacy port but does it have USB C and
to me that's a problem because when you
buy Mac's these are not machines that
you're going to be upgrading typically
every year at least I don't
and so we see quickly and quickly USBC
is starting to take hold now in terms of
peripherals and that's just such a
useful port and in terms of USB C can be
used to power monitors and to charge
your computer and to connect to hard
drives it's the universe of port my
Google pixel is USB see the game changer
for me is reason I went with the 2016
ultimate leaves because I wanted to be
able to drive 5k and 4k monitors the
MacBook Pro 2015 that I bought only had
Intel integrated graphics and as far as
I understood it could not even drive a
4k monitor at 60 Hertz that probably
drive it at 30 Hertz now you may not
know the difference between 30 Hertz and
60 Hertz when you're driving a monitor
of 30 Hertz it's like you have a mouse
pointer that's a drunk or a mouse
pointer that's being dragged through
snow or through sand it's really slow
and it's just really annoying and I
can't take it so that to me was the game
changer because I wanted to be able to
drive 4k and 5k displays the MacBook Pro
2015 could not do it with the integrated
graphics that I couldn't find any new
MacBook Pro 2015's with dedicated
graphics that's the GPU so there you go
that was the game-changer for me so I
decided to take a risk
I bought the 2016 still had the 2015 and
Apple has such a great customer service
you may fault them for this survive
thing but they have such a great
customer service that I had to both the
2015 of 2016 I was able to compare and I
actually cloned
I cloned the hard drive of the 2015 onto
the 2016 so I had the exact same hard
drives in terms of the file structure in
the apps in the and the video projects
so I took a video project that was in my
2016 it was all May 2015 put out of 2016
and I rendered the same video project on
both machines and to my surprise the
2016 was able to render out the video at
30 40 percent faster 30 40 % faster so
instead of being 10 minutes it was like
6 minutes to render out the same file
and that to me is extremely significant
because what I put out a course could be
a hundred videos so it adds up in terms
of time in terms of other performance I
just noticed that it was just as if here
overall much faster the keyboard on the
new Mac was fine for me but again the
main point I think of those videos that
you have to choose the computer based on
your needs and I would suggest always
buy for forward compatibility yes at the
end of the day I did have to get one dog
oh right that's the thing it's funny you
buy an Apple computer these are like
$2,000 $3,000 computers and people are
complaining that they're gonna have to
spend 50 bucks more on a dongle that's
kind of you know you know if you can
spend that much money muzzle despite a
dongle to get that extra power and an
extra capability and yeah so for me if
you want to know all those not relevant
why did I get the new MacBook Pro 2016
rendered my videos 30 40 % faster it had
USB C it could drive 4 and 5k displays
with no problem those are the three main
things and the USB the ability to drive
the 5k displays for me because I use
external monitors all the time you see I
have an old video on YouTube from 2-12
to me I always
use my laptop's connected to an external
monitor all the time and external
Bluetooth keyboard and mouse I don't use
wire keyboards keyboards and mouse to
connect to my laptop so and the dog will
fake was this it became a not an issue
for me because I just needed one dog or
to go from buy my 2016 MacBook Pro into
my Thunder port thunderbolt monitor
there we go the thunderbolt monitor has
all kinds of ports built it as USBs and
stuff like that so that solved all my
problems so that's it one one dongle and
I got a much faster machine so it was a
little bit more expensive that's true
but to be able to render at 40 30% to
40% faster not me that was me that was
it you know that productivity will
account for the increased expense but
then again like I said who cares what I
want
depends my needs are gonna be probably
are gonna be different from your needs
with regards to computer so that's why
there's always different types of
computers and different configurations
and so just consider strongly what you
need and take every review with a grain
of salt
Jojo so I saw that latest Star Wars film
rogue one and man whatever it's kind of
like Star Wars meets saving the Private
Ryan that's the best way I could
describe it it's pretty good that gray I
would just wait for Netflix personally
but that's just my taste
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
