about CSS flexbox and CSS grid this is
something that came up in a comment in
the YouTube channel and we're gonna take
a quick look at these two technologies
as part of CSS and some broader
implications about when to leverage new
tech CSS grid flexbox are relatively new
in terms of their implementation in the
CSS specification so I'll translate that
into non nerd basically it's been in the
spec but boy in the last year's old
couple years something like that
that it started to be rolled out
supported in all the web browsers but
not all of them not all of them so this
begs the question number one when should
you implement new technologies when
should you put it to use and which
should you be looking for so in the web
space traditionally what you want to
look for is technology that provides a a
big advantage that you don't have with
previous technologies or current
technologies and B technologies that is
widely supported so let's take a look at
what CSS grid and flex box are so I'm
going to the w3c the w3 schools rather
w3c by the way is the organization say
it's the organization that basically
manages the whole internet thing in
terms of all the tech and everything in
terms of CSS JavaScript et cetera so
they sort of keep control that so they
have a site called w3 schools which is
excellent site to go to to learn new
things once you have your basics down
now this is not a place to go if you're
brand new to the web coding and coding
in general because you're just going to
be confused so you do do a good course
then you come here and you can reference
new things like CSS grid and CSS layout
so let's look at the w3 schools website
now so if you come to the CSS tab here I
just clicked on it you see the tutorial
here which is outline of course I cover
all this in my own tutorial but a much
friendlier manner
it's all text-based here so it's a good
reference site so if you look down under
CSS advanced you have flexbox we click
on that now flexbox is basically allows
you to create flexible boxes and to
position things within your website it's
designed to make it easier than the
traditional ways that we do it and
actually right here
the flexbox layout module makes it
easier to design flexible responsive
layout structures without having to use
floats and positioning floats and
positioning if you've done your basic
CSS is the traditional way of laying out
pages and it's a bit it's not the most
user-friendly as I spoke about in my
course but if you've got a good course
it's it's quite usable so you've got
flex box here is cool and if you're
familiar with CSS it's a property of
display so display flex flex box right
I won't get into that now so if we
scroll down here and if you look down
here CSS grids got its own section so
CSS grid layout module the CSS grid
layout module offers a grid-based layout
system with rows and columns main easier
to design web pages without having to
use floats and positioning sounds like
the same thing now it is but it is in
Flex box is something that you use
inside of the grid layout although you
could use flexbox to create your whole
page layout really you use the grid to
create your grid layout and then you put
your use flexbox inside to do stuff
inside the layout that's the way I would
suggest you do it when you use these
technologies but there's a big but with
using these technologies which we'll get
into a second but before I go on if you
look down here display property knows
display grid so when is the display flex
one is the display grid there you have
it so when should you use these well you
should use them because they're going to
make your layout work much easier and
you can argue that and when it's widely
supported so how do you know when it's
widely supported for first of all you go
to kind I use can I use com
and I checked out CSS grid so CSS grid
as you can see it's pretty much
supported in modern web browsers but ie
now you go ie that's old what is old it
is old released 2013 you can see it's
indicated right there and as this global
usage 2.7 80% according to according to
kind I use now we have to see where they
get their information from now there's
different ways places rather that you
can check to see browser support but
right now it says about 3% use ie and ie
has partial support with prefixes okay
so you got a hack it a little bit to get
it work with IE but how important is is
IE well it's at least 3% globally
important but that doesn't tell the
whole picture you have to figure out
where the traffic is coming from for
your website and where you want it to
come from it is they've been a way of
considering traffic so let's go to
another site stats counter comm so stats
counter calm let's go to the USA alright
I pre I preset this to make it easy for
everybody here so if you look at browser
market share united states america right
up to date I'm recording this in March
2nd 2018 so you can see the dominant
browser is chrome with 45% and the
second browser most popular browser
Safari which surprises me to be totally
honest with you
but it is but look the third one is IE
we have to dig down see what versions I
bet there's a bunch of versions before
11 remember and I can't I use it was 11
has partial support but if you look at
yeah so you see IE has four point nine
four percent usage in the United States
only five percent and in Canada it is in
Canada it's it's almost six almost seven
percent so you say to yourself ok we may
have some problems with flexbox and we
may have problems with CSS grid in the
United States well as much as let's just
say for sake of argument five percent of
people might have some issues there you
might have to mess around with some of
the code to CalPERS
which means more work but ie usage is
dropping overtime so you have to ask
yourself when you're designing a layout
now CSS grid does make it easier then
traditional means of all if you just
learn from a good tutorial traditional
means it's not that hard you could use
bootstrap but there's bootstrap three
and four now four came out recently but
it is based on CSS grid so you run into
the same problem
CSS bootstrap 3 is based on more
traditional so work and be compatible
with many more browsers you don't have
to check into that you have to check
with bootstrap 4 to see whether or not
they've made it backwards compatible and
I would imagine they did we would have
to look into that anyway I'm just
running through the thought processes
but professional web designers and
developers have to go through so you
have to consider basically whether or
not potentially alienating 5% of your
market is worth it to you so you have to
ask yourself you have a company says
let's say they do a million dollars in
sales I'm picking a round number and you
say to them wow we're gonna use CSS grid
because it's easier for me to use that
to do a layout and to do is with
traditional layouts or maybe I will just
use bootstrap instead which is pretty
easy but anyway you say I want to use
this grid it's only gonna cost 5% 5% of
your audience would be effective so you
say to the client you might affect
$50,000 worth of business and I think
that the client may go what what you
want because it's gonna make your life a
little easier you want me to jeopardize
potentially 5% of my audience jeopardize
you know getting in the way of baby 5%
of the sales now again thought process
perhaps you've implemented CSS grid with
some minor hacks it will work with older
versions of ie perhaps bootstrap 4 which
is based on CSS grid will have that
built in to make it backwards compatible
if you don't know what bootstrap is it
is a system that allows you to layout
pages easily and in fact in the w3c they
call it a framework enter several
out there the most popular is bootstrap
Boosh f3 which is based on old technique
bootstrap 4 which is based on new
technique so you can explore those as
well generally speaking in production a
lot of people just use bootstrap it's
pretty easy to implement I talked about
in my book and we have a quick
introduction to bootstrap in the package
anyhow but you can just find it here as
well right they have a section on
bootstrap right here
I think this covers bootstrap 3 of
course yeah and you can see all that
works so very avid this tutorial was
about CSS grid and flex the grid creates
the outer structure use flex CSS flex
inside of grid that's how I would use it
although you can take grid and make it
work for a whole framework there's other
ways as well to layout traditional ways
there's the table as well as CSS table
is another way I show how to do that
in the course so what I would like you
to get out of this tutorial is how you
should consider laying out pages how you
should consider the technology terms of
use case in terms of in terms of you how
widely adopted it is how advantageous it
is to use a particular technology like
is CSS grid going to be that much better
for you and traditional layout methods
is it worth the hassle maybe doing CSS
grid is something great for a year from
now or two years from now maybe in 2018
maybe it's better to stick to bootstrap
3 or 4 depending on the backward
compatibility or 4 because you know the
traditional CSS techniques are going to
work with all browsers no matter what
and you know well just about and you
know that bootstrap 3 will work with all
browsers for sure but when you look at
CSS grid when you're looking at
bootstrap for you may have some inflex
box of course you may have some issues
there there you go I hope this is useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
