let's take a little deeper into the
WordPress administrative functionality
that we have now main administrative
window if you will is called the
dashboard and wherever you happen to be
if you just click on this dashboard
button it will get you there so if we go
back to users for instance we can just
click dashboard it gets us back there
another thing that you notice a lot of
these options pearance plugins users
tool settings they all have little sub
options if you click the little arrow
that appears things drop down now when
we first loaded WordPress we have this
default theme appear for us a theme is
basically just a template for wordpress
by default when you first install
WordPress it comes with a couple of
themes and I'll show you how to activate
them now so what you want to do is go
into the side menu you want to click on
appearance you want to click on themes
and here we are any manage themes window
and right now we have two themes that
come with WordPress the current theme is
the theme pictured on the top here and
we also have this other theme this is
the old classic theme by its guide David
ship so if we want to activate the theme
all you have to do is click on it we get
a little preview here just click on the
x over Y activator of course we click on
the activate button and new theme
activated so let's take a look at our
page and we just hit refresh and bring
this interview here so we hit refresh
button and as you can see the new theme
rolls out for us what's really cool
about WordPress is that with the themes
you can change the entire look of your
site which is a click of a button right
so how do you add new themes to the
system well there's a couple ways
this is add new button here which will
allow you to do searches for themes and
download them I'm not gonna get into
that here the old-school way is just to
find a theme that you like and our theme
shops whether they be commercial or open
source free themes once you find what
you like all you need to do is upload
them into your themes directory in your
wordpress install so what does that mean
for if we go to the server and if you go
inside the blog directory that's where
we installed hard WordPress at this time
you want to go into WordPress well WP
dash content WP is always short for
WordPress that's why I keep saying or
press so you click that open and you see
the themes directory and of course
classic default if you go back to our
theme we have the classic and we have
the default theme so if you wanted to
load up a new theme all you'd have to do
is gravel the theme files and their
contain usually in a folder and you
would just drop the new theme into your
themes directory you will then refresh
this manage themes page and that theme
would appear as an option for you so I'm
just going to activate the old default
theme because I prefer that one for sake
of this is a video for instance if you
go to cure sighs calm we've created our
own theme here from scratch to suit the
overall look of our site and I would
imagine that you will be doing the same
in time as well one popular option is to
actually take one of the default themes
like this theme for instance and to use
it as the basis for your own custom
theme
there is a heck of a lot more that can
be said about themes there are themed
editors you can go in there and change
things it you can as we saw before
actually be going to let's say the
default theme you notice here at the
theme consists of many different files
and in fact we had killer sites have a
video course dedicated to teaching
people how to create their own themes
given that we have a course dedicated to
just creating themes it goes beyond the
scope of this video for me to get into
that what you need to take away from
this part of the course is that you can
use the appearance tab here or drop down
menu to go in and make changes to look
and feel of your WordPress blog
one of the thing I want to mention is
this widget option right here now
widgets allows you to customize the look
and feel of your theme based by dragging
these elements into the sidebar here now
again this can get pretty complex
because how the widgets work really
depends on the theme you haven't be
using certain themes will support
widgets while other themes won't but
let's assume but this theme does and i'm
not sure if they update it is at this
point so let's try it out we're going to
put in one of the calendars we drag it
in put the counter will say killer Cal
I'll say that and now we're going to go
see if the calendar is inserted there
you go is inserted the killer calendar
by inserting one item into the sidebar
it changed the default behavior of the
sidebar if you notice all the other
options disappear again this is largely
a function of the theme the guy who
created the theme or a girl has to code
the theme to use this whole widgets
library here so let's delete that see
what happens now as you can see this
default theme becomes WordPress if you
don't add any widgets hear it then
displays all this for you by default of
course you could go into the theme
itself into the theme editor and you
could go in there and if you know about
the structure of the themes you can go
in there and change the look and feel of
the theme yourself for the sake of for
fun let's actually just build this out
just a little bit so we're going to add
something called pages
i'm going to call it pages save that and
i'm going to add something called mmm
categories I just collapse and
categories there we go show full scale
you have different options I want to
call this category's save them all right
and what I should we had with addy no
it's had a search box but you know it's
added to top you see how search say then
you notice how we're press allows you to
stack and reorder your sidebar elements
according to which you what you want so
we have a search on the top then we have
the pages and categories let's refresh
search on a top pages and categories I
think at this point you're getting a
pretty good idea how to widgets Tool
Works how you can sup your page and so
we can move on from here
in next video may teach you the
difference between pages and categories
and post so you understand how they work
within the context of a wordpress blog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
