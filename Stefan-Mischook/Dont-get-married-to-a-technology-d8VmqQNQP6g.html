killer sites calm and the new killer
sites University calm I'll talk about
that later it's been one long time so
they did a video blog I've been busy at
a town but I'm back again in this blog I
want to talk about technology and
getting married to technologies so
basically the message is don't fall in
love with a particular technology and be
ready to jump ship and grab something
that's better so let me give you a quick
example for instance about five years
ago I started getting into Mac having
been a Windows user for you know since
90s early 90s and then I picked up the
macbook air and here it is the ultra
portable and it's simply the best
computer i have ever used and what are
reasons it is the best computer i've
ever used is because it's so fast it's
so elegant easy to work with its speed
is largely derived from the SSD heart
SSDs the solid solid state drives as
opposed to the old magnetic hard drives
what a lot of people to understand is
that the perceived speed of computer on
the actual speed of the computer is
largely affected by the speed of the
hard drive not the processor not the RAM
everybody concentrates on processor ram
and they tend to ignore hard drives SSD
drives are something like 10,000 times
faster than your typical hard drive so
when you have an SSD based system like
the mac air everything is super super
fast so i recommend to anybody
especially if you're getting into web
design web programming on a professional
manner even if you're learning it really
i recommend spending the extra couple
hundred bucks to get the SSD base
computer whether it be a macbook air or
one of the ultrabooks are now coming out
hitting the market so getting back to
the original point of SB blog not
getting married to a technology so I
switched over many years ago from
windows because windows are really
falling apart especially vista and i
switched over mac OS because Mac os10
was far superior now though I think
windows with windows 7 and I think with
the new ultrabooks coming out I think
they're starting to catch up to Mac and
in fact I think perhaps and I'm not say
for sure from what I've seen with
windows 8 you may see windows really
starting to get back into the groove
again again I'm never good I don't think
I'll get rid of my macbook air I'm going
to use it because I think you know the
main thing is the hole and you know you
don't have to worry so much about
viruses with the mac that being said i'm
pretty sure i'm going to be getting the
new samsung series 9 which is their new
ultra thin SSD based ultralight notebook
know if it's an ultrabook us anyway so
and the reason getting it well first of
all I think windows seven is is very
good I'm not saying it's perfect but I
think it's very very good and the fact
there's a practical reason and practical
reason is that for the new courses that
are going to be producing I need to
produce these things in the Windows
environment because you know with the
killer sites network in art we get a
couple million pageviews I don't know
what are the exact count is we have
millions of page views per month and I
was looking at the data recently and
we're still 75% windows-based so I have
to put out windows-based videos and
training horses I'm still going to do
mac stuff as well but you know I have to
do it so in working you know if your
primary work machine should be as quick
as they should be as quick and as easy
to use as possible because you know you
know you're going to make up for that
extra expenditure the extra couple
hundred dollars more 40 SSDs based
system just in the time that you say so
there you go so again I big fan of Mac
OS big fan of the air the mac air is the
best computer for ever used so far but
when I see what's coming down the road I
see the advantages here there I see you
know what I think it's time to look at
windows again and look at windows you
know based hardware like Samsung's
putting out really good stuff asus is
putting out really good stuff so again
with regards to not being married to a
technology I've recently well recently
lost months ago I decided that it was
done for flash and I was one of the
first flash users in the world back in
the late late 90s but at this time i
think with the rise of html5 css3 jquery
packages like javascript packages like
jquery that's the big one script oculus
the advantages that flash provided are
now gone largely and the fact that adobe
has said no more flash players for
mobile devices that's crazy that's to me
is the last nail in the coffin because
you know most of the people in the next
several years or maybe surfing the web
with these mobile devices I'm not saying
flash going to disappear altogether but
it's going to fall into a niche and
eventually disappear so again I'm not
following falling in love with that
technology I see the writing on the
walls I see that it's time to switch
over something new or something better
so I leave flash behind and let it go so
yeah that's my advice to you as
technologists as nerds web programmers
web designers you can't get married to a
technology that you're ready to move on
when it makes sense to move on it's not
like there's no it's not about loyalty
these are just tools these are just
tools that's a you know and so you got
to pick the best tools for a job that's
it it'll be more coming very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
