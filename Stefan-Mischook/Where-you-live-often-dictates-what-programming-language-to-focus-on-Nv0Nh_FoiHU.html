asked should I take computer science
computer engineering like with so many
other things we talked about whether it
be technologies or skillsets or
programming languages check to see what
the local job listings are check to see
what the local opportunities are and
assuming that you you like doing
computer science or Computer Engineering
then make your decision based on that
you can check listings you might even
call them up and say hey listen now I'm
a student what are you guys looking for
you looking for more for computer
scientists or more for computer
engineers etc check Sara do a little
investigation one of the things I like
to do in my vlogs and in my courses not
only teach you the fundamentals and give
you principles to work off of and to
build off of but I'm also trying to
teach you how to think in a way that
will make you more productive which will
give you more opportunities so one
example that is that when you're looking
at whether you want to acquire a new
skill set or you want to start a new
business
maybe launch a type of product first
thing you do is you check to see what
the market is like out there in the
market but you want to get into so if
you have a product that's very regional
meaning you know sell in your city or
your country only check out what the
demand is for that product in your
country or in your city for example etc
etc etc there's many ways you can look
at that I'm gonna get into that in my
business course but again what to take
away from this video is you want to look
at the region or of a market segment
that you're in and you make your
decisions based on what you find out
there look at the data and that's pretty
much it I'm about to head out my my
back's a little stiff
and I think I need to do a little bike
ride up and down the hill go downtown
get a bite to eat that'll loosen up the
back loosen up the legs and I'll feel
much better for it that's what I do when
I have getting a little sore maybe that
tells me I'm sitting around too much
typing
and recording too many videos and that
means I got to get out and do some
exercise I'm gonna close off with a
couple of things I found I was doing
some more spring cleaning as you know
I'm downsizing slowly slowly I'm about
to do another round of giving away
clothes to the goodwill getting rid of
furniture I don't need and they found
some old promotional material from my
very first company started when I was 18
years old so here is the flyer as you
can see it's it's very water oriented
you have to understand here's the
products I don't know if you can see
that or not they're the products you see
it obviously you got a little fish on
there I wasn't biessing I told people I
was in the fish fish product business
before I what and I was indeed here it
is
and we designed these things when
graphic design on computer was this is
back in like 92 or something so it was
really hard to do this kind of work
because image files were really heavy
like to manipulate an image like that
for print took some heavy horsepower so
I was like collecting weight and weight
to click and wait and wait and wait and
here are some of the product labels I
kept a couple samples I designed these
back in the day myself
so that I don't know and here's the the
logo the company is no more I sold out
my position a long time ago well over 20
years anyway
it was a small company it was profitable
was successful I like to tell people I
learned I earned my PhD in business
building that business up I learnt a
heck of a lot and it's nothing like
getting out there into the real world to
get things done and so anyway I said I
just found those in the closet somewhere
I thought I'd share that with you guys
alright I'm off to get my chicken</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
