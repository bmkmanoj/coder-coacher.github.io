calm and killed PHP calm in this video
I'm going to answer questionnaires
recently put to me by a user of go live
adobe golive if you're not familiar with
go live it's a web design software put
out by Adobe Systems so the question was
will Dreamweaver be able to read my goal
I've files the short answer to his
question is of course and the reason the
answer is of course is because go live
is just writing HTML and CSS pages as is
Dreamweaver as is any other web design
software out there people who are
WYSIWYG users
what-you-see-is-what-you-get programs
users things like go live and front page
and Dreamweaver of course some of them
don't understand the code behind the web
pages so they assume wrongly that a file
produced by go live a Dream Weaver an
HTML file or a CSS document or whatnot
is somehow some sort of proprietary file
type like if you produce the file in
Microsoft Word or if you produce a
Photoshop document web pages are an open
format or plain text format what that
means is that web pages are just built
using text code and all that go live
Dreamweaver front page or any other web
design software does for you all it does
is it automates the process of writing a
code as you point and click in the
background these programs are just
writing a code to the pages that's why
it's important and I always tell people
who are new to web design but you
understand the code behind the pages if
you don't you can be severely restricted
you're going to have
many more frustrating days because
though these programs are very powerful
and I you know whether it be dreamweaver
expression web expression go live
whatever they're very powerful and
capable but they don't do everything
perfectly and there are times when you
just need to be able to go in there and
make changes to code that's clear
another thing I want to point out is
that if you don't understand code you're
going to be very limited in terms of
your ability to structure your pages and
your website's properly because if you
don't understand code you're not going
to understand some of the subtle aspects
of web design and web pages and these
subtleties are important in terms of
creating websites that are easy to
update websites but our SEO search
engine optimized or search engine
friendly and websites that that are easy
to adapt this is important and the
difference between a professional web
designer is some kid playing with
Dreamweaver our front page is that basic
understanding of those structures and
often times the difference between a
successful web site on the web versus a
non successful website is an
understanding of these subtleties so I
highly suggest if you're a go live user
a dreamweaver user or front-page user or
whatever if you're hazy on the code if
you're not quite sure about how all this
stuff works you should really learn this
stuff and again killer sites com we got
plenty of stuff there for you to learn
and at the end of the day what you're
going to discover it's really not that
difficult if the basics are taught to
you properly
