name is steph and i'm going to be your
teacher and i'm here with my partner
Hans I'm so excited to learn so in this
course over the next several videos
we're going to learn basic HTML where
there's this down form HTML is the
language that's used to build websites
and it's short for hypertext markup
language so we're going to learn a new
language exactly so I had to do that
once you know from Austria I protects
markup languages so quite a mouthful in
terms would it always so I'm not going
to get into it now you're going to learn
about the details about what this means
as we go through the course my style of
teaching is very hands-on I think the
best way to learn is to just do
something my name is hands or a kind of
understand it so what we're going to do
is we're going to jump right into
building our very first web page right
but before I do guys won't explain i am
using mindles seven for all the
demonstrations wait a minute with above
the mac whether you're on Windows or Mac
it's not going to make a difference
because web design is universal and HTML
is a universal language so this is Mac
head friendly exactly so whether you're
using Windows 7 mac windows 8 or XP
you'll be fine because we're using
software to build our websites that is
built into every computer it's great so
first thing you want to do is go to your
desktop and we're going to create a
folder so on Windows you right click and
you hit new folder its brand new I'm
just going to call it websites right so
open that up and in here we want to
create a new text document so on windows
I'm going to hit the right click again
right and hit new and all the options
that you have here it may be different
on
computer depending what programs you
have installed you want to select text
document to extort you don't want to
select rich tags or a word document does
the poor one exactly the plain old
simple text document right so I select
that and what we're going to do is I'm
just going to call it page dot HTML or
does that mean well we changed it from
dot txt to dot HTML because we're by
doing this we're telling the computer
that this is an HTML page HTML means the
web page exactly so let me just hit
enter here now Windows is asking us do
you want to change the file extension it
file extensions anything past a period
so before we had dot txt now is HTML so
it says if you change the file extension
the file might become unusable what are
you sure you want to change it so it's a
warning it's a warning so don't worry
about it we're just going to say yes
change to change the symbol you see the
icon it changes so what does that change
to it changes to let me just drag it out
here so it's a little bit bigger it
changes to the Internet Explorer icon
and the reason it does as because
Windows now thinks that this is an HTML
page and it links it's an HTML page
because because you called it that
exactly we gave it the dot HTML
extension right you see windows and mac
they use the extensions of the file
anything past that period to decide what
kind of file it is and if you call me a
girly man I'm not going to agree right
but in this situation whatever you call
it the computer reads a good way exactly
right let me let me to make my point let
me just turn this back to txt which is
short for text and see what happens
alright we get that familiar warning
again a hand so I just click yes and
look what happens see it does whatever
you tell it yeah it turns into a little
notepad that's the that's the that's the
symbol or the icon
for notepad right so if you look here
even down here and windows is the plane
notepad you see that it looks like we
got the image here so i'll change it
back to HTML again it is whatever you
say it is exactly so like this sysctl so
here we go the page dot HTML you see we
got the Internet Explorer icon back
again right so now it's like it it's
reading it as a web page exactly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
