getting up super early in the morning
I'm talking 5 a.m. 4:30 a.m. 6 a.m. for
me that's super early I usually get up
around 8:00 8:30 or so and the reason
I'm doing it is because I feel much more
energized throughout the day my ability
to think is noticeably better and even
the feeling in my body I'll use the
energy in my body in a non spiritual way
but the energy in my body is just
lighter more relaxed so this brings me
back to a lesson that was taught by my
Chinese my traditional Chinese medical
doctor and traditional Chinese doctor so
this is dr. yu from China all the way
from Beijing and he had just come to
Canada they moved here Lee spoke broken
English and he was a medical doctor but
he was also a traditional Chinese but
doctor I guess and what does that mean
that means that they practice the old
reading of the Chi if you will
doing the herbs the traditional herbs he
was telling me at the time that he would
read 1000 or 2000 year old texts that
was part of his curriculum and again let
me emphasize is he was also a medical
doctor in specializing in cancer so what
he did was to combine traditional
Chinese medicinal therapy with with
traditional with modern cancer treatment
and combining together beyond that he
was also applied that principle of
combining Western Eastern medicine to
cure all kinds of illnesses or to at
least address many illnesses ah so why
did I run into this guy because when I
was 19 years old I got a blood disease
that it was pretty bad
and it was chronic meaning
permanent you've stuck with that light
for life staff and it was requiring
major surgery blah blah blah blah blah
anyhow long story short I wasn't
visiting my friend and Chinese guy and
he said nice and hey you know your bliss
so his father sourced out this guy for
me who happened to have just moved here
from Beijing very recently I forget what
was within the last year or six months
or so anyway talking about the guy and I
told him what I had according to the
principles of Western medicine and so he
said ah no problem
I fixed you no problem and he spoke like
that and it's not an insult because I
had a lot of respect for somebody who
comes from China or whatever other
country where their first language isn't
English and is able to learn English his
English was much much better than my
Mandarin I all I could say at the time
was Goku so and seafood for my martial
arts training
anyhow so he put me on a regiment of
herbes he put me on a lifestyle regiment
I had to stop my martial arts I had to
go sleep before midnight he had and I
had to in the earth were the most
important aspect of it all and yeah he
told me back then doctor you with
regards to sleeping he said he said that
humans were not not turtle or not bats
and as such when we stayed up after
midnight it actually hurts our immune
system over time it does when you're
young in your teenage area or 20s or 30s
it doesn't affect you so much but you're
you're young and you're full piss and
vinegar but as you get older I'm in my
40s it starts to impact you and you feel
it more and more so you're able to
perform by the way physically you're
able to do just about everything just as
well as you could when you're younger if
you keep in shape the thing is is
recovery is longer so if you enter
yourself
he pushed up really hard you recover
more slowly and you're more sensitive to
the foods you eat and you're just your
lifestyle choices that's all anyway so
I'll talk to you about the dr. yu
situations pretty fascinating basically
it cured me of my blood disease took
nine months but it cured me of red blood
disease anyway I reminded of him because
he first introduced me to that a whole
idea that it's better for humans to
actually sleep at night and get up early
in the morning with the Sun another
sunny day today but there you go you
never know where you're going to learn
stuff and you never know how important a
meeting can be because you can learn
life-changing lessons from random events
like getting a blood disease and meeting
a traditional Chinese doctor who just
came over from Beijing all right I'm off
to get my coffee now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
