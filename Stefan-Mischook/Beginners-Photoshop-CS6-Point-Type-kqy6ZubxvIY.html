talking about working with the type tool
inside of Photoshop cs6 to begin with
we'll start exploring working with point
type to follow along you can open up the
killer sites you for PSD which can be
found if you go to the mini bridge
inside of your source files in the
killer sites folder as well if you want
to follow along with the files that
we've been working with up to this point
you can also open up killer sites one I
happen to have both of them open here
one that has all the type that we're
going to be using and one that has no
type at all you'll notice that I've
zoomed in to one hundred percent on
killer sites number one whereas killer
sites for is at a lower magnification
let's start by looking at killer sites
number one there's nothing in here and
if you look at your files inside of the
layer palette you'll notice that we just
have the logo some sticker information
banner and the simple background info
well within the logo we may want to
include some type inside of this so what
I'm going to ask you to do is to click
on the type tool or there is a keyboard
shortcut of T as soon as you do that you
may notice that there is a lot of
options available right up at the top
all for use with the type tool if you
just click on the stage what you're
going to end up with is point type and
point type is kind of interesting it's
generally used for short blocks of text
not large paragraphs and the reason
being is if I were to just come in here
and type a bunch of information and even
if I use the spacebar to make more than
one word we still would have all of our
texts on one line in order to separate
that text i would have to position my
cursor at a specific point and then
press the return key so that it would go
on to another line but i don't want to
do that in this
Aereo so notice i'm going to select all
of this text just by using my type tool
to click inside the text area and to go
all the way back to the beginning if i
delete that you can see that i still
have active type here let's write in the
word killer sites university now i'm
working with the font called bebes nua
you can work with any font that you like
notice here as soon as i move my cursor
away from the type area it turns back to
the move tool this is useful because it
allows me to now reposition my text
wherever I want it to be this type tool
is great because I can also make
selections and turn them into different
colors in order to do that I got to do
is to come up to the top and click on
this little color box right here I can
choose from colors by sliding along this
way or I could even use the eyedropper
tool to come in here and choose a
specific shade of green you can change
the size of your font by selecting it
and choosing a specific number by
clicking here or you could select the
type and change this number yourself to
another one another thing you could do
so just position your cursor right under
the t's that you see right here and
you'll notice that it gives you the
finger with an arrow on the left and the
right hand side this is something that
you could use to decrease or increase
the size of the font I'm going to leave
it at 50 to accept the changes that
you've made to your text the way to exit
this text area is to press the keyboard
shortcut command return on a Mac or ctrl
enter on a PC as soon as you do that
that allows you to work with the type
tool again
and to create yet another piece of text
so if I want to create another point
type I'll just come here and click I'm
going to write out the word the to
choose a font all you need to do is to
choose one from your list as we've seen
or we can select the font here and just
start typing out the font that you need
if you know its name you'll be able to
just write it out as I am right here
once you have the font that you want
press return and that will make the text
field be active I'm going to reduce this
size down to something like 20 29 now if
I move my cursor away from there I can
then reposition my text exactly where I
want it to be that's still a little too
big so I'm going to choose something
like 23 or 24 also select it and come in
here and choose the same gray color that
I'm using want these words to be in
lowercase letters so I'll just make sure
that I'm not pressing anything else when
I type them in now to exit I'll press
command return or ctrl enter this stage
you can see that in your layer palette
you happen to have killer sites
University written out right here as
well as the word the written here to
make that text active again you can
choose your type tool and click inside
of it or you can also double click the
text right here double clicking the tea
will allow you to select the text that
you can see there are more options than
the ones that we see up here in order to
access those options we can open up the
character window this can be accessed
here on the side from your window panel
or in the window menu here under
character or you could even just come to
this point right here and access the
character and paragraph windows if you
wish to make a change within your
character palette that's easy enough to
do simply in the same way as we saw
before you can change the size of your
file but you can also make some other
changes for example you can change the
amount of space between each of your
selected characters or in this case
we're going to set the tracking for all
of our characters you can choose from
the list or you can also use the slider
as we saw before to make those pieces of
text tighter or to increase the amount
of space between them you wanted to
increase the space between just two
characters you would have to click
between two characters and then you
could make your metrics here by setting
your kerning this could also be
increased notice that only affects the
two characters where my cursor is at
that point I could accept this by
committing the current edits by pressing
this little checkmark that is the exact
same thing as pressing command return or
control return on a pc I actually want
my text to be closer together so
commands that I'm going to undo that now
text in this fashion can also have layer
effects applied to them so just as we
saw in the previous videos dealing with
layer effects you can come in here and
you could say hey I'd like to bevel and
emboss that particular file and then you
could choose from a number of different
ways of doing this set the depth and you
can come in here and also apply a drop
shadow if you wish with a specific size
and blur depending on exactly what it is
that you're trying to do
come back in the next video and I'm
going to show you a little bit more
about working with the type tool but
this time we're going to be looking at
paragraph text</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
