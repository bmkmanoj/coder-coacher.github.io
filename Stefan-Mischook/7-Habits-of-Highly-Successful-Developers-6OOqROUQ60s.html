successful developers now these are my
top seven picks Klebe innate good benign
but seven habits is kind of a famous
book so I figured I just borrow that for
this video click baby title as they
would say so but these are very
important I think some of these things
are non-standard a lot of things here
I'm going to be mentioning you probably
wouldn't have considered alright so here
we go number one good documentation when
you're writing your app code when you're
writing your app be sure to document
things well especially the more complex
aspects of your code that being said the
code should be self describing but
that's tip number six but anyway good
documentation learn to write it for your
code you appreciate it especially down
the road six months later a year later
when you have to update things you'll be
glad that you documented things number
two get your apps out as quickly as
possible why do you want to do that so
you can get user feedback in the startup
parlance they call MVP Minimum Viable
Product because this is something any
entrepreneur has known for a long long
time I've known it for a couple decades
myself you never know what's going to
work so you want to get it out there you
want to get the product in the hands of
your consumer as quickly as possible so
number two get your apps out quickly as
possible or MVP Minimum Viable Product
number three you got to be language and
technology agnostic you can't be
somebody who is married to a particular
language piece he is the best necessary
everything else sucks
Python is bad everything else sucks
jealous you get the idea you don't want
to be stuck in that cap you want to look
at each project and you have to decide
what with that project which language
which technology would would best serve
that project that is the key
don't get caught up in language Wars
don't get caught up in being married to
a particular technology whether it be a
programming language or a framework what
have you be language agnostic before
when you sit down to write your apps
have coding standards your syntax how
you structure things naming conventions
etc etc this is important so that it
will become intuitive together navigate
through your codebase and navigate
through your app will also help you
along in terms of writing your code
because the more of convention that you
set easier it will be for you to sort of
lay out your project quickly and this
will work across different projects once
you have a certain standard I used to do
that myself back in the day especially
you would have my own framework I had a
very particular standard so when I was
when I would sit down to write out a
project it would just come up really
quick because I had the standards in
terms of database access layers and
validation layers and so if I had
frameworks of code and so forth but it
was this easy to lay out very quickly so
have standards fortunately many all the
modern programming languages and
frameworks have these standards in place
so Python has the pet standards and so
on and so forth so I just mentioned the
Python one because I just finished
Python core so it's fresh in my mind so
yes every language has a standard you
may want to flesh that out even more to
streamline your workflow standards very
important number five favour simple code
versus complex code whether it be in
individual methods of functions whether
it be in the structure of your app or
structure of your modules look to create
code that's really easy to understand
I'd rather have an extra few lines of
code that are much simpler to understand
when I come back to it six months later
but having some very complex code that
saves two or three lines yes simpler
simpler code the better at number six
you self-describing
naming conventions in your code would be
function ease method a variable names in
the case of web apps view themes etc use
have a standard naming convention and
make sure they describe something about
what it is that the code is doing so we
have a validation block object code
validator you know excetera etc so these
are basic things you may find the music
you may not find them useful but again
self-describing naming convention is
huge it will make your code much more
readable ultimately I spoke about
documentation before and you know this
goes to comments as well commenting your
code ultimately the less comments you
need to put in your code because your
code is simple and self describing in
its naming conventions the better off
you will be so you would use your
comments sparingly again if you don't
know the comments are you going to do
one of my beginners courses on programs
whether it be JavaScript PHP or Python
number seven this one's going to freak
out the Nerds up there you should have
good communication skills good
communication skills very important when
you're speaking with your clients that
they're able to understand you you're
able to understand them so you got to
learn to explain some of the concepts
that you know that represented in your
code you got to be able to explain these
things in simple terms that's harder
said excuse me that's easier said than
done it's harder to do than to say there
we go yet you want to learn to
communicate as best you can not only
verbally but it written as well when I
was a freelancer one of the things that
differentiated me from people out there
and this is what clients told me is that
I was able to break down the structure
of proposals very clearly and in non
nervous terms and this allowed me to
really communicate with the client very
effectively which got me a contract but
also cleared up a lot of frustration
because they were able to understand the
approach I was taking as opposed to them
being not too sure then running a bunch
of code and then they're saying nice not
what we wanted so being able to
communicate well as important
one of the best ways to learn how to
communicate well verbally whatnot is to
write simply write well as coverages and
other vlogs we learn to write well
concisely and that's going to help you
with your ability to just communicate
overall that's it those are seven
those are Senate well I'm going to add
in number eight you gotta use you're
going to understand your DevOps
development operations it's pretty
complex these days in my opinion but at
least understand github that's a cold
repo so that you have continuous your
backups and backups of various releases
so you can roll back things very quickly
if you update your Co it sucks you can
go back to the previous of work etc etc
etc so ya understand github or bitbucket
or one of these repos so that you can
get the job done we do we use get twelve
my coders use git and it just it's just
another layer of safety another layer of
redundancy there you go over to seven
