hierarchies in JavaScript what we're
going to do is we're going to jump into
one of the core javascript objects and
we go up here in the language subsection
here what I want to cover in this
video's are raised arrays are one of the
most important constructs one of the
most important objects in JavaScript and
it's important that you understand them
because a lot of us stuff what we do
within the document object here relies
on arrays to make happen
from now on since we're becoming quite
nerdy and we're starting to understand
these things a little bit better I'm not
going to use words like thingy and in
mechanism I'm going to start using the
proper terminology so for instance when
we're talking about an array we're
talking about the object array we're
talking about an object so we're going
to learn about the array object today
very quickly and after that I think we
can actually jump into some some foreign
processing code in JavaScript so anyway
in this video arrays and we'll take it
from there
like so many other things in JavaScript
arrays are something that is used in
many different languages including Java
C sharp action script PHP so once you
learn the concepts of an array in
JavaScript you're going to pretty much
learn how they work in all these other
languages so once again you will be
killing many birds with one stone
so here we are back in our text editor
and I set up a JavaScript block here so
what we're going to do now is we're
going to start off by creating an array
so it's pretty simply done in JavaScript
so we go VAR and we'll say i don't know
bar products equals new array now let's
go over this right quickly I'll say that
so we've created a variable and we've
assigned it an array we said we
basically told JavaScript to make this
variable here an array and you see this
new here this is as keyword in Java
Script and the new keyword basically
triggers java script to create an array
object for us so let's talk about arrays
a raise or objects that can hold many
different pieces of information if you
recall when we talked about variables a
variable as a container of it holds one
piece of information compare that to an
array and rate can hold many pieces of
information think about array as being
like a carton of eggs or you get an egg
carton rather where you got many
different slots for many different
pieces of information now this
information can be text this information
can be numbers it can even be objects
and because in JavaScript you can create
your own objects you can store objects
you can create you can have an array
with other raise inside of it so it's a
pretty powerful tool and it's used all
over the place in programming you're so
it's important you understand it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
