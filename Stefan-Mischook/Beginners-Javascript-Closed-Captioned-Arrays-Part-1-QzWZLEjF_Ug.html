hierarchies in JavaScript what we're
going to do is we're going to jump into
one of the core JavaScript objects and
we go up here in the language subsection
here what I want to cover in this videos
are rays arrays are one of the most
important constructs one of the most
important objects in JavaScript and it's
important that you understand them
because a lot of us stuff what we do
within the document object here relies
on arrays to make happen
from now on since we are becoming quite
nerdy and we're starting to understand
these things a little bit better I'm not
going to use words like thingy and in
mechanism I'm gonna start using the
proper terminology so for instance when
we're talking about an array we're
talking about the object array we're
talking about an object so we're gonna
learn about the array object today very
quickly and after that I think we can
actually jump into some some foreign
processing code in JavaScript so anyway
in this video arrays and we'll take it
from there
like so many other things in JavaScript
arrays are something that is used in
many different languages including Java
c-sharp ActionScript PHP so once you
learn the concepts of an array in
JavaScript you're gonna pretty much
learn how they work in all these other
languages so once again you will be
killing many birds with one stone
so here we are back in our text editor
and I set up a JavaScript block here so
what we're gonna do now is we're gonna
start off by creating an array so it's
pretty simply done in JavaScript so we
go var and we'll say I don't know bar
products equals new array now let's go
over this very quickly I'll save that so
we've created a variable and we've
assigned it an array we said we
basically told jobs but to make this
variable here an array and you see this
new here this is keyword in Java Script
and a new keyword basically triggers
Java Script to create an array object
for us so let's talk about arrays arrays
are objects that can hold many different
pieces of information if you recall when
we talked about a variable as a variable
as a container of it holds one piece of
information compare that to an array an
array can hold many pieces of
information
think about array as being like a carton
of eggs or you get an egg carton rather
where you got many different slots for
many different pieces of information now
this information can be can be text this
information can be numbers it can even
be objects and because in JavaScript you
can create your own objects or you can
store objects you can create you can
have an array with an other arrays
inside of it so it's a pretty powerful
tool and it's used all over the place in
programming your so it's important that
you understand it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
