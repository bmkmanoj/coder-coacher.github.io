in today's screencast I will show you
how to use WordPress is custom taxonomy
feature in your own themes taxonomy czar
used to classify and group things within
wordpress by default WordPress users to
taxonomy 'he's categories and tags but
you can also create your own this
functionality has been possible since
wordpress 2.8 but would press three
recently included the ability to create
hierarchical custom taxonomies making
this feature even more useful if you
need an additional way to organize
wordpress posts pages or custom post
types creating a custom taxonomy may be
the solution so what have i done so far
well first of all I went to
wordpress.org and I downloaded the most
recent version of WordPress which is
three point zero point one and I
installed that and set it up on my
computer and it looks like this and the
only difference between this website and
the stock wordpress install so I've
added one new post and that'll come in
handy a little bit later I've opened up
Kota which is my text editor and you'll
notice I have a twenty ten theme folder
open which is the default theme that
WordPress includes so you can find that
I installed my wordpress files within a
wordpress folder and you can find that
theme file within wordpress content
themes 2010 so what exactly are we going
to be doing today well we're going to be
imagining that we're building a blog
site let's just assume it's for our own
personal blog and we want to be able to
associate a mood with every blog post so
for example I'm writing a blog post and
I want to specify I'm you know I was
writing that when I was happy when I was
sad when I was depressed or whatever and
we also were going to assume that we
cannot use categories or tag
for this particular functionality
perhaps they're already being used in
some other way and we don't have access
to them so the first thing we're going
to do is we're going to open up our
functions.php file I'm going to go all
the way down to the bottom we're
actually going to create this taxonomy
so the way WordPress handles this is it
wants us to create a hook which uses the
add function or add action function like
so and this hook will hook into
WordPress and allow us to run additional
code so we want this hook to run when
WordPress first initializes let's end it
and we want it to run the build taxonomy
function so and finally we add 0 and the
next step we're going to actually create
our function so function build taxonomy
so that sets up the basics and whenever
WordPress is initialized it's going to
call this function now within this
function we actually need to register
our taxonomy and that's done by using
the register taxonomy function and I'll
just leave it at that for the moment I'm
going to open up Firefox and I have the
register taxonomy page open within the
WordPress codex and you may want to take
a glance of this and it does a pretty
good job of explaining what this
function does and what arguments you
need to pass in so you can find this at
codex wordpress org slash function
underscore reference / reference
underscore taxonomy excuse me I've
registered under store underscore
taxonomy so I'm going to go back to Kota
and the first thing we want to do within
this register taxonomy function we want
to name by taxonomy in this case I'm
going to call mine moods we need to
associate it with particular type either
post or page or a custom post type in
this case I'm going to associate with
post and then finally for the third
argument we need to pass in array and
this is going to include some additional
details about this taxonomy we want to
make it so it's hierarchical so we can
order and group our tax on these all
right you know taxonomy items so we're
going to set that to true
we're going to include labels which I
will explain them a little bit more
detail in a minute or two I'm going to
set that equal to labels variable and
I'll come back to this as I said use
query bar we're going to set that to
true and finally be right that's going
to be true as well and I believe these
two both involve the URL and indicate
that we're going to rewrite the URL
properly I'll show you that in a little
bit so to get back to our labels I'm
going to go back to Firefox and this
register taxonomy reference and down
here about the middle of the page
somewhere there's a pretty good example
showing you how to create custom
taxonomy I'm just going to copy this
section labels and what this does let me
place this in here is this sets how this
taxonomy is named within the WordPress
admin so it sets it for example the name
just the name overall it sets its name
when it's used in a singular form just
anything within the WordPress admin so
the example that we used use genres but
i can replace all of that all these
instances of genres with moods or a mood
depending
okay so i'm going to go ahead and save
that file and believe everything looks
good here so let me go ahead and open up
firefox yeah looks like that's fine let
me go ahead admin and let's take a look
at the posts you'll notice we have a
moods item in the left-hand navigation
now so I'm going to go to that and i'm
going to set up a couple just basic
modes for us to get started with and
i'll show you how the hierarchical
function works so i'm going to order i'm
going to organize our moods into two
categories i'm going to organize it into
positive for you know positive moods and
negative moods and i'm just going to add
one item within each category here so
i'm going to add angry and I set the
parent to be negative so notice how it's
now nested underneath the negative item
and i'm going to use happy as well set
that underneath the positive okay and
now we're going to go to the post
section and edit my new post and if you
scroll down a little bit you'll notice
there is a moves item here and i'm going
to set my mood too happy let me go ahead
and update this and take a look at the
front end
so you'll notice nothing has changed
here and if you go to the single post
view doesn't look like anything has
changed here either now that's normal
I'm going to go ahead and show you next
how to display this mood within the
front end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
