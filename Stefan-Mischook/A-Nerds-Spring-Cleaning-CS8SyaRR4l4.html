web.com and killer sites calm amongst
the other sites so this is a pure video
blog and it's a commentary blog and i'm
calling it spring cleaning i'm recording
this in late mid-may 2014 so I've been
doing a lot of spring cleaning on many
levels in my life lately number one I've
been spring cleaning my house I just
took out three or four big bags of old
dishes and things in boxes have been
holding for months and more years
actually years if you haven't used
something for over a year you probably
don't need it so give it away or throw
it out or recycle it whatever you want
to do so besides the home domestic renov
a spring cleaning I'm actually been
doing some spring cleaning in terms of
Technology and my technology stuff what
do I mean by that so for instance as you
probably as you may know I'm a big
reader of Technology books I've been
doing this reading lots of books for
many many many years so what I've done
is with great reluctance I've gone into
my pretty big library of geek books and
I'm starting to filter things out and to
give you an idea well look at this this
stack here represents maybe fifteen
percent of my books are those subjects
and I and I thrown out a lot of books
are giving away a lot of books rather in
the last couple years like you have no
idea like maybe 10 times this now it's
hard for me to give them away because
strangely enough I have some sort of
emotional attachments to some of these
books of these books date back many
years and it's hard for me to let them
go because it reminds me of my youth
so also one book I'm probably never
going to throw is a creating killer
websites now I didn't write this book
Steven Yeun segala David Siegel wrote
this book but if you look on the title
killer sites calm and that's where the
site comes from I took this over I guess
in 2002 or 2001 I forget what was and I
expanded on what he established a
100-fold but nonetheless I keep this for
for the sake of you know I don't know
something I should I figure I should
keep any up with regards to the old
textbook the old tech books on PHP Java
and whatnot you'll see that a lot of the
technology though hat it has changed the
fundamentals haven't changed that much
at all in fact so you know I got this
will just randomly take a book so PHP
hacks you know it's like more of an
advanced level thing yeah things have
changed a lot but there's also a lot of
good stuff in here but you could you
could learn about the core language
stuff that's still available you know
especially the beginner stuff like you
know this book it's learning PHP nothing
in terms of beginners PHP and
intermediate PHP it's pretty much the
same stuff you know it's a minor
differences here and there but really so
it's hard for me let them go even though
I know them but it's I don't know it's
this one of those things but I think at
some point you're gonna you have to let
it go you have to move on to new things
and that brings me to my next house
cleaning so besides cleaning up my house
and cleaning up the books giving away
old books it's time to clean house in
terms of maybe expanding once again my
the range of courses in which I'm
providing so I mentioned it before I'm
slowly putting together a ruby course
and then I'm going to do a beginner's
Python course simply to mix things up to
bring in
new languages into the mix and you know
I want to practice what I preach oh I've
done in the past I've written software
in eight or nine languages over the
years but I think that everybody should
learn multiple languages so even if your
primary language is PHP it makes sense
learn a little Ruby or to learn a little
Python because it will just expand your
knowledge of programming in general it
will give you new ideas which will
ultimately end up making you a better
PHP programmer in the end that's what I
found myself my first language I believe
was javascript in 1995 I'm not sure
about that till 94 95 something like
that it was either JavaScript or pearl
anyhow so then but from there I learned
many different languages and what I
found to my surprise that with every new
programming language I learned it was
easier and easier and easier to be
comfortable to learn each language of
course and because a lot of principles
are the same and also it made me a
better programmer because I saw how a
certain group of nerds would do certain
something in in PHP for instance and how
that I would compare how they do it in
Java JSP and so on and so forth so it's
important to learn and new things and
it's important to be ready to look at
new languages our new technologies but
may compete with something you already
know so yes spring cleaning is is an
important thing to do both in your house
in your library and in your mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
