those links and we'll get to the text
and what they look like in a little bit
but for the moment what I want to now
address is the fact that inside of our
main area we have lorem ipsum text as as
h2 headline and a paragraph I'm going to
actually copy that information and paste
it directly underneath again and perhaps
what we can do is also create a h3 in
here and i'll just change what this
secondary title says perhaps i'll just
say a sub headline and we have pretty
much the same paragraph of information
although if you wanted it to look a
little bit differently perhaps i'll just
make it a little smaller than the
previous one if I preview this in the
browser after saving it you'll notice
that just creates a little bit longer
text I like it so I'm actually going to
create another copy of it doesn't really
matter what the text says at this point
we just want to get a sense of what it
looks like and I'll say another sub
headline save that information actually
maybe I'll even add a little bit of text
in here so that it's a bit of a longer
paragraph and i'll save that preview in
the browser and essentially we should
see that this area is longer than this
area which is just fine it's exactly
what I wanted it to be looking like good
so we've got that in place but as you
can see especially when i have my hover
state in here the text is touching
dangerously close it's actually right on
the edge and the text over here is right
on the edge too that's because there's
no margin and padding on these boxes now
one of the things that I want you to be
aware of is that we gave a definition in
our CSS for that main area we said the
width of the main was 760 now look if I
wanted to add some margin or padding
directly to the
div called main that's going to be a
problem because what CSS doesn't take
into account is the fact that you have a
width and if you add a margin it just
makes the width be larger so it'll add
an extra 10 or 20 pixels depending on
what you want so hypothetically speaking
let's take a look if I were to come in
here and say hey you know what let's put
even padding for example let's say I
want padding on the left hand side of
the main box right so if I were to say
even 10 picks ilysm actually even one
pixel will throw it off if I save this
and then preview this in my browser
again let's take a look at what happens
ooh you see that it's pushed this
actually underneath this one the reason
being is because if this is 200 and this
was 9 60 excuse me 760 that equaled 960
evenly but since I put padding of 10
here what ends up happening is that we
now have too much space it's actually
not 960 it's 970 so they don't match up
they don't meet up in the same area so
that's a problem so I'm going to ask you
to get rid of that instead what we're
going to be doing is addressing all of
our texts so that each one of these
elements of text can have the padding on
the text itself as opposed to the
padding on the box that's containing it
so if we remove the padding or the
margin on that box we don't have to
worry about our wits getting all screwed
up so instead what I'm going to be doing
is addressing how to do this inside of
the main area as well so let's think
about what main has well I'm going to
come in here with the selector called
main and I know that there is a h2 in
here that we want to be addressing as
well there is a h3 and there's also
paragraph so to all of these we are now
going to be adding some extra
information
so let's see what we can add inside here
well technically speaking I just want to
give it a little bit of padding on
either side that's for sure so let's
come in here and let's see what we can
do let's say padding on the well let's
start with the left maybe a generous
amount of 20 pixels that is a little
generous but ok for what I want to do
and I also want to be doing a padding on
the right of the same amount all right
so now that we've got that in place i'm
going to save this and if we preview in
the browser you'll see that everything's
going to smash up all nicely together
let's take a look over here we don't
actually have any information touching
the edge perfect there's 20 pixels of
padding what about over here well you
can't really see it if I don't have
anything but you will notice that
because I happen to have this
information over here that produces a
really nice value for us right you can
see that there is 20 space there what if
we wanted to include like a line going
all the way down well if I approached it
from the navigation side and put like a
border only on one side it would end
right here which might be fine might be
exactly what you want but if you want a
line that goes all the way down well
this is bigger than this area so we
would put a border on the left hand side
of this one do remember however that
whatever the size of your border happens
to be for example if it's just one pixel
then the problem being is that you're
going to have to adjust the width
because just like padding and margin
extra border information adds to the
width of the box but you know that's not
something that the browser is really
going to be able to distinguish so let's
approach that as well so I'm going to
come in here and I'm going to go back to
my element and here is main as we saw
before and let's imagine that on the
left hand side of main
I wanted to create a border so if we do
that we could say border on the left and
let's give it a color maybe something
that's a nice faint sort of gray I think
that should be just fine and if we're
happy with that on the left hand side
right now if I were to leave this and
just save it let's take a look you can
see that well nothing's really happening
and that's because we need to put some
extra information inside here so it
wasn't enough to just give it a color
we've also got to add some other things
so I've just written out border left
width is 1 pixel border left style solid
just a solid line going all the way down
the left-hand side but remember what I
told you even one pixel will turn this
off so if I come into my browser and
preview what I've just done as you'll
see in just a second you'll notice that
oops there you go you see the one pixel
browser problem that's occurring as it's
pushing it underneath so if I'm one
pixel off what do you think we have to
do yep change the size of the main area
so instead of 60 we're going to say 759
if I save this now and preview it in my
browser everything works out just fine
and there's a little separation that's
happening here you may or may not want
it to go all the way down if you don't
then you can make it be on the right
hand side of your navigation element so
right now I'm fairly happy with what I'm
seeing I don't really have a problem
with it there are some issues here
related to the top and the bottom of the
elements and the simple fact that all of
these elements actually have not a lot
of spacing going on inside them now
that's not a problem here when it comes
to my headlines and I kind of like the
amount of space or the proximity of my
text to my headlines that kind of lets
me know what's going
on but I do think we need a little bit
of extra space in the paragraphs
themselves so we could do it at the top
of the paragraph but that's going to
push it down a little bit it's really
more at the bottom of the paragraph so
that's going to take care of this area
over here as well so let's go back to
our elements and here we are in our code
view and what I want to do is as we said
main h 2 h 3 h paragraph well listen h2s
and h 3's are not going to have any
bottom margin so i'm actually going to
add another bit of information here
actually let me just copy this
information i'll paste it and it's
really only the paragraphs that i'm
addressing at this moment inside main so
if we were to say paragraphs on top and
I don't know maybe just give a little
bit of information like four pixels and
paragraph on the bottom padding so I'll
come in here and I'll say excuse me
bottom on the bottom maybe I'll give it
something like ten let's save it and
let's see what it looks like just so we
can discern exactly how this is looking
so a little bit up on top more on the
bottoms I think I actually want even
more on the bottoms just to be a little
bit more generous with what these things
look like so i'll save that and then
I'll preview it good good so you can see
that it's not touching the edge there
it's pretty much the height that I want
over here although if I wanted to I
could have said listen you know all of
these elements may in fact contain let's
say four pixels so I could do that to I
could say look I'll take away the one
that's on the padding so I'll just
remove it this way and I'll share that
overall the headlines and the padding as
well so that first headline up on top
will also have the same you'll notice
there's going to be a little bit four
pixels down here too so you see that
these things look like they belong
together because they're closer together
I've separated the bottoms of the
paragraphs even more so that makes these
things look
like they're all three solid chunks of
information very nice so great way that
you can sort of work with that can be
done with padding it can be done also
with margins if you prefer but at this
point I think we're pretty good to go
and we're pretty happy with the way
things are looking so we've got some
links in here we've also got some
elements down here let's come back in
the next video and we'll put in some
content in the footer as well as inside
the header</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
