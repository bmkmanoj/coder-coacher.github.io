downloads because I wanted to go over a
couple little things about the two
versions of Python that are out there so
as you can see here we have Python 3.5
point 2 and we have Python 2.7 12 now
effectively nerds will call this version
3 X meaning branch 3 X X meaning could
be 0.5 plus 6 point 7 or whatever and
then you get a 2 X branch could be to
point to point 1 to point 2 X n or etc
etcetera so what's the difference well
the 3 branch at this point is 3 point 5
point 2 is the most advanced branch the
most recent branch and it is the branch
that you should be working with and
that's why this course is working with
the 3x branch because all the latest
developments in Python all the new
developments in Python are going to be
in the 3x branch the 2x branch is just
kept around for people who may have some
old apps written in the 2x version of
Python and there are incompatibilities
so Python 2x is not exactly the same as
python 3x so sometimes if you take a
Python app that was written in 2x while
it could be 2 point 5 to point 7 2 point
6 whatever a lot of times they won't
work in Python 3 there are some
fundamental differences between the 3x
of Python versus the 2x so there you go
the people who look after Python they
keep Python 2.7 tip-top they don't add
anything new but they do bug fixes and
stuff like that so you're not gonna see
anything new with Python 2.7 that's it
it stops at 2x it's not going anywhere
where's Python 3 you get all the new
stuff so of course you're working with
Python you're gonna work with new Python
so I just said that so we'll stop there
so when we started this course we
installed Python 3 on your scene whether
it be Mac or PC and we're doing our work
on the 3.5 point 2 version that being
said I want to show you a couple things
in
terminal in Mac so I've launched my
terminal and Mac and the reason I'm I've
launched terminal Mac is because Mac
comes with Python 2.7 built-in so that's
kind of cool so here is the terminal
profile window now don't worry you don't
have to have Mac to follow along I am
just want to show you a couple of quick
things so I'm going to launch the
terminal window I use the the grass
I don't like the grass every I'm gonna
use this one here so may just make the
text bigger so this is something called
bash is basically the text interface the
way you can talk to the Mac OS directly
so I'm going to type in Python - -
version and what this is gonna do is I'm
basically asking Mac what version of
Python do you have installed so I hit
enter and the default version as you can
see is two point seven point one so
that's the default version so if I want
to go into the default version of Python
I was just inside of Mac's bash window
you see bash here don't worry if you're
using Windows as a point of this don't
worry about so I'm just gonna go into
Python see see I've launched Python and
I'm in Python 2.7 point 1 oh that's cool
now we can start writing Python commands
I can say name equals it's a variable
you don't know what that is
don't worry check it out of course I got
name so now I could say print which is a
command in Python or so they put the
name notice repent and name and it
prints out the names to find I also just
print some technical print and I say
prints the fan is a nerd and stuff I was
in there so there we go
Python 2.7 0.10 notice the print command
print name excetera eccentric cetera so
now I'm going to exit out of this see
I'm outside of Python now so what I want
to do is I want to go into Python 3 if
you remember at the beginning of the
video at the beginning of the course
rather I installed Python 3 so I'm gonna
just type in the command Python 3 and
this tells Mac OS within this window
here to start using python 3 point 5
point 2 now you might be using 5
five on 3.6 3.7 who knows this python is
a June 2016 Python so anyway so we're
gonna go back here I'm gonna type in
Dulce if I'm gonna create that variable
equals name I say still on so it's in
there now watch me watch what I do I
want to do it just like what we did with
Python 2.7 print name watch what happens
boom I get an error I'm sorry try dot
and says file error on line 1 this is
line 1 and it shows me where to error
was blue arrow points up here so at the
end so it says syntax error meaning
error my code missing parentheses in the
call to print call to print what do you
mean by that well I was using the print
command built into Python and I was
calling it if you recall when you use a
command and use a function in Python and
other programming languages nerds will
say you're calling that function just
like you're ordering a pizza you're
calling the pizza guy to bring you a
pizza in the case of Python you're
calling Python and say print out
whatever's in the name variable so that
doesn't work so let's try and do it
properly in Python 3 style so I'm gonna
print there doesn't have to be gonna be
spaced on the face spaced and I'm gonna
say well let me try that again
yeah print parenthesis and as they print
me that name variable boom it works
same thing with text print you gotta use
parentheses boom just a fan here mm-hmm
the fan eats pizza well as much as I
used to that's why I've lost a lot of
weight do you want to lose weight hole
comes down to how you eat more than
anything else prints pizza it works so
there you go there is the difference
between laws one of the differences
between Python and 72.7 rather and 3.5
or more importantly it's the 2x branch
of python versus the 3x branch of python
whether it be two point six two point
seven two point eight pretty much the
same and whether it be three point one
three point two point three point three
excetera pretty much the same when you
see 0.2 0.5
every whatever's after the mean branch
it's usually just bug fixes minor
changes but there is definitely a big
difference between Python 3 and Python 2
you will find old apps out there that
are still written in Python 2 that's why
I wanted you to be aware of that
although all your new app should be in
Python 3 so you can take advantage of
all the latest and greatest features of
Python 3 let's remember with python 2
they maintain it
meaning the correcting little bugs that
pop up but they're not making any
additions to it or updating it so keep
that in mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
