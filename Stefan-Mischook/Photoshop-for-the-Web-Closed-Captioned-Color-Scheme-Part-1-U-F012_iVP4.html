little bit about how we'll be looking at
making this particular design if you've
been saving along with us we are at the
stage where we've set out our type
rulers and we've got all of our rulers
and guides in place and those guides are
set up for a prime optimization of a
1024 x 768 fixed pixel design and that
design is going to look something like
this we're going to slice these elements
up we're going to bring them inside of
Dreamweaver and assemble ourselves a
nice working website another thing that
I do want to talk about before we get to
discussing our design because that's
part and parcel what we're trying to do
here is take the design skills and
fundamentals we learned in our articles
and apply them here in this simple yet
effective type layout so one of the
things about this particular design that
you may or may not notice is the color
scheme and this color scheme is
decidedly different than the one that I
just had open recently let me just open
that for you again as you can see the
background color is white it's just the
default color that we had going so where
did these other colors come from just
pick them off the top of your head well
some of us can in fact look at colors
and pick out colors effectively but if
you are very new to this and you're not
really accustomed to working with color
schemes one of the things I can suggest
to you to do is to go to a website
called Adobe cooler or cooler dot adobe
excuse me and the one thing some people
will pronounce it color kul ER let's
just switch over to firefox for a second
and in firefox here i am at the k u lar
color or cooler website and as you can
see if you wish to get in here well
quite literally just a google search for
kul er is fine but if you put in the
address its kul er adobe com so this is
small little application that's put
together by the people at Adobe and
what's nice about this is that it's not
just merely a receptacle for different
color schemes as you can see here
there's a few that are being showcased
and some of them as actually all of them
have names and if you look over there's
a star rating system people like them
most popular and as you can see here you
can browse through all kinds of
different color schemes and as they call
them here themes you can look at the
most recent ones you can look at the
most popular ones most downloaded yes
that's correct what you can do inside of
this environment is to actually be able
to download and use these different
schemes so for example if you did like
this sea Wolf's game which is a very
nice color scheme you could download it
but in order to do so you would need to
sign in with your Adobe website address
or you would be able to register so if
you don't have an Adobe ID you can
register here to get one and if you do
have one an Adobe ID you can just go
into this and sign in now when you do
sign in you'll see that there are more
options available to you and I'll do
that in a second just to show you what I
mean but even if you're not signed in
here's something that you can do with
this particular application let's take a
look if we click on this button we will
be able to view this color scheme inside
of this window that we have here now as
you'll notice each of the colors are
represented down here by slider bars and
right now they're all selected to have
RGB colour and the RGB colors are great
because those are colors that will use
specifically with any computer screen or
monitor but notice that there's also
hexadecimal colors and hexadecimal
values are quite literally just the same
value as any RGB value or hue saturation
and value or CMYK but that's generally
something that you'd be using if you're
dealing with the print industry here if
we're dealing with screen based stuff
its RGB and if we're going to be
utilizing these inside of our Photoshop
designs you can just use this
hexadecimal representation right here so
for example if I wanted to use this
particular color scheme and I'm not
registered or signed-in and I just want
to come in here and copy this color you
can right click and you can say copy
that hexadecimal number you can then
jump to photo shop on a Mac that's
command tab nice shortcut or on a PC you
can do the same thing just by pressing
alt tab so as you can see here I'll just
switch over to photoshop and if i was in
my type layout here there's a couple of
things that you can do what i would
suggest if you're just copying this in
this fashion you could just come in here
and you could paste in the information
that you want to have available to you
right here however there's one thing
that I've found is that you might have
some difficulties at any given
opportunity to do that so you know you
can copy it here as you can see but
might give you some grief if you're
attempting to paste it command V or ctrl
V or paste it here if that doesn't work
then you might have to resort to just
remembering the numbers and switching
them over so 37 for 140 can turn into 37
for 140 over here as well and as you can
see now we've got this darker color a
couple of things you can do like number
one I can come over here and grab my
paint bucket just drop it in bang you've
got this great new color it's not white
it's something that you can use what i
would suggest you do is to add this new
color to your swatch palette here so as
you can see I've got this new color as
my foreground color because it's
selected as such we do in fact are able
to create a new color here you could
also double click it when you double
click it you
and rename it and do all kinds of things
to it one of the other things that you
probably may or may not be aware of is
that you can delete some of these
swatches for example here are my
swatches I don't need all of these basic
ones so what can I do well do I have to
grab them one at a time well that would
be really time consuming can I
shift-click them as I can inside of
Illustrator well you could try but won't
work one of the things you can do then
is to say replace swatches but that
would be if you had other swatches that
you could work with now there are plenty
of swatches here in Photoshop for you to
choose from which are great but I'm
showing you what's happening on the
color or cooler website and one of the
things that I can do is to download and
load one of those swatch sort of pallets
inside of these so you can replace
swatches do you want to save the current
swatches before replacing them you could
say don't save and now you could go
about picking those colors well I don't
have one downloaded just yet so we'll
have to wait until doing that but what I
would suggest you do is try to delete
colors if you can and when you do delete
those colors you'll have a much cleaner
palette to work with and I'll show you
that in just a second as we take a look
at the colors a little bit more closely
