calm I'm filming this in in my place
here my own loft so it's a little bit
does it look so office he like but I
hope you can bear with it I wanted to
put this video together quickly because
something just came up and it's about
controllers as in model view controllers
I want to briefly discuss something
about controllers i think that is
overlooked a lot of times something i
had to discover through trial error
myself so the focus of this video is
what exactly is the controller use for
and what do you do with the controller
at the end of the project so how do i
start this this is what it is well back
up two steps one of the Holy Grails of
object-oriented programming irregardless
of the language Java PHP ActionScript
whatever one of the Holy Grails is code
reuse the idea is that you write your
code you rate your objects and then one
project and then you can pour them to
other projects and over time you
developed as nice library of objects and
you know you make your clients a bunny
so how does this have to deal with
controllers so in the embassy frame when
we got the model which is all your
business logic rake of your data access
stuff it can be all the business logic
like in a gambling application you have
your in your modeling at how the classes
you have the objects you would have the
objects that dictate how the layout of
different games work and so on and
different rules of the games and on the
other end of the spectrum you have your
model I don't know if this isn't frame
you got your motto and you got your view
the view of course is what people see
right it's the skins in the PHP world
that of course would be the HTML pages
or ex HTML pages are your flash movies
or Silverlight movies I guess if you
want any strange guy who's doing the
Silverlight stuff but anyway so you got
your model or your business logic
data access stuff and the other end the
spectrum you get the view and sitting in
between is the controller the controller
is the broker the controller coordinates
the communication between the view and
the model and so simple enough fair
enough let's get back to reuse again
holy grail of object or a programming is
reuse the thing that I was struggling
with way back in the jab my java days i
was looking at the controller and i was
always trying to create reusable
controller code and that was a mistake
nobody ever told me this I didn't they
couldn't find in any books at the time I
still haven't seen it any books so I'm
going to spell it out right here the
controller is the throwaway component in
the MVC Trinity is the throwaway
conceptual component or layer in that
Trinity you should not be worried about
trying to create modular abstracted code
in your controller controller is
specific to the application model yes
view yes controller no that's the point
of this video controller is a throwaway
component so don't go swing over that a
final note in leaving this video to
create reusable components that you can
take outside of project a and move it
into project B and C and so forth my
only tip to you is you want to try to
keep your objects as simple as possible
as simple as possible if you do that you
will be able to create reusable
components and I did and in my last
years as a active Java programmer he
became exceptionally exceptionally
useful to me and prof
to me because I had this layer of
components that created over the years
in various projects and because they
were simple and to a point i was able to
reuse them all quite a bit in other
projects to reiterate point of this
video in MVC model view controller the
controller component that middle layer
that brokering layer but cute that
creates to the line communication
between the view and the model that's
the Collatz layer that you can not worry
about in terms of creating something
that's reusable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
