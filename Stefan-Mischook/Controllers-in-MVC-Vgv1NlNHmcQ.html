calm I'm filming this in in my place
here my own loft so it's a little bit
does it look so office II like but I
hope you can bear with it I wanted to
put this video together quickly because
something just came up and it's about
controllers as in model view controllers
I want to briefly discuss something
about controllers that I think that is
overlooked a lot of times something I
had to discover through trial and error
myself so the focus of this video is
what exactly is the controller used for
and what do you do with the controller
at the end of the project so how do I
start this this is what it is well back
up two steps one of the Holy Grails of
object-oriented programming irregardless
of the language Java PHP ActionScript
whatever one of the Holy Grails is code
reuse the idea is that you write your
code you write your objects and then one
project and then you can pour them to
other projects and over time you develop
this nice library of objects and you
know you make all clients a bunny so how
does this have to deal with controllers
so in the NDC framework we got the model
which is all your business logic right
of your data access stuff it could be
all the business logic like in a
gambling application you would have your
in your model you'd have the classes you
have the objects you would have the
objects that dictate how the you know
the different games work and so on and
the different rules of the games and
then the other end of the spectrum you
have your model I don't know if this
isn't frame you got your motto and you
got your view the view of course is what
people see right it's the skins in the
PHP world that of course would be the
HTML pages or XHTML pages are your Flash
movies or Silverlight movies I guess if
you don't want any strange guy who's
doing the Silverlight stuff but anyway
so you got your motto or your business
logic
data access stuff and the other end the
spectrum you got the view and sitting in
between is the controller the controller
is the broker the controller coordinates
the communication between the view and
the model and so simple enough fair
enough let's get back to reuse again the
holy grail of object or a programming is
reuse the thing that I was struggling
with way back in the jab my java days I
was looking at the controller and I was
always trying to create reusable
controller code and that was a mistake
nobody ever told me this I didn't they
couldn't find in any books at the time I
still haven't seen it any books so I'm
gonna spell it out right here
the controller is the throw away
component in the MVC Trinity is the
throw away conceptual component or layer
in that Trinity you should not be
worried about trying to create modular
abstracted code in your controller
controller specific to the application
model yes view yes controller no that's
the point of this video the controller
is a throw away component so don't don't
spit over that a final note in leaving
this video to create reusable components
that you can take it outside a project a
and move it into project B and C and so
forth my only tip to you is you want to
try to keep your objects as simple as
possible as simple as possible if you do
that you will be able to create reusable
components and I did and in my last
years as a active Java programmer he
became exceptionally exceptionally
useful to me and profitable to me
because I had this layer of components
that I created
the years in various projects and
because they were simple and to a point
I was able to reuse them all quite a bit
in other projects to reiterate point of
this video in MVC Model View controller
the controller component that middle
layer that brokering layer but cube that
creates the the line the communication
between the view and the model that's
the Collatz layer that you can not worry
about in terms of creating something
that's reusable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
