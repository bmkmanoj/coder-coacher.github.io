going to talk about what it's like to
write a book so some of you may know
that I wrote a book in 2015 why I
actually wrote in two thousand fourteen
and fifteen was published in 2015 and it
did Marley well and to book on beginners
web design five star reviews on Amazon
shameless plug anyhow so what's it right
like what's it like to write a book it's
a very regimented process and it
requires a lot of discipline because
when you are writing a book you're going
to be working with one primary editor if
you're writing a tech book you're going
to have a secondary editor of course the
secondary editors involvement is less
they just check the seeds of the
secondary literature is a technical
editor I'm there will they will check to
see whether or not the code what you're
saying actually makes sense and then you
will probably have a graphic designer
but you'll be working with as well to
create you know a fancy the graphics
semi fancy but I know they did some
pretty good jobs with some of the
graphics in here and so yeah anyway so
you're going to have at least a few
people you're going to be working with
to to produce the book now beyond that
when you are writing a book for print
because the way books are printed and
have to be bound like they're bound like
here bound they have to be written in a
certain structure you have to have even
number of pages in the in the topic so
if you started a topic they have to
start on an even number page and end I
believe was on odd number page so I
couldn't have a subject covered in five
pages at to be six pages eight pages or
ten pages that kind of thing so what
this kind of does not it kind of what it
does is it enforces a very strong
discipline in terms
writing you have to sort of fit it into
that structure the problem and the
criticism I have with that is that then
because of that situation because you
have to fall within a structure but
satisfy is printing you're letting the
structure of the book the printing of
the book dictate the content so you're
not as free not nearly as free in terms
of how you write and what you write in
the subjects you cover and how you cover
a subject as you would be in a digital
book or a vlog for instance or a blog
rather so that's not cool but on the
other hand having that discipline forces
you to be very controlled and very
specific in your writing and i took this
book gig in 2014-2015 2014-15 excuse me
because of two reasons a because i want
to re-establish myself out there in
industry be i want to enforce that
discipline because i was getting ready I
was prepping for my new courses for
studio web so long to make sure I had
everything tip-top up to shape and I
wanted to be sure that everything was
very very precise and controlled so by
reading a book it forced me disciplined
me beyond what I would have done
otherwise to really structure all my
information properly so in this book i'm
teaching html5 css3 a little JavaScript
and teaching a little bootstrap Lord
jquery the basics the idea is that get
somebody up and running in terms of
building websites and it's also start up
web apps of course so yeah writing a
book is very involved it took months to
write it I was actually rude bad back
pains I hadn't been exercising property
at the time and so I was like writing my
book with my laptop while laying on my
back on the floor a lot so it was it was
a book Roth in pain so it was quite the
process but nonetheless I'm happy I did
it it really disciplined me and allowed
me to see how it was to really write my
own book
back front to back I had participated in
like a chapter two in other books I've
written lots of times for print
magazines and so on web designer
magazine amongst others but I never
written my own book myself from front to
back so it's kind of cool that way do
you make a lot of money writing a book
ninety-nine percent of books sell less
than 50 copies ninety-nine percent of
books published sell less than 50 50 50
copies now tech books have a built-in
audience so they sell bit more and I'm
well within the average last time i
checked i think is so like you think
they so like eight thousand copies or
something like that you know maybe
10,000 I forget now exactly but that's
fine I wrote this book to be fairly
evergreen what does that mean that means
that it will the content will be good
for several years now this is something
you wouldn't have been able to do five
six seven years ago or what were before
because the technologies was evolving so
quickly but now web tech html5 css3
javascript the things that are right
about there pretty static they're pretty
stable now because technology is stable
so this book i'm very very certain in
four years from now will be very very
good because because the fact that the
technology is pretty stable what i
recommend writing a book i would if you
have the time to do it and don't expect
to make much money out of it i made some
money on it but not a huge amount i did
it again for reasons not better not
monetary and for those reasons alone I
would have done it what I do another
book maybe in the future I'm much more
concerned now continue to develop studio
web to make it even better we just
released to do web three which is more
of a behind-the-scenes update to the
system quite nice and I have lots of
things I want to implement for version
3.2 and three point
23 a studio web that hopefully will come
out within the next six months but
anyway that's what my focus is writing a
book kind of cool very disciplined
forces you to write in a disciplined
manner but that's very good sometimes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
