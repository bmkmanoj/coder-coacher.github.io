March no not March May excuse me so I
woke up at around 4:30 this morning
because I went to bed really early
not because of french fries and salad
again just because I just fell asleep
and you know that I always find myself
so much more energized when I wake up
early in the morning now of course
getting up at 4:00 in the morning 4:30
Moi's a little silly but it's also a
very quiet time in the city so I'm able
to get a lot more work done so I was
able to record another three or four
more videos for the Python course and so
I'll be adding them editing them later
today so it's fast becoming a done
project in terms of the basic courses
all the videos and stuff and I would I
think I'm going to be doing with that is
to release kind of like a pre release if
you will for people who want to get into
it because it's really good now by the
way you know I've been creating these
type of courses since 2003 I'm pretty
good at putting together it at this
point you do something you do anything
for what 14 years over 14 years
you know you get pretty good at it after
you know 14 years anyhow so I think I
will be putting it out and really soon
maybe next week it won't be its final
final form but you're still going to
learn so much from it and yeah so I
might be putting it out because a lot of
people want to want to get their hands
on this course they want to get going so
that is that is do so it's now Saturday
so yeah
looking like it's cool up there from
Montreal we're especially for this time
of year but looks like it's going to be
a sunny day and I think I'm going to go
out and get myself a coffee so yeah this
is a this is one of my rare official
vlogs I don't know if I've any subject
in particular any lesson in particular
to discuss well something I was reading
about I find interesting Bill Gates and
Zuckerberg have been talking about two
things number one they've been talking
about AI and robotics and how that's you
know in the future and so on and I would
tend to agree with that they're also
talking about how if so many jobs that
would be lost and people are going to
have to adjust for that and the
government is going to have to adjust
for that because you can see tens and
tens of millions of jobs are going to be
lost in that they're not coming back and
I don't think there's got to be jobs to
retrain to so that being said if you get
into programming you get into whatever
language and so forth that's a huge
that's not going to go away anytime soon
ai it's going to K I am on a long long
time to get there although the type of
programming is going to shift you know I
remember back in the 1990s there was a
big market for small business apps for
small business
so VB developers I don't know if you
guys are aware of Microsoft Visual Basic
which was basically Microsoft's rapid
rad rapid application development
environment I was called rad for
building apps for Windows now back in
the days and windows apps were were it
was at that's what you needed to do is
wanted to do there's plenty of business
for small developers just to build apps
for companies using VB and it was
largely a drag-and-drop GUI type of
environment and then you would stitch it
together with snippets of code
and it was quite effective for building
apps on Windows when you want to build
apps for Windows only VP was a way to go
especially for most apps now this is
old-school stuff you would never do this
today
the reason I bring this all up is
because things have changed quite a bit
you won't do this VB is all but dead now
just legacy stuff is imagined on VB you
don't hear anything about it you don't
want to go there so but programming
skills that you develop back in those
days using VP you know you have to learn
a few new things but the fact that
matter is you got you had a lot of if
you did a lot of VB coding for you to
jump into modern day coding there
wouldn't be such a huge hassle for you
rather than starting from scratch so
this brings me back to a broader
question people ask learn this language
should I learn that language I've done
many videos on it and I think the
overall message I'm always trying to
convey is that you shouldn't be so
concerned about the language because
whichever language you've learned you're
going to be able to apply those skills
at any any other language it's really
you know because they're so similar
visas now let's say you should go back
and learn v be able to do that because
the paradigm is so different from where
it is now but let's talk today with the
unit PHP or Python or Java or C sharp or
swift or Ruby you know if you find you
learn X language and you learn Swift and
you find that nobody's developing iOS
apps with native languages any more I'll
move into the web well we're gonna move
in a web won't be such a big deal
never I mean so I would be too scared
about that anyway python is an AI and
machine learning is what I would be
looking into these days if you're
thinking long term and big projects but
again PHP for web app development for
WordPress development small business
development that's also big - a lot of
work there a lot of legacy people have
tons of business
WordPress sites and they don't want to
take them down I'm going to need
WordPress people to help maintain them
and stuff so so much work in so many
different areas you can't go wrong
learning to code regardless of the
language
anyway went off on a tangent there same
ol message right same old message really
I've been talking about for a long time
there are certain principles I picked up
a long time ago and they are true today
as they were true back then and it will
be true tomorrow anyway that's it I'm
off to get my bagel my coffee it's my
daily habit my daily habit I know I cost
me five bucks a day so it's actually a
pretty cheap habit and there are a lot
more expensive habits that I'm glad I
don't have any inclination towards so
yeah I'll stick to my bagel in my coffee
all right I'm off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
