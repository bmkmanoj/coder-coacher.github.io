buttons and their specific events like
on press on rollover and different ones
like that we'll also explore now how
callback functions can be associated
with movie clips movie clips which have
their own set of event handlers the most
common one which we are going to explore
right now is something called on enter
frame so in order to get this working
first and foremost let's number one
create a MC movie clip layer and on this
particular layer I'm gonna use the
polystar tool and I'm gonna choose the
options star make a nice 5 sart it's
decided star I'll give it a different
color on the fill and here let's even
increase this so what I'm going to be
doing with this particular star and why
I'm using a star in general is because
we're eventually going to be doing some
rotation on this object and we'd like to
have it rotate and like to have it show
that it's rotation and circles just
won't do that so I make the object I
completely selected by pressing f8 I
will convert it into a movie clip which
I will name star the same time I'm going
to go into the property window and give
this an instance name of star 1
underscore MC so with that done we can
now see that I'm going to create an
action scripting layer now just as we
did in the past we created all of our
callback functions for buttons on the
action scripting layer however now what
we're going to do is to put these
actions on frame number 1 and we're
going to associate that with a movie
clip instead so first thing let me
target that movie clip by pressing this
button here and when we insert a target
path as you can see we can say star 1 MC
but since this is on the timeline I
really just need the name star 1 MC put
a dot after it and notice this because
it has the suffix MC when we add that
period right after the name it shows us
everything that we can associate with a
movie
some of these you'll notice have events
that are related to buttons for example
there's things like hold on let's see on
mouse down on Mouse on press on release
these are the ones I'm looking for on
roll out on rollover those are all
familiar for those of you who've done
events with buttons however a very
common one here is on Enter frame and
the way an on enter frame script works
is something like this you'll notice
that when you only have one frame
available on the flash movie and if for
example that frame had a stop action on
it it's not actually stopping this read
reading head on that frame what's
actually happening is that reading head
is continuously entering that particular
frame it's not going backwards it's not
going forwards it's just constantly
entering this one frame so it's not
really stopped it's continuously moving
but it's entering this frame
continuously how many times does it
enter this frame well that's all
associated with the frame per second
rate one of the drawbacks of working
with on enter frame is that you're tied
to the frame per second rate however
that can be an advantage as well in the
most part as we're gonna see in this
very simple example it'll serve our
purposes quite nicely so you'll notice
if I leave this at 12 frames per second
this on enter frame script will happen
12 times in one second so in other words
every time we enter into this frame
executes a function which we are going
to see inside this callback function
right now so like any other callback
function we'll say equals function open
and closed curly brackets and we'll get
that happening now if I want to refer to
this particular movie clip star 1 MC I
could certainly come here and say go to
the root level find me star 1 MC but
since we are defining this on interframe
script for the star 1 MC movie already
all I have to do is refer to it by
saying this this mean this movie star 1
MC
right what do you want to do to it well
I could say something as easily as
underscore X in other words I want this
movie star 1 mcs underscore X position
to be equal to whatever this movies
underscore X position is now plus 10 so
what this is doing is as you can see if
I press ctrl return or command return on
the Mac it's actually moving my object
across the stage how exactly does that
work well let's consider this I'll put
this at position 0 on my stage right up
here and you'll notice what I'm actually
asking it to do is this on enter frame
move the position the exposition of this
movie and make it be equal to whatever
the x position is now plus 10 so if we
start at 0 it'll move to 10 on the next
iteration of this loop it'll say
whatever the x position is now 10 plus
10 so it becomes 20 and then again
whatever it is now 20 plus 10 so it
becomes 30 so as you'll notice that's
what causes this object to move across
the stage and look ma no tween there's
no tweening happening in here we're
using ActionScript to move this object
across the stage so as you can see that
makes it very very easy to work with
something that you should also be aware
of with on enter frames there's
something called update after event now
it might not seem all that important
right now but what this is actually
doing is allowing us to make sure that
whatever script is inside the on enter
frame it happens before we go through
this loop once again now you don't
always see this but sometimes it's good
to have it here just in case so as you
can see update after event is a really
nice way to do this so if I were to
be this information let's push this even
further and if we were to say make this
movies y-position
be also moving you'll notice that x and
y at the same time are making movements
so that's a great way to do that however
let me show you something else this
seems rather long this x position is
equal to this x position plus 10 there
is a short way of writing this so notice
I'll just comment that out and I'll show
you the shorthand version of writing
this all we have to say is this movie
dot underscore X position plus equals 10
and that's exactly the same information
and created to do exactly the same thing
so as you can see that's another nice
way of doing it let's try this let's
move to rotation if we say underscore
rotation plus equals 10
well flash is smart enough to know that
this 10 because we're referring to
rotation actually means 10 degrees of
rotation so let's try that again
and you'll notice that it's moving
around also just to prove to you that
the frame per second rate is tied to the
on enter frame if I double click this
frame per second rate and change it to
something like 30 now check out the
speed on this thing that moves much much
more quickly by the way you'll also
notice that my center point for this
movie is right in the middle and if
yours is not if it's up here you'll get
a rotation that looks much different
than the one that you're seeing on my
screen nevertheless as you can see here
that shows you a lot of possibilities
one last thing I'm going to create be a
button layer and I'm going to create a
button on this layer and what this
button is going to do is actually turn
off my on enter frame rotation how do we
do that let me show you how I'll create
a button just give it the name B I'll
give it the instance name very simple b1
underscore BTN that's fine now if I go
to the ActionScript layer and we open up
our ActionScript I'm going to introduce
something here
that says b1 underscore BTN dot on press
is equal to a callback function open
closed brackets and inside this callback
function here's what I want to say go to
the root level find me star 1 MC there's
my target path and what I want to do is
to make sure first I'll put in front of
it
delete space root level star 1 MCS dot
on enter frame and I can just copy that
from here and place that right in there
so you'll notice what this is saying is
when I press this button delete whatever
the star 1 MCS on at your frame is doing
so let's take a look at this our auditor
frame is causing this object to rotate
when I press this button it stops the
rotation so that's a little bit about
event handlers specifically related to
movie clips there are a few more out
there and you'll be able to access these
simply by looking in your ActionScript
toolbox and you'll see what all the
different events are and how they work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
