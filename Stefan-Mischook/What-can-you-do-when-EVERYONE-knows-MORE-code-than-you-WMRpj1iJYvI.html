emails alright so I have a bunch of
emails long messages sent to me from the
youtubes so I figure I do a little Nate
late-night vlog Steph answers emails
alright let's get to it
okay you know I'm not gonna read this
whole thing because it's pretty long
this is basically a guy who's been
struggling really badly badly from
imposter syndrome holy geez impostor
syndrome there's even a Wikipedia entry
I feel like everyone at my job is better
than me at programming which is not
necessarily a bad thing but it just
makes it difficult to have any
confidence in the decisions that I
sometimes need to take my question is
did you ever felt this way is this
normal within the program community or
is this because I don't have a formal
background there's no colder in the
world knows everything they have their
specialties there might be a particular
area where they've just finished a
project working on it for months and or
a year and they know like the back of
her hand so if they're doing just that
they'll be really good at it so for
example when I was actively involved in
some really high level database work
back in the day I started going deep
deep into database theory normalizations
and optimizations and in terms of
indexes it all kinds it and went really
deep this is like what I just mention is
kind of superficial but I went really
deep into the whole database theory and
design and my level of knowledge became
extreme for a while it's been years
since that time and I have to tell you I
can tell you right now I forget just
about all of it I would I would remember
it pretty quickly once I just got back
into the saddle again but the point is
you may feel intimidated because you're
running into people who are working
right now their hands are dirty and that
kind of code so to them it's very fresh
and so if you haven't been working with
that type of coding at that particular
moment or awhile or ever you feel a
little nervous whoo I don't know I don't
know what I'm doing these guys really
know what to do and they really know
what they're doing cuz we're working on
that
now the other thing to consider is that
once you have your core whatever your
basics in terms of programming is
concerned it's something I talk about
all the time like the stress all the
time you can just learn whatever you
need to learn depending on the job at
hand so I wouldn't care too much I
wouldn't be so concerned about the fact
you may not be aware of a particular
library now or but if you're a language
now and if you're nervous about a
decision you have to make in terms of
the coding which actually they don't
have to do just do a little bit of
research on it do a little research on
it Google is powerful if you know your
core you know your basics you'll be able
to answer those basic questions do the
research and then if you're still
feeling nervous present what you've
found and go see your colleagues which
is normal and software developed a I'm
thinking of doing this this is solution
I suggested what do you think that's it
and see what to say and they may come up
better ideas they may go that's cool
they may go I don't know I'm not doing
this right now and just go from there at
the end of the day which great thing
about being a software developer is that
your code will work or it doesn't work
right it works or doesn't work and you
know as long as the code is clean and
simple easy to update which is pretty
obvious self evidence right you'll be ok
so yeah just just keep working through
it follow those two steps as I suggested
and you should be fine but any any
psychological misgivings any
psychological emotional hang-ups if you
will not that this is major it's a minor
thing really don't worry it's gonna work
through it through repetition and the
more you give yourself a chance to do
work the more you give yourself your
chance to complete projects and to work
on projects and solve them the more your
confidence will grow right repetition
all right what's the next one hi Steph
hope you have a good day question is
there a high level gaming language that
you would recommend
I think I don't do much game I haven't
done any game programming except for
basic stuff so I would suggest that you
look at a c-sharp and how it's used in
the unity gaming engine so you may want
to look at that you want to look at that
Unreal Engine apparently works with mono
which you could use c-sharp that is what
I would take a look at c-sharp game
engine and see how that is again this is
not my Forte's not my strength so that's
a good place to start you can't say the
other guy says I'm currently doing my
comps I second year at I won't say to
school and I hate it I hate it because
of the system around that I feel like
it's a waste of time and money but at
the same time I'm ready I'm already in
the second year took a break last year
to work on my own projects similar to X
Y Zed we'll get into it but you have to
shut it down I'm back this year but I
still feel this wave should I drop out
and learn programming myself I consider
myself a fast learner
so No so how do I do it however what
about not having a degree how badly does
that affect me I love programming okay
you need a degree if you plan on getting
into the type of programming where
you're gonna be working for large
organizations that have HR departments
human resources department and if they
do then they're gonna have sort of set
criteria where only extreme experience
can get around
that's a criteria what's that say
criteria big companies means they want
people with calm side degrees or some
sort of degree so your second year into
it was it four years three and a half
four year to pay how many courses you
take on it's been a while if you're
going into debt for tens and tens of
thousands and you think you're just
going to be doing stuff on your own or
working for small businesses or startups
or they don't really care about degrees
as much then I would say don't go into
tens and tens of thousands into debt
because student loan debt is the worst
possible that you can get because it's
non dischargeable non dischargeable in
the US and Canada to where non
dischargeable debt means even if you go
bankrupt you still have that debt
you're around your neckk student loan
debt is that that you avoid at all cost
so if you tell me your fuel you're not
getting out of anything out of
university you're going into debt you've
got another two three years and about
another thirty forty thousand 50
thousand debt you think you might just
do your own thing because you said you
tried to do your own thing available
normal right your try project fails and
harm I try project fails if you're
looking to get into freelance or build
your own projects and you know you have
you absolutely don't need a degree at
all has no no advantage but on the other
hand if you think you might want to go
work for a large organization then you
would probably need a degree so you have
to look at those two issues one thing
you can do is you could always go back
right you could always go back for me
I left University in my second year
because my business started to take off
that was one of the reasons and I
couldn't do two things at the same time
but of course my business was taking off
and in those days the amount of debt you
you could have crew in the university
was minimal it's like the cost for up
here in Canada cost universities nothing
it's like a few thousand bucks a year so
that was another issue as well it's not
like I was going to go into big debt at
any rate I had to Paul I had to make the
choice whether to go into business
because it was growing or do my career
or finish my degree and I decided to go
into business and I figured that one day
I'll go back and get back into
university let me tell you once you get
out there and you sort of leave school
the chance of you going back and
completing it it becomes much more
difficult much more difficult because
you sort of left holes I'm learning and
university stage of your life of course
if you're successful then you don't need
to go back right yeah I never went back
hi Stefan I'm a freshman in college
looking in multi-platform software
development be looking in a
multi-platform software development
major okay you see that's what he's
taking the college strongly focuses on
C++ and Java it will also touch base on
basic HTML and JavaScript and greatly
enjoying the courses I'm hoping to do
software development possibly someday
game development
what suggested languages should I
attempt to learn on the side to see more
appealing for jobs
depends on the type of program you want
to do so if you want to do game
development then I would pick languages
that are used a lot in game development
now it depends what type of game
development that you want to do if you
want to build engines and so forth
looking at C++ if you may want to look
at the Unity engine and c-sharp what I
would do is I will look around at the
job market right now in terms of gave
developers if that's what you want to do
and look at the job market and then look
at the requirements look what they're
the type of programmers are looking for
and that will tell you exactly what
language is which which frameworks you
need to learn and then what you could do
is on the side you can learn that so one
option again you have to check might be
C sharp with the Unity engine or no
maybe it's just diving deeper into C++
if you want to get into low-level game
engine building lifters work for that
and then start writing that kind of C++
code that's my best advice in terms of
terms for your question all right
there's a bunch of other questions but
yeah I think I won't answer those
oh wait that's pretty much it I yeah
much more to come I've been checking off
a lot of the check boxes taking care of
a lot of work so time is freeing up for
more of these type of vlogs
