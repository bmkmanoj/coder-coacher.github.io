learn about one of the most important
things in the PHP language something
called PHP sessions
so what exactly are PHP sessions
essentially a PHP session is a mechanism
built into the language that allows you
to track information about a particular
user visiting your PHP pages
so what exactly does that mean that
means that the web is stateless meaning
that stateless is a nerd term that you
see in dynamic web page programming it's
usually quite have been many different
languages well web web programming
languages that is and what it describes
is that the Internet the web rather is
designed in such a way that there's no
continuous communication between the
user the client computer and the server
computer there's no way for the server
to know whether or not the client making
a request for particular page has made a
request for another page before I hope
this is making sense to you guys
cuc typically when people were designing
client server programs or applications
when this when the client would make a
request for a particular document or a
particular piece of information from the
server the server automatically knew who
was making that request because there
was a continuous connection between the
client and the server if you recall in
the very first video where I described
the whole process of the server serving
our web pages and dynamic pages you'll
remember that once the server sends out
a page that's requested by some client
the server cuts off the connection so
the connection is open you open the
connection by actually clicking on the
links on when I click on this link i
open a connection i basically say send
me this page and in this case is a this
was if you look at the bottom bar here
PHP dash objects dash page 1 dot PHP so
when I click on this I'm sending a
request or server sent me this page so
the server gets this request and then
sends the page back to me say now I got
the page here I've loaded up the page
and once the page is sent the connection
between the server and the client are
closed
if you have a page like a PHP project
like a shopping cart system for instance
where you need to track what products
people are purchasing the stateless
nature of the internet or of the web
rather makes this difficult there are a
few ways that smart nerds have gotten
around this stateless nature of the web
and I'm not going to get into all the
different ways because frankly session
the session mechanism is probably the
most efficient and I think actually I'm
pretty sure about Microsoft's invented
session that could be wrong about this
but it was the first time I saw session
was with ASP active server pages which
predates PHP by a year or two I believe
anyhow sessions makes it stupid easy for
you to basically tag somebody and
session uses cookies sometimes and
that's probably the most efficient way
so it'll basically upload a cookie to a
guy's browser with an ID a unique ID but
the PHP session mechanism generates and
then whenever the same user hits another
site within your PHP site and your
tracking session you have enabled the
session mechanism PHP will know up this
guy's been here before because they'll
see the unique ID in the cookie
there are other ways of PHP sessions can
tag the user with that unique ID and
we'll get into that when we actually get
into sessions I think I've gone a little
bit too far in there details already so
let's actually get into some PHP pages
and will actually use session and very
simple way but you're also going to see
quickly how powerful PHP sessions are
and why I believe well why anybody
recognizes that PHP sessions are amongst
the you know top five most important
things in the PHP language</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
