perspective in this video I'm going to
talk about what Warren Buffett can teach
you about coding that is a title I'm
sure most of you would have never
expected if you've been watching my
videos for a while you know that I am a
big believer in universal principles
these ideas these principles that seem
to not seem to they actually impact
they're true across many different
disciplines of study so I bought a lot
of ideas for example from my martial
arts background which I did for nearly
three decades and I took those ideas and
I move those into coding and they
translated 100 percent of course when I
went into coding I only had about what
maybe 15 16 years of martial arts
experience at that point but nonetheless
the most lessons from martial arts
translated very well to coding so for
instance in martial arts you learn as
you come advanced you learn that
simplicity is what separates the good
martial arts from the great martial arts
the great martial artists are able to
execute their movements in it the most
simple and direct manner and I used to
see that in advanced martial artists
from different styles would be boxing
the couples of judo jujitsu etc etc the
most advanced people were always very
very very efficient very simple very
direct and refined in their technique
same thing with cold when you're writing
code any experienced developer will tell
you that simple code is the best code
and you want very simple clean
structures and that will make for much
better software in the end that is one
of the reasons why we have all these
frameworks these frameworks give you in
a turnkey package if you will a bunch of
code that is refined cleaned and has
been vetted by many many people
that's what
looking for so how does this tie into
Warren Buffett now what are the
principles that Warren Buffett will talk
about these days is about
diversification how he says and he's you
don't know who were Buffett is he is I
believe is the second richest man in the
world probably most successful and
consistent investor in the history well
at least what we know of the world and a
rare person indeed and he has very
specific principles that he goes by and
one of the things he tells people these
days is that you should probably not you
should probably said 99.9% of people
should be highly diversified in their
stock market picks as he is but he takes
a step further there's something in the
stock market called index funds
what are index funds they basically take
a slice of a whole bunch of company
stocks and they put them into one basket
and you buy that one basket so you don't
have to try and pick all these
individual companies because for
instance let's say you want to invest
which one should you pick Apple IBM
Microsoft Google which one should you
buy you don't know right you don't know
probably which is going to be the best
computer that's maybe it's none of these
companies maybe it's a bank maybe it's
some oil company maybe it's a Starbucks
stock who knows right even the best
stock pickers in the world data shows
and I'm a data-driven guy data shows
that these guys are they're terrible if
you bought just an index card meaning
you just blindly bought a little piece
of all these companies you can buy these
things in index funds are called ETFs
that's another way those are that's a
way of buying all these type of
investments where you buy a little piece
of many companies if you just bought ETS
of the index of
of the stock market then you can
outperform meaning you're going to do
much better than these fancy stock
pickers or we're doing constant research
and you're buying in and out of stocks
trying to pick the big winners the
stories that you hear about the guy who
invested the coupling of the girl and
does really really well because it goes
20 times these are like lottery ticket
winners typically what you hear is what
you have a person's very successful was
in the investment world and I can tell
you I've seen it and then a couple years
later they've terrible they've lost so
much money because at the end of the day
with the data shows is that the end of
the day the index always outperforms the
people are trying to stock picker I
won't get into all the details because
it's not a stock picking video anyway
back to Warren Buffett who talks about
most people should use that 19.9 session
just by index funds mean you should be
have maximum diversification in your
stock portfolio this way you can write
the up and down and you know after 20
years you're going to worry up making
much more money than people who don't do
that strategy if you're diversify this
the key is the key concept it applies
the coding if you are diversified your
chances of success increased big time so
how does this relate to coding how does
this Buffett Rule is not just Buffett
Vanguard another company and I forget
the name of the guy who founded it banco
or barcode forget snail also just pops
right out of my head so doesn't matter
with Vanguard funds again famous they
said don't buy individual stocks you
waste your money where she at time
you're going to lose rather just by
index funds again you buy a new piece of
all these companies you do much better
this is time and time again the data
shows this to be the case don't let
people trick you by the way if you're
getting into the stock market to invest
into thinking that they're going to pick
the best start for you that's a bunch of
BS so when it comes to coding I have
been talking about how lately how first
of all one thing it's universal Luva
different stocks
regardless of the programming language
you learn Java PHP Python c-sharp
JavaScript Ruby Swift you there's
opportunity in all these things and even
if you don't find work let's say you
learn Swift which is the language Apple
created for iOS development let's say
you do that but you can't value Swift
jobs that's such a big deal because once
you've learned the basics of programming
it applies to all the modern programming
languages so you don't you know can't
get any Swift work okay you spend a
month or two you jump into Java or jump
into PHP or you jump it to whatever each
other's JavaScript except you're excited
so it's not a huge deal so that being
said when you think about
diversification you got to look at the
languages in terms of which language
diversifies your ability to get a job or
to get gigs which one is the most
flexible let's look at a couple
candidates let's look at Swift we talk
about Swift iOS development now Swift
great little language by the way I like
it in of itself but the problem I have
with Swift personally when you recently
never jumped into it I played around
with it I went in there and created
basic stuff just to tinker around but I
decide to drop it because because that's
all you can do if you write swift all
you can do is write iOS apps now that
could be great a lot of people make a
lot of money building iOS apps so what
the market is heading towards it's
heading towards building mobile apps as
I've mentioned in previous videos with
html5 css3 and JavaScript I call that
the web stack why is the market going in
that direction because you can build an
app with html5 based technology which
includes those three languages but you
can also with the same codebase then
immediately flip it into an Android app
so right you can write one code base and
you can write Android and you can write
iOS that's huge right because if you
write native meaning you
in Swift for iOS or you could use
objective-c but people who use with
these days use Swift for ILS or if you
want to go Android you want to write
native Android you go to Java for
Android then if you need to write the
app for the other operating system
you've got to write two different code
bases that's a lot of work it's a lot of
work a lot of maintenance you got to get
new skills coders in there it's it's
very expensive so even the biggest
companies are world now instead of
writing native for most of the apps
can't do for all of the apps because
html5 base is not quite as fast as
native but for most apps out there you
don't need the ultra speed they're
writing the stuff in html5 technology in
the web stack because of it's so
advantageous here's the great thing
about learning html5 technology as I
said if you like if you learn just Swift
that's all you can do iOS but if you
learn html5 css3 and JavaScript ah now
you can do Android development client
cups yeah I need to develop a little
Android app for my start no problem
html5 now the class is a I'll learn to
iOS no problem most slides are going to
want both ideally no problem html5 well
what happens if you can't find any
mobile apps to develop well you can do
websites you can do WordPress based
sites you could do web apps you can jump
in to a node perhaps that you know
JavaScript down right you see with the
html5 stack it gives you a huge platform
meaning it gives you a lot of
flexibility it's like buying an ETF it
is like a Vanguard fund it gives you
that diversification of skills or access
to jobs right so learning html5 css3
javascript especially in terms of
getting work whether it be freelancer of
working persona this is the most
flexible set of skills you can get now
in
software development I by the way I
haven't mentioned it Windows 10 now
supports html5 technology for native
apps as well essentially you can write
native apps in the html5 web stack html5
css3 javascript I won't say it again
when I say html5 and talk about those
three languages
anyway Windows 10 now supports that
native as well and this is not a
surprise to me because history teaches
us in technology is that easy and open
always beats closed easy and open always
beats closed greasing example flash
closed closed technology owned by Adobe
html5 kicked it kicked its butt
why because html5 is open it early other
reasons as well flash was a security
issue and Steve Jobs in like Adobe so he
decided to kill flash at iOS when iOS
had a huge amount of power because the
iPhone was so dominant at the time and
yeah so flash again got killed
bye-bye html5 technology because it is
open another example macro answers is
Windows now neither there's free you
can't get Mac OS unless you buy an Apple
Windows and you have to pay for it it's
not exactly
expensive but here's the thing why did
Windows beat Apple in terms of market
penetration terms of desktop computers
there's several factors but one of the
big factors that Microsoft made it
really easy for developers to develop on
Windows made it very easy and then it's
spread like wildfire so the point of
this video is that you want to consider
technologies that give you maximum
flexibility in terms of the type of work
that you're going to be able to access
and a type of jobs or a variety of jobs
you can access again this is not a
discussion of the technical merits of
the html5 stack vs. Swift or native Java
this is not at all that this is about
the business end of it all and the
practicality of it all because you got
to remember it can't be one of these
nerds who just looks purely at the code
in the technology and judges from that
perspective you have to consider the
business implications the job
implications the flexibility that these
languages provide the environment around
them I remember back in the 90s a friend
of mine who was a big Delphi programmer
and he loved Delphi and Delphi used to
compete with Visual Basic and they did
pretty much the same thing but Visual
Basic smashed smashed Delphi because it
was visual basically Microsoft's
products are they able to push it
through bla bla bla bla my Delphi buddy
was saying to me yeah but Delphi so much
better oh it's so much better why are we
doing visual buddy was this all in love
with Delphi and technically yeah it had
some superior aspects to it versus
Visual Basic no kidding but there is so
much more work there's so much more
opportunity developing apps and visual
basic and so visual basic darling
for that space Delphi lost so you ask
yourself how many opportunities are
there in the html5 stack vs. Swift and
just do it iOS you have to consider that
all right I hope that was useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
