an unusual video this is the principles
of business video number two where I'm
going to give you an overview of what
you might call the three pillars of
business success or I like to say the
Venn diagram of business success or if
you like Led Zepplin the John bottom
diagram of business success so you see
we've got three circles right and so
these are three basic elements that
you're going to need if you're gonna
have the big chance of success with your
business so first thing first of all you
need the business strategies processes
then you need the psychological tools
and mindset that you need to be able to
successfully run a business any type of
business by the way and find it finally
you need your financial or your money
management skills to be successful with
your business so what I'm gonna do in
this vlog is just going to give you a
little taste of each because each one is
pretty comprehensive so we'll talk with
business strategy first and now there's
all kinds of different things that you
can get into with that just you know the
business strategy will change to pay on
the type of business you're getting into
whether it be retail business a client
doesn't a business but it beaters B or B
of C as they would say whether you're
gonna be in the software or services or
products etc etc senators all kinds of
strategies within each of these Denisha
businesses businesses and so it's pretty
comprehensive stuff that being said
there are some basic strategies basic
realities about building products and
businesses that apply to all types of
business so I'll give you one of them I
coined this many many years ago maybe 20
years ago I said if I'm a hundred
percent sure of a product or service
that I'm producing is gonna be a great
seller for my
two percent sure I probably have a 10%
chance and to some of you you're going
huh what that's terrible no there's
actually pretty good odds if you're at
one in ten
you hit a you hit a you have success
you're doing pretty good
and so this statistic or this reality of
business shouldn't be something that
puts you down it should be or makes you
feel bad it should be a reality it
should be a statistic that informs you
of a business strategy how to approach
business and there's there's there's
different things to look at but in this
particular context the big rule as I
said is that if you only have 1 in 10
chance that your product or service is
going to be successful then that begs
the business strategy where you or that
suggested business strategy rather where
you will go out there as quickly as
possible to get your product or service
into the public so that you can get
feedback right away so you can determine
whether or not that product has a
potential to become a viable product or
service has a potential to be a viable
business and it can go on from there but
that's just one reality of business but
I've experienced and I've seen out there
and everywhere that's how it works it's
very rare that the first product or
service especially in its first version
is going to have any success even some
of them you know the unicorns out there
the big unicorn of last decade is
Facebook of course very rare super lucky
this guy is Zuckerberg is like the guy
who wasn't a super lottery the Super
Ball jackpot very rare very rare that
being said even he who has tremendous
luck and I'm not taking away from him
but there's always a luck element in
business but he's had tremendous luck
and even he said that he had no idea
what social networking was gonna be like
when he started working on Facebook and
I went through many many many many
many many changes to get where they are
today so keep that in mind so business
strategy and I just gave you one taste
of one where that reality is that you're
going to have to get your product out
your service out as quickly as cheaply
as possible you so you can gauge whether
or not there's actually a market for it
so let's move on to another quadrant or
not a quadrant but another one of the
drum heads if you will and let's talk
about the psychology psychology in
business is not an afterthought now you
think that because you're all
everybody's kind of concerned with this
area here business strategy but
psychology is huge meaning your
psychology as a founder as a business
owner you have to have the right
psychology so that you can manage the
ups and downs in the business I'll give
you one example you need to be very
stoic about your business approach
meaning you have to have a calm calm sea
ALM determination calm underlying calm
determination to move your business or
your product forward you can't be
excited can be excitable we can't get
angry fearful because if you let these
extreme emotions take you you're gonna
have big - up and ups and downs and it's
going to affect your ability to make
proper decisions about your business now
this is something I learned decades ago
but you see this actually in
professional fighting or in fighting
martial arts boxing whatever one of the
things I was taught as a when I was
boxing especially was emotional control
and ultimately you want to have no
emotion you want to go into a fight
clean a stone code no emotion you're
just getting the job done workmen like
and the reason you want to be stone cold
on emotional unemotional about the
project when you're in the fight because
when you have emotions
come into place when your emotions come
in they distort your ability to respond
accurately in the situation in the fight
and this goes with anything in life if
you're emotional the emotions oftentimes
will hinder your ability to react
intelligently to situations so going
back to business you have to learn to
have a calm determination so that when
things happen opportunities occur or
problems occur you can look at it with a
clear mind and you can move forward so
anyway I'll stop there with the
psychology again we're just touching on
there's a whole bunch of other things to
consider as well but you can't
underestimate the importance of the
psychology because at the end of the day
we're really driven by emotion so keep
that in mind so the final sphere is the
financial sphere or the money
management's here now this would seem
obvious right you got a manage money but
people make huge mistakes tremendous
mistakes and it's one of the main
reasons why so many businesses go out of
business so quickly it's because they
don't manage their income properly and a
lot of times they don't manage your
income or receive your money properly
their financials because of the
psychology is also messed up right
because without the money managed you
don't have time to execute on the
business strategy this has to be there
so one example for example is well a lot
of people want to get into business
they're excited about the image of being
in a business oh yeah I'm gonna be a
business guy so I gotta guess nice suits
I gotta get the best computers and I
gotta get super fancy office furniture
and I gotta get an office space now the
problem with that approach is that
you're basically putting all these
barriers these obstacles that will
prevent you from executing on your
business strategy you have to be very
careful about how you manage your money
especially in the early days of your
business it's huge and again I'm just
touching on the surface of this but you
notice how the psychology is affecting
your ability to make proper money
management decisions because you a lot
of people want to look good they want to
look this role or they think that they
have to appear a certain way to be in
business and and so they start messing
around with their financial situation
and that's where the psychology has to
be managed right where you go wait wait
wait a second I'm building an app as an
example I'm building an app that runs on
the phones there's no way I need an
office now there's no way I need an
office now right now I have several
people working on studio web four and
several developers just the developers
and I don't have an office for him to go
and we live in 2017 here who needs an
office with high-speed Internet and
Skype and iMessages and etc my office is
the local coffee shop you know what I
mean it's it's a crazy waste of money in
my situation where I'm developing
software so keep that in mind you've got
to learn to be very very careful with
your finances so getting tip number one
do you really need that office right
what is that cost and expense of getting
the office what's it really gonna
provide for you in a meaningful
meaningful way for your business you got
to think about that so anyway when you
got each of these components satisfied
they come together in the middle you get
the cash so that's why you have to be
mindful of these three areas and you
have to understand them and there's a
lot of stuff that goes into business of
course one of the things I see I'm going
to close off with this introduction one
of the things I see is people talk about
the grind the grind and you have entire
I hate there's conferences that just
talk about the grind now yes you have to
have a work
ethic in business you have to be willing
to put the time and effort to get into
it and to develop whatever product or
service you want to develop but here's
the thing you could dig a ditch and put
all kinds of elbow grease and sweat and
grind it out digging a ditch but if
you're just digging a ditch it's not
gonna take you anywhere
so the grind is a part of the psychology
I would argue it's about the work ethic
is about being focused and getting the
job done but the grind is only one
element just in the psychology component
of a business so somebody says to you
it's all about grind so about grind it's
only a part of a puzzle right you need
the financial you need the financials so
handled you need the strategy the
business strategy set handle you need
all the other components of the
psychology handles as well so don't let
people fool you into thinking it's all
just grind because you can grind your
way into a hole in the ground that leads
you nowhere there you go
and that's it I hope you found this
video instructive I've as I said before
and other vlogs I am moving more into
the business end of what I do to teach
entrepreneurial skill sets and so forth
because I see so many people out there
teaching how to be entrepreneurs but
they did yeah hi young guys they're
young people and they don't really
frankly don't know what they're talking
about
order one hit wonders order you two
stars who they made money doing YouTube
videos that got viral and matter like
entrepreneurial experts that's not an
entrepreneur entrepreneur somebody is
able to develop businesses products and
services consistently over time and the
best ones over different fields I guess
you know a great entrepreneur my best
mentors was worth maybe 50 million
dollars at the time now he's I think
he's worth four hundred two hundred
million older than me German guy and he
had successful businesses in many
different industries right construction
commercial real estate furniture
building internet provider blah blah
blah blah blah all small businesses
medium-sized businesses but collectively
it was a pretty good Empire and this guy
I really respected because he was able
to show his business skills in many
different fields he didn't just have one
hit and just rolled off of that because
you know let's face it in life there is
luck and I've seen it many times where
if somebody is good you get very lucky
and you have one hit and then you just
sort of ride that you know and this this
mentor of mine this guy I mentioned not
only do have many successful small
businesses he started from scratch he
was an immigrant from Germany to Canada
and his young guy and he was able to
build his businesses which is very very
impressive much more impressive than
somebody who went to work for her father
who had a multi-million dollar business
and then you know built it up you know
that's these you know of course somebody
who does that who comes into her
father's business they think that
they're great business people because
they don't understand the hardest part
about building a business is
establishing that that that initial
structure you figure out what the
product is or the market niche is
figuring out relationships distribution
and just getting that basic cash flow
going so that you can build build up
from that I can tell you from personal
experience that having several
businesses over the years that once I
had my cash flow established once I had
my first business established where I
was making money contacts and my
accounting of plays and my legal in
place and at cash it becomes super easy
I can launch new businesses like this
because I've done it all I have
everything in place but the hard part is
that first that first level which nobody
talks about because most of the people I
see who put out books on business they
either got one hit wonders VC financed
and grew huge you know I don't know how
useful they are for most people or they
inherited businesses they went into
their father's business and grew from
there
they think they're geniuses the hardest
part is an initial building stage that
first year two or three rebuilding the
structure figuring out all these
components after you got that it becomes
much much much easier I can tell you
that you know from experience anyway I'm
not trying to denigrate you know Steve
Jobs or recycle Berg anything like that
it's you know they've had their
successes and they deserved our
accolades I'm just suggesting to you
that these type of guys are very
exceptional very lucky they're talented
too no question but I rather be mentored
by that guy who had many different
businesses where he built his success
from having repeated many times
successful strategies as successful
executions amongst many different
industries that shows a talented person
just like a great fighter is able to get
in a ring and fight many different
opponents and many different styles of
opponents and do well that's how you
know that person's a fantastic fighter
and that's how you know somebody's a
really good business a good a business
if you're able to do that across many
industries all right this has gone on
really too long
