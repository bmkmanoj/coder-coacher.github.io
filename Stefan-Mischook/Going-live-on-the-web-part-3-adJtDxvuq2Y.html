what we're gonna do now is we're gonna
take this particular web page well
website well here's the code actually
kind of simple so let me just close this
up here is here are rather the two files
are going to upload so I didn't register
shark vacation calm because I have
several other domains that I could use
so here's the site HTML near Viacom this
is something I registered a while ago
now this is live on the web
and you know it's live because you know
this right here in the browser window
HTML nirvana right now you see this
weird thing index of so what this is
apache 2.1 for apache is the web server
app that runs on this particular server
and this is actually a one of the
servers that i own and it's live on the
web and attach this of information about
the server and the reason you see this
page is because i didn't upload any
files to the web server i didn't upload
our website so we're gonna do that now I
already have my login information I of
course my server so I have the usernames
and passwords and I logged into the
control panel for HTML nirvana see it
says here in HTML Nevada this is a
control panel called cPanel which is one
of several control panels at you but
hosting companies use see panels one
plus cos another and there many others
so I'm just gonna do the demo with C
Patou cos as far as I know it's the most
popular one out there so just to be
clear hosting companies will install
this C Patou software the cPanel app so
that people like us who have hosting
accounts with them can easily manage our
own hosting account so what do I mean by
manage well you can do things like check
out the files in your hosting directory
add your databases add some email count
check your stats for your website to
configure security all kinds of other
things we're not going to get into here
what we want to do is actually just
upload our website and in the case of
this example we're just we just have two
two files here index.html in the pet
shark image and how do you upload the
website so what we're going to go to the
file section here at the top and we're
going to click on file manager so this
opens up this window here and this is
basically a view of our directory so the
web hosting company gives us a spot on
their server computers and so we're able
to add our files here now if you look on
the left see all the files but we have
access to all this all the directories
all the folders now websites they go in
public HTML 90% of time you're putting
your website files on public HTML right
here so we just click on that and as you
can see public HTML only has the folder
CGI bin right CGI bin so let's look at
this you notice here index of slash
right index of this site the index means
the starting point of site you'll notice
this folder notice this link here CGI
bin and I hope so we go back here CGI
bin see that so I could click on this it
says forbidden you don't have access or
permission to get into CGI being on the
server see that's a server setting see
you could go in there we go back you
could go in here and change the
permissions permissions you know you
have permission to do this you have
permission to do that okay I'm giving
you a lot of extra information but just
understand with the control panel this
file manager here is part of the control
panel so what we want to do is simply is
to upload these two files right inside
of the public HTML folder so that we
have so our web pages are displayed on
the web so how do we do that we click
the upload button and says here select
the files you want to upload into home
HTML Nevada public HTML so what is this
this is the location
on the hosting server computer so you
don't have to worry about that all you
need to know is what we're gonna upload
into a public underscore HTML this
little thing is underscore so you could
you to select your files were clicking
on this and the file browser shows up or
I get is drag and drop file so I'm just
going to select our files drag and drop
them and watch them to here see both
files have been uploaded 100% so let's
go into our file manager again now we
don't see the files but if we reload
here they are index.html pet short dot
jpg so now that we've uploaded a files
we go back to our web page refreshed and
here it is HTML nirvana now has our
website live on the web pretty cool
pretty cool so what I could do is I
could for instance I can change this I'm
gonna open with sublime text here and
I'm going to change the title from my
pet shark Tiger to where's that age to
my life my friends should spell this
properly my friend's pet shark tiger
save that so it's saved and now when
upload that back up to the site upload
it the following files already exists on
the server directory home HTML Havana
public underscore HTML and XHTML do you
want to continue your upload and
overwrite these files like yes so again
we see upload it again hundred percent
go back here let's refresh my friend's
pet shark tiger so that's it you've
learned how to get your website live on
the web
there are many other options there's
different ways that you can upload your
files to a website we've just discussed
the using the control panel which is
easiest there's other ways like
something called FTP and another way
called SSH and a lot of pros use
but this is very cool whoops fantastic
as you can see easy use and there you go
I hope you enjoyed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
