look at something called looping looping
is basically a way in programming to
quickly run through a whole bunch of
different records it allows you to do
repetitive task automatically you can
think of it as like a conveyor belt if
you will or automatic card shuffler you
see looping used a lot in situations
where maybe you have a whole bunch of
records from a database like a list of a
thousand products and you want to put
this in a table in your HTML page and
you want to format all the prices you
want to make the text boat you would use
looping in javascript to automate the
process to do it all automatically so to
be clear loops are looping is a built-in
mechanism that comes built in with
JavaScript and it's actually very common
in just about every programming language
I've ever used it's one of the key
powers of programming or computers the
ability to do repetitive task
automatically and looping allows you to
do this in JavaScript there are several
different types of looping mechanisms
that you can use we're going to
concentrate on to we're going to look at
the while loop and the for loop
okay we have a simple HTML page here and
you've noticed in the body I've created
our script block here and here's our
first loop now it's called the while
loop and you can see why it's called a
while loop and this is how it works so
first thing you need to do is need to
create a variable so I just called a VAR
a I could have called anything you want
and I said VAR a had a value of zero so
you'll see how and why this is going to
be used in our loop so here's the while
loop it looks kind of like and it works
kind of like an if statement where you
have the instead of if you have while
then you have your opening and closing
brackets and where you're checking to
see this is true or false and then you
have your curly brackets so basically as
long as this is false as long as it is
true rather anything in between these
curly brackets will get executed so let
me look at the code so we're saying
while the variable a is less than 10
you're going to do this and when soon as
a is no longer less than 10 when it
becomes 10 this while loop will stop
looping so it's very much like the if
statement except the wild repeats itself
over and over and over again until this
becomes false right so in this case when
as long as a is less than 10 and we know
it's 10 random from beginning we know
it's less than 10 because we set to 0 we
could have set it to two or three or
whatever we want but I'm just going to
keep it at zero so while a is less than
10 we want to write something to the
pace or writing the a so it's going to
write the value of a and plus the plus
sign in JavaScript basically allows you
to to combine things and write it to the
page I think we've looked at document
dot write before and this is a built-in
function in JavaScript allows you to
write to the page saying we're going to
use it here just for the sake of our
little example so we're saying
while a is less than 10 you're going to
write to the page the value of a and
you're going to write a dash beside it
right you got the quotes here and we use
quotes because this is a string right
string of text I hope you remember that
from a previous video another thing I'm
doing as i'm using the Firebug console
console dot log to log the value of a at
the same time now here's the interesting
thing you see a plus plus this is an
operator we've looked at operators
before where an operator operates on
variables and if you recall so we got
the variable a and we got it here too
and what we're saying is that every time
this loop runs right as long as a is
less than 10 we want you to write this
log them to the console and we want to
do to a plus plus plus plus means simply
to increase the value of the variable a
by one that's what plus plus means and
underverse ciders minus minus but for
our example we're going to go plus plus
so basically what we're saying here is
that every time we run the loop we want
you to increase the value of a by one
right because eventually we want a to
increase so it hits 10 so it's not less
than 10 so this loop stops looping
so let's take a look at how this looks
in the actual web page so here's our
page and you knows we have the the page
is been written 0 1 dash 2 3 etc and if
you look at a code that's what we told
it to do we said write the value of a
plus a dash as long as a is less than 10
so we go here so it started off at 0
because we started with the variable at
0 that was the initial value so right so
k 0 1 2 for you up to 9 so let's change
this let's say we'll do it until 20 so
I'm going to save that and we'll just
reload the page and as you can see it
increases up to 19 pretty cool right we
could have started this ad for for
instance say this and we reload and you
see it starts out for the loop the while
loop automatically repeats itself as
long as whatever is in between this and
this bracket is true so it's very much
like the if statement except this is
repetitive
so a lot of you may be asking why did
you put this line of code here why did
you have to put a plus plus well that
prevents what some people will call the
endless loop from occurring you see if I
didn't put this a plus plus a would
never increment right this is the
increment operator increment means you
know increments from from zero or wall
on this key will start at zero from 0 to
1 22 23 24 that's an incrementation of
the number so if you don't increment the
variable as you're looping a will never
go up it will always stay at its
original value of zero so will always be
less in this case 20 what happens is
that you will get an infinite loop and
basically the browser or just keep
running the while loop infinitely you
will never stopped because this will
always stay true write a will never go
change from 0 will never become equal to
20 in what happens in that kit situation
and I'm not going to demo it because I'm
just going to crash the web browser
browser and just keep running a while
loop infinitely so you always got to
remember when you're creating while
loops and any loops or that matter you
have to make sure you don't sit set
yourself up for a situation where you
have an infinite loop where you crash
the system so you learn more about that
as you get into more loops later on but
that's why we have this a plus plus here
we're making sure that the value of a
does increase every cycle of the loop
in part 2 we're going to look at
something called a for loop it's a
variation it's another type of looping
mechanism built into JavaScript and I'll
help you to understand what all this is
nerd stuff here what this means and I
hope you understand the difference
between the while loop versus the for
loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
