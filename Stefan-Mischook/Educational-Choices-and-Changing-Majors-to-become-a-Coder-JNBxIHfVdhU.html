I'm going to answer an email that was
sent to me recently and I'll take it
from here so QA with Steph so I'm just
going to read off the email here I'm in
my second year as a grad student in
mechanical engineering and I find my
motivation lacking quite a bit lately
I've been thinking about going into
programming instead but changing majors
in school would mean another year before
i would start and i'm already in my 28th
years so and he's starting to panic
about it and he's starting to panic
about not studying a serious career let
me give you a little perspective at 28 a
year seems like a long time but in the
grand scheme of things it's not a long
time so don't try not to sweat too much
over a year it's better if need be but
you spent an extra year to do what you
want to do then forgo that because later
on you'll probably come to regret not
doing what you wanted to do again one
year not five years but one year is not
a big deal at 28 don't sweat it too much
I know it seems that that it that it is
a big deal now but trust me it isn't so
let me go on what you thought would be
the best way to start a professional
career and out development be it for the
web or just desktop server apps is it
enough to start learning on my own and
create a profile just to see where the
this will take me is worth of getting
the bachelor's degree and he goes on to
save it as a basic understanding of
programming since he's done you know
HTML CSS JavaScript little PHP and of
course in Java madlib excuse map matlab
as an engineering student so you're
doing mechanical engineering the first
thing i would check is to see how how
many jobs there are in mechanical
engineering out there in your area i'm
not sure what the market is these days
for that 10 15 20 years ago there's
quite a big market for that but let me
just point out one thing when you have a
degree
engineering mechanical engineering
computer comp sci degree etc Taylor when
you have a technical degree like that
that's worth a lot that opens up a lot
of doors into all kinds of job
opportunities if that is you go keep
that in mind having the technical degree
university degree like that is is very
valuable if you want to go into software
development as a professionally if you
want to work for a company having that
technical degree weather mechanical
engineering computer science animagic
computer science be better if you want
to become software developer it's good
out that degree if you want to get into
software development you know maybe
freelance maybe start up your own
company or something then the degree is
not super important actually it's not
very important at all it's your
portfolio so here's the situation if
you're already into two years into your
mechanical engineering see if you can
take credits from that applied to I
don't know computer science whatever or
maybe finish off your mechanical
engineering just of a year to couple
years I believe right maybe do a minor
and it's something related to computers
and i would start writing code your own
side projects right away pick a language
that tracks you whatever what you know i
know whether it be java python whatever
and start building things you might
maybe start building some web apps and
websites on the side for clients side
work if you can find a time it's
important as a developer to build some
sort of portfolio so if your end goal is
to become a developer whether working
for somebody otherwise whether you stay
mechanical engineering or you you flip
into computer science or something
whatever track you're looking to pursue
it's always good to have a nice strong
portfolio so if you come out of school
let's say for example looking to get a
job and you've taken the time on the
side to let's say start a little web
I'm business where you build a whole
bunch of little web apps for people or
maybe you've developed some some apps on
your own for some projects or another
you know the more robust your portfolio
is the more chances you will get work
working for a company or and it will
also just give you two chops that you
need to actually go out on your own and
start your own development business now
to give you perspective now I basically
found myself in a similar situation many
years ago I was in University and I had
started a company on the side and
import-export company so it wasn't
technology related but it was
import-export and Savannah called soft
manufacturing where I basically just buy
products from some suppliers in
different parts of world stick them in
jars and put labels on them and sell
into stores and so forth and add started
that I think when I was 18 something
like I mean was 18 and it was small it
was a side thing and a gruel is slowly
grew slowly grew as a side thing now is
still going to school and I got to
appoint I was like I think I was 19
years 20 years old or 19 years old when
I decided that the business I couldn't
do both University in the business so I
dropped out of university in my second
year to pursue the business because the
business was growing I was one of
reasons anyway has not having a
completed degree from University hurt me
no but I have a huge amount of
experience over the years and especially
back in the 90s they were so desperate
for coders as they are today by the way
you don't really need a degree to get a
job with most companies if you have a
strong portfolio and you know what
you're doing they don't care they just
hire you when I look at coders and
hiring coders I couldn't look at the
degree the amount of time is spent
looking at their education it's
literally like five seconds okay what do
you do so it's good I look at it and go
okay that's fine okay so what do you
know show me what you've done what can
you do and I always look for just a
little interview tip I always look for
listen for the questions the potential
code
might work for me puts to me intelligent
questions put to me puts me at ease so
if they're asking what type of repo do I
use what's the process to use was your
deployment cycle how many people are on
your team blah blah blah blah
intelligent questions that an
experienced coder would ask an
experienced developer asked that is
something I look for personally so
anyway again to recap 28 it's not too
old if you're really sure you're really
sure that you want to jump into comp sci
or something then doing that extra year
to get that comp sci degree is no big
deal but if you're just not your kind of
bored I know second year engineering is
the tough tough part and it's just tough
right now and you're not sure and but
you're not sure about going to something
else you're not sure about the issues
not sure about that I would just stick
it out because you're halfway there
right you're halfway there and on the
side I would be actively coding outside
of what you have to do for school so you
might like I said start doing websites
and web apps for small businesses or
people you know in the area and this
will not only teach you how to code in a
commercial way but also give you a
portfolio and also teach you how to deal
with clients in you know in a business
relationship rather than just an
academic situation it's very different
and then if you continue with say and
you do your mechanical engineering
because you know just you just running
through the processes you get you get
there but you get at the end trust me
having a degree in mechanical
engineering it's not a bad thing it's
actually a very good thing it will just
give you a nice baseline you can work
off of once you have that degree it's
worth a lot because at least you have
that you know what I mean it's it's a
bottom I tell people that whatever the
technical trade may be whether it be I
call it a trade loosely know whether it
be become a mechanical engineer or you
get into computer science you get your
degree there or plumbing you know if you
become people become plumbers that's
worth a lot of money you know if you
become a plumber you get that red
see you they call it you're basically
got the license to print money as a
plumber and it's there's a limit to work
with that so you know it's different
though when you're getting into like the
arts right if you were telling me you
were a philosophy major in your second
year and you weren't sure I'd say I
forget about go to coding if you were
telling me you were a psychology major I
probably tell you the same thing it's a
bit better than philosophy but you get
the idea I was studying psychology that
made the the decision for me to leave
University in my second year to go into
full-time into my business a lot easier
because psychology even back you know
back then the chances you getting
gainful employment in that field were
pretty miniscule yeah and I remember I
was working at a cinema part-time about
the same time so and my business at the
cinema thing a little bit just an hour
to a week to help with some cash and
then the business started taking off so
I remember I was working at the cinema I
was trying to make this decision and I
knew all these all the popcorn girls are
just three girls that work behind a
popcorn stand and they all had they all
had masters degrees in psychology and I
said to myself why you know I can pop
popcorn now with with no degree in
psychology so that made my decision
pretty easy I hope that helps bye bye
before i forget same person asked what
is the difference between my standard
training courses were just much videos
that you see everywhere versus the
studio web interactive training and it
is the interactive training what you see
if you talk to people who've done the
studio web you see that the interactive
component is a huge part of the training
because as you're going through all the
videos and there's there's a few hundred
of them you are quizzed along the way so
the whole point of the quizzing is to
reinforce the knowledge sometimes a quiz
there's multiple choice of times you're
writing code and the system's giving you
instant feedback so it's almost like
having me standing right beside you
going ok I've explained to you this here
a question answer ok that's wrong try
this now okay
I'll get good next question okay go next
question next question but of course at
your own pace and so that is the
difference between what studio web
provides versus what you see pretty much
everywhere else out there is that
interactivity that instant feedback
feedback that we give you continuously
and thoroughly throughout the system
that's why a studio web makes learning
to code swisher especially for beginners
so much easier because you get that
instant feedback because it's broken
down and to find smaller chunks are easy
to understand and digest and because it
tracks everything so you never have to
remember where was I did did I do this
yet I don't know it's all there for you
that is the big difference between
studio web and the interactive component
tones all interactive versus my standard
libraries and stuff that you see else
elsewhere out there and stuff I had been
doing since 2003 that's why I built my
very first coding course and it was
called original original name web design
one that was the original anyway that's
it all right ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
