markup language like HTML from a
programming language like Java Script is
that in a programming language you can
make decisions you can't do that in HTML
whereas in JavaScript you can actually
see what somebody is doing and then have
the JavaScript take an action based on
what's happening that is one of the key
differences between a programming
language and a markup language so what
we're going to do in this video is look
at one of the most basic decision-making
mechanisms built into JavaScript and
many other languages something called
the if statement
so we're back in our well dreamweaver
cs4 in this case but again you can use
any text editor and you see have
pre-built the basic structure of an if
statement you have the keyword if two
brackets and then two curly brackets so
the best way to explain this it's
actually just jump into it if three is
less than four and in here i'm going to
write some code so i'm just going to say
console dot log and i'll say i don't
know indeed it is so let's take a look
at the console and see how that turns
out there we go indeed it is so
basically the way the if statement works
about anything in between these brackets
if that's true then anything in between
these brackets but follow it will will
happen now if this was false I'll just
do the opposite 3 is greater than 4 then
javascript will go up this is false and
it will skip whatever code is in between
these two curly braces so let's try the
cell as you can see it disappears if
statements are exceptionally important
and you're going to be using them all
the time you can be using them for
instance in a conjunction with a
function so let's use a function that we
used earlier remember index of so we're
going to go string str our string
variable when you say in Dex loops index
of and we're going to look for the
letter e so if the string thus far
string rather contains the letter e then
we're going to run this otherwise it
won't so what's this we save that let's
run that and script indeed it is so
let's say we say index you know of no
space no it's an obviously there's no
space in here so we
run this again so they'll ok and you can
see it doesn't fire off
we show you another example yeah mostly
a now you you would expect that since a
is not part of hello right string hello
it you figure it would return false but
I mean returning on remember a function
returns value so the index of function
would return a value the first time it
said it was one right so you figure a we
remember last time we did string index
of a it returns a minus one now
javaScript is an interesting language
it's a great language but sometimes it's
kind of weird so typically minus one
you'd figure it mean false but it
doesn't in JavaScript unfortunately so
even though in this case there's no
value there's no a in the string for
some reason if we'll still fire off as
if it is true then we'll see this Rama
it's really fun to see index hope it's
true so for some reason index of if it
sees minus one if I if rather C's minus
1 because we know that index of a
returns bios whining i'll show you what
i mean by that if i go here
console dot minus one is what make it so
it's not so confusing for you guys so
how C student it shouldn't do that but
litter so we got console dot log that
string index EA so from soon see you see
that index of returns minus one when it
doesn't find value right so that sucks
so it's a it's snug fit so what we can
do we can change this so it gives me an
opportunity to you where to be change
this so I can go okay we could do this
with you go minus 10 get in here minus
one double equals so this double equal
operators basically is called a
comparison operator because it compares
this with this so we know that from down
here we know this will output minus one
so if minus 1 is equal to minus 1 we say
council dot log ouch so we're going to
do that let me just erase this so we
refresh that don't where I'm going to
get back and explain those some things a
little bit so i'll just come out of
course so let me explain this now these
double arrows this is an operator it
because it operates on right member we
had operators like the dot operator and
equals this is the assignment operator
as it is science value we're assigning
the value of hello to the VAR string in
this case situation we have double
equals what we're actually doing is
called a comparison operator we're
asking JavaScript to compare what's on
this side to whatever is on this side so
because it's in an if we're going to get
in a vibe we're going to get a if it's
going to valuate that so it's like we're
basically saying compare minus 1 versus
the output of string of index of and
tell us what it is and in this case
because they are equal it will be true
so because it's true this is run
I hope that makes sense if i said- to
that should be false and we should get
nothing in the console let's try that
out see that nothing appears right
because this we know outputs minus one
so let's go back to minus one and we go
index of e so we know that this will
output a index position of 01 but since
this is not true it will also be false
as well I hope that makes sense think
about it if not play with it at home so
let's try it out again see out right so
we know that that is true right Oh a
second I shouldn't bencher we try it
again we say them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
