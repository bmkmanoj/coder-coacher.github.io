number three the title of the vlog is
called catching the rising tide let me
give you the story many years ago I was
in a business totally unrelated to
technology
it was import/export hybrid bacteria's
water purification Yetta Yetta Yetta so
I was in this business and it was a
couple years old at this point it's
about two three years old I forget the
exact number and I was I learned to HTML
back in 94 to build a website for the
business and at that time being an HTML
coder was a very rare skill set he got
Hearst and the web at that time was so
young that people were considering the
possibility that the web might become a
commercial place believe it or not most
web sites at the time were websites
hosted by universities and schools and
the academics would just exchange
information just to give you context so
I built my web site for my business and
then I was approached I don't know how
by some law firm but had offices in
Canada US and Europe and they wanted to
build a website because they saw the
advantage of having a website yeah I
remember very few companies at this time
had it so they approached me and my
business was growing it was still quite
small and young and they say you want to
build this for us but they will pay you
so they said okay well not so I'll do it
makes an extra money etc so I built the
website and and then they approached me
said listen this is a great new
technology and we deal with legal firms
all over the world so we're gonna be
able to hook you up with all these legal
firms so you should do the same pursue
this so I hit a crossroads here not a
crossroad fork in the road I had two
choices here I can continue of my
current business which was in an older
industry that had reached its plateau
was actually
decline but the business was established
and growing or the other option was to
pursue this new business in an industry
that was brand new wide open a lot of
opportunity now looking back I go oh
what I do I stuck to the business that
was already established me me money etc
except I didn't understand the concept
of the rising tide I didn't understand
the concept of maturity of industries
and how you should be able to you should
rather catch the wave of a growing
sector a growing market and you should
get out of markets that are in decline
and dying so at that time the industry
that I was in was slowly slowly slowly
dying off there's a lot of competition a
lot of players are in the marketplace
everybody was established so I was
getting in there trying to basically
claw my way in to grab shelf space
literally from established players
whereas in the web game at that time it
was so wide open it was just it was just
like a hot knife through butter to get
in there but I didn't understand that
idea again of the rising tide so the
lesson derived from this story my
screw-up is that you should look to
industries look to market segments or
markets whether it be markets would be
geographical areas etc except there
where you see growth where you see
growth and you can be found in all kinds
of different areas so in the web the
money going forward a big money if I was
to start over is in AI related machine
learning that's where the money is now
the thing about that right now it's it's
the domain of the big players the
googles a leader Microsoft IBM but maybe
you could become an expert in all the
options out there
machine learning so you can implement
services from these big companies and
implement them into your small
medium-sized clients apps they may be
able to use for instance IBM's I think
it's called Watson where you pay for
requests and all Rogerson can answer
questions you might be able to inject
that into your clients app again that's
just a no it's just a suggestion
you would have to look into it another
option would me maybe to look into
niches that they're now unsupported even
though or not supported enough even
though these technologies have been
around for a while so I'll give you an
example classic example uses PHP
WordPress development these two
technologies are like the redheaded
stepchildren of the development world
people don't like WordPress developers
dome people don't like PHP developers
don't even though they're so widely used
it's incredible how widely use they are
have talked about that so therein lies
an opportunity for a freelancer because
so many small businesses depend on PHP
and WordPress Drupal and Joomla these
are all content management systems
they're all written with PHP and since a
lot of developers don't want to work in
PHP you know a lot of developers don't
want to work in WordPress there's a
strong potential that in this niche you
can do really really well servicing
companies that have sites based and on
these on these technologies in fact I
was talking to a CEO of somebody and
Ottawa who works on exclusively on a
certain content management system a
Drupal and he says you can't keep up
with the man can't keep up with the men
now Drupal is far from being exciting
far from being new for most from most
people's perspective but again therein
lies the opportunity supply and demand
right there's a big supply of Drupal and
especially WordPress PHP work does
involve small businesses that are
dependent on those technologies and
there's less supply developers because
all the devout
helpers want to get into the new stuff
like JavaScript server-side coding and
AI machine learning anything but PHP
core for us to reiterate look for rising
tide of markets get out of dying markets
and look for niches as well you have to
be nimble and your choices in terms of
how what your career or your business
pursuits will be I hope you found this
useful
