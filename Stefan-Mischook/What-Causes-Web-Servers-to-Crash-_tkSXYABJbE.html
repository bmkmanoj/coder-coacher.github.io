answering a question I was put to me on
the youtubes
I'm gonna read part of the comment made
and they don't give you my response once
we answer this question what causes sort
of a crash in high-level showing how
different things like too many users
requests or loading too much SQL data or
too many users at once can cause your
server to crash okay so this is my
experience over the last 20 odd years
supers don't typically crash what they
typically do is slow down quite a bit
well you have too many requests maybe
too many people trying to hit a web app
or website at the same time and it just
can't keep up with responses and it just
takes forever for things to happen now
wallet for the service responders just
too many requests you saw that through
hardware with increased RAM increased
CPU to pay out situation the other major
thing though cause servers to really
slow down to a crawl and appear to crash
is database overload database overload
again because you have a web app or an
app that is getting hit too many times
and the databases is overloading there's
all kinds of strategies which I've
detailed in other vlogs about how to
take care of that now the key really is
to design good database tables that's
the key thing number one thing you
should look at is how you design your
database tables make sure they're
optimized and there's whole courses on
that and then why'd you have it just a
well-designed database tables database
structure excuse me I'm talking about
relational databases here which is the
most common type of database think MySQL
SQL server etc the only thing you have
to do is you have to properly index your
tables again I've talked about this in
other videos these two things alone will
go a long way to eliminating server
slowdowns
your web app can't compete or can't keep
up with the requests this is huge this
is huge is the database optimizations
that I just spoke about another thing
you can do is you could just do
intelligent queries to the database
Aquarius
using your programming language of
choice it could be PHP it could be
Python it could be Java whatever and the
key is to create optimized queries so
but it efficiently reads the database or
writes to the database communicates with
the database what do I mean by that well
in Java apps that we call a prepared
statement PHP as well and I'm sure many
other languages do that as well so is
that that is a statement a statement is
basically choosing to SQL command that
is pre compiled so it just executes
quicker that's another thing you do
another thing you do is something called
caching if you have a huge amount of
data that doesn't change very often so
let's say you're loading in catalogs
from a product product list for a store
chances are your product lists are not
going to change often so that's a good
candidate for caching whereas caching is
basically creating a snapshot of your
database in a format so that it's super
easy to load for your web app this way
it speeds up things together one of the
most expensive operations one of the
most expensive things in terms of CPU is
making a connection to the database
reading from the database the adding
record Center database especially
reading that takes a lot of juice so if
you have records in your database that
are fairly unchanged or don't change too
often that's a good candidate for
caching but again I'm going back to the
database itself database management
servers DBMS as database management
servers so yeah
our database management software I
forget the acronym means now anyway
software but is
databases MySQL etc etc they have all
kinds of tools built into them right
from the core app for it optimizes data
access and indexes as I mentioned before
is as one strategy there are many other
strategies you can use something called
a stored procedure or stored proc which
is kind of like a precompiled SQL a
precompiled query or a precompiled
database operation and what this is you
set that up as a start proc you do it in
your database itself every database has
its own way of handling this and then
instead of using SQL directly to create
a query to the database you would just
contact that stored proc the stored
procedure why because the procedure is
going to be compiled and optimized by
the database app the DBMS and it's just
going to be so much faster there's other
things you can do as well views and etc
or just having intelligent queries in
terms of how what data you grab from
your tables and how you do it but again
whole books have been written on this so
when it comes to server crashing from my
experience the server rarely crashes
what you typically see is just an
overload of requests usually requested a
database that's the heaviest second to
that I found it's of course is standard
web traffic when you're looking at a DD
denial of service attack do s attack
denial service attack that's typically
just hitting a paging like crazy number
of times so the web server is trying to
keep up trying to keep up try to keep up
and that's how they crash it by just
overloading it with too many requests
again what happens is when you get too
many requests whether it be to a
database or just standard request to a
web page the crash is just an overload
of the buffers and it just can't clear
it and something messes up and on a rare
occasion you may have to flush it but
that's very rare in my opinion in my
experience but again you could avoid
those type of situations from happening
just by having a very optimized database
having optimized
access strategies as I discussed I hope
this blog is useful a little early in
the morning for me I'm kind of tired and
I only just started drinking my coffee
some still just working at 75% of normal
brain the speed
