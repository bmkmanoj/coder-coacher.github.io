apps that you can use to build websites
since HTML is just code you could use a
simple text editor like notepad on
Windows and you can just start typing in
your HTML code here it works just fine
now this is good but the problem with
this is that it doesn't give you any
help if you remember when we were using
our clone editor here you knows how
color to code or if I started typing in
a tag it knew what I was trying to type
and it suggested in this drop-down list
what tag to tantor we just press ENTER
and look it types out the rest of the
tag for us
whereas with text editors you have to
type things raw and it works but it's
not as fast as using a proper code
editor so yes you can build your pages
with simple text editors like notepad on
windows or TextEdit on Mac a better
solution though is to use a proper code
editor like sublime text on Windows and
Mac and Linux and there are many many
others let me show you so here I am on
Wikipedia and here is a very small list
of HTML editors we know when you're
building web pages you're just writing
HTML code there's all kinds out there so
which one you use it's a personal choice
some people will say notepad plus plus
is the bass some people will say sublime
text is the best and there's another
class of app that you can use to build
websites and they're called WYSIWYG apps
WYSIWYG right up here and WYSIWYG is
short for what you see is what you get
it's kind of like a point-and-click
drag-and-drop type of app used to build
webpages kind of like building a web
page with PowerPoint and the most
popular app that in that style is
something called
adobe dream
this is not free of course and you click
on buttons and it helps you build your
page and so on and it's pretty good but
these days HTML is so powerful that to
use one of these apps it's cool but most
people will actually just use a code
editor like sublime text anyway even if
you use one of these apps like
Dreamweaver to build your sites you're
still going to need to understand your
code because these these apps like
Dreamweaver do a good job but at the end
of the day what makes a really good
website has a lot to do with how you
structure your code properly how you
write it
cleanly and so on and we'll get into a
little bit later on in the course but
just I just wanted you to know in this
particular lesson that you have a few
options available to you in terms of
building websites you have again simple
text editor like notepad on Windows you
got code editors like sublime text and
there's many out there and you got apps
like Dreamweaver but allow you to build
your websites kind of like you might
build a PowerPoint presentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
