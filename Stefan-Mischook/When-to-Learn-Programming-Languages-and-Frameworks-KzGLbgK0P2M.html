need to nerd basis expression need to
nerd bases what that is is you should
learn things on a need-to-know basis and
so you shouldn't be so concerned about
all the new developments that come out
every every other day it seems you see
software development is largely driven
by young developers who after a few
years they see specific areas where they
may be able to improve things so they
start pushing out a new framework or
maybe there might be an attractive new
language comes out and they talk about
how great it is and that's cool and I've
been there trust me but you have to
always consider whether or not a new
technology is going to make a
significant difference in terms of the
actual work that you do you're going to
look at the potential market share of
that technology whether or not it's it's
going to actually spread if it's going
to if it's going to become something
that's dominant at some point or if it
is dominant why are you going to
consider these things because I can tell
you there are so many technologies that
looked amazing when they first came out
and they just went nowhere or they fell
into a very small niche or a slowly
fellow fell into a niche typically for a
new technology to be able to user be
able to replace and establish an
established technology excuse me
it has to have something like 10 times
the capacity or the benefit it has to be
really significant now it's hard to
measure ten times like how how can you
measure whether Swift is ten times
better than Objective C or whether Java
was ten times better than C++ depends
how you want to measure it right but at
the end of the day you have to really
see something that's really much better
than its predecessor before it takes
over so let me give you a quick example
I remember we and I remember when Ruby
started gaining steam in the it was like
the late 90s no excuse me late 90s mid
2000s hit its peak I think in 2007 and
Ruby brought over a bunch of people from
the Java community because Java is
getting unnecessarily stupidly complex
so so a lot of Java people said well not
so they went over to Ruby because they
like the Ruby language because it's got
a lot of cool things about it and what
really drove Ruby's adoption was the
rails framework and the rails framework
was not something that depended on Ruby
in the sense that you could reproduce
what the rails framework did in any of
the languages you could reproduce it by
thawne and PHP and Java whatever you
want but because Ruby on Rails came out
first and it grabbed a lot of market
share because the people who invented
the rails framework they had produced
some pretty successful apps and so again
some traction but at the end of the day
it wasn't it didn't hit that 10 times
threshold if you will for a broader
community and rails go and made a big
push it didn't quite make it and
although quite a few people still use
rails but it's really really faded as
you know in terms of popularity because
it doesn't have that huge significant
advantage you know because everybody
else has produced a rails like
frameworks it's all sudden a big
advantage at Ruby Ruby on Rails provided
there's gone so like in the PHP world
you have laravel symphony and then
pythonic a django and i think we're sort
of a simpler ones a flask and they're
not all exactly grills but they're
they're productive as rails is and so
they work and then you know ruby has
some downsides so it just never got
enough momentum it felt a nice so now
ruby is really falling away I find
there's still jobs whereas with PHP
because it was it just grew so quickly
so fast
it was it's got such a dominant position
in small websites and small medium-sized
websites that it's it's entrenched it's
not going to go away and because PHP is
light and nimble and quick to develop
with people are going to still be using
it despite the fact that there are
people you know PHP is like everybody's
favorite whipping boy this is not the
prettiest looking language that's for
sure it has it has a messy background if
you will and as amis messy history but
it's still very productive it's still
very productive rails excuse me Petri
laravel is every bit as sophisticated as
rails and the language is highly
performant very reliable easy to get
going with that's a big advantage by the
way the PHP has over any of the
competitors by far it's what you can get
up and running with PHP quick super
quick and PHP at runtime when the Petrik
code actually runs it runs much faster
in Ruby I'm afraid I run much faster at
Python and Django it runs really really
quickly so it is the king in terms of
the scripting languages the Lightning
the languages in terms of ease of
learning ease of use in the ployment
hours run time speed run run times we
rent it now it adds up if you have to
spend 1/3 as much on hosting instead of
spending you know 300 a month you have
to spend 100 a month when your startup
or your small business that's $200
missed or just 2,400 bucks a year in
your pocket because you
PHP anyway to conclude this long vlog
discussion when you look at new
technologies consider the need to nerd
rule my knee to new rule consider does
it really replace anything that's in
such a significant wave as a
game-changer or does it just maybe do
something a little bit better here or
maybe something a little bit better
there you have to look at all that and
you have to look at whether or not it
has a big enough market share or you
think you can have a big enough market
share to make a difference because the
way text technology typically goes the
market leader will grab the market share
because business owners here's a little
business rule don't don't want to be
invested in some rare niche technology
because they don't want to spend all
kinds of money developing an app and
pick some new hot language and then four
years down the road
nobody's coding in that language anymore
and then also the coding is extremely
expensive and high it's just a pain in
the butt to manage I seen that many many
times now you may be you may be going as
a color would have a good you know you
get into something that's rare and
expensive like Ruby you guys can make a
lot of money because there are lots of
legacy Ruby projects out there harder
and harder to get Ruby programmers but
you're gonna be coding yourself into a
corner there in the sense that you know
less I don't people I don't see people
starting new projects so much with Ruby
anymore I think they're gonna be doing
things they're gonna be doing in the
JavaScript they're gonna be doing a PHP
and then you got peripheral ear
periphery and the peripheral don't you
see asp.net them use Java maybe I
wouldn't be using done that personally I
wouldn't be used to have it rather
personally etcetera etc you get the idea
now don't get me wrong when I'm
discussing this stuff I'm not discussing
I'm discussing with languages and so on
I'm not discussing necessarily the
technological merits of the language I
think all languages you could with all
languages you can produce very good
software very good software as I've seen
very good
software produced with all the languages
so when I look at these things I'm
always looking at the job at hand I'm
looking at market share I'm looking at
personal taste in terms of choices
anyway again in the tradition of my my
blogs I'm trying to teach technology
combined with business so you understand
how to make intelligent decisions for
your career whether you become an
employee a freelancer or you start your
own company I hope that helps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
