looking at a site Pauline X I guess
that's how it's pronounced and it's a
place where you can exchange in crypto
currencies crypto currencies if you
haven't heard about it it's digital
currencies like Bitcoin and aetherium
etc etc etc so there will be some sort
of use for these digital currencies or
the processes behind these digital
currencies but you have to be very very
careful now because we are now entering
into a well-known or a very often seen
before
mania stage in this asset class I say
that with hesitation because an asset
class by the way is a Wall Street term a
bankers term for some sort of asset that
has some sort of value that could be a
house it could be stocks it could be oil
could be gold it could be etherium
Bitcoin so each class each type of acid
is categorized in the into a class like
commodities like technology companies
like you know stocks like bonds etc
etcetera etcetera and I'm not going to
teach you about investment here except
to say if you are a young nerd who is
salivating at the prospect of buying
into one of these cryptocurrencies
please keep in mind a few rules about
this type of stuff we are now entering a
mania yes some people will make a lot of
money most people lose money that's just
the nature of these markets now if you
got into Bitcoin a few years ago as I
almost did I'd be way up accept the
reality of situation is I get a video by
the way when Bitcoin was a thousand
dollars I said how I lost twelve million
dollars by being lazy because at the
time was like six seven years ago two
years or whatever it is
bitcoins are about four five cents
apiece when I was goodbye $500 of
Bitcoin it was so hard to buy back to
him because the exchanges were very
primitive
that I did I didn't get to it I went
through three or four stages and I just
forgot forgot about it so it's a bit of
joke it was a bit of a joke bit of
tongue-in-cheek when I said I lost 12
million because the fact that a matter
is anybody will tell you is traded
unless I would have forgot about them
about the bitcoins
I can guarantee you there's no way if I
would have put $500 and I went to ten
thousand I wouldn't have sold most of
them right that's just the nature of
this and that's what people will do but
that's what the smart thing it could do
I guess with these crazy speculative
investments if you will but don't kid
yourself there's not investment when
you're buying something like a Bitcoin
or an etherium coin which is basically
something that's given value because
it's perceived that it might be worth
something kind of like Cabbage Patch
dolls if you go back in history there
not too long ago Cabbage Patch dolls
were all the rage and they were shooting
up in value not as much as a cerium but
they were shooting up everybody said oh
my god these things are collectors items
that are gonna be willful I and people
were paying hundreds of dollars for
Cabbage Patch Cabbage Patch dolls now
you can't give them away there's a lot
of them in landfills now so keep that in
mind
it's like 1980s comic books 1980s comic
books at one point shot up and die but
they've since collapse far as I'm told
now certain things will hold their value
but it's a very dangerous thing so when
you have a mania situation now where
everybody's hearing about on the news be
oh my god Bitcoin just like when gold
and silver went crazy the few years back
gold was when shot up from a thousand to
eighteen hundred fifty dollars an ounce
of gold and now it's unlike what twelve
thirteen hundred forty hundred has been
seen there so people who bought a
eighteen hundred they got killed they
got killed they lost more almost half
their money saving with silver I did it
I was involved in this and I watched
silver go all the way up from like 12
bucks
whoever was to $49 and change I remember
the night actually
and it was such a spike up kind of look
like aetherium as you see here this
chart about like the loo and I got out
sold all my silver sold all my gold
within two days I was lucky because
three days later my friend who waited an
extra day or two he just broke even
where I made a pretty good coin pun
intended with my silver but that was a
fluke I just got out by some stroke of
luck it wasn't as our genius it cleared
kept going up who knows because when you
have this type of mania situation that
we see here with the digital currencies
this is not a situation where the prices
are being moved because of some
fundamental truth underlying these
digital currencies this is purely
emotional this is purely emotional you
are now if you invest and there's a
chance you could do well you can make
some money but if you invest you are
gambling on the emotional predisposition
of everybody's jumping into this so be
careful with that as Warren Buffett says
the most successful investor of all time
of a long long track record when
everybody is greedy be fearful and when
everybody's fearful be greedy
so everybody is greedy now for these
things so I would be fearful but I'm not
giving you any investment advice advice
because I don't have a crystal ball and
I don't know what's going to happen here
also keep in mind most fortunes are made
by people who gradually who gradually
invest over time and hold on to their
positions like I would have been at this
point with Bitcoin well over 2000 I
would have been worth 25 million u.s. if
I would have held good luck with that
alright I'll talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
