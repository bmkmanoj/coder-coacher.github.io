course I'm not sure what the title is
gonna be my working title is business
battle plans simply because it's as easy
to say it may change to something else
maybe nerd nerd printer who knows anyway
if you look in a link below i have a
link to a survey on the killer sites
forum and if you can i'm asking two
questions a what format you would like
the course in video only audio only mp3
or video and audio and the other survey
is whether or not you would like the
course in a download-only format
download and premium forum forum format
where i would post the videos in a
premium forum that's a paid subscription
type of thing where you can ask
questions under each of the videos and i
would answer and other people would
answer and of course I would put new
material up on the premium forum sort of
more like a a mentoring type of
situation rather than just a static
course and the third option for the
course would be a quizzing base to do
web based course where you'd have the
videos mounted within the studio web
system where would be quizzing
components so forth so it's quick quick
survey quick poll I'll just kind of kind
of curious what people think and I will
also help me to engage to to gauge
rather the level of interest in this and
yeah that's pretty much it do you have
to go to the killer size forum of course
it's for you to join like any other
forum and you can quickly join whether
you use your Facebook account your
Twitter account or your Google+ account
or you could just not join directly it's
no big deal although it's probably
easier with the social networks and
that's pretty much it that's pretty much
it yeah thanks for watching bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
