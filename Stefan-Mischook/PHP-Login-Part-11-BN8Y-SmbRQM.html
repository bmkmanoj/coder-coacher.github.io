email is invalid format and the last
change that I want to do is going to be
down within this section you know it's
rather an important one that I somehow
missed in my earlier tutorials you may
notice that in all this error checking
here we make sure that all the form
fields are filled in and we make sure
that both password fields match and now
we check that the email form is valid
but we never anywhere check the database
to make sure that our user name or email
address is unique we don't necessarily
want users to be able to share email
addresses or username somehow email
addresses shouldn't happen but it's
quite possible that the user may enter
in a duplicate username and that would
be bad we don't want to have things
being confused in the database so let's
go ahead and write a couple my school I
queries to make sure to check for that
so the first thing you'll want to do is
we're going to check if the email is
taken
and we're going to do that check equals
mysql I and we're going to prepare this
statement well do you select email for
members where email equals ? and then
we're going to bind the parameters first
one being s for a string it replaces
this ? and in the place of that we're
going to include input email
then we're going to execute I'm going to
store the results and finally we're
going to do an if statement to check if
there were any results so if check
numrows it doesn't equal 0
we want to display a message saying the
email is invalid or not so much invalid
is already in use so in that case I'm
going to add two error messages and an
alert message with a long room or
descriptive message
and then I'm going to add an error
message next to the email address itself
simply says
okay like so and then the final thing
want to short form again and rather than
doing multiple if statements and if-else
statements etc because we want to check
out the email to take in and then we
want to also check if the user name is
taken etc so what I'm going to just do
is I'm going to include an exit that
simply means that if we get to this
point and we hit the exit PHP is going
to stop and it won't continue executing
any additional code so that way I don't
have to worry about multiple nested if
an elf lcf statements so the first thing
we want to do is check if the email is
taken and I'm going to copy and paste
this and we're going to check now if the
user name is checking and basically just
a matter of changing a couple variables
here
just make sure yes I call mine user ok
okay and then the last change that we
need to make to this file is down here
want to make sure we're saving the email
in the database
okay I believe that's it let me save it
and let's go ahead and check this so i
logged in I just remember actually just
going to fill in some filler information
just to make sure everything's working
okay that makes sense try again since
the emails already in use so i'm going
to put admin to instead that should fix
that and different use your name and it
looks like we got an issue so let me
double check that
username email password oh here we go
forgot to add an extra ? so let's go
back try the skin it looks like we've
got a member added successfully message
let's check our database and it looks
like everything was inserted correctly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
