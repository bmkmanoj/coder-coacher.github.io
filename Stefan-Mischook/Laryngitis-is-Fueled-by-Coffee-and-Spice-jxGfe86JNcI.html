because my voice I don't know if you can
tell but my voice is actually feeling
much better it's not perfect it's about
80% of the way there where I've been
struggling with this laryngitis for a
couple of months now and so I decided to
take a second look at what causes
laryngitis what what you're supposed to
do and not supposed to do and I was
reminded that coffee is not very good
for you to drink coffee no caffeine in
general little spicy food drink lots of
water and don't talk too much so not
talking too much is very difficult for
me so someone's not drinking coffee so I
decided yesterday to not drink a coffee
so it's been nearly 24 hours since I've
had a coffee and I'm already feeling a
big difference in my vocal box so I
think hopefully by tomorrow I'll wake up
and the voice will be back fully I can
go back to my bad habits of drinking a
coffee so they asked me about my Python
course staff once the Python course
coming out I know I know I've been
slacking on that I've been distracted I
did distracted by that and I'm so close
I got over 40 videos now done I think
the course when it's finished will have
between 45 and 50 videos some of this
close but I'm bringing on an editor now
who's starting to review the content and
she's going to bring in another
perspective now I shoot I edit the
videos of course but then I get feedback
I read it and now I'm going to get
feedback from an editor it's going to
help me to fine-tune the material that
all said and done it's pretty good as it
is again very good reviews from the beta
testers so I'm pretty stoked about
what's going to come out when this
course is finally done it will be very
soon I never seen it but I have to get
this out I've been stalling on this too
long and so it's going to be out soon I
promise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
