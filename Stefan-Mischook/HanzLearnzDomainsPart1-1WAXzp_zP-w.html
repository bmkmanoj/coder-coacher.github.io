in this video we're going to learn about
registering a domain name why do we need
to do that if you want to put your
website live on the web you need to get
it an address and that's what a domain
name is and is this they lick one of the
first things that you need to do well
yes if you're looking to put up a site
for your small business or new small
business or your project I would suggest
the first thing to do is the register
the domain so that you know that it's
locked up because then the name of the
site the domain name of the site will be
can be incorporated into the design of
your website once you register it like
you said does that mean it's yours yes
it is yours it's almost like copywriting
as long as you keep your going to renew
it every year but fortunately most of
maine's can be renewed for under ten
dollars per year so it's pretty
affordable that's great so just to be
clear a domain name is the unique
address of a web site on the web so for
example killer sites com is a domain
name killer PHP calm as a domain name so
there could be like Hans lens calm Hans
learns calm is a domain name as well
google.com domain name these are all
domain names are all legitimate and they
could be calm it could be dotnet ticket
B dot info get B dot CA these are all
different types of domain names to call
extensions and they're just different
addresses that's all they are a dress
like a house exactly like the house so
let's actually just register a domain
for you yeah and from there we'll learn
a bit more about domain names fantastic
there are many places on the web you can
go to register domain name and there's a
small fee and the speed basically covers
the cost of just maintaining this joint
address book of domain names so
companies like killer size calm and many
other registrar's or social to call
companies that allow you to register
domain names or call registrar's they
just allow you to register your
my name and add them to this giant
address book that maintains all these
domain names there's only one book
exactly and you have all these different
companies that helped you to register
them and you pay a small fee per year
just to keep this database up-to-date so
there's only one killer sites that come
example exactly I should point out
killer sites com would be a different
address from killer sites dotnet why
because it's considered them a different
address just like you know 784 Baker
Street is different from 784 lat Wall
Street right those Wall Street crooks so
what we're going to do now is we're
going to well if you go to Kyoto sites
com you click on web hosting we have our
web hosting guides where you can read
more about domain names and registering
to my name's lots of questions then so
i'll let you explore that on your own
time so let's actually click through if
you click through here domain name just
click through and you'll be able to get
to hosting killer sites calm and again
you can go to any registrar you want so
we'll just use this for now so what's
the name of the site you want to
register what I like headphones in fact
I'm wearing some right now so I i would
say that i'm a headphone guy a headphone
dude so maybe something like that so
head phone guy calm alright so we have a
we have options we have the dot-com here
then we have several other domain name
extensions so many of them just like if
you remember in my basic HTML video I
talked about filename extensions like
dot txt or dot HTML same thing with
domain names you have extensions you got
com see all net these are all
essentially different addresses like I
said you can register headphone guide
com which would be a different address
from head foci coo or
welcome everybody is always talking
about coms dot-com was the first
publicly available domains that you
could buy in the past in the past in
passer asst comm the first three were
calm dotnet and dot org ya heard of that
now there used to be all kinds of
restrictions in in the old days if you
are a dot-com you're a company if you r
dot or your nonprofit organization no
money and if you were a dotnet you were
a network was isp internet service
providers stuff like that I forget
exactly to be honest in such a long time
anyway that's ancient history there are
many other domain name extensions that
you can register now co info and they're
saying that doesn't matter with with you
choose these days it doesn't really
matter although the preferred one is
still calm right but it doesn't have any
advantages in terms of the search
engines and turns of the traffic just
most people when you hear a name like
headphone guide for saying no think is
calm where it just sounds good exactly
but you know what how many times you
actually type out a domain name usually
you collect to it through a link right
yeah it doesn't really matter if it's
dot infonet etc before we go on is when
I point out there are something called
country codes country codes yeah so it's
so right dot FRS for France the country
France and then you have dot CA which is
for Canada this crazy canadians then
there's dot us which is for the u.s.
right now sometimes you can register a
country code and you don't have to be
living in that country other times you
have to be so for instance for dot CA
you need to have a Canadian address it
to be in Canada exactly but for other
country codes like dot TV it's for some
small country forget what it is but they
allow foreigners to register that TV is
a country
exactly i forget which one it contestas
mean hear something I I don't know what
it is there's a devil that lives there
so what we're going to do for you is
we're going to try to register v home
headphone guy calm ok let's try it so
its first we have to do so we type it in
we select calm and then we hit Search so
now it's going to check the database and
see if it's taken or not if it's taken
or you mean like if I ask a girl on a
date and I need to know she's taken so
if the domain name is taken you have a
couple options you can choose one of
these alternate extensions or you could
go for another name it looks like it's
taken well the dot-com is taken yeah
what happens to me all the time but
these extensions are available so that
means headphone guy dotnet is available
bismol be etc right but so but what if i
pick headphone guy that net isn't the
original headphone guy going to be upset
about it we might be upset about it but
he can't do anything about it because
it's a totally different domain name i
say because it's got a different
extension so what I think you should do
is maybe try another domain name but
similar with a calm right so forget
about this one maybe think about another
one there's other fish in the sea so
what do you have in mind ok well let's
say that I like headphones and I am a
man so if headphone guide com is not
there what about headphone dude calm
yeah so let's try it out yeah
I like that one so now we hit search
again we're here the system is going to
search the database to see if it's if
it's available it's probably taken so
congratulations it's actually available
what it's there I can't believe it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
