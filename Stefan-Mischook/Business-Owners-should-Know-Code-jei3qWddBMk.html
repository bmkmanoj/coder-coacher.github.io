particular episode I'm going to talk
about how important it is for small
business owners actually all managers in
business to run code they should learn
code even if they have no intentions of
ever writing code let me just give you a
quick story a friend of mine who runs a
company that does about 2 million a year
in sales it does very well he was
telling me recently that one of the most
important skills he ever learned was
just basic web design HTML not that he
has any time to build any web pages or
ability websites but since he has basic
coding skills and a basic understanding
of the process of building a website he
is much more able to make proper
business decisions regarding his website
and these days if you have a web
presence chances are you're going to
have a website some people are purely on
social networks like Facebook pages or
YouTube channels but not but at the end
of the day you should always first of
all have a diversified positioning Ian
social social media network so you
should have Instagram you should have
perhaps a Twitter should have a youtube
perhaps you should have a Facebook
except depending on the type of business
you have you should deploy your social
networking efforts accordingly I'll get
into that in another video I will get
into that now that said with all that
social networking in place you should
still have a website your own website
which you can direct people to and doing
that will give you some sort of basic
autonomy with regards to your web
presence you don't want to be solely
dependent on being on Facebook's
platforms or YouTube platforms I can't
tell you how many times I've heard of
people who had their YouTube channel
shut down
after the YouTube decided to shut it
down because they claimed or that they
violated some policy I don't know the
details the point is you don't want to
have all your eggs in somebody else's
business basket you don't want to be
dependent on some social network for
your entire online presence that said
you have to have some online social
media presence that's for sure by
stylish vest you should try to make your
website the focus of your social media
messaging so that people are aware of
your website and that's very important
that also allows you to take advantage
of traditional content marketing via
search engine optimizations and so forth
for your whole website again this is all
part of diversification which is one of
the basic business strategies one of the
basic strategies in life don't put all
your eggs in one basket so in this case
don't put all your eggs in the social
media basket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
