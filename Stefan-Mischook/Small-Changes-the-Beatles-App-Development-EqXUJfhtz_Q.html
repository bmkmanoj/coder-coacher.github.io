with a friend of mine who is a CTO of a
funded startup and they're making moves
and they seem to be doing some
interesting work now he was one of my
mentees if you will one of my students
and he worked with me for several years
and in fact he was one of the lead
coders in one of my core apps that I
have running today anyhow we were
talking about app development and
business development and one point that
kept coming up again is how incremental
and small improvements is how things
work in the real world so do I mean by
that well let's look at software first
of all so you build your app you come up
the idea rather you build the first app
and you get the first beta out there or
the first version out there for your
clients to see and as they start working
it as they start giving you feedback
that's when the real work begins in
terms of refining which your app does
and what you see over time is that app
development is about many small
incremental improvements will hear a
little here little here a little here a
little here a little here and what
happens over time as you see that all
these little tiny incremental
improvements have a huge impact in terms
of the quality of your app same thing
with business by the way business is
about coming up with your your big idea
or your basic idea which may change
depending on what the market tells you
but let's say you get an idea of that is
starting to get some traction so what
happens after that is again those small
incremental changes that help you to
slowly slowly slowly improve the quality
of your business so instead of thinking
that you're going to make some huge
changes which is going to have a huge
impact on your on your app or your
business it's actually small little
changes built up over time layered over
time at
the big difference so that's pretty much
it saturday night vlog I just felt like
relaying that message to you guys we'll
talk soon ciao hey guys actually have a
question for you let me know what you
would like me to do with the vlog that's
a small vlog we have like 13,000 members
or so in on this YouTube channel rather
so let me know what you think in terms
of what kind of content would you like
more vlogging content which would you
like me to go deeper into code into
tutorials I don't know let me know I
just put up a about 40-50 minutes of
JavaScript basics and I've been playing
around a little bit with the whole
vlogging idea nothing huge but anyway
just let me know what you think what you
guys would like to see and we will take
it from there I'll buy one last thing
