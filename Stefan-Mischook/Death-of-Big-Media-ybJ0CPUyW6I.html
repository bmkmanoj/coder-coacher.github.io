steph in this vlog we're going to talk
about big media the death of big media
and how this relates to your own small
business or business and even your
coding career don't worry I'm going to
stitch it all together for you people
watch me know well maybe you don't know
but I'm a big coffee drinker but I'm not
somebody who's into preparing coffees
all this kind of thing because I just
like to have my coffee Boone so what
I've done which will get very many a
greenie angries I use these Keurig cups
here I know if it focuses in on there
mmm anyway and so I just put this in my
machine boom a little coffee and then I
throw this in the garbage so then the
the environmentalist the greenie people
they get very angry about this now let
me just point out a few things I'm a
huge lover of nature and you know from
Canada and my father was a canoe guide
canoe capra guide when he was very young
and I've been on several big canoe trips
where you go from Lake to Lake canoeing
sometimes you have to carry the canoe on
your back to go on a trail through the
wood to get from one Lake to next so
I've done on it's more than one occasion
I take four three four or five times I
forget now where I've gone these two
week trips one week trips will we cover
20 legs 50 legs my biggest trip I did
with my father and my brother when we're
you know younger we did about 75 legs up
in northern Quebec or all your food is
on your back and you're going from Lake
the lake and there's nothing like
unspoiled wilderness wilderness that is
has not it you don't see too many humans
around it's just amazing experience they
highly recommend that you take time to
enjoy nature so I am a big advocate of
less pollution less waste and all this
kind of stuff but here's the thing about
the green movement one of my criticisms
a lot of the Greenies will point at me
and go staff look at this this your
curie cups you're damaging environment
meanwhile they'll have two cars will
spend a hundred thousand and renovating
their house several times they'll go
many many trips using the jet planes
instead of traveling around town so they
have huge huge carbon footprints
themselves but they ignore that and then
they get on top of my butt for using a
curie cup you know they'll replace your
car every four years you know i keep the
same car I'm gonna run my car for ten
years I love it I love my convertible of
course but I bought i buy things with
the intention of keeping them for a long
long time even furniture i buy very
high-end furniture and that's it i
bought them and i haven't thought about
repurchasing anything new replacement
i've had stuff for 10-15 years why
because when you buy the super high-end
they last not only in terms because
they're built with better materials so
if you want to be green by the high end
high quality and keep it for 15 20 30
years that's why i got my Eames chairs
and so on so there's an old expression
Pennywise pound-foolish so what I see
with a lot of the environmentalists and
the Greenies out there not all of them
but a lot of them the they criticize
people for minor things like my k-cups
which would take like a million of
I would have to drink like a million
copies coffees to t equal one renovation
in their bathroom in terms of the carbon
footprint you know what I mean so let's
say let's keep it real so anyway my
little rant about that sort of thing so
I was reading some articles about how
even now the NFL which is the biggest
draw on TV they're seeing their audience
drop quite a bit like ten fifteen
percent year-over-year and it's just
going to get worse because there's so
much other media that there's so many
other choices even the powerful NFL's
losing it now this goes to a basic
principle I spoken about in other blogs
the idea that you have to be ready to
adapt to the changes in the marketplace
so even the NFL is now feeling it
finally a traditional TV TV geo TV shows
traditional TV shows like you know
Seinfeld and all this kind of stuff
scripted shows they are falling like
crazy people are just not watching like
they used to and I've been going and
keeping them alive or old geezers like
me an older than me the Millennials and
so far if they'd rather be on social
media they'd rather watch YouTube
vloggers this is the nature of the game
now there's a lot of denialists out
there that's my word denialist people
who deny what's happening and these
denialist who are saying that TV will
never go away it will never go away but
it will be far diminished from before
like I have not had cable in like 15
years or something because I am why do I
have to adhere to their schedule when I
could just watch something on demand but
now through Netflix or YouTube or any
other video site and the fact of the
matter is I find that a user produce
content by small guys like me and I'm
not really I don't consider myself a
vlogger
I do this if you watch my videos why i
do this i don't i'm not trying to become
a big vlogger here but i just find
independent content producers to be much
more interesting than the scripted
corporate productions and i'm not the
only one trust me so so the NFL is
losing it audience is dropping and so
the media establishment is dealing with
this issue now here's the thing i was
watching a show recently we're talking
to Larry King I know if you remember him
it was the biggest talk show guy one of
the biggest years ago about his like you
know son Rick RT TV or something I know
it's not like I watch him very much but
he was talking to a new media guy
they're talking about how when TV first
started to rise and at that point
everybody would listen to radio when
people will listen to rate it will be
listening to radio at eight o'clock at
night listening to some radio show some
you know some drama or something and all
the radio people said no no no TV will
never replace radio they were wrong and
now the TV people are going on oh the
web you know well not are starting to
realize it they say two years ago now
web won't replace TV they're going to be
wrong people are not consuming their
media anymore I have like this giant
screen TV here and I may watch something
on that TV once every four months I'd
rather just watch something on my set my
tablet because Jesus there it's
convenient whatever once in a while put
on one of my big screen TVs but these
days I don't know if I'd buy a big
screen TV I have an old pioneer elite
the plasma six th it's you know in its
day was by far the best TV and it's
still very nice-looking TV but but I get
a new one I don't know so when you're
looking at your own business you have to
be mindful of the trends right now you
can fight a trend but you don't want to
be fighting in in a marketplace where
you got a bunch of established players
and the market itself is shrinking you
want to get you want to get out of there
as quickly as possible you want to find
yourself at a market where the pie is
always getting bigger so you have to
identify where those trends are going to
be and that could be as a software
developer as a coder you have to look at
where
the demand is in what languages and if
you're starting a small business or you
save a business you have to look at
again where the demand is in the sector
it excuse me in the marketplace easier
said than done sometimes but that's the
timing is a big issue because if you see
something coming and you jump into it
too soon and the market doesn't mature
fast enough you may find yourself in a
bad situation financially where you're
ready for a wave of change in the
marketplace but the markets not there
yet so you got no clients yet so you can
be very very careful about how you
proceed with this terms of coding
languages I've talked about this check
out my videos on you know what I learned
Python what I learn JavaScript what I
learn PHP etc etc etc and all these
things are very very their doable
options these days it just it just
depends largely on what type of work
that you want to do so there you go the
death of big media I think there's going
to be a rise of bond i think the rise of
small media producers such as myself of
a like I said my goal is not to become a
big bloggers out there and let me just
tack this on I talked about this in
another video whatever you do when
you're starting a new business don't
just rip off blatantly rip off somebody
else because if you're copying somebody
else unless you could do a much better
you're entering a world of pain trying
to copy these people who have been doing
this longer than you they got a bigger
audience than you they're more polished
and their approach when you get into the
marketplace you either have to get in
there with some new angle that's
significant enough that people are going
to want to look at you or maybe you're
getting into a marketplace where it's
just growing really really fast where
the demand is insatiable and that's
another thing again it's a judgment call
case-by-case basis but before you large
into a new business I strongly suggest
that you spend some time researching the
market that you want to get into to be
sure that
you could position yourself so that you
could be profitable in there and also
you got to be awesome you know in terms
of small business I know this is a long
blog here it turns a small business try
to keep in mind rather that typical
business takes two to three years to
establish itself before it becomes
profitable typical business two to three
years and if you're in businesses that
deal with institution it could be much
institutions rather it can be much much
longer so for instance you want to get
into the educational business which I'm
in now it takes five to ten years before
you before the average educational
company i'm talking about success
stories become profitable and has to do
with the nature of the way these
institutions work but i have to leave
that to another video because we're are
a leaven minutes cheers boys and girls
and i hope you found this log
