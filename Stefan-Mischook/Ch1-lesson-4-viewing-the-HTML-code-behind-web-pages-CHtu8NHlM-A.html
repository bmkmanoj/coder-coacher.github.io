this simple page we created with this
very simple HTML that we have here and
then we were looking at this much more
complex page which has images video and
all kinds of stuff like that drop down
menus so let's take a look at what this
looks like behind the scenes so one way
to do that is you right-click and you
want to select view page source so what
does this mean it basically means show
me the source of this page or in other
words show me what creates this page and
you know what creates every single web
page in the world of course is HTML with
the help of the CSS and JavaScript but
you need that basic HTML so let's view a
page source so here is all the code
that's used to generate the studio web
home page now there is a lot of code in
here and trust me it's complex even
experienced web developers web designers
would have to look through this there's
a mixture of code in here there's a lot
of HTML there's some JavaScript and
there is some CSS as well so I just
wanted to give you an idea of what it
looks like so we need to zoom in a bit
your first clue that this is an HTML
page is the first line here number one
you see doctype HTML so what does this
mean this means that this document type
because this is a document right it's a
page page of code is of the type HTML
and we'll get into more later now you
see these numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
these numbers are put there by the code
editor in this case we're using sublime
text and these numbers are telling us
now which lying this code happens to be
on so we're looking on
on line 25 we see that we have a the
link code now there you go so that's why
we have these numbers here these numbers
are put there by the code editing app
when we're using analysis of blaim text
they all do it by the way
they just had the numbers there just to
make it easier for you to know where you
are in the code so you might say to your
buddy hey check out line number 49 and
look at the code there so it just makes
it easy to identify finally I'm doing
these demos right now on Mac on an Apple
computer but it's the exact same thing
whether you're on Mac or you're on
Windows or on Linux coding in HTML
building websites is the same thing
there is no difference
HTML CSS JavaScript all the computer
languages in fact all of them not just
the web design computer languages the
web design computer languages are HTML
CSS and JavaScript but all computer
languages can be written on can be
created used rather on any computer
whether it be Mac Windows Linux or even
Chromebooks
whatever it doesn't matter they're
universal languages the only reason I'm
using Mac now is because it's just
convenient for me I use the Mac I have
better Hardware here but I'll do some
demos later on the windows as well just
to show you but it's the same thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
