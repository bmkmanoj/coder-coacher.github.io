look at our basic website and I know
some of the pages have changed and I've
cut it down so we have our index to my
plans page my work page and in the sub
pages folder I have my friends so let's
look at some code so here's the page and
I'm going to instead of use sublime text
I'm gonna right-click and then a view
source but before we do that actually if
you see here you notice I've added a
paragraph to the page and I've added our
list of links to our other pages down
here and I put their little visit Google
here so some minor improvements I guess
just this show that we do have an actual
website which is just a bunch of web
pages put together so let me view the
page source of the UNIX page
so I assumed in here a little bit so
pretty standard stuff probably briefly
talk about this paragraph here now you
see this pet with all this text this
mumbo-jumbo text is called lorem ipsum
and what this is is just standard filler
text text as designed to have no meaning
and it's just there to be able to use to
fill in pages that's why they call
filler because you're filling in use the
fill in pages so that people can see
what the page looks like with some text
in it here it is here all blown up let
me reduce that size so if you want to
reduce the text size in your web browser
you hit the control button and you hit
the minus symbol that zooms it out I
can't even make it Shizue - 33 percent
see how small it is or you can price the
plus which zooms it in that's what I've
been using so it's ctrl + to zoom in
control - to zoom out so yeah there you
go so let's look at our code again so
you look down here I have a paragraph
for each of our page links and this is
okay but this is not the best way to
create a list a list of items in HTML
HTML actually has list tags and I'm
going to show you how to do that in
chapter 5 and I guess that's pretty much
it I just wanted to show you a cleaned
up version of our basic website yes it's
very simple but that's okay it's your
first website and and I wanted to show
you lorem ipsum this actually goes back
400 years this tradition of putting this
particular text here and not for web
design you know cuz you know the web is
only 20 years old but 400 years ago they
were doing this even when they were
printing books and then they would just
put in this this type of text here
called lorem ipsum anyway you see every
now and then so now you know what it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
