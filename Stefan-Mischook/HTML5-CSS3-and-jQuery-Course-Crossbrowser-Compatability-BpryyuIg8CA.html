worked out for our very simple html5
page and if you'll recognize in the
simple little layout that we just
created what I have is you know a little
bit of a graphic on the body all of the
two column layout information the footer
clearing everything the way it's
supposed to now let's make this work a
whole lot better with the html5
environment so if you remember we were
now using these new semantic tags inside
of html5 now here's the only problem is
that older browsers will not recognize
what those tags actually are in other
words they don't know what you know a
nav tag is or a header tag is more
importantly they do not know to display
these html5 elements as block level
elements right now they just be like
inline elements and then that wouldn't
really work at all so our layout would
be kind of busted in in a lot of older
browsers especially so what I want you
to do is to go to the CSS style sheet
that we linked to our progress file and
we're going to add a little bit of
information so first thing I'm going to
do is to just put in a little html5
comment here well it's a CSS comment I
should say but I'm going to ask you to
write HTML 5 display rule now of course
this is just a comment you don't have to
write this but we're explaining exactly
what we're going to be doing here
so let's see we need to make those older
browsers understand what some of these
new semantic tags actually do or in
other words we want them to act the way
they're supposed to which means they
should be displayed as block level
elements so I could just put in the ones
that I'm working on currently so for
example the header the nav the footer
the section and stuff like that but I
often find that when you're working on
projects like this one you never know
when if
and surely you may later on add
something we're not using the aside at
this particular moment but I will be
using the aside more than likely a lot
later when we explore some things with
jQuery so I'd like to actually just add
as many of these new semantic tags as
possible as selectors and then we will
go about giving them a particular
property in value so there is the
address put a comma on that there is the
article which is one that we are using
well also use an aside eventually even
though we're not using it right now now
canvas is not something that we're
exploring at all in this particular
video although it will be covered in
other killer sites videos nevertheless
might as well get into the habit of
writing canvas in here as well content
is something that we were using details
is not something we're using but could
be used later
there's fig caption fit caption is
something that you add as a caption to
things like pictures and stuff like that
there's figure there's also footer I'm
trying to just do this alphabetically if
I can we also have a header you could
also have a age group like a heading
group these are all new tags that you
know most old browsers don't understand
we are definitely using nav we are not
using but we could if we wanted to use
menu don't forget to put in these commas
it's important that you do so when
you're defining multiple selectors so
the menu was something that we were
doing section is also something that I
want to be using and finally well not
using it right now but we may eventually
be using something like summary okay so
I've got quite a few selectors here then
I'm going to just come in here
we're gonna add some simple information
and the information will be to say let's
display all of these things as block
elements there you go and let's close
that so that's what we need to do to
make our html5 semantic tags our new
elements display properly display them
as a block level element so I'm gonna
save this that's great we could use this
now and it should work for the most part
however there's always one little glitch
related to earlier versions of Internet
Explorer now the current version of
Internet Explorer is not really
problematic because it accepts all of
these html5 tags and displays them
properly as block level elements but we
need a little bit of code that's going
to help us to make this work in HD in a
html5 environment if we are working with
older internet explorer browsers so
that's something we want to do so what
I'd like you to do is just go to Safari
or any browser for that matter
and let's just write in a little
something called html5 shim now as you
can see here Shiv or shim is are these
two things the same thing they
absolutely are the same thing so whether
it's a shim or whether it's the Shiv
it's all the same thing don't worry
about it so one has an m1 as a bead
nothing to worry about
so look what it says html5 ie enabling
script and it's part of the
code.google.com so it's part of code
Doc's from Google so if we click on that
and you'll see here html5 shim it's just
a little bit of code that has been
written and is made available under the
MIT or it's a you know common licensing
right is there a difference between
chamionship nothing right so as it says
there so here's what I want you to do
just copy this information and you could
see it's just Aiken
code comments sorry rather and it is
something that you will introduce
I'm gonna go back to my html5 code and
take a look right under our link but
before the closing of the head tag I
just want you to copy paste that
information in here and you can see that
comment right here so let's describe a
little bit of what it's saying here it
says if less than ie 9 I told you that
the current version of ie is great but
if it's less than ie 9 what do we do I
want you to load this little bit of
JavaScript and this little JavaScript
will create all of the elements inside
of older Internet Explorer browsers by
doing so we can be guaranteed that all
of the things that we defined here as
block level elements will also work in
earlier versions of Internet Explorer so
once you've got those two elements in
place your html5 semantic tags headers
and footers and articles and stuff like
that are all going to work perfectly not
only in the modern browsers but also in
older browsers at least they'll be
recognized and not just throughout your
whole design out of whack now the only
other thing I'd want to mention to you
when it comes to cross browser
compatibility and html5 elements is that
there is a wonderful little tool that
you can use to help you in this regard
and it's a little bit more complex or
complicated than the scope of this
particular course but I will bring it to
your attention as you progress and as
you get a little bit more comfortable
working in this environment what the
html5 shim or Shiv will do for you as
well as what we had done with our
display rules can also be achieved by
utilizing something called moderniser
and let's see how it's written
modern isay are moderniser err alright
and if we look at moderniser you'll come
to this little website here and you can
download moderniser the development or
the production you can configure your
own build and basically i'm
you to this website it's a completely
free website nothing crazy about it
notice it has some html5
excuse me css3 in here too and in order
to make these css3 elements as well as
the html5 elements that we're going to
be dealing with work in your browsers
then modernizers a good use of this
however don't be fooled moderniser does
not mean that if you implement
moderniser into your work that it's
going to automatically work on every
browser that's not true that's false in
fact but what moderniser does is it
helps you to work with elements like the
css3 that we're going to be dealing with
as well as the html5 shim that i
implemented in my work and you know the
declaration of putting things as a
display rule block instead of inline all
of those elements can also be achieved
by using moderniser we didn't need to
use it so that's why I'm not using it
but I will bring it to your attention
especially for those of you who are a
little bit more comfortable working with
more advanced ideas and features
modernizers a really good thing to help
you with this regard so you could take
advantage of it and you can see there's
a couple of other articles that are
based on it and some tutorials so I
encourage you to go explore this after
you've finished this particular video
and you can look at some new things that
you can do in css3 and html5 so build
the next generation of HTML 3 css3 and
html5 right that's an open source
JavaScript library so like I said we
don't actually need moderniser for the
things that I'm going to be doing with
this work but remember that if you
wanted to you could explore this and
implement it into your work as well
however do be aware that you know if
something doesn't work in a particular
browser moderniser won't make it work
moderniser is just a way of making the
browser react properly so that it sort
of defaults nicely in other words it
doesn't break apart on you and your
whole design doesn't freak out
and crumble in front of your eyes right
basically it's just saying look if this
doesn't work for this browser then just
ignore that and just display this as you
would in older browsers so anyways I
just wanted to bring that to your
attention before we move on to our next
video so when we come back we're going
to start implementing some css3
