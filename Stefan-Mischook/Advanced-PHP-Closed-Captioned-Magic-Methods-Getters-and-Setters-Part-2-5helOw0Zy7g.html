name for now we'll revisit that in a
minute this one is going to be called
it's going to be a public function and
it's going to be called call and call
takes in a name and it takes a
collection of arguments
happens is call runs whenever a function
can't be found in a particular class so
let's say I delete get address here if I
go back to killer PHP here and I echo or
I refresh you'll notice nothing happens
if I comment out this call function
you'll see that I get call to undefined
method blah blah blah blah blah get
address it can't find it but with this
call function we don't get any errors
anymore if I actually echo this then i
can say has been called and if i refresh
this again you'll see that call has been
called as echoed instead of you know
whatever the addresses so using this
approach we can dynamically create
methods in our class so in this case I
want to make sure that whenever I do
something that starts with get it
immediately gets called or it actually
returns the value of a variable so we're
going to write a little bit of code here
i'm going to create i'm going to
basically i need to give the method
prefix which in this case is a substring
of the name and we're going to go from
zero to three so if I just do an echo of
the method prefix we can see that the
bet that prefixes get if i go to echo
get a dress and I put you know XYZ
address then I'm going to get X Y Z so
basically it's just getting the first
three characters in the name of the
method the next thing I want to do is I
want to get the rest of the method the
the property that it's accessing because
there's there's quite an obvious
repetition here we could have get
address actually before we move further
I'm just going to create
first name actually yeah let's do first
name last name protected email so now we
have all these properties you could
imagine that if we had getters and
setters for all of this we would have
instead of a you know 10 or 20 line
class we would probably up to 50 or 60
or 70 line class so things would start
growing rather quickly and now i'm also
going to grab the method property now
the method property is in this case it
would be a dress but it could also be
first name or last name or email a
property is another way of saying it's a
variable sitting inside of a class or an
instance of a class so the property here
is address and right now we're going to
be getting the property dynamically so
i'm going to say method property equals
and i'm going to start by getting
everything after the name and the fourth
character so if i echo method property
I'll get dress which is very interesting
actually we want the third character so
that we get a dress which is great
except that we want this a to be a
lowercase address right we're following
a very strict naming convention here
it's called I think it's called camel
case or Hungarian notation or something
anyways it doesn't matter basically the
first character is lower case and then
if we want to have subsequent names or
nouns inside of our variable name then
they're also upper cased so in order to
do this properly instead of getting the
third character I'm going to get the
fourth character and I'm going to grab
the third character and I'm going to
lowercase it by doing STR to lower and
then I'll just concatenate the two so
now I should get a dress lowercase
so we're almost there the next step
instead of echoing the method property
is to actually just return it so I could
just say return this method property and
I'll get Eiffel Tower so you see instead
of actually going in here and saying you
know return this address I can actually
pass in a variable and it'll do exactly
the same thing which is really cool so
let's see if we can create something a
little more generic for handling all of
these cases I'm going to have we want to
return the method property in the
instance where something begins with
debt but we also want to have our
setters to work dynamically as well so
I'm going to get rid of set address here
and let's see if we can make that
dynamic as well to do that I'm going to
start with a switch statement and the
switch statement is exactly like else if
or else and if except that you're just
declaring it a little differently so
you'll see that you'll see what this
looks like in a second so a switch
statement basically allows you to create
different cases based on a particular
variable so if method prefix equals get
then we'll do stuff where method prefix
equals get and then we'll break and then
if the case is set then we'll do
something where the method prefix equals
set and then the default case in other
words it's anything but get or set we're
actually going to throw an exception and
throwing an exception is a way of
basically telling the you know the
programmer or the user or in basically
your your application that you know
something didn't go right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
