their surface pro and their surface book
presentations they just released the
surface book I think it was new then
surface pro with surface pro 4 and when
I saw the CEO the new CEO microsoft and
top guys and girls who are presenting
the products at the microsoft
presentation they were all kind of weird
people kind of strange people not in a
negative sense in a very positive sense
because what you'll find in life is that
typically it's the strange people the
unusual people that are creative people
and when I solve it the CEO and the top
people in the department's what kind of
characters they were characters cookie
characters I knew then that then in
there that they were going to start
coming out with even more and more and
more innovative products and here we are
a year later and you can see it
happening with the surface studio which
is really kind of cool device for
creative types they're continuing to
work on I think what they did with the
surface book their their upgrade it's
not revolutionary but they they did what
they had to do to really take it to work
it should have been and so on so forth
what you can see hollow lands another
microsoft thing you're seeing there
coming out all these new crazy products
really cool they're coming out with new
ways to interface to work with the
computer like that dial thing which for
me I don't see a use with it but I can
see that dial thing working really cool
for creative types and then you get to
sort of studio and pan work I can tell
you this from a guy usable who uses both
Mac and Windows Windows 10 they've
really come close to perfecting the
blend between a touch-based operating
system and a mouse keyboard based
operating system and also in terms of
the using the pen I use it all the time
I wasn't expecting to use it and I'm not
an artist i use it for taking notes i
use it for
jotting down ideas i'm actually going to
be using it now and some of my video
work and there's a whole bunch of other
uses for it as well it's just a very
useful tool and microsoft continues to
evolve and refine Windows 10 so that it
is really a very productive too we have
all kinds of different ways to interact
with your computer whether it be mouse
keyboard touch on screen pen and now
this dial thing it's all these different
ways where if you look at Matco as they
got a traditional mouse keyboard and now
they got their little touch oh they all
that strip at the top it doesn't compare
at all with what you can do with a
surface product with the touch screen
and the pan interface it's cited close
so yes Mac has a super solid product
very performant and efficient you know
that tight integration between hardware
and software they do some crazy amazing
things there SSD speeds rewrite speeds
are phenomenal I'm not sure what they're
doing there I pictured I guess sums were
a raid setup but anyway I haven't looked
into it so yeah back to the main point
of this video when you have unusual
people strange people quirky people
characters involved in projects you know
you're going to get some interesting
products coming out of those people
whereas you look at Apple the bean
counter types seem to have taken over
and as a result after three years or
they've what they came up with was the
touch screen and not the touch screen
but the touch bar at the top and I hear
some people say is actually pretty
useful but it's hardly revolutionary
it's a nice little addition perhaps oh
you know what I will give them the
benefit of the doubt I'm sure it has
some uses for sure but really laptop is
your sinner better but nothing really
groundbreaking if you want the
groundbreaking stuff now you want that
new way of interacting with the computer
and efficient manner
really you have to go to Microsoft now
that's where the action is strangely
enough all right that's it respect the
crazy people not crazy the strange
people they have something to offer
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
