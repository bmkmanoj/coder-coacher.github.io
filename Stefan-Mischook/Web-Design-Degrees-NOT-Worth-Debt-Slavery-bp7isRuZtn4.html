killer sites calm and killer PHP calm in
this quick little vblog I want to
comment on web design schools website
colleges what programming colleges and
the reason I want to comment on this
because i was reading an article
recently about people are in debt and
one of the people one of the individuals
rather this woman they were interviewing
was someone who lost her job and then
they decided to get into web design
because he saw an opportunity there so
she went to a web design college and I
guess she did a one you win your course
and she said she was now eight thousand
dollars in debt because of student loans
and so forth so my comment on this
couple things number one I am nothing
against web design schools or
programming schools what not for some
people if you need structure you place
the gall to learn then that might be a
viable option but I want you to know two
things number one if you're going to be
doing work as a freelancer or you're
going to be looking to work for a small
to even medium sized company a web
design degree or web programming degree
is not important at all they're much
more concerned about your skills I
didn't want to see a portfolio they want
to see what you've done keep that in
mind especially if you're a freelancer
and you're working for doing jobs or
small businesses and startups they
couldn't care less about a degree the
other point of what I make is that if
you're looking to get into the web field
whether it be programmer designer or
usability expert whatnot before I would
go out there and spend thousands of
dollars if not tens of thousands of
dollars jumping into a program i would
first explore the subject
either through online tutorials whether
it be the free written ones whatnot or
video courses we offer video course of
course yes I'm talking my book to a
certain extent but also you know we do
have schools who use our videos as well
as the basis of the courses so either
way it doesn't really affect us too much
as close but anyway I just want you to
understand that you don't have to go to
school in web program and web design to
be able to make a great living far from
it it's not like being a lawyer or you
know a plumber or something where you
need to get a certificate or something
that's not the case it can help in
certain circumstances but that's only
really if you want to work for let's say
a government agency or very large
corporations where they care about
pieces of paper like this so before you
jump in putting yourself into debt for
thousands if not tens of thousands of
dollars I would look at these
alternative routes save a lot of money a
lot of headaches and don't forget when
you get into student loan debt this is
non-dischargeable debt that means is
that that you cannot get rid of through
bankruptcy so it's ironic if you start a
company and you ran up a hundred
thousand debt or 50,000 debt or whatever
and doesn't work out you're going to
declare bankruptcy and you're done no
we're dead that's a good thing because
otherwise if you make debt onerous you
make that difficult for people nobody
would want to start a business because
it'll be just too risky unfortunately in
my opinion when it comes to student
loans it's not the case they've changed
the law in the US and I think in Canada
as well where if you find yourself and
student loan debt you cannot get rid of
it through bankruptcy
and they did this to prevent some abuse
of the system and so on but this is also
very dangerous because what you have now
especially in us because higher
education is so bloody expensive you
have a group of students X students who
are now effectively debt slaves they
have degrees but don't help them to get
work or the jobs that they get or just
that are pathetic in terms of their
payout to pay that you make and they
have these huge debts some of them in a
hundred thousand I'm to undersell if it
sounds amazing to me but that's the case
anyhow and they can't find work but it
can't get work that makes enough money
so now they got these huge debts they
can't get rid of him through bankruptcy
they're really screwed so yeah website
web programming I believe there's a
great future of that because I think the
economies are going towards small
business small business development and
every small business just about me it's
a website and somewhat programming so
it's a good thing to get into but I
would think a couple I think once or
twice before committing to a big bill
and I would also look at alternative
means of Education to save you from
getting into any of these type of debts
and these debt messes that's pretty much
it I'm going to try to do more video
blogs as going forwards you know this
isn't late August won't mid-august
rather we'll see how it goes depends on
how busy I am because we got a lot of
new stuff coming out so the whole new
way of training people coming out so I'm
pretty I'm pretty excited about that and
so it's taking up a lot of my time
besides of Theismann no that's it that's
the info on my time all right I'm Steph
mr. Keller Sykes calm killing PHP calm
if you have any questions feel free to
send them to me if you have tech
questions nerve questions anyway about
the video about any of the videos or
anything I advise you
suggest that you go to our forms there's
a lot more people that are answering
questions right away killer sites com /
forums anyhow thanks for watching until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
