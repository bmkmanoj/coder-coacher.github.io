our very first web page so first thing
you want to do is you want to go to your
desktop and we want to create a folder
to put all our web documents or web
pages etc you know images and so on into
so what I'm gonna do is right click and
I go new folder and I'm gonna give it a
name so I'm gonna say my killer website
here there you go now you can give it
any name you like it doesn't really
matter typically in a commercial project
I might actually give it the name in the
commercial project
I might actually give it the name of the
site that I was building so let's
pretend I was building killer sites calm
I call it and kill her besides calm
again doesn't really matter so in this
folder you now want to create a new text
document so then I'm going to right
click I'm gonna go to new and you got a
bunch of options here so you don't want
to choose rich text document you don't
want to choose word new word document if
you have word and you what you want if
you want a new simple text document just
text document so I'm gonna select that
and I'm going to call it my page dot txt
now if you're on Mac just create a very
simple text document to with text to
edit and you want to keep it in a simple
text format alright and if this is
confusing for you on Mac just check out
the back video on creating a text
document and that's by the way is the
only difference between but design on a
Mac and a PC if you don't see the dot
txt on Windows which you want to do is
you want to show file extensions now
what our file extensions file extensions
are anything past a dot
file name so we got dot txt here let's
go to my documents you see here I got a
dot RTF and I got a dot x AR anything
past the dot and these files are called
the extensions and the extensions
basically tell the computer something
about the document it tells the computer
what kind of document this is so in this
case with my page txt it's telling the
computer that this is a text document
txt is short for text if there was an
Excel document it would be dot XLS XLS
short for Excel some of you may not be
seeing the file extensions because your
computer is not set up to do it so to
display the file extensions you have to
tell Windows to do this and the way you
do this you go into folder options now I
can't show you this on screen because
the way my video is being captured here
will show you but just click the Start
menu at the very bottom of the pop-up
you're gonna see search programs and
files so you want to type in folder
options and you click folder options and
you can get to it from the control panel
as well if you go again Start menu
control panel so when you get to control
panel we're just gonna - for you you're
gonna go into folder options there you
go folder options so you click on that
and the folder options appears and what
you want to do is you want to go into
view the second tab you want to make
sure that just roll down a little more
than halfway see hide extensions for
known file types I just mentioned
extensions you got to make sure this is
unchecked if it's checked I'm gonna go
to apply you see my page it doesn't have
txt anymore now if I uncheck it hit
apply it appears now so that's what you
want you want to show the
densha's so that you know what kind of
files you're dealing with at this time
so now we want to do is we have our page
created just double click on it to
launch notepad in Mac of course that
would be text at it and let's actually
write some basic HTML code so just
follow along for now and I'll explain to
to you everything HTML there we go this
is the very first set of HTML tags we've
ever written together and so borrow you
I would pause the video and I write this
out right now do what we just did create
that folder create the text document
make sure you see your file extensions
etc and write this code HTML HTML so
well HTML HTML now you see something
curious here you see this this point T
bracket here point D bracket here pointy
bracket here
what do you bracket here except there's
a forward slash here it's leaning
forward think of somebody leaning
forward right
this four slashes on the same key
typically as where you have your
question mark it's a bottom right hand
of the keyboard so first thing we gotta
learn all these team out tags start with
the pointy bracket pointing left has
some text in it and ends with a pointer
you bracket pointing right so you got
this little case if you will think of it
as like a package and most HTML tags
come in pairs oh what's the tag well
here's the tag well here's the tag pair
the opening clap tag closing tag the
tags think of no tags on cows they are
tags price tags on clothing or on things
that you buy tags tell the web browser
what it is that you're tagging so in
this case this is the mother of all tags
the HTML tag this tag pair may come in
pairs opening/closing they come in pairs
and this tag pair tells the web browser
that this is an HTML page all right HTML
and it knows that anything in between
this opening tag and this closing tag is
gonna be HTML in there and that
basically sets up the web browser to do
what it needs to do you see each and
every web browser has an engine and this
engine understands the language of HTML
and when it sees HTML tags it then
starts processing those tags according
to the rules of HTML which the engine
knows about you see the support / that
is how you know that is the end of a tag
pair opening tag pair does not the
opening tag of a pair does not have a
forward slash but the closing does so
when the web browser so I could have
spaces like this doesn't matter so when
the browser starts to reading starts
reading a page from the top start
scrolling down bang bang bang bang hits
this tag knows is the tag because it
sees this it sees this it understands
what this is it knows this is the
opening of the HTML tag and then it goes
ok anything after this is going to be
HTML its HTML eh oh look there's another
angle bracket slash it says this is a
closing of the tag and it's easy HTML
and it sees this there this bracket here
rather so it knows that this is an HTML
set a set of tags and it knows it's the
opening this is closing and it reads
this accordingly so there you go so do
what we just did type it out and just
hit save for now not very exciting but
this is the beginning and you've by the
way you've learned what are the hardest
things about HTML just now if it hasn't
sunk in don't worry we're gonna learn a
lot more very soon and
it's all gonna sink in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
