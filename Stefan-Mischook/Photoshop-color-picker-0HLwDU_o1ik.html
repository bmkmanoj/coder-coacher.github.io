of Photoshop is the color picker palette
that you see right here in this palette
as you'll notice it also indicates you
the foreground and background colors
which are quite obviously right here I
can manipulate these colors by using a
slider using the RGB value by entering
it in numerically right here add more
greens and more blues notice if I was to
keep this all on one side we have
perfect black if we slide all the way to
the other side we get to our 100% also
notice that there can be add the ability
to pick colors just simply like this or
as you can see here I can pick out any
color I want similar to what we'll see
with the eyedropper tool
and in there you can just grab in the
colors that you want and in so doing you
can determine which colors you would
prefer for your foreground or background
colors also as with any of the palettes
that will have access to there's often
an options button right here this option
button allows you to do a number of
different things if we wanted to not
show any of the colors here we could put
this as a gray scale slider and allow
for any of these gray values you can
also change to CMYK web color sliders as
you can see here indicate web-safe
values but you should know by now if you
don't already that the web safe palette
which is limited to 256 colors it's not
something that we generally are overly
concerned with now in web design simply
because you couldn't even buy monitor
now that only supported that many colors
most monitors come with the support for
millions of colors so it's actually not
something you should be overly concerned
about but the option is here if ever you
do need to be that concerned so that's
the color picker and will now move on to
some other tools</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
