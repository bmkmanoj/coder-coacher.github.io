got an email recently somebody asking a
couple of new questions more career
oriented so I'm gonna read off part of
it and I'll try to answer as best I can
so the question is well I'm a thirty
year old guy my careers in heavy
industry I know the basics of how to
build a website however they aren't very
good looking sites and and I am also
only properly learning server-side PHP
database stuff I take in some interest
in laravel I'm just reading parts of the
email I'm also trying out some of the
more advanced front-end stuff like sass
or gulp flexbox etcetera so when he says
and I am also only properly learning
server-side PHP I I guess he's from the
UK so I guess that means that he's just
starting to learn it now he's starting
to put some focus in PHP and database
stuff now so that's that's what it is so
he goes anyway my question is basically
how should I spend the next six plus
months do I focus on PHP
beginner-intermediate do I build up a
powerful portfolio bitter sites apps etc
prove myself as a junior developer
without computer science degree I guess
that means should he go out there and
start trying to build sites well I think
it depends on what level skill you have
if you're a beginner with server-side
programming but jumping to a PHP
framework like laravel right now is
going to be too much to to consume at
this point one step at a time right so
before you go try to run the marathon
and you should try running you know two
kilometers first so if you're not
comfortable beginner's PHP basic PHP and
basic database operations you know crud
operations SQL that kind of stuff then
you got to learn that and then what you
should do is once you have that under
your belt then you can get into
valera Val of framework for instance and
start learning basic laravel but you
can't you know jump to laravel unless
you're very comfortable with your basic
PHP so you should understand object 1 -
PHP and the principles of Andhra of
object-oriented programming
you should understand you know just the
basics or you know functions are and be
comfortable creating functions using
built-in functions creating your own
functions with PHP and also you should
be comfortable of creating objects in
PHP on top of that you should become so
for SQL creating a database connecting
to the beta to the database doing the
crud operations
krytus bit short for a create write
update and delete these are basic
operations because when you're doing web
apps most business web apps have to do
with interacting with a database you're
just moving data from the web browser
user entered information typically into
a database and back out again and you're
filtering that checking for errors and
so on and so forth so you have to be
comfortable with this stuff
then laravel should you do client-side
stuff should you get into sass and
jquery perhaps bootstrap before depends
on what you want to do as a web
developer you're gonna need to know all
right of course you're gonna be very
comfortable HTML and CSS html5 css3 not
the whole skull but just a basic so you
can do layout because there's a lot of
stuff that you can do in html5 and are
very cool
and css3 very cool animated effects and
so on but they're not necessarily needed
in day to day but the key to all this
stuff and I keep saying this is to
understand the basics if you understand
the basics then all the more advanced
stuff become much more easy to learn and
much more approachable my experience in
the field is that even to this day if
you're looking to get a job as a
developer and you don't have a comp site
agree you don't have a computer science
degree then you're looking to do either
your own jobs as a consultant or working
for
a smallish firm which will hire you
based on the projects you've built so
step 1 learn your basics
PHP SQL MySQL be comfortable doing all
that PHP stuff I talked about you should
know basic JavaScript maybe learn some
jQuery another very popular framework so
I got bootstrap I should learn the
basics of the bootstrap grid system
which is the UI building system while
your page layout building system that's
quite big but if you get the grid you're
pretty good with that and yes you should
build small projects once you get
comfortable start building small
projects for sure for sure because
that's how you're gonna build your
portfolio another thing you should look
at is WordPress because WordPress is
used constantly especially in the small
business arena so you should be
comfortable installing WordPress
configuring WordPress and eventually you
should be able to build themes for
WordPress installing themes configuring
themes and building themes from scratch
this is where the work is and press by
the way is built with PHP that's one of
the reasons what are several reasons of
a big advocate of PHP versus Ruby or the
Django Python or or Java or what not you
know because you know between WordPress
Drupal Drupal and Joomla which are the
top three CMS's in the world they power
something like 35% of the world's
websites so there's a lot of work for
people who know how to work with these
these CMS's and if you able to work with
them ultimately to the highest levels
develop plugins make modifications work
on themes having a good knowledge of PHP
is pretty important so I hope that
answers a question get very comfortable
basic PHP concentrate on database and
database work work in and out of
databases create little crud type system
then when you're comfortable with that
then jump into MVC frameworks like
laravel laravel is probably the best one
to go with today although you're gonna
get some arguments but their bows is
definitely taking off or if it's not a
road if it's not already the dominant
PHP framework
I said client side a lot of demand for
JavaScript guys these days that's for
sure
but I think in terms of the general
public they're not going to be looking
small business they're not going to be
looking for guys who know just really
good edges like a little bit of
JavaScript they don't know why people
have the turnkey package to be able to
produce the site from a to Zed to
produce the web app from A to Z if you
follow those those things then you be in
a good position for sure with regards to
getting work as an independent
contractor or working for a small to
medium sized development firm because
you will not get into the huge
development firms these days without a
computer science degree or our
engineering Computer Engineering unless
you have a real deep portfolio of
material to work with I hope that
answers your question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
