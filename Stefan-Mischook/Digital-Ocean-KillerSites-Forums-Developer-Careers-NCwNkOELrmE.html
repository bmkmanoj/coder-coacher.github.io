couple things I want to talk about
number one as you know I host one of my
apps what are the studio web apps I host
on digitalocean digitalocean is a VPS
for virtual private servers highly
regarded generally speaking pretty good
services bare-bones though bare-bones
where I use another VPS that has much
more turnkey solutions not as much
freedom but I don't have to worry about
a whole bunch of stuff that I have to
worry about on digital ocean so it
depends on your use case that said about
a week or two two weeks ago the physical
droplets as they were called basically
my physical installation for my virtual
server the hardware failed and they had
to move me from Hardware be box excuse
me I had to move me from box a to Box B
box being the physical server which
surprised me because I assumed that for
Virtual Private servers they had a
cluster of physical boxes where they
were powering a whole bunch of nodes
like mine a whole bunch of virtual
servers like myself what in a box has
failed the other boxes would just take
long to load so it's a little bit more
primitive is from what I've seen at
digitalocean then I had figured that
said when they discovered that the
hardware was bad on the old box they
moved me to a new box pretty easily the
downtime was like nothing I think it was
just a couple minutes so that's huge
big advantage over traditional dedicated
servers which I had been using for 15
years that said I just got an email last
night from digital ocean but the new
boxes to put me on they're starting to
see hardware failures
there that's weird so I don't know if
I'm just having some terrible bad luck
or the studio web app is grinding
hardware to its knees which doesn't make
any sense but anyway just I wanted to
point that out I don't know I don't know
I'm unlucky I don't know if there's some
things
something going on at digitalocean
generally speaking I'm positive about
their services so I just a little heads
up there so next one I am finally
finally I talked about about a month ago
if you recall I was talking about
expanding the community that we started
here on YouTube and merging that
community perhaps with the killer size
community which used to be quite big in
terms of the forum and so forth and I
had but the forum will lock down a
couple years ago I believe it was
because I just didn't have time to
manage it to manage it and it was too
much spam it was this big headache so I
said forget it but now the company that
manufactures the forum that I used at
this point they've come out with a whole
new platform and they looked at far
superior capabilities in terms of
anti-spam far superior capabilities in
terms of people being able to join using
their social media accounts and whole
bunch of other things so it's really
cool so I decided to get the upgrade
done I initiate the upgrade so this week
this is the week of October 15th I think
it is we should have the new forum up
and running you don't have to go I'm
just pointing it out there's gonna be
lots of advantages to having a profile
on the forum where you're gonna be able
to start your own threads and topics and
so forth so you don't have to wait for
me to post a video to post questions get
comments and this goes to the where I'm
taking my public education vlogging if
you will part of what I do now just a
quick background I got back on YouTube
actively about a year year and a half
ago last July not to July but just
passed by July previous to that and I
did for two reasons number one I wanted
to get comfortable in front of a camera
like this and so I figured I'm just
going to do four through repetition so I
did almost a video per day not quite but
hundreds of videos I did as you know and
I also did it mean it's good for
promotion as well it also allows me to
test out different ideas see what people
like what people don't like it's a great
laboratory if you will not in laboratory
but a good way for me to throw out ideas
and get some feedback from people anyhow
so I am now taking my public work here
into the realm of outside of pure coding
and development into coding business
development entrepreneur career building
of a finance financial advice not
financial advice but financial skillsets
but which is related to career which is
related to business and then of course
the psychology behind behind all this
this is very important this is a main
bit coders discount and I did four years
as well they discount the importance of
these other factors in terms of you
being a great developer or a coder so
let me give you a very simple example so
let's say your typical developer you
know you know your stuff you know your
let's say your whip your full stack web
developers you know your HTML your CSS
or JavaScript in let's say you're
laravel person or maybe your nodejs
person or maybe you're a Django person
maybe you're Ruby on Rails person or
whatever it doesn't matter so then you
go see a client and a clients a small
medium-sized business owner which you're
going to be mostly your clients mostly
people who deal with and they have a
particular thing that they want to do
they want to execute on something
related to the web but there's all these
different routes you can take in terms
of that sorry about that the video just
stopped recording ghetto ATD anyway
so you're seeing this client
small-business client and there's all
these different routes that you can take
in terms of what type of website what
type of web app you can implement what
kind of
application you can implement so I'll
give you something a little bit more
concrete
so let's say the client comes to you and
they are deciding whether or not they
want they want to put up a new website
so given their business they're not sure
if they should just use something like a
weeks or maybe they should put up a
wordpress-based system or maybe they
want to go to a drupal or maybe they
want to do something from scratch maybe
they want to do web up a web app from
scratch and maybe they want a an Android
app as well an iOS app etc etc etc so
they're coming to you for advice about
this and yes you have to have the
developer skill set
not that you need to know how to do all
these things but you have your base
knowledge would say it's it's a peach
peeler eval and or it know just you have
a script so you have this base knowledge
and then you should have a little bit of
knowledge about these other areas just
so you know when they make sense to
implement that's all just so you know
when they make sense to implement and so
you may decide based on what the client
comes to you with that might make sense
to do it note and do a web app it might
make sense to do an Android app it might
make sense to do iOS app am I who knows
right now the great thing from a coding
perspective from a software development
perspective if you have that solid base
that mastery of the fundamentals that I
talk about all the time then if you
let's say a node.js programmer and you
say well we actually got to do something
we gotta do an Android app for them
because of they want an Android app I'll
get into this in a few seconds what how
you determine that well because you have
your foundation solid for you to jump in
and learn Android development will be
pretty easy you could probably do it
pretty quickly maybe you can get an
assistant to help you on the gig I enjoy
going guy or girl and then all of a
sudden you could you know you work with
them and within a week you're gonna be
up and running writing good cold write
because if you're good coder you're good
coder doesn't matter what platform you
happen to be developing on so let's back
up you have this situation you have
clients coming to you whether it be your
freelancer whether you're working for a
firm and the client is some other part
of a big business if you have at least
some basic understanding of business
considerations how the suits think how
they operate how businesses work and how
things are evaluated priorities and so
on you're gonna be a much better
developer because you're gonna be able
to understand their point of view at
least a little bit better than you would
otherwise
so you can make a better evaluation as
to what is the best choice for them so
you can help them bridge that gap that
gives you a communication layer that is
lacking with a lot of developers and on
the flip side I tell business owners you
should learn at least a business the
basics of coding not to be a coder but
just so you understand the web you
understand what hTML is and CSS it's a
it's the basics just understand a little
bit about programming understand about
client versus server about about
dedicated apps for Android iOS for
instance mobile apps versus web based
app very basic you can learn this with a
decent beginners course every business
owner should learn this and a good
friend of mine who runs a business of
this to three million a year in sales he
says one of the most viable skill sets
he ever acquired was just basic HTML CSS
because it just gave him a perspective
about how the whole the web thing works
and you know any business these days has
to have a website they have to
understand web and having a presence on
the web and of course this guy that's
nope he's not gonna write a websites or
anything but when he speaks to his
professional is visible of developers as
web designers he hires on occasion to
update the site's update his systems
he's able to speak to them much more
intelligently and understand where
they're coming from because he has that
basic understanding of code same thing
with this
you have may have no interest in
becoming an entrepreneur you may have no
interest in being a business owner but
if you understand a business owners
perspective you will be a better
developer so to conclude this video long
one when the forum new forum software is
installed running clean I'm going to be
suggesting people go there no cost and
establish your profile there the forum
gets about 40-50 visitors now you know
it's been dormant every 15 minutes half
an hour I forget now and that's dormant
you guys have sent killer sites calm
gets about a million page views a month
if I recall like my my top 4 site Killa
site CSS tutorial killer PHP how to
better web sites together we got about 2
million pageviews per month and this
really hasn't been my focus for years my
focus has been my app my educational app
or institutions studio web I'm getting
back into that I'm going to develop that
and develop that community it's good to
get into a community like that
so actually something has some some some
establishment there right Joe sites been
around since 1996 the killer sites calm
was one of the very first sites in the
world that actually taught code by the
way 1996 it's put out by was put up by
David Siegel who wrote probably the
best-selling book on Web Design in the
90s creating killer websites was
published in nineteen language isn't he
established his whole career anyway so
getting getting on the farm interacting
with people see how it goes it's just
good for reputation and I've had many
people tell me over the years on the far
as little was up very active if people
got lots of jobs and made lots of
contacts make good friends on the farm
because they develop a reputation so the
new forum software has a place where you
can develop your reputation and you can
do all these kind of things and just let
you know the farm is not going to be
dedicated purely to code I'm really
going to be being
in the business element I'm gonna be
bringing in the social media marketing
element I'm gonna be bringing other
elements into it for a discussion
because to be myopic and just to be
concerned about coding and tech it's
limiting you and your career your
business opportunities you want to have
a broader vision and I will really
maximize the opportunities for you there
we go
hey guess what the camera did not shut
off again fantastic
