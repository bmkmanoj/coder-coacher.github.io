clean when you start a project what
should you do to prevent your code from
becoming a total disaster the first
thing you got to do is you got to set up
protocols you got to set up certain
protocols within the coding to make sure
that people follow these protocols
what's the protocol things like naming
conventions in terms of variables files
database tables and so on so you wanna
set up a protocol in that regard that
will go a long way you set up certain
rules like no God methods you know if
you see there's more than three or four
things that a particular method does a
particular function does then you as a
protocol you've got to break it up into
simpler functions no massive classes as
well another thing you can do is you can
have a senior developer who you trust
maybe that's yourself maybe it's
somebody else who does a code review
maybe once a week just to go over things
before it gets too big and stupid
another thing you could do is you can
start using framework so let's say we
are doing a web app so when you're
building a web app of any decent size
you're going to be using one of the
popular frameworks better out there and
you want to use one of the popular ones
so that you don't find yourself in some
sort of niche barely use technology
where it'll be a very difficult to find
somebody to work on it so if you're in
PHP you would probably these days use
laravel if you are in Java you would use
Java spring if you are in the JavaScript
on the server side you probably would
use nodejs and on top of that expressed
yes now this will change with time and
depending on what's popular what's in
depending on the circumstances but by is
using a framework that is well defined
this forces a set of protocols a set of
rules for your programmers to work with
it so that's another thing and finally
and it goes along with the protocols
again I use the word protocol loosely it
can't think of a better term but another
thing you
do is set certain design patterns that
you insist upon so when you're using a
framework like a lair eval for instance
the main design pattern for a web app is
MVC model view controller and they use
that in iOS app development and all over
the place so that is a pattern you can
specify another design pattern you can
specify is no inheritance in your
objects rather you use interfaces that's
one thing you can specify you can look
at different patterns perhaps they but
are your favorite design patterns in
code that you would want to have
implemented on a consistent basis with
some exceptions with every rule there
are always exceptions keep that in mind
when I was much more active in
developing apps I would always use MVC
model view controller i would use filter
the filter pattern a lot which is in the
java spring framework that would be
dependency injection in java servlets
that would be called they would call
these servos filters and that's because
I just imagined all my apps as being a
flow of data kind of like a river of
data so when you use filters the filter
pattern you're filtering the data you're
injecting a filter at different points
to modify the flow of this information
and that's how I looked at it so i would
use MVC i would use server filters which
is kind of like dependency injection but
on the servlet level you don't know so
servlets are they are the basic
structure of a dynamic web app in the
Java world you don't have to worry about
that only if you get into Java and
there's a few other lol like using
facade a lot but so these were to be
three main patterns of that I would use
over and over and or all these obviously
designed by interface rather than
designed by inheritance and I've talked
about this in other videos so there you
go keep it cold clean by at the very
start of the project you set up certain
standards certain protocols
which everybody should adhere to and
maybe on a weekly basis do a quick code
review to make sure nobody's going nuts
go and nobody's going off on a tangent I
hope that helps alight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
