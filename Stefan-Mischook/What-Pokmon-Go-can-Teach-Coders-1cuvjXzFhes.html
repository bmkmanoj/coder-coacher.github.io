video I figured it would make sense to
look at coding from pokemons point of
view why because Pokemon is popular now
and I think Pokemon and Nintendo in
general has some great lessons to teach
coders and app developers so let me just
go over the first four bullet points a
number one Pokemon uses a great simple
to use UI number two great usability
seems that it's pretty simple to use
people really like it they're getting
into it notice that there are no
groundbreaking amazing graphics to
require crazy engines to process yes the
graphics are nice it's very pleasing to
the eye but the success of the Pokemon
goal game
doesn't have to do with whether or not
it can run 60 frames per second or or
you know how beautiful the graphics are
it's literally all about gameplay it's
all about content which brings you back
to the most important rule when it comes
to any piece of entertainment and apps
and games especially of course it's all
about entertainment content is king and
it will always be king so you can have a
game for very simple graphics and it
will still be a smash hit like crazy
simple things like a flappy birds and
you still have a smash hit because the
content for whatever reasons is very
compelling another aspect to the pokemon
game that I found out that it's very
compelling for people as a social aspect
right is the ability for people to go
out there meet other people that are
like-minded and so on so let me give you
a quick story I don't play
oh c'mon just as a background I'm
nothing against it it's just not
something I've looked into but yes so
I'm at the grocery store and the clerk
young guy figure 20 year old guy young
for me and he goes how did a blue I
didn't say anything he goes to me yeah
so this you know you don't want to waste
your time on a sunny day like this
playing Pokemon and I looked at it I
said well why not
they said I said you know what's the
dream Pokemon in hockey or watching a
hockey football baseball basketball or
any of these things so then of course he
opens up and he starts getting getting
into the whole thing about Pokemon how
he plays he loves playing it running
around and he really expressed to me the
the fun the social aspect of it the fun
aspect of it and then he brought up the
fact that it could be I think later on
or soon you'll be able to trade your
pokemons and so on which will add
another level of addictiveness to the
game so let's look at this from an app
developer a coders point of view again
to to stress you have a wildly
successful game not because it has
amazing groundbreaking graphics or
amazing groundbreaking physics no it's
the content is very compelling itself in
a compelling way that's something at
least for myself as a coder I would
sometimes get trapped in that mindset
that the solution to the problem because
remember when you're writing software
you're you're trying to come up with
solutions to problems sometimes the
problem is just entertaining people
sometimes it could be some sort of
business problem anyway a lot of times
as coders our inclination is to think in
terms of how we can write code or put in
a system or engine to solve the problem
where a lot of times the problem can be
just content presentation it could be a
story that you present it really depends
on the circumstance now this just
doesn't apply to games in absolute I've
developed that have nothing to do with
gaming it came down to that as well we
were working on
a software solution to solve a usability
problem and the usability problems
ultimately solved by just better
instructions better use of words in the
apps of any that they made more sense it
was simple as that
so keep that in mind another thing that
the Pokemon game makes use of it's
something that I'm gonna draw from my
site call my psychology experience in
background in university my major was
psychology one thing I learned from
probably the most important class and I
did it in my undergrad was something
called the mixed variable payoff matrix
the mixed variable payoff matrix okay
this is a nerd alert I'm going deep into
the rabbit hole of psychological
nerdness the mixed variable payoff
matrix is very important in terms of
making an app making a game addictive
and what the mixed variable payoff
matrix is is a mechanism that's kind of
hardwired into the brains of just about
all animals this is something discovered
by this guy named Skinner BF Skinner I
think it's name was BF I think it was
but anyway his laws in the Skinner you
can read about him he's one of these
guys who tried to figure out what caused
animals to want to do things and this
falls under a category of learning
theory so anyway long story short what
he discovers that if you take a rat you
put him in a maze and you put a piece of
cheese on the end of the maze and he
said go rat go go go go for your cheese
and what he discovered is that if you
fed the rat the same type of cheese the
same piece of cheese every time the rat
would get bored of going through the
maze and he wouldn't be so incentivized
to do a maze but what Skinner discovers
that if you change the reward randomly
you would it was much more likely that
the rat would want to go through the
maze so some one time to wrap might get
there and might find you know
one cube of cheese another time a get
there you might find two cubes of cheese
another time you might find ten cubes of
cheese another time you might get there
and find no cheese they might change the
cheese so that's what you would call a
mixed variable meaning it's mixed it's
variable and it's a payoff matrix in the
case of the rat and maze the payoff mate
the payoff is the cheese right so by
changing the frequency and the amount of
payoff there maybe it's very addictive
to whether it be rats pigeons and humans
that's why gambling is so addictive for
a lot of people that's why fishing is so
addictive do you think about if one
thing that's in common between pokemons
fishing and gambling is the mixed
variable payoff matrix right the gambler
plays because then they never know when
they will win that hand and they never
know how much they'll win a lot of times
they'll lose does it matter to keep
playing cuz it's very addictive to get
that win they get that higher the win
the same thing was fishing you go
fishing you never know when you cast
whatever you're gonna catch a fish or
not you don't know how big the fish is
gonna be what kind of fish is gonna be
that's why people love fishing it's very
it's hardwired into our our brains
now pull your man as far as in sense
similar thing right you go around you're
looking around for pokemons you never
know where you're gonna find a poking
man you don't know if you're gonna find
a super valuable Pokemon it could be a
very rare one it could be a common one
there's pokemons that you can only find
in certain parts certain regions so if
you're near a large body of water you
apparently you got water pokemons and
yada yada yada so you see how the
brilliant people at Nintendo who I would
count out every now and then wrongly
they they understand that very well they
understand mix variable payoff matrix
the understand the content is king think
about when they came out with their Wii
and this was an underpowered console
relative to
Xbox and the PlayStation at the time and
everybody said how these guys are done
but instead of relying on powerful
processors and beautiful graphics they
said no no we're gonna rely on unique
gameplay and it was wildly successful
for the time that it was out although it
didn't have the longevity as the the
Xbox and the ps3 and so on but here they
are again they come out with an
ingenious game that works on the basic
principles of great UI great usability
great content and the mixed variable
payoff matrix and they have a wildly
successful game where people are running
around cities and so on that's why I
took that video of me I was driving
around just so I went to dim sum off a
friend of mine and he said the adders is
a Pokemon Center I think they call it
where everybody hangs out there because
they've been told that there's a lot of
Pokemon door hanging around there so it
gets people out of their houses running
around and chasing after these virtual
creatures it's amazing it's amazing and
you know what I'm not making fun of
these Pokemon people why not if you you
know at least are getting out there
being social of meeting people they're
doing things there's nothing wrong with
that it's no different from people get
together to play game of basketball or
hockey and people who are walking bass
well you get your sports you're getting
shapes yeah yeah yeah that's true but
they're all just games anyway right at
the end of the day whether you're
capturing pokemons or whether you're
trying to get a puck into a you know
hockey you're trying to get a puck into
a net or a bad a ball into a basket by
the way those two games Hawking
basketball to Canadian games just just
just to mention that anyhow that's my
take as a coder you don't necessarily
need to have the most powerful the
latest and the greatest in terms of the
technology a lot of times it's good
old-fashioned usability content
nice-looking UI that wins the day I hope
you found this useful
new style video
and because it's Sunday afternoon I want
to go out and chase after pokemons I
didn't use my fancy camera so we have to
deal with the webcam I'm not going after
pokemons I'm just going out to relax all
right we'll talk soon ciao guys I almost
forgot my album of the day so here it is
this is Jimi Hendrix access bodes as
love this is a vinyl standard vinyl
pressing but the the North American
European vinyl pressings of Jimi Hendrix
albums tend to be really good this is an
amazing album this is his third album
and he did after another amazing album
called Electric Ladyland this is
considered one of the best albums of all
time
it's a bluesy album a little of some
psychedelic elements in there and it's
got some amazing songs like little wing
and bold as love and some great jams in
there but a lot of people don't listen
to a lot of times when you hear Hendrix
on the radio you're hearing the big hits
but he's got a lot of great tunes but
they're not necessarily big hits but
they're just really good jam so my third
recommended album Jimi Hendrix access
bulldoze loved great album check it out
whether you download the mp3s or Spotify
it or whatever or get the vinyl as I
have here I hope you enjoy it
ciao guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
