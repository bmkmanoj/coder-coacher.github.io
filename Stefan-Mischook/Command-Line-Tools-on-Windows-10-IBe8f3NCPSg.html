anger towards the macbook pro 2016 which
i think overall is a bit overblown to be
totally honest with you yeah it's
expensive but you get you got to
consider the Apple resale value which
you should factor into your price as I
discussed in another video you're
looking at about a fear thirty percent
perhaps you can get back on your mind so
consider that anyway macbook pros are
very popular with developers because it
has built-in command line tools and
these tools are quite useful when you're
interacting with servers because most of
the servers out there but people use our
Linux base and yes it's Mac OS is based
on freebsd unix you got all the command
line tools built right in so it's kind
of cool it's all integrated so the
people at redmond the Microsoft people
who are now awake and responsive to the
needs of their client based seems like
apples starting to go to sleep and
Microsoft's waking up it's kind of an
interesting switch of things these days
anyhow so basically Microsoft is now
considering that and the provided apps
that allow you to install bash shell
commands command lines excuse me
Microsoft has included an app that
allows you to install bash shell command
line 2 into Windows 10 and i just found
this article is published a few months
ago something to consider if you're if
you are a developer who's a little angry
at Apple and you're looking at perhaps
the surface pro or a surface book I also
check out the vaio campus to file canvas
computers if you want a hybrid
touchscreen kinda like the surface pro
which is an excellent computer and you
also look at the canvas vaio scuze me
flip i think it's call which is their
convertible which is very cool
cheap these vaio computers are super
high-end premium and they're right up
there with apple laptops in search terms
of price and frankly so RVs surface
Pro's with a heavy-duty chips and
processors receive it when you load them
up with the big processors and the big
SSDs and they're all kind of neck and
neck if you want premium build products
will be apple or on the windows side of
thing you're going to have to pay money
for it yeah so basically Windows is paid
attention to what developers need and
they're providing all these tools so yep
you can have installed bash of bash and
you have a develop developer mode and
it's all there and cool cool cool I
haven't used it because I have an apple
that's what a reason I had my apple
computer because I have certain absolute
I'd like to use to interact with our
servers that being said I've been using
Windows 10 since it came out I bought
this surface pro about a year ago very
happy with the computer when the macbook
air came out the first macbook by the
second macbook air not the weird curves
one but the straight one I bought that
one and to me the macbook air was one of
those seminal products was one of the
first or probably the first SSD based
laptop but I was aware of and it was
just a game changer how perform at that
little laptop was and it still holds a
special place in my heart I think the
mac book air was an amazing innovation
or an advancement rather in computing
and laptop computing and why do I
mention that because I feel that the
surface pro with the sticky pen and the
kickstand is and in the high-end cameras
like this webcam is a really good webcam
like much better than what you're going
to get on the max and yeah it's just a
great and of course its touch so it's
just a great computer and to me this
surface pro is the equivalent
is the 2016 equivalent of the old
macbook air so hopefully a little
competition will wake Apple up and I
just wanted to point out the whole point
of this video's that you do have the
ability to install bash shell command
line tools in Windows 10 so if you're a
developer and you're worried about that
your lack of command line tools and
windows do not worry it is there there
other options as well by the way all
right that's it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
