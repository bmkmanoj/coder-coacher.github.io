about the origins of the Python
programming language now in the last
vlog I put out my Friday mailbag vlog
somebody said Python the language it's
not named after the snake now
technically they are this person was
right and technically they are wrong so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you what we're gonna get into a
little bit about pythons creation story
just very quickly because you know how
exciting can the creation story of a
programming language be right all right
well so let's get into it so here we are
at the Python website Python or this is
where you come to download Python so
let's let's zoom in let's zoom in here
you notice the logo the snake snake two
snakes back-to-back right so yeah
there's two snakes originally the
Creator Python did not name the language
after snakes the community has basically
adopted a snake or a couple snakes as
its logo so let's get into it a little
bit here python programming here we go
this is a Wikipedia page so see here
this guy here with the Google shirt on
drinking beer this is the founder or a
creator of Python this guy a Guido Guido
van Rossum and yeah so what happened
here's a quote from the guy and he
basically decided over Christmas but he
needed something to do so he decided
I'll start inventing a programming
language so this is classic nerdness and
nerds like to write code now he named it
after Monty Python because he was a big
fan like all nerds at that time you see
in the 80s 70s 80s early 90s if you were
a nerd it was almost required that you
enjoy
monty python which is this british
comedy group so it says right here i
chose Python as the working title for
the project being being in a slightly
irreverent mood and a big fan of Monty
Python's Flying Circus which was a TV
show
so let's go to here here it is Monty
Python these are the guys here and he
also did a bunch of movies in their day
anyway see see this guy right here
one of the founders here and I forget
his name
this guy dad this guy's dead john cleese
he's still alive but anyway this guy
right here
and it was his name it's uh Terry Jones
there's a Michael Palin anyway whatever
so this guy right here I saw him in an
interview but he gave years ago and
you're asking about the origins of the
name Monty Python and it had to do you
can look it up on youtube if you want
but basically what it came down to is
that they needed to come up with a name
that was funny strange and something
that the TV executives would consider
acceptable and they thought that Python
was just funny with Monty Monty Python
and in the interview he mentioned they
were thinking about different animals
cats and hippopotamus or something like
that and they came up with Python so
though the Python programming language
was not directly named after Python the
snake because it was named after Monty
Python the this comedic group from UK
from the UK
you could argue since they were thinking
of all kinds of animals and they just
came up with Python if you wanted to be
nerve precise and I know how nerds like
to be precise if you want to be near
precise it seems pretty clear that the
people from Monty Python named Monty
Python partly after the Python animal
the snake because what you know Python
is not some word that means nothing it
has a meaning it's they're tired about
this type of snake so there you go so
that's why I'm using this big green
background here
snake and I may use other snakes as well
I may use other snakes now if I could
use Monty Python as visuals for the
course I might do it but actually prefer
a mistake because my studio of course is
if you done in any of them you know I
tend to use animals frog spiders some
other animals sheep you know so why not
use a snake given the situation I also
cut got this cool snake mug as a prop
for the course so I'm not going to get
rid of this mug and get a Monty Python
mug even though this is a rattlesnake by
the way I couldn't find an actual Python
mug so very habit folks
Python and the programming language
which is at version 3.6 as I speak was
originally created in 89 I guess by this
guy who was a big fan of Monty Python
which was a British comedy group and not
necessary directly named after snake but
the community and as you saw the Python
logos actually two snakes back-to-back
so there you go so that's my response to
bet nerd who was in indignant and
offended by the fact that I had a snake
background when I was talking about my
Python course which is it's going to
start rolling out pretty soon by the way
all right bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
