short for structured query language and
it is the language of relational
databases now a relational database is a
type of database there are several types
of databases out there there are
flat-file databases which are just text
files there are object based databases
objects as inter as in object-oriented
programming then there are relational
based databases relational based
database databases are the V most
popular by far and away there are other
types of databases as well but
relational based databases are the most
popular
some people just simply call them the
SQL databases why because the structured
query language SQL is the language of
relational databases
there are many relational database apps
out there mysql probably the most
popular there's PostgreSQL there's
Microsoft sequel server Oracle big one
and several others as well
for whatever reasons SQL based databases
are by far the most popular and if you
are going to be doing web app creation
and a lot of mostly web app creation
you'll find yourself using relational
databases all the time all the languages
by default pretty much support
relational databases whether it be PHP
asp.net c-sharp ruby ruby on rails or
Django Python you name it if you're
going to be doing database work a lot of
the times I would say with the web maybe
95 percent of time you're going to be
doing it with a relational database big
blogging engines like WordPress Drupal
Joomla they're all based on relational
databases well these three apps are
written in PHP and when we're talking
about PHP PHP is the most popular
server-side web app develop
the programming language in the world
very powerful very fast very easy to
learn compared to other languages I'm
not saying it's the best language
overall you watch my videos where I talk
about all this but in terms of web it's
the King and Drupal Joomla WordPress
these three incredibly popular content
management systems but a lot of small
and medium-sized businesses even big
businesses use they're written in PHP
what this all means is that since so
many businesses run run WordPress Joomla
and Drupal that means that PHP is here
to stay and it also means that SQL based
databases are going to be here to stay
for a long time well trust me you don't
need to pout Joomla WordPress to keep
SQL databases up and running let me give
you a quick rundown an SQL based
database otherwise known as a relational
database is an app that stores all your
data in the form of tables so a table
you can think of it as like a
spreadsheet like Excel spreadsheet or
Google Docs spreadsheet and you have
table you have columns you got rows and
what a relational database does it
stores its data in a bunch of tables and
you might have a table of all your
client information another table of all
your product information another table
with all your sales information so let's
say you have an e-commerce shop and
you're selling bananas apples and kitty
cats and you have clients will come in
they make purchases so you got to keep a
record of all your client information
your name or first name last name a
dripping address a credit card and
credit cards and with what orders
they've place so you'd have the table
for all your clients and then you'd have
another table with listing all your
products and then you have a yet another
table listing all the sales you made now
it's called a relational database
because the way these databases are
structured besides being in tables that
look like Excel spreadsheets these
databases create relationships
between one tables information and
another tables information so very
simple example if you have clients you
have a table with all the client
information you have another table with
the orders that have been placed on your
store so you would create a relationship
a connection between the order that your
clients created that you have listed in
your client tables you have your client
table of all your clients so you got
staff who came to started by a dozen
bananas so you have steps all of steps
information in the client table and then
you have another table where you got all
your order information in there so
you're going to have in there all the
things that I bought in that table
probably have another table to bat snow
story but anyway so you have your orders
table but you're not going to keep all
the information about your client in
your orders table and there's all these
reasons for that these technical reasons
well I won't get into the house I'm not
here to teach you SQL just to give you
the basic overview so you would create a
relationship between the order record my
order for my bananas I bought from you
you would create a relationship between
the order my order in the orders table
with my record my information in the
client table you create these
relationships and it goes on from there
so understanding SQL or relational
database theory how to structure your
databases and so on how to how to manage
your information is something very
important but you have to learn so
regardless of the language so if you're
getting into web app development and
many other types of apps as well by the
way a lot of cell phone apps smartphone
apps will be backed by relational
databases as well and so on so forth so
if you're getting into app developer
chances are you're going to have to
learn database not only the SQL language
but you also which is the language is a
coding language by the way that's used
to communicate with these databases but
you're also going to have to learn how
these databases work how to basically
construct these databases so that
they're structured properties of the
information
and can be managed properly but anyway
that's a whole other story I talked
about this briefly or morbid briefly in
another video so there you go should you
wear learn SQL in 2016-17
chances are highly likely given what I
just told you you don't have to be a
database administrator they call these
people DBAs you don't need to become a
DBA but you really need to know at least
the basics and should know how to design
a database and you should know the basic
commands in the SQL language to be able
to interact with the databases with a
database these basic commands are often
referred to as crud operations create
read create a record read record update
a record delete a record that's correct
see are you d anyway I hope that helps
yes SQL you got to learn it so whether
you're doing PHP Python Ruby Java
doesn't matter c-sharp if you're going
to be doing many types of apps
especially web apps chances are you're
gonna have to learn relational databases
