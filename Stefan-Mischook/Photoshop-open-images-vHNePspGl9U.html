image inside of Photoshop and once we do
that then we can proceed in how to work
with that image and manipulate it to the
best of our abilities first and foremost
what we're going to need to do is to
access an image well you'll notice that
in the file menu you can try to open a
file and do take note control o is the
shortcut for open and if we were to do
that I could direct you to go to your C
Drive and in your C Drive find your
program files and in the adobe program
files you'll see photoshop cs2 in
photoshop cs2 you'll see samples and you
can work with any of the samples that
you see here for the moment we can take
a sample ducky that's a perennial
favorite in Photoshop so as you can see
here we've got ducky in place and at
this point we can manipulate this image
do different things to it but as you
probably have noted there was only a few
select images that you were able to
access in the sample folder however
Adobe does give you something that you
can work with as well if you go to file
browse instead of file open and the
shortcut for that is the same as before
except adding the alt or option key so
if i were to access file browse
sometimes it might take a little bit of
time
so now that we've got adobe bridge
activated as you can see here Adobe
bridge is a product that allows you to
have access to other Adobe applications
as well as different files that are
available on your desktop among other
things what I want to draw your
attention to is to the adobe stock
photos and if you access the adobe stock
photos what it will do
is open up
and what that does is open up the adobe
stock photos and as you can see here
you'll have access to stock photographs
that you can use for your work at this
moment you'll recognize and you might be
asking yourself is this a free thing can
I use this photo in any kind of project
well these are comping images and
comping images in the graphic design
industry we produce a comp or our
composition to provide to our clients in
order for them to approve how the
project is running long at that point
you can use these files and it's not
going to be for commercial purposes yet
but if that file has been approved and
if you're going to use that photograph
in your final project for some
commercial purpose then certainly you
would have to have your client pay for
that photograph now for our purposes and
as Adobe makes clear we can use these
just for testing out some images and
we'll be able to use them as comping
images if we use them for commercial
purposes then we must pay for these so
if you were to do a search on something
like a dog
you
you'll recognize that it's acquiring
some of these images and depending on
your connection speed and you may have
this come up faster or slower so if for
example you needed a picture of a dog
something like this cute little puppy
right here
double click that image
and that will open up the image details
as you can see here the pricing for
those images and the different ways that
you can do it but if you download the
comp or download the composition you'll
notice that there is a downloaded comps
folder that you can save this file to
um it has been saved at that specific
location you can view that folder as
well and as you can see here it accesses
the downloaded comps that we saw there
before and notice you can just drag this
into Photoshop and there's your comp
image that you can start working with as
well so those are some of the features
that you can be using remember you can
just file open any file that's on your
computer and you can also browse browse
for the files on your computer as well
as browsing through the adobe stock
photos and it'll allow you a number of
different images that you'll be able to
work with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
