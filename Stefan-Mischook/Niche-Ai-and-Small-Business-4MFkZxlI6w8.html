created a little while ago where I
mentioned AI and job possibilities in a
nutshell I said that if you're going to
do AI work you're probably going to be
working for large organizations who have
money to compete with a Google or a
Facebook or a IBM or something this is
false what I have since learned
specifically from a couple of friends of
mine who have small companies startups
where they are developing their own
custom niche ai's for their particular
product so I'm looking a little bit
deeper into that and you see that
actually there are a lot of new che eyes
that are being developed basically
little companies small medium-sized
businesses who are developing a eyes
that have the that have a very specific
use a very specific purpose so that
previous video I believe I was wrong
about that I have to admit that it seems
that there is a lot of potential work
developing nisha a eyes now to be
totally clear I haven't done an
exhaustive search in this end and so
this is based on my conversation with a
couple of friends of mine and a little
bit of research myself on the web but
two friends of mine are actually doing
this for real what a friend of mine has
raised a couple million dollars and they
have a few guys developing an AI for
their app and another friend of mine who
he built who built his app the more
traditional way the more traditional
business where he was feeding it from
his own cash flow and slowly developing
the app over a period of three years so
those different approaches to building a
business you can go VC venture capital
we speed up the process or you can go
traditional business where you fund it
yourself like I've done with studio web
anyway getting back to the subject at at
hand if you want to do AI programming
you can't find yourself in the AI field
working for small or mid-sized
businesses where you will be building
very nice AI is very focused a guys that
very particular tasks for particular
industries perhaps as opposed to the
bigger a is like the Watson projects or
the Google assistants ALS pretty much it
as wanted to correct right bye-bye
I figure end of vlog on my balcony now
that the spring is here this is Montreal
in the springtime I know if you hear a
lot of win or not with the mic but you
can definitely hear the cars below and
here's the mountain and yeah I don't
know if you look down
street below
all right if you liked my vlog let me
know comment about the the old like
there and go guide me in terms of what
am I going to do going on people asking
to do more vlogs about business and
discussing the emotions of it and how to
view if alright I'm gonna do more of
those because I think those super
valuable together be able to control
that and manage that I think so I take
for an alpha toxin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
