2018 in a nutshell
WordPress is still a mainstay of web
design and development why what do I
mean by mainstay I mean that so many
people use WordPress so many small
businesses use WordPress and this is not
how to change anytime soon there's no
other platform blogging platform that
comes even close well excuse me
we're press is much more than a blogging
platform it used to be just a blogging
platform but now it's a total content
management system and it's by far the
most popular one in the world many many
small businesses depend on it and
there's a huge huge ecosystem built up
around WordPress whether it be the
theming whether it be plugins ecommerce
components and a whole bunch of other
things if you are a wordpress
professional that means you understand
how to install configure WordPress
you'll know about theming configuring
themes building themes from scratch or
you're at the elite level and you know
some PHP and you know how to build
plug-ins for WordPress it's just about
unlimited number of contracts for you in
that field WordPress it's just so
popular so pervasive and for some reason
a lot of young programmers young
nerdlings don't find WordPress sexy or
cool and I can see why you know I you
know there's other areas that seem
cooler and sexy but there's nothing as
cool and as sexy than making a lot of
money for your time so if you put the
time learn WordPress put the time learn
some PHP of course you got to know your
html5 and CSS you should be able to set
up a great business as a WordPress web
professional WordPress professional
maybe depending on what you want to call
it it's just such a great field to be in
so yeah we're press those been around
for a while its install base is so huge
and the install base is mostly small
business owners who need something more
of an aesthetic website who needs
something more than a
website so if you got those chops you
got those skills you're gonna have
yourself a great time as a developer you
know it's a cool about developing for
WordPress as well is that you have
yourself a platform that's known so in a
short period of time you should be able
to solve any wordpress problems that may
come up any theming problem may come up
because it's it's fixed right it's not
like you're developing custom apps from
scratch every time so how do you become
a wordpress professional well first you
got to learn the basics of web
development and design that means html5
css3 a touch of JavaScript you got to
know what jQuery is you got a little
bootstrap is you got to know what you
got to know your PHP as well it's not
absolutely necessary but if you get some
basic PHP skills then it takes you to a
whole new level
my full stack web developer course my
interactive web developer of course will
teach you all this and a lot more by the
way and then once you have that then you
just got to install some wordpress
install on your own site of course and
just get to know the the environment
around WordPress the echo system the
echo system around around WordPress like
the themes that are available the free
ones the commercial line is the pros or
the cons of different themes the top ten
plugins in WordPress would be kind of
cool to know so that you know which you
know which you which you have out there
which you can install for your clients
and so on and maybe understand of course
you got to know the basics of seaming my
again my interactive web developer
course teaches you WordPress saving and
maybe a little bit of plug-in work as
well although again be able to design
plugins from scratch not necessarily
required Givens you have so much out
there already and just being able to
lock down word precedent in terms of
security you got all that covered you
sure you have enough skills that go out
there and start securing a lot of
WordPress and base contracts and in a
short period of time you can find
yourself with a stable of clients who
come to you on a regular basis you could
set up retainers with them and it's just
like a very lucrative very lucrative
degree degree a very lucrative business
again into so I'm thinking in terms of
freelancing you know you could get a job
working for WordPress freelancing studio
and get a really good job doing that as
well
so yes WordPress it's extremely viable
2018 for some people is not the sexiest
but you know as I said if you're making
money hand over fist that's pretty sexy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
