loader class and its objects and the
mile and a listener object is in place
now what we're going to do is to work
with external variables and the load
bars class now the load of our class
just as we did with the movie clip
loader class will create an instance of
it effectively creating an object
associated with the load bar class now
before we do that one thing that I would
like to do is to keep things a little
bit neat so in order to do so we can
just write out some very simple comments
in here and i can write start mcl for
the beginning of the mcl information and
right after the listener I'm going to
just copy this information and paste it
here and we'll say end mcl so that way
everybody will know where the beginning
and where the end of this information
actually is and how it's going to work
for us at the same time here it's got my
mcl load clip I'm just going to write a
little comment to ourselves saying load
the swf all right now once that's done
let's start out some comments here which
are going to give us some information
about the load bars so I'm gonna say the
load while actually we should say start
load bar
start the load bar
and we can also just backslash that I'll
copy this and we're going to paste it
and load bar
and in between these two comments we're
going to write out our load bar
information now what exactly are we
doing with this load bars well if we
take a look at our files and if we go
into the killer side starter set again
what we're going to see here is that
there is a folder called bars or
variables in it there are a bunch of txt
files just simple plain text files if
you open up one of them for example if
we open up the killer sites which is the
first load bar here is notepad and I'm
just going to squeeze this in place so
you can read it maybe I'll make the text
a little bit smaller so you can see that
too
alright so what you should see right at
this point is something that looks
somewhat like HTML because you know
we've got some HTML tags in here like
the text format and paragraphs and a
tags for links and stuff like that but
unlike a HTML file it starts with info
and it says info equals in other words
what i'm doing here is info is
representing a variable and the
variables in the variable info the value
for info is all of this information here
and this information happens to be
styled with HTML tags throughout now as
we'll eventually see a little bit later
on we're going to learn how to not only
use this as HTML but also we're going to
learn how to style this with CSS as well
so just to orient you the info variable
is written inside the txt file
incidentally all of our tax files start
with info this is just a simple and easy
way to make sure that we can use the
same movie clip load or excuse me the
same load bar class or object that we're
using for all of our movies and anytime
we call the load bar we're going to
specify info you can make things a
little bit more flexible if you need but
at this point this is all we really need
to do the beginning starts with info and
incidentally it doesn't have to be info
it could be any variable you want it
could be display it could be you know
information whatever it doesn't matter
infos not something that's specific to
make this work it's just the name of the
variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
