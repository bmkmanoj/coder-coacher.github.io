is an error otherwise you need to do a
couple things first of all we need to
update the password so I'm just going to
grab the section and we're going to do a
head it going to do a prepare we're
going to instead use an update
like so and we're going to pass in the
password actually can't simply just do
this we need to do an md5 put pass and
also include this salt value that we
discussed when you first set this up now
like that and then you need to include
the email okay so that should be good we
execute that and we don't need to
actually display anything so let's just
close it so password gets updated and
actually I was going to do this in
separate queries but I believe we can do
both at the same time let's go ahead and
let me test this so password equals one
thing and we also need to update the
password reset
and this we're just going to pass in an
empty string like so okay so that should
be fine that'll take care of updating
the password and clearing the reset key
and the last thing is we need to add
alert messages
you
I'm going to ask the user to log in and
provide them a convenient link if that's
the next thing that they want to do
okay and then will clear our input
and finally we do it include and we
display the form back to the user with
the message letting them know what's
going on okay so I believe that about
wraps it up for this tutorial let me
just make sure that everything is good
to go on that they don't have any typos
it looks like yes we do so let me check
this whoops
okay so save that
39
I put the dollar sign in the wrong place
okay now let me see if that is working
okay so much better so let me go ahead
and Charlie setting my password one more
time so here's my latest request just as
an example let me show you an old
request and you'll see the message we
should get the message at least looks
like we need to fix one other thing
oh here we go
we just change this to input it
shouldn't actually make a difference
email
should be okay I'm sorry I mean one more
second here if I can't figure it out all
pause the video and come back to it in a
moment
oh no one did here we go I missed adding
an extra equals blank so save that now
let's try one last time
okay so we still have the key in the URL
and it looks like yes it does give us in
the loop message saying that the email
in this case it is valid but if you'll
notice USC is the last couple digits
here and you notice that's no longer the
reset key let's go ahead we just make
sure XG be
here we go
72
actually what I can do here is I don't
even need to do this I can just do this
that should fix the issue okay so
hopefully the last fix on this and it
looks like password was updated
successfully let's go ahead and try
logging in looks like I successfully
logged in with the new password and his
last thing let's double-check and it
looks like yes the password reset field
was cleared so that wraps it up for
today's tutorial I'm a bit longer than I
had expected it would be but hopefully
you stayed with me and thanks for
