killer sites calm in this video blog a
lot of comment on an article has
recently put out on TechCrunch and you
can see the euro out the euro here
excuse me essentially this guy scoured
craigslist to see where the gigs were
looking for C sharp versus Java PHP he
looked at client-side programming
programming as far as he was concerned
flash JavaScript CSS HTML he also looked
at server-side PHP Java da Dada Python
Ruby etc he was just curious to see
where the jobs were at least on
craigslist somebody else pointed out
that on other sites like stackoverflow
you would have a different result true
stack overflow is very much a nerd
century programmer centric site so
you're going to have a representation
there from people more in the know but I
would have a guess that craigslist would
be more reflective of general of the
general society but I have nothing to
back that base that out except for my
own feeling on that that said he had
some results which are actually very
much reflective of what I hear
anecdotally from people who are out
there programming and what that is is
that as I've been saying for many years
PHP by far and away as is the most
popular popular web web programming
language I'm not saying it's the best
technically I'm talking from just a use
point of view you got to remember and
somebody pointed that out in the
comments as well the comments on this
article down here that you know there
are millions and millions of sites that
use Drupal WordPress they were and
joomla and these are all written in PHP
so if a site owner has a site based on
one of these technologies or wants to
get a site with
CMS on the backend likely they're going
to be using one of these products so
they're gonna need PHP programmers to
make modification modifications and that
create plugins or make changes to V
systems and there's several others think
of all the forms are out there and the
new social networking engines these
things are all written in PHP so extends
to reason that PHP would be the most
popular Java being also coming in second
on here again that makes sense it's Java
is such a dominant player on the server
side da Dada of course I'm done that C
sharp I don't know why you know he
separated hat but anyway Ruby you know
again I'm not as the author of this
article pointed I'm not here to start
any flame worms or Wars all suggesting
to use that because of the layout of the
land if you will PHP is clearly going to
be a hugely important language no matter
what you think of it in terms of its
technical merits if you will and again
you have to understand that I in terms
of logging programming hours I've done
much much more in Java that I have in
any other language or programmed in many
languages so i really love java so you
know i don't have a dog in this fight if
we scroll down in the client-side
technologies HTML CSS of course that's
that's a given javascript and flash now
this is just a snapshot of time that was
done on I guess September 30 of 2012 I
would imagine you're going to see the
flash use in decline simply because
flash is not supported on iOS devices
ipads and iphones and ipad ipads are
barf by far and away the most popular
tablets and how the
growing very very fast in terms of
market share in terms of devices being
used on the web and in fact beyond the
fact that iOS doesn't support flash
android won't have a native flash plugin
anymore as well they you know adobe has
discontinued the production of that as
well so on the mobile devices on tablets
and smartphones flash is going away or
is gone so I imagine this is going to
diminish even more and the reason while
just mentioned this in terms of Java
squirt squirt JavaScript frameworks know
Jas at least at this point I'm seems to
be very popular that's weird I know why
didn't conclude well I guess he said MVC
framework but I would have included
terms of JavaScript frameworks I would
have included jquery of course you know
some of this terminology in his article
and some others thinking may be flawed
all I'm concerned about is the numbers
that he pulled out here and I think it's
relevant if you're looking at being a
freelance web designer or web programmer
I've been saying for many years that you
have to learn a little javascript and
PHP and I've also suggested for many
years that you should be learning
wordpress or some other popular CMS
engine like joomla or drupal i'm still
big advocate of wordpress because it's
so it's got such a huge community it's
pretty easy to deploy nothing against
the other to vote nothing against joomla
or drupal anyway that's it just a little
comment there something interesting yes
you will get different results on
different sites as a guy one of these
guys pointed out here if you did the
same type of thing and stack overflow
you see that PHP you know it's it's much
closer right javascript is
world-dominating java still dominating
sku of course that makes sense right it
make sense with JavaScript dominates
because there's really no competing
language in what JavaScript does and you
know in terms of client-side scripting
in the browser you need JavaScript to do
all your Dom stuff you do your Ajax you
need to do all any cool stuff and with
html5 to control that stuff so yeah that
makes sense java course SQL of course
you know we all use SQL everybody uses
relational databases object databases
never took off all they although they do
have some interesting advantages HTML
CSS makes sense Python is kind of
interesting largely that's very
interesting but again it's the question
of the wise Python interesting because
it is a niche language it's a very cool
language by the way but it is a niche
language and you figure of all the buzz
with rubric that Ruby had with Ruby on
Rails you figure that Ruby would be more
popular the more popular than Python but
you know what else so anyway again but
it's a stack overflow I have a stack
overflows audience is much more
sophisticated too long I think guarantee
is much more sophisticated and people
will be posting on Craigslist so I think
stack overflow is a s'more be skewed
perspective versus something you would
see on craigslist and there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
