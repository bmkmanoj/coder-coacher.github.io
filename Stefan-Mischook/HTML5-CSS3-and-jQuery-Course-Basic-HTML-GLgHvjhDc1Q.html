concept and how it's going to work if we
take a look at our initial content area
this will give us a better indication of
what we're going to be doing in the next
video so let's take a look as you can
see I've got my body and we've got a
content tag that's wrapping everything
within it now what are we doing with
that content tagged there's not really
much that it's doing at the moment but
I've included it in here because it's
not unusual to have a container of sorts
that holds the website and it also
affords you an extra possibility of
putting in yet another background image
depending on where you want it and what
you want to do with it so it's not
really doing too much at the moment but
it's there so that if you need you have
a wealth of possibilities as to what you
can achieve with it so the basic
structure of what I want to be looking
at are sort of located here you can see
that there is a header area which i'm
just going to temporarily collapse and
then you'll notice that i have a number
of divs and the header area has the most
information the divs i've actually
stripped of their information i don't
just put in a small little p paragraph
section in order for this thing to work
however it's important that each of your
sections actually has a good deal of
information within it and you'll even
notice that in this particular example
I've actually taken some liberties to
utilize the CSS to make things a little
bit larger than they normally would be
but that's just another aesthetic
criteria that you know you can choose
whether or not you want to embrace so as
you can see here we've got individual
divs sections and these divs are being
used so that we can work with them as
individual sections now even in the
header which I still have some
information here the basic information
is still the same it's still sound in
other words and basically what it looks
like is something similar to what you
see right here within the open header
close header area that I have here the
header is given a class of scroll item
and the CSS
you see what scroll item is going to do
we'll take a look at a little bit later
but I just want to look at the basic
structure of the HTML page so within
this header called scroll item class and
it has an ID of section 1 let's take a
look at the other ones same thing class
scroll item ID section to scroll item
section 3 scroll item 4 &amp;amp; 5 so they're
all exactly the same it's just the
content we're putting in them that is a
little bit different so let's see what
happens and if you remember from our
sketch that we looked at last time we've
got that containing element and then
this element is set to one hundred
percent on the width so that it will
stretch out and give us the background
image that we want the different
background images as we scroll through
this thing within the thing is the
article with the class called mod in
this case and if you remember articles
are going to be set to 960 and centered
in the page so that even on a very very
large canvas or large screen resolution
will still have the article centered
while the background image is going to
take up the entire area of the browser
as well in there we have a section tag
which is being used to hold the
information for the class called main
and let's just take a look at our finder
again and if you remember here's the
archive with the scan I'm just going to
open that up so look the scroll item
container in this case the first one
it's a header tag in the other ones
they're just div tags but they have a
class scroll item and within that we
have the article which is centered 960
pixels and in the first one we have
navigation and the main class area but
the other ones just has the main class
area alright so now that we've
understood a little bit we visualized it
once again i'm showing it to you in code
so here the section with the class
called main has a h2 and a couple of
paragraphs and stuff like that and then
we close that section within that
is the information that I just
Illustrated however right next to it in
the first area is the nav tag and as you
can see here I'm just going to spread
that out a little in the nav tag we have
an unordered list with list items okay
so within that is the article tags or
there they are and here is our header
tags so you see the nested sort of
scenario that we're working with in here
with a section and the nav now if we
scroll down and we look at our first div
I've made it a lot easier by stripping
out the text and what you'll see here is
again the same basic structure a section
with the information and that's going to
be on the right hand side the article
that holds it in order to Center it on
the page and finally the div with the
class scroll item and its own individual
ID is holding all of that information so
there is the HTML structure that we're
going to be looking at and working with
in this particular instance let's come
back and when we do in the next video
I'm going to explain a little bit about
how the jQuery is going to work for this
as well as what we're going to be doing
with our CSS styles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
