to the universal selector everything's
pared down to zero and we do have a
wrapper in place but first and foremost
before we do anything else let's take
care of a couple of things I'm going to
ask you instruct you to create a new CSS
rule and this is not going to be a class
it's going to be a tag that redefines a
specific HTML element and in this case
the HTML element is the body notice of
course we're defining this rule in our
external style dot CSS file alright so
if we come back here and click OK what
do we want to do with this body well
it's a small little trick that I want to
talk to you about that's specific to
Internet Explorer and you know versions
five and six older versions of Internet
Explorer now not as many people are
using those browsers there's still a
small percentage of people that are the
main problem with those browser users is
a simple fact that the little trick that
we did with the auto margins on the
wrapper not really going to work in
terms of centering the document in those
browsers so the way that we Center the
document in those older browsers is to
go to the category called block and as
you can see here what I'm going to do is
to say text-align center now if I click
ok you can even apply that but we don't
have any text in here so we won't really
show up so just say okay well at this
point you'll notice that if I was to
write in some text you know sample text
or something like this let's take a look
if we refresh this will notice that the
sample text is right in the middle of
our browser that's not at all where I
want it to be I want my text to be left
a line you know if I have this all
centered it would end up making my
website look like a wedding invitation
which is the last thing we want to have
happening in here so instead of having
that happen
we're going to go back to our CSS rule
and here where we have our wrapper what
we can do is remember the text is inside
the wrapper so while the body which is
represented by this white area is
centering all the text and at the same
time not just the text but everything
else on the body that's for the older
browsers Internet Explorer's older
versions so in order to sort of
circumvent this centering of the text
all we got to do is to say tell the
wrapper here I'm going to hit the edit
rule and when we go inside here we'll go
to the block and we'll say hey look
everything on the body is set to be
centered but what I want to do is to say
anything inside the wrapper which is
basically the entire site will be text
aligned left back to the default and if
you click apply you can see now that
your text is left-aligned inside the
wrapper and that's perfect that's
exactly what we want to have happening
in here one last thing I want to do
while we're at the body and we go to the
editing here we can go to the background
and as you'll notice the background
color of my body is defaulted to white
that's perfectly fine if you've got a
white background but if you remember i'm
just going to hit command tab on my mac
or alt tab on the pc i will switch over
to photoshop and if you can see and
quite well remember we had been using
swatches that we downloaded from the
adobe swatch exchange and in there we
decided upon a background color for us
to use so you can take your eyedropper
tool or you can just pick it from your
swatches and as you can see here what
i'm going to be doing is just selecting
this particular background color if i
double click that or just single click
actually hear the color picker for the
foreground color gives you a value that
is a hexadecimal number hexadecimal
numbers are what we use inside of our
web designs so i mean certainly you
could use an RGB value when you're
working with CSS it's much easier to
just give one definition one value so
I'm going to select everything that's in
here command C or control C on a PC to
copy this information click OK command
tab I'll go back to Dreamweaver and as
you can see here this is my background
color now look you know you could choose
from any of the colors that you have
here and if there is nothing that you
like you can also go to some of these
colors here now it doesn't really look
like there's colors but you can just
bring that up or down for the brightness
level and you know you could choose a
color like this if you wished and just
to show you if I pressed apply bang you
see all of those colors but that's not
what we want we have a color that we're
working with so I'm going to paste in
the color that we copied from Photoshop
and I'll click apply and check it out
the entire body now conforms to that
particular color click OK and that's
perfectly fine for us but as you're
going to be seeing a little bit later on
I'm also going to be doing a couple of
other tricks to change the bodies
background color and make the wrapper
have this particular color that we're
looking at but nevertheless at this
point I can get rid of that sample text
we've got a wrapper in place we've got
the universal selector pairing
everything down to zero margin and
padding the body is centering things for
older Internet Explorer browsers and the
wrapper is also doing it now notice here
style dot CSS I can actually go in here
and write again a little comment to
myself or to yourself further that
matter and inside of this little comment
i'm just going to say this definition is
used for older IE browsers and here
that's a little way that you can define
that and you know you could also write a
little note text align left in the
wrapper was to put everything back to
its default away from the centered so
I'm going to save this notice the
asterisks will disappear when I press
ctrl asks or command s and now we're
back at the source code so we've got our
body in place I've got a rapper set up
the way we want to and we've got our
universal selector now it's time for us
to deal with all of the other gives that
we're going to be placing inside of our
rapper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
