all need to manage now that's kind of a
stupid and boring statement but it's
true so let me give you a first example
where really started really
understanding pressure and of course
that was in martial arts my boxing coach
taught me that because he was a
literally a pressure fighter you're not
a boxer you know a fighter pressure
fighter gets into your face and he's
just keep he keeps right in there and
he's hitting you he's hitting you and
he's pushing you he's in your face he's
literally trying to put pressure on you
because the pressure is there to break
you down and I don't know I don't know
if he said it or heard it somewhere else
but pressure can beat skill so if you
have somebody who's more skilled than
you you can apply pressure on the mental
physical pressure if possible mental
pressure to break down their skills
because pressure will break skill so in
business you're gonna have to get used
to pressure pressure is such an
important part of business being able to
handle it being able to on occasion to
exert it but managing pressure is a huge
part of it and that's why you hear
certain entrepreneur say you have to
really enjoy what you do because when
the pressure comes in evident and
inevitably the pressure will come in
business you're going to have to you
have to really like it to want to deal
with that pressure unless you're
naturally good at managing pressure and
I remember and one martial art style I
did I was kind of uh the teacher called
they call it a catch Kimble it's not the
kitchen Kimble what you typically see it
was more some weird hybrid this guy who
taught my teacher he was now dead he was
an enforcer and he was shot but anyway
he taught he just called a catcher cam
rule but his stuff was very different
it's kind of a white crane derivative
it was very Street oriented because I
said this teacher was an enforcer so it
was pretty rough-and-tumble los Apsara
hitting each other one of the things we
did is we learnt to handle pain was a
big part of it to be able to not flinch
and not be afraid of pain so we've sit
there while said dairy get into a horse
position and then people will on your
boom boom boom boom boom boom and you
have to learn to absorb and not flinch
and I was not totally into that because
you know I figure you should learn to
get away from the punches and get away
from the kicks but like to give you an
idea to pass my third belt
everybody got to kick me or punch me in
the gut as hard as they could and I had
to stand up and take it if I wanted to
pass even after doing all the exam and
all the silly tests and stuff and I
actually went out and I had to I had to
barf once because I got hit so hard but
you know what that does so is that when
you learn to take a beating like that
mentally you become super tough and then
when you get into a street fight
somebody hits you and you're like what
that's it that's all you got you know
because you're used to getting hit by
guys who are training hard to learn how
to hit people so some some guy on the
street goes that's it
I pay I pay to get hard hit harder than
this so their pressure on you is nothing
and so learning and pressure training is
much more of a mental thing than
anything else so you have to understand
when you get into business that pressure
is a big part of it you have to learn to
cope with it and you may want to look up
some exercise you can start preparing
yourself in terms of dealing with
pressure and exercise some excuse me you
may want to look up some exercises that
can help you with that it could be
mental could be physical exercises
whatnot but this cool exercise where
you're straining yourself and stressing
yourself and your discipline and help
you with that it teaches your mind your
emotional self if you will to not give
in not to control you with pressure
because a lot of it again is mental and
sometimes to deal with pressure besides
training
physically to deal with that you may
have a system in place so for instance
today was one of these days right it
really didn't feel like working too much
so what I do is I have a basic rule that
I've had for a long time now a couple
decades if you don't feel like working
at least get a little bit done at least
do something like it's you know if you
have two hours of work to do and you
don't feel like doing anything do at
least say I'm just gonna do five minutes
at least you do something to push it
forward a bit and you may end up only
doing five minutes but at least you got
a little bit ahead or sometimes when I'm
getting ready to plan out a new course
wasn't working on the courses now I
don't feel like recording that day what
I do is I added a further prep for that
course I may put down some more notes I
may prepare a via the editing software
so it's open everything's could figure
something to push it forward and that's
where you use a system you have a
protocol that you you must adhere to no
matter what and I got that again like so
many other things in my life I got that
from boxing whereas in boxing you have a
buzzer when we train you start training
we would have a buzzer and the way it
would work was that when the buzzer I
was thinking of three minutes on one
minute off three minute on one minute
off and it'd be whether you'd be doing
shadow boxing skipping rope heavy bag
work sparring in the ring pad work
whatever and what my coach would
emphasize is that when the buzzer says
you train no matter what you train and
you don't stop early and you don't
continue if the buzzer if you feel
really good and a buzzer goes off now I
can get I don't need to take this break
you take the break even if you don't
need to you take the break and what this
does is that it really disciplines you
that when it's time to work you work no
matter what and with rest time you rest
and you're training your mind you're
training your brain to react in that way
to you so if you put into place a system
or protocol where on the day's you don't
feel like working that you have to do at
least some
minimum right like I have the emails
come in like crazy and I say I said I'm
gonna answer for emails today it's me I
gotta get those done prep this I'm gonna
prep that so I may only do a little bit
of work but at least I push the project
for it anyway that's my tip for today
pressure you have to learn to understand
it you have to learn to manage it and
also yeah pressure can be used in
business negotiations as well it will be
used on you but I have to I'll have to
leave that to another video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
