at a couple of interesting functions one
or two other interesting functions just
to give you an idea of what what some of
these functions can do and yeah I think
by looking at other functions it will
make it easier for John Stan the
concepts that we just we just covered
again if some of this stuff is hazy to
you don't worry it's surprising how it
begins to sink in once you actually
start using different functions and I
suggest that after watching this video
and part two as well where you build
your whole functions I would suggest
that you you start playing with
different functions and experimenting
with them just to get a feel for the
process it goes a long way so let's
let's look at let's look at a very
important function in PHP I'm creating a
variable first of course to capture the
value from the function now this is a
function you're probably going to use a
lot because it helps security when
you're processing forms in PHP now which
strip tags does is it removes any PHP
tags and HTML tags from a string attacks
so this is often used when people are
processing forms where do you want to
make sure that somebody's not trying to
send up malicious code or something up
the pipe so what they do is the script
tags will remove the tags or from the
string of text from the form input this
way they can do things they try to
sabotage your database or any other
nasty garbage like that so we're gonna
just put in a few basic tags so that's
and that's just enough to make the point
so and we'll just echo out the results
that this particular function gives us
let's take a look at it in the page so
we go see we see tags the PHP tags is
the text that's left over
from the originals you noticed there's
no PHP there's no P tag there's no PHP
code as well strip tags removes that for
us from the from the screen so this is
actually a very important a very
important function that you're probably
going to be using quite a bit when you
start processing forms with PHP
here's another simple function that's
that can be quite useful
it's the string poles stripe O's
function this function takes two
arguments
argument number one argument number two
again separated by the comma and the
first argument is the string that you
want to examine and the executor is what
you're looking for what piece of text
are you looking for in that string so
what string poles does this short for
string position checks to see if a piece
of text that you have mentioned you
identify in the second argument if it
actually exists in the big string this
is a good way for instance to check
whether or not a user somebody's entered
in proper information within a form or
improper information so in this case
what I've done is created a very very
simple email validator but just make
sure just checks rather to see that this
person actually entered in an email
address well and that's simple you need
the you know you need an add symbol in
your email address now this is very
simple I know but you know I'm just
showing you this to prove a point
so again if this with this for how this
function works if it finds the
particular letter you're looking for a
piece of text you're looking for in your
string in your first argument it will
return the nut to position the string
position within within the string here
so that makes sense so this was in
position 10 this function string poles
will return the value of 10 to results
so what I've done here if an excuse me
and if it doesn't find the add symbol it
will return the it will return a null
value or a blank value it will be
basically false so what I've done here
I've taken the return result put it into
a variable and then use this variable
inside of an if statement and
essentially if it finds this symbol in
here
the script will echo out it has the @
symbol so let's take a look at and see
what happens and sure enough we see we
do have an ad symbol so let's take out
the ad some here
we'll save that just watch again and you
see nothing is printed because this of
course evaluates to false let's do
something wild and crazy and we're going
to use the else statement will echo out
a different response no hat symbol
refresh that no I had symbol C now what
we could do if we want to really get
funky so let's see let's look how we can
use one function to help another
function out so then we could send out a
mail and I'm just gonna leave these
blank for now yeah so we could send out
a mail so if if the person actually
entered in a proper email address
assuming that this was all we were
checking for then we could say okay he's
entered a proper email address send out
a mail by calling the mail function the
point of this is to show you how we can
use functions to string together a
logical sequence inside of our PHP
scripts
you notice how two functions take away a
lot of excess code in our pages and so
we have a very clean page as opposed to
imagine if we had to write out all the
code by hand to send an email could be a
lot of pay a lot of code in a page for
instance in Java Java is a language it
takes a lot more code to get anything
done and to send an email in Java using
the base Java Mail functions and
capabilities it would require over a
page of code so it's very common for
Java coders to to basically write
functions in Java functions are called
methods but there's anyway their
functions basically Java people will
write functions that will basically wrap
around package up the
native Java email code so back they can
have just a neat function call like we
have here with mayo and PHP to keep
their main scripts nice and clean
fortunately for us the PHP nerds decided
to make it as simple as possible for us
so all we have is a simple mail function
to call and we're ready to go
in the next part we're gonna actually
build our own custom PHP functions and
we're gonna learn how to use them in our
PHP scripts yeah I think you'll find
that particular video very interesting
because when you create custom functions
you can wrap up your own code in to the
function packages which your own code
could be just your you know standard PHP
code you can also integrate other
functions whether your other functions
you've created or functions that come
built into PHP into your own custom
functions and it's a very powerful
combination that will allow you to
create modular code that's very reusable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
