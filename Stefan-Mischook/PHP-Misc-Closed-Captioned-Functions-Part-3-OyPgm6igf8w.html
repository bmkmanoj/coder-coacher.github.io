at a couple of interesting functions one
or two other interesting functions just
to give you an idea of what what some of
these functions can do and yeah I think
by looking at other functions it will
make it easier for John Stan the
concepts that we just we just covered
again if some of this stuff is hazy to
you don't worry it's surprising how it
begins to sink in once you actually
start using different functions and I
suggest that after watching this video
and part two as well where you build
your whole function so I would suggest
that you you start playing with
different functions and experimenting
with them just to get a feel for the
process it goes a long way so let's
let's look at let's look at a very
important function in PHP I'm creating a
variable first of course to capture the
value from the function now this is a
function you're probably going to use a
lot because it helps security when
you're processing forms in PHP now which
strip tags does is it removes any PHP
tags and HTML tags from the string of
texts so this is often used when people
are processing forms where they want to
make sure that somebody's not trying to
send up malicious code or something up
the pipe so what they do is the strip
tags will remove the tags or from the
string of texts from the form input this
way they can do things they try to
sabotage your database or any other
nasty garbage like that so we're going
to just put in a few basic tags so
that's that's just enough to make the
point so and we'll just echo out the
results that this particular function
gives us let's take a look at it in the
page now so we go see we see tags the
PHP tags is the text that's left over
from the original is you notice there is
no ph peters nopee tag there's no PHP
code as well strip tags removes that for
us from the from the screen so this is
actually a very important very important
function that you're probably going to
be using quite a bit when you start
processing forms with PHP
here's another simple function that I
can be quite useful it's the string
polls stripe OHS function this function
takes two arguments argument number one
regular number two again separated by
the comma and the first argument is the
string that you want to examine and the
execu- are looking for what piece of
text are you looking for in that string
so what string polls does this short for
string position checks to see if a piece
of text which you have mentioned you
identify in second argument if it
actually exists in the big string this
is a good way for instance to check
whether or not a user somebody's entered
in proper information within a form or
improper information so in this case
what I've done is created a very very
simple email validator but just make
sure just checked rather to see that
this person actually entered in an email
address well and that simple you need
the needles you need an ad symbol in
your email address now this is very
simple I know but you know I'm just
showing you this approval point so again
if this with this for how this function
works if it finds the particular letter
you're looking for piece of text you're
looking for in your string in your first
argument it will return the nut to
position the string position within
within the string here so that makes
sense so this was in position 10 this
function string polls will return the
value of 10 to results so what I've done
here if an excuse me and if it doesn't
find the ad symbol it will return the it
will return a null value or a blank
value it will be basically false so what
I've done here but I've taken the return
result put into a variable and then use
this variable inside of an if statement
and essentially if it finds this symbol
in here
the script will echo out it has the @
symbol so let's take a look at see what
happens and sure enough we see we do
have an ad symbol so let's take out the
ad symbol here we'll save that just
watch again and you see nothing is
printed because this of course evaluates
to false let's do something wild and
crazy and we're going to use the else
statement will echo out a different
response no hat cymbal refresh that no
ads symbol see now what we could do if
we want to really get funky so let's see
let's look how we can use one function
to help another function out so then we
could send out a mail and i'm just going
to leave these blank for now now so we
could send out a male so if if the
person actually entered in a proper
email address assuming that this was all
we were checking for then we could say
okay he's entered a proper email address
send out a mail by calling the mail
function the point of this is to show
you how we can use functions to string
together a logical sequence inside of
our PHP scripts you notice how two
functions take away a lot of excess code
in our pages and so we have a very clean
page as opposed to imagine if we had to
write out all the code by hand to send
an email could be a lot of pay a lot of
code in a page for instance in Java Java
is a language it takes a lot more code
to get anything done and to send an
email in Java using the base javamail
functions and capabilities it would
require over a page of code so it's very
common for Java coders to to basically
write functions in Java functions are
called methods but there's any way two
functions basically Java people will
write functions that will basically wrap
around package up the
native Java email code so back they can
have just a neat function call like we
have here with mayo and PHP to keep
their main scripts nice and clean
fortunately for us do PHP nerds decided
to make it as simple as possible for us
so all we have is a simple mail function
to call and ready to go
in the next part we're going to actually
build our own custom PHP functions and
we're going to learn how to use them in
our PHP scripts yeah I think you'll find
that particular video very interesting
because when you create custom functions
you can wrap up your own code into the
function packages which your own code
could be just your you know standard PHP
code you can also integrate other
functions whether your other functions
you've created or functions that come
built into PHP into your own custom
functions and it's a very powerful
combination that will allow you to
create modular code that's very reusable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
