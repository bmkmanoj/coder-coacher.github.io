simple a website is just a bunch of HTML
pages a bunch of web pages connect it
together I'm going to show you how to
connect these pages together using a
special HTML tag but for now let's set
up our very first website the first
thing you want to do is create a folder
on your desktop why on your desktop it's
just an easy place to find your website
files so I'm gonna create the folder
right on my Windows desktop and I'm
gonna call the site my my website now
this is okay we can call it my website
my you notice there's a space here my
space website now for creating a folder
on our desktop there's no problem with
that but when you get into real serious
web coding having spaces in your file
names whether they be folder names
whether they be your HTML page names is
not a good idea so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna put a - that is a much better
name because if you don't have a - or
you don't have you have a space rather
like this it could cause problems for
you so you don't you either have no
space like this or you put a - or maybe
you can put an underscore whatever you
prefer but whatever you do no spaces
just trust me it's gonna make your life
easier now but we got our website folder
created let's pop it open
and I'm gonna create a new folder in
there I'm gonna call it images and yep
I'm gonna put our images in this folder
just so it's organized you don't have to
but it's a good place to organize all
your images of course these are the
images that are gonna go into your
websites
so now let's pop up in the code editor
and you remember our code here let me
just clean this up a little bit and I'm
gonna save as and I'm gonna go to our
desktop here's my website and I save it
as index dot HTML because it's going to
be the very first web page in our
website let me save this and there you
go so let me close this up we go back to
there it is index.html and we're going
to put images in the images folder
because we want to put some images in
our website but that's only one page a
website as many HTML pages so let's
let's create another HTML page I'm gonna
open up the text editor again I'm gonna
save file save as save as it allows me
to save the file under a different name
and what am I going to call this I'm
gonna call this let's say I want to set
up I don't know personal diary like a
private Facebook website for yourself
maybe you don't want to have your
information out on Facebook for
everybody to see so we're gonna set up a
private little website you can create
for yourself so you can put all your own
personal information on your own site
nobody else will be able to see it but
maybe that's what you want to do so I'm
gonna call this page my friends okay now
maybe I should spell friends properly
you notice I use a dash here and you
notice the page name name of my HTML
page tells me something about the page
so what am I telling you here I'm saying
but in this HTML page I'm gonna have
information about my friends so I'll say
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
