sites calm I feel like nailing social
media again so why because more news is
coming out so I figure what the heck so
you look at this Financial Post
investing social media stock collapse
conjures up calm bust yeah so let's take
a look so today group on another darling
of the wall street machine so we got
group on dropping nine percent today I
would see let's see since it went public
how much have you lost so since it went
public in November 2011 eight months ago
you've lost 73.5 seven percent of your
money yeah and not a very good
investment of course the CEO and all the
people who took the company public
they've all cashed out with a big big
wad of cash but something really gets on
my nerves see in the stock market
there's this whole excuse me in the
stock market there used to be there's a
scam called the pump and the dump and
what they do typically is they find tiny
little companies penny stocks pay stocks
or stocks that are worth pennies to
share and anyway so what they do is
they'll to put out a bunch of news false
news and they'll get it people hyped up
on it and then the pump the stock up and
as the stock values are pumped up the
people who are responsible for the pump
and dump scam they will be dumping this
stock to make their profits and so what
you know when I look at Groupon I look
at facebook you know they're down we'll
see from you know it went public from
going publicly down thirty-nine percent
from their IPO price 38 bucks of course
a lot of people bought it at 45 see the
height of 45 so they've lost nearly half
their money about forty-eight percent
when I see this type of action and if
you look over my google plus account or
Facebook I was morning people a month or
so before the IPO before it even went
public I said stay away from facebook I
still think facebook is worth somewhere
below a dollar share and I think it's
gonna you know I don't have much faith
in the whole business model the whole
social networking business model I
talked about that in another video the
one exception of course is linked in
it's actually it's not at its its high
but it hasn't collapsed like the other
guys although I question how much money
they're making their it's it's their
evaluation is frankly absolutely crazy
if you look at its six price-to-earnings
p/e price-to-earnings ratio the share
price divided by earnings per share so
basically in a normal market this is
usually eight to twelve times right this
is at six hundred and forty four times
its it's absolutely astronomical
basically they're saying WOW right this
is like take 644 years of the crane at
the current rate to get your money back
which is crazy let's compare that to a
company that actually makes money Apple
if you look at Apple which is that a
huge huge shield the most profitable
famous tech company around today look at
its price-to-earnings ratio 13.99 so 14
x 14 x vs linkedin 644 times let's look
at facebook now it's back there only a
hundred and twenty four times groupon
see they don't have a PE here I guess
cuz yeah they're officially losing ton
of money so so you get the idea if we go
back to Apple 13.99
14 times now you hopefully are seeing
why I think that Facebook is totally
ridiculous I can't see how Facebook is
worth that much more on a price-earnings
ratio on the p/e ratio here than Apple
it makes no sense why because Facebook's
technology is not hard to reproduce
social networks are notoriously fickle
friendster myspace anybody nobody goes
to those sites anymore yeah so this is
this is nuts this is nuts people have
such different memories this is so
reminiscent of town you this is so
reminiscent of the dot-com bubble boom
and bust and I believe a bust is coming
I know this is not technology strictly
supposed to be here teaching web design
web programming but I think as
professionals in the field you have to
sort of get a feel for what the trends
are and what money is now you see a lot
of money was dumped into social networks
over the last 5 10 years now with the
Facebook Twitter groupon etc
livingsocial Zynga see that's another
one that's going into the toilets Zynga
see they listed you know because they're
losing money big-time so it's like you
know they're down again you know really
look at having some people actually paid
fifteen dollars a share 5091 and now
it's going for three dollars so you know
holy Cripe poor guys now if you bought
at the opening you've lost 68.3 two
percent and if you are unlucky enough to
buy a little later say Bob's in February
this just passed februari you've lost
seventy seven point three nine percent
of your money all these things are you
know they to meet a pump and dump scams
I'm not saying they are technically but
I think there's a lot of
yeah I don't trust it so these companies
are not something you can bank on don't
dust them don't invest in the market at
all it's it's a rigged game that's
pretty clear but generally speaking as
software developers what designers and
so on don't count on social networking
trend to be something that's going to
carry on for much longer it reminds me
again somebody that was all the rage
10-15 years ago that was the directories
directories are everywhere and
everybody's reading directory scripts
and everybody that directory is the
biggest one of course is Yahoo who uses
a directory these days this is like dead
skis and I think social networks are
going to fall into that niche again as I
said in a previous video social networks
are going to be something included
within the context of a truly viable
business something like a Google+ which
I'm a fan of well if an office is an
exaggeration I'm not a big fan of social
network so I don't think you should put
your I don't think it's wise but all
your personal information out there for
everybody to see so that's it so I just
wanted to harp again on these social
media companies social media in general
as a business model I think it's flawed
and the way it's being executed these
days as a software developer I wouldn't
get too excited about social media sites
if you can get a gig working on them and
they're going to pay you well fine
that's great but I you know don't don't
you know you know how I feel so that's
it another vblog by Steph yeah whatever
I saw this article and I saw the groupon
action today and I had that was I felt
compelled to V blog about it that's it
