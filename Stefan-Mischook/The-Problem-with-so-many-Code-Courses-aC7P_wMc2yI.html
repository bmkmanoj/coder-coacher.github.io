written by a student instead it was
complaining about the nature of her
education saying that she was just being
crammed full of bunch of information
remembering facts but not really
understanding anything not understanding
the big picture she felt that she was
just coming away with a bunch of facts a
bunch of memorization not a real
understanding and that kind of reminded
me of a lot of the cold courses that are
out there you see there are two types of
cold courses that I see out there you
see the project-based courses where they
walk you through projects and walk you
through projects is cool but it
shouldn't be the first level walking
through projects has its uses but the
problem is that a lot of times the
people that are walking you through
projects are not really explaining or
teaching you all the basic things all
the fundamental concepts and techniques
behind the projects that support the
projects for me and in my courses we do
teach and do teach with projects but
that's only in integration with a good
foundational teaching curriculum if you
will and what does that mean that means
that I teach you not only the how but I
teach you the why and I give you the
context and as I've been saying in other
vlogs I've talked about this met for
many years in fact
the key to becoming a great developer is
understanding the fundamental principles
and techniques because what you're gonna
find as you get into your development
career is that with just about every
project you're gonna have to learn
something new so with that in mind it
kind of makes sense that you really
understand the basic principles and this
will allow you to learn new technologies
new frameworks new languages much much
more easily
besides the project-based courses you
also have I don't know how I would call
my cuz I would call them the snippet
based courses where they have you write
one line of code
little beasts code but they don't really
teach you how to use this code for real
it's just kind of all disjointed I've
had many people tell me if they've done
this de site and not saying this this
course in that course and they don't
they don't know what to do they know
they weren't like kind of whatever
function is and kind of what an object
is but they don't know how to actually
use it to do anything and on the other
hand you have people have done the
project so they've run through a
project-based course and they they're
writing the code and at the end they
sort of get something working but they
don't know why half the code does what
it what it's doing and why to use it and
why would you want to use that style of
coding here and you want to use this
style coding they don't even - have no
idea so they would walk into any type of
project for real and they would not be
able to actually do anything why you
have courses like that because most of
the courses put out by people are either
put out by coders who have zero teaching
experience and even worse coders with
zeros teaching experience we've all been
coding for a few years a teacher has two
major roles number one the teacher has
to simplify the key concepts so that the
still will have that solid foundation to
launch the career whether it be coding
whether it be software development in
Java or PHP or Python whatever or
whether it be martial arts or business
you have to be taught the true key
fundamentals and these fundamentals have
to be simplified so that you really
understand what what's going on and the
other thing that a good teacher has to
do is they have to identify the key
concepts that are required to be able to
create that foundation with programming
there are many many things that you can
learn like just within a particular
language like Python for instance or
JavaScript whatever language you pick
they're big they're big and there's all
kinds of libraries and all kinds of
things that you can do but just like
when you're using Mac OS or Windows you
use only a very small sliver of
you use a very small sliver of Microsoft
Windows of any app right if you're using
a spreadsheet Excel you don't use hardly
anything in there compared to all the
tools that all the capabilities that a
complex piece of software has same thing
with programming languages you have all
kinds of things that you could do but
most at a time 99% at a time when you're
writing software you're gonna be using
maybe 10% of the language maybe 20%
depending and once in a while you're
gonna you know use this module here use
this library here etc again that sort of
fundamentals coming once because you
once you have a fundamental a good
understanding of the fundamentals of a
programming language or a framework and
the rest comes easy if you want to jump
into this jump into that that's how my
career was when I was a freelance
software developer I would walk into
projects with well once I had some
experience they have four five years
experience I would walk into a project
and I would have no preconceptions with
regards to the language I would choose I
would be open to and using any language
or any framework even though at the time
this is in the 1990s early 2000s I was
big into Java that was really my
favorite programming language and I even
had my own Java framework that I had
developed that being said there were
several projects where Java was not a
good fit and sometimes I would have to
learn a new language a new programming
language to get up to speed but because
fortunately I had really good training
in the fundamentals and that took me a
long time to put it together it was easy
for me to learn new programming
languages I can literally learn a new
programming language in a couple of days
and be functional or learn a new
framework in a couple days to be
functional and that's really what a good
course should have that's what a good
teacher should be able to provide is a
simplify the key concepts and beat
identify those key concepts that you
need to know so that you can get up and
running as quickly as possible you don't
want to go down these
rabbit holes of new rabbit holes were
you going to learn some strange
specialized libraries some rarely use
aspect of the language there's no point
in learning it now because let me tell
you there's gonna be tons of opportunity
for you to learn things as you are
working as a professional developer
either for yourself or working for a
company or developing your own apps
again the key to being a great
programmer great developer is to have a
super solid understanding of the
fundamentals and any experienced
developer will tell you that somebody
tells you that's not the case you know
that they are just junior intermediate
level developers and there you go I hope
this is useful bye-bye
I just wanted to finish off this I
forgot to mention so I had mentioned in
a vlog I don't know about a month ago or
something but I was getting into the
whole minimalism thing I've always been
a minimalist if you look at my furniture
I like designer furniture but have you
know very modern simple lie and simple
styles like Eames and Rush Limbaugh's
stuff like that so my style is very
minimalist by nature and I think that I
got that from my martial arts because in
martial arts the key to martial arts is
to strip away all the excess movement so
a beginner will throw punches that are
inefficient but as you become more and
more and more advanced you're punching
you're kicking you're grappling
everything becomes much more efficient
energy efficient in terms of body
mechanics and alignment they become more
efficient efficiency is what separates
the beginner from the master or from the
expert anyway with that in mind I can I
am continuing my move towards minimalism
and I'm I'm basically just given away
giving away tons of stuff I just gave
away another five bags of clothes and
duvets and Hawk Isis stuff stuff that I
was not using I have a rule which I
never I didn't implement as as well as I
should but had this rule this one year
rule if you're not wearing a piece of
clothes
with you know within the year you
probably don't need it and maybe you
should just give it away to somebody who
could use it and that might be the same
thing for gadgets and devices like I
have video cameras that shoot 720p and
they're fine but since I got fancy
cameras like this there's no reason for
me to keep these these it's handycams
right already call camcorders there we
go so I'm gonna be giving away these
things as well and I've town you every
time I give away something it's like
losing five pounds if it feels great and
so something to consider it's it's
almost frees your mind and what it also
does interestingly enough it it prevents
you or it reminds you maybe not to buy
stuff unless you absolutely need to I
was thinking of getting something
forgive it was minor piece of furniture
but I was like yeah I'm probably just
gonna give it away in a year so why am i
buying this thing so it's a kind of an
interesting mental experiment minimalism
if you have that opportunity to become a
minimalist we are fortunate enough to
have excess in your life I highly
recommend you take a look at it because
let me tell you you just feel pretty
good afterwards alright that's it for
sure buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
