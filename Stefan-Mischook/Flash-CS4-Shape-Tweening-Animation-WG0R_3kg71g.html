going to be creating inside of Flash is
called shape tweening now shape tweening
takes its name from in between in
between two states and what I mean by
that is we're going to be creating the
first drawing first shape in an
animation and we're also going to be
drawing the second final shape of the
animation and what happens in that
scenario is flash will morph or change
one shape into another and this is
really kind of an interesting approach
to animation and it's something that I
really want to stress that while might
look cool initially is something that
you should really use sparingly it's
very taxing on the computer processing
when you are actually you know compiling
this animation so you should really
think about you know using it sparingly
I like to think of it almost like the
Cheesecake of animation why cheesecake
well you shouldn't have cheesecake every
single day of your life but you have it
once in a month or something like that
Wow one of the greatest pleasures of
life so use shape animation sparingly
alright well let's get started by
creating our shape animation and as you
can see here you could choose to use a
stroke or not in fact I'm gonna choose
no stroke and you can see that by just
pressing down on the stroke color as you
saw there and when you get your drop
down menu of colors you'll see that in
the top right hand corner there is a
icon that looks just like this meaning
no stroke so I'm creating as you can see
here a red square now let me point out
one thing in particular you'll notice
the one I'm doing this my rectangle
drawing does not have this tool selected
object drawing and the reason being is
because I don't want to have this as a
grouped item I want this to be an
individual shape so when I select this
with my with my black arrow tool my
selection tool you'll see a bunch of
these little white dots all around your
tool when you click on the stage they go
of course so we don't see that blue
bounding box shape tween will not work
if you are doing this with either a
grouped object or a symbol and you might
not know what a symbol is because you
haven't gotten to that video yet but
when you see symbols you'll understand a
little bit more about it in that video
about how symbols are sort of like these
containers these groups of different
objects nevertheless they're much more
powerful than a simple groove but the
main point I'm trying to get across here
is that shape tweens will only work with
shapes how do I know that this is a
shape well number one if I select it you
can see it's got those white dots all
over the place and if we open up our
properties window you can see it's
described as a shape not as an object
drawing not as a symbol all right so
we've got the beginning of our animation
and what we want to be doing is taking
the shape and bringing it to another
shape or converting it into another
shape morphing it into another shape so
first and foremost let's do this let's
deselect that object let's choose
another color can choose whatever color
you want but if I choose red and let's
say blue for this moment not really all
that imaginative but nevertheless what
I'm gonna do is to say well look I still
have my default set to 30 frames per
second so I'm gonna say well I want one
second of animation so if you remember
30 frames go all the way to frame 30
that would equal one frame or excuse me
one second of animation so at this point
I'm not gonna press the shortcut f6 to
create a new keyframe I'm not gonna be
making a copy of the previous frame I
actually want to make one shape at the
first frame and a completely different
shape at frame 30 so rather than you
know insert a keyframe and then having
to delete that shape there's another way
that you can go about that and that's to
right click here and say insert a blank
keyframe so you'll notice that you know
my Square starts off at 1 and goes to 29
and then
banging at frame 30 disappears that's
because the keyframe at frame 30 is
empty there's nothing inside of it
there's no contents in that frame so at
this point we're gonna change our
rectangle tool into our oval and you'll
notice I'm still not making it's just a
shape it's not an object drawing or
anything like that and if I hold shift I
will make a perfect blue circle so you
can kind of see where those elements are
it's not really square it's a rectangle
going to a circle and as I'm scrubbing
the timeline we can see that these
things are not exactly in the same
position so I'm going to introduce to
you something that's really kind of
interesting when you're working with the
timeline and that is this key icon right
here well I'll show you all of them one
of them says edit multiple frames one
says onion skin and outline and the
first one just says onion skin so let's
see what that does well you'll notice
that if you scrub your timeline you can
see that there are two different dots
next to your reading head the red marker
so what I can do is I can extend and see
what's behind my red marker or what's in
front of it now in this case I just need
to see what's behind it so if I'm on
frame 30 and you don't even need to see
all of those frames although that's
useful and remember this is a great tool
to use if you want to do some walk
cycles or anything with keyframe
animation so as you can see here I'm
gonna select my selection tool and I'm
going to move this roughly into the
center of the two objects you can even
use your arrow keys to sort of nudge
that thing back and forth so now that I
deselect the onion skinning we can see
that that circle now is much more in the
center of the rectangle all right great
so we're halfway done we've got a shape
at the beginning what's one color shape
at the end that's another color so what
we're going to be doing in this case now
is the final moment where we right-click
anywhere in between those two points you
could click at the beginning
or anywhere in between and what we're
gonna say here is create a shape between
so right-click create a shape tween when
you do that what you should see is an
arrow going from one of the dots to the
next and a green bar well if we scrub
that you can almost hear the transformer
sound effect happening as this works its
way along and you'll notice that it's
changing from a rectangle into your
circle amazing look at that one other
thing I want to bring your attention I
used red and blue not by you know
haphazardly but I did so on purpose so
that you could see that by the time I
get to 15 I've got a mix of red and blue
when it gives me a purple sort of color
in the middle and that's because shape
tween not only tweens shapes but it also
tweens colors another great way to use a
shape tween so that's the beginning of
your shape tween and as you saw a little
bit of onion skin at work there as well
but there's something else that we're
going to be looking at as you can see
the shape tween is sort of like turning
into my rectangle which is okay but not
exactly what I wanted
so we'll do something to help along with
that called shape hints in the next
