Earth as you can see here today I am
working inside of a dreamweaver
environment and we're bringing you the
latest killer sites video tutorial
dealing with CSS layout so basically
what we're going to be attempting to
instruct you on in this series of videos
is basically how to get together a
simple CSS layout inside of HTML and you
can do this whether you're working
inside dreamweaver or whether you're
working just in a simple text editor
either way as I proceed I will be
showing you both the code and the design
view to show you exactly what's going on
and in the series of tutorials we're
going to be looking at two things in
particular number one how to create a
fixed pixel layout and will explain more
about what that means as well as how to
create something more along the lines of
a liquid layout something that actually
resizes as your browser resizes as well
there's a couple of tricks and
techniques that you should be using and
I will be showing you the latest
techniques on how to do this inside of
Dreamweaver cs5 the latest release and
if you've used dreamweaver before you
probably can see a number of differences
specifically as you can see here they've
got the split screen view not top and
bottom anymore but side to side which is
actually quite nice it makes perfect
sense especially considering that the
vast majority of what we're going to be
seeing is something that we can share
and if you've got a large enough screen
resolution then you'll be able to see
your entire design view exactly the way
you intended now we may not be able to
see it exactly the way it will in the
browser but that's why we check in the
browser so all of these things will be
doing in the next series of lessons and
we will commence in the next video with
how to create a CSS fixed pixel layout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
