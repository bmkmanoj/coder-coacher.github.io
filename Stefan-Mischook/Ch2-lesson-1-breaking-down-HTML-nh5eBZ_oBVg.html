the word HTML HTML is short for
hypertext markup language so let's start
with hypertext hypertext is just the
text in a web page
it's called hypertext is because it's
kind of like hyperactive text what it's
trying to describe is the fact that HTML
pages can move around the world super
quick so you could for instance put
something a status update on Facebook
and your friend in the other side of the
country you can see it right away it's
super fast
compare this to printed text on paper
now if you wrote something you want it
or if you wrote a letter and you wanted
to send it to your buddy you have to
write the letter then you have to go to
the post office send it and four or five
days later he gets it so it's pretty
slow compared to HTML compared to
webpages that's why it's called
hypertext think of a hyperactive text I
know today we look at this we go yeah
well big deal
but you're gonna remember this is just
twenty years ago or so this was invented
and this is a big deal and it really
changed the world hypertext is super
cool so what's what's a markup language
a markup language is basically a
computer language that is used to mark
up a page or in other words it's used to
give more information about a page
there's a few markup languages out there
but hTML is by far but most important
and that's what we're learning here so
we'll talk about HTML so hTML is the
markup language of hypertext right and
what it does is that it describes to web
browsers like Internet Explorer Chrome
Firefox Safari so on the markup language
describes what is in the web page so
that could be paragraphs of text it
could be images it could be video files
it could be mp3 files that's what the
markup language the HTML markup language
is used for it's used again to describe
what is inside a page and that's what a
markup language
is all about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
