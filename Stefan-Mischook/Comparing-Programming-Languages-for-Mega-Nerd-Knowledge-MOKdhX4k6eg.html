calm and steady web if you've been
watching my videos you know that I
really lean on my martial arts
background a lot when it comes to my
coding decisions by business decisions
and entrepreneurial activities if you
will everything what you'll see in life
is that if you take any skill set
whether it be martial arts business
coding development etc you take any
skill set and you work it for 5 10 15
years or longer the lessons that you
learn from whatever skills that you're
practicing will transfer on to all
fields of study and I discover that in a
big way with martial arts where I had
been doing martial arts for quite a bit
when I started cold so I started coding
in 1994-95 started building websites and
at that point I had been doing martial
arts I don't know I guess 15 years or so
and a lot of the advanced concepts that
I picked up in martial arts I would just
rely on those when I made my coding
decisions so let me give you some simple
examples like like being very simple in
terms of your code being very efficient
with your code trying to have less code
to get the job done I got this directly
from martial arts specifically
personally me and exclusive to it but I
got this from Jeet Kune Do Bruce Lee's
stuff and one of the basic principles of
Bruce Lee's art was to absorb what is
useful from different styles of fighting
to take what you like reject what you
don't like and then to simplify
everything but you do think about coding
coding is exactly the same way you
should learn different languages
different structures different
frameworks different libraries mostly
you have to learn everything we should
learn a few different things
and then you're going to take what's
good for you what works for your
particular type of work that you want to
do and your personality type and then
you just reject the rest and then when
you write your code you try to make your
code as minimal and as simple as
possible
you don't want fancy super complex
algorithms if you can afford not to have
that the more complex you make your code
the harder you make it to maintain and
that's one of the things you have to
realize is as a developer you're going
to have to maintain code another
principle I learned from martial arts
was from was the basic rule that is good
to mix and match style so you can
compare and contrast different
techniques different philosophies
different training methods the same
thing with coding I personally found
that with each new language that I
learned my ability to code in all
languages increased so my first
programming language I believe was
JavaScript in 96 not sure but I think
that was it I may have done a bit of pro
before but in such a long time but the
first one I got into is JavaScript then
I got it to be B script and I got into
ASP classic and yeah Lea Java yeah and
so on
so with every new language but I learned
my overall understanding of programming
increased quite a bit because I was able
to see how different languages approach
the same concepts how Java stripper's
has handled functions and data types and
datatype overloading versus Java for
instance Java JavaScript to different
languages they have similar names
because the marketing purposes back in
the 90s but that's about it
javascript is a scripting language that
is loosely typed Java is not really
scripting laws not stripping language is
a full-fledged programming language and
that very strongly type and there's a
whole bunch of the differences as well
anyway here's a disk point out that it
makes sense to learn JavaScript and
maybe to learn Java or some other
program
by wishing that with each successive
language that you learned your overall
understanding of programming would just
get better because you will be able to
compare and contrast different languages
in their approaches the same thing with
frameworks you have several JavaScript
frameworks out there some compete and
it'd be interesting some overlap and
would be interesting to compare and
contrast framework to see how different
people approach different things that's
how I came to develop my own MVC
server-side framework in Java by looking
at a whole bunch of Java frameworks at
the time and I decided at that time but
I wanted my simple lightweight my own
implementation let's say it was the
greatest framework it wasn't but for the
type of work in the type of contract
work I was doing at the time it worked
really really well for me and the
frameworks that were around at the time
I just didn't like I thought they're too
complex and I'll leave with this today I
would never consider rolling out my own
framework there were so many frameworks
out there the landscape if you will of
frameworks whether it be server-side
frameworks or client-side frameworks
they're all very mature and there is no
sense to reinvent the wheel now so
python may get django and you get others
you got run rails you got laravel and
PHP you got spring on Java lab blah blah
blah etc there is no reason to create
your own server-side framework
practically no reason so I would not
even approach that just in case you're
thinking about that remember when I was
talking about that when I said I rolled
out my own MVC framework that is because
this was in the 90s this is a very
different time for now you're lucky now
a frameworks are far more mature you can
get much more done with so much less
code and complexity and there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
