and then shut down my online dating site
so here's a story that goes back to
1999-2000 something like this 2001 and
in fact this dating site was one of the
reasons why I ended up getting into
teaching code online where I started in
2002 2003 so how did it begin so I'm a
young nerd young nerdling back in the
day and I was really into Java at the
time I was learning Java I was exploring
the did you know whose job is big right
so I was exploring all the different
capabilities of the language and I said
you know what instead of me just doing
little one-off things here and there I
said I'm just gonna do a project just
for fun so I decided to build a dating
app hey what the hell build a dating app
not that I had any aspirations to own a
dating site or anything I just that
would be a subject so I just started
building a dating site back in those
days I had an ADSL line coming right
into my place this has cost me like five
hundred dollars a month and I had my own
web server right in my apartment I had
to actually had the server in a closet
backup battery
and so on and I was doing everything
local I wouldn't advise us today I would
even go to the cloud or get a dedicated
server although these days I would lean
towards the cloud much more so anyhow so
so I was developing it this dating site
in Java again just to experiment with
Java technology so I built it up and we
had something going and it was an
interesting dating site it had a twist
to it it it was a dating site designed
to plug into other people's websites and
what it did is that the idea behind it
rather was that if you had like a
nightclub for instance the Veii could
plug in my dating site you know said a
couple configurations colors and fonts
and stuff and it would literally look
like their website
and the whole reasoning behind it in
terms of the business application was
that you know to get people to come to
your dating site was a lot of work this
is pre Google what Google's just
starting out so search engines were very
good so they get the traffic it was hard
at first so I figured if I could partner
with some night clubs and get them to
you know they have a website they
probably have people going to their
website and get them to basically drive
membership into the dating app across
all kinds of night clubs so you figured
if you get 50 night clubs whatever you
can start building up an interesting
little user base so that was the plan
again it was a there was no real
commercial aspirations was more of an
experiment than anything else so I set
it up and I told a friend of mine about
it he's I I know some club owners so he
just I'll talk to some people so
whatever so I'm working on it working on
guess their members start coming in
people start plugging into it and I
didn't keep track of so much the
business centre that I was much more
into the coding you know different how
to deal with messaging had a deal with
reviews and all kinds of stuff just
working with the tech so one day I'm
working on it and I get an email from
some woman who was using the site it was
some tech support question and okay some
problem with the messaging or something
so I said okay I'll look into all the
buckets you know and so I check in at
this point to say I had about maybe
fifteen fifteen sixteen thousand members
something like that and I did start
charging a little bit at this point to
start charging that's entry a little
Side Story I started to charge us to see
what the hell I'll start charging and I
was charging five bucks a month or six
bucks a month something like that let's
see what happens and the people started
paying people started paying now in
those days online dating was a little
bit taboo I know it seems weird today in
the days of tinder and the plenty of
fish and stuff been those days a little
bit tad taboo
you're a bit of a loser of your online
dating so I said okay on the billing
statement for my online dating site it
was gonna be it was written soon like
Jimmy's coffee shop or something like
this and I was transparent it you're
gonna be billed as Jimmy
coffee shop so people don't know you're
using online dating online dating was
almost like you know not exactly joining
a porn site but was maybe one or two
steps above that at that time so
whatever so so a lot of people you know
they were joined you know they were
getting Jimmy's cafe on their credit
card statements
there's a reason I'm telling you this so
anyway back to this woman so I started
checking into the system so with Java
you can have a console Java is different
from languages server-side languages
like PHP for instance or Java when you
start up the Java engine the JVM it's
running and it's it's always running
where's PHP page loads loads and it
shuts down loads shuts down Java it's
always in memory you load up the
equivalent of a PHP page in Java web
there servlets and jsps and so on they
stay in memory so they're always there
lingering like like it's like opening up
an app but it's just running the
significance of that is that when I was
debugging the messaging system I would
pull up a console and and I would
started I turn on the debug e and I have
all these messages being relayed to me
when messages are centered from where
from who what's going on you know how
headers so think about it like a Friday
night with my friends I would spend an
extra two hours before going out to work
on my little app here my dating site so
I'm debugging this messaging system
because there's woman emailing me and
then I was like looking through all the
messaging you know like it's all
appearing on screen in front of me and I
wasn't trying to be a peeping tom
effectively I was just debugging but
effectively I became a peeping tom was
like and then I discussed it holy crap
the message I start seeing all these
messages messages they couldn't believe
what was going on it was pretty pretty
adult stuff if you oh so then I said
who's on the site so I started
investigating who was on the site and
what had happen is one of the top
swinger sites in North America had
hooked up with the system I don't know
so what happened is that my system
became a huge
a swingers hub holy swingers organizing
stuff through my site now I have never
taken swears not my thing you know
whatever I'm a libertarian in that
respect and so you know I let it go you
know whatever but it started I have to
admit start freaking me out like holy
crap all these swingers and I just
didn't you know at the time I didn't
want to be associated with that you know
and I'm not casting aspersions you know
but you know it's just I don't want to
be known as king of the swingers and
code you know it was a no-no so what
happened is anyway
within several months I decided you know
what I'm just gonna I'm not gonna do
this whole thing I'm not gonna do this
this site and I just shut it down
I just shut her down it was growing it
was growing is rowing some of you are
glad you shut it down that's crazy
I was just not comfortable being
associated with that world you got to
think about these things you gotta think
about you know what's your long-term
association even if you're not doing
that even though I'm not a swinger who
wasn't interested in being a swinger
even though I don't really care either
way you don't want to be associated with
that necessarily you there some people
Michael yeah you know maybe you know the
fact that I'm working with other
institutions you know if they found out
I owned the very popular swingers site
and may not go over too well so that's
why I shut it down
this years and years ago so why did I
mention the juvies cafe because so I
shut it down and I let everybody know
I'm shutting it down shutting it down
and then I I would get these statements
I realized months after I shut down
people were still paying for the
subscription and I think maybe they just
kept a subscription on they couldn't be
bothered is that they never check that
I'd shut it down
maybe they kept it on because they
thought maybe it was going to a coffee
shop I must have went to some coffee
shop called Jimmy's coffee I feel what I
called it to be honest with you but it
was something like that so I had to
manually go in there and shut it down
myself shut down those those rebuilds
you know so there you go that's why I
started my own
dating say it was to learn technology
and there's a lesson in that if you want
to get a job as a coder as a developer
boot camps are fine they can maybe help
you out I always suggest try online
courses first see if you're motivated
but really what people are going to be
looking for well I would be looking for
when looking to hire a coder would be
somebody who's self starting somebody
was like young staff who on Friday night
would spent two hours extra two three
hours working on his pet project to
explore technologies to work on things
this shows a genuine interest in it
because people who are like that people
who actually work in at it as a hobby
really enjoy the code coding and
development for what it is they're gonna
in the end be much better developers and
somebody who's just doing for a job
because let me tell you coding is an
intense work it requires full
concentration like maybe if you're like
in a boxing match same type of thing but
if you really enjoy it's still a lot of
fun you know just like boxing I guess
alright that's pretty much it I hope you
found the story interesting ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
