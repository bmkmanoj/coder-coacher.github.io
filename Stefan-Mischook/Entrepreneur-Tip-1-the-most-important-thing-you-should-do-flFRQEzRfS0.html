number one tip you could give to a
budding entrepreneur I would have to say
in 2017 2018 the first thing you should
do is learn to code not necessarily
because you want to become a coder or
because your product is code centric the
fact that matter is is that these days
modern-day businesses rely on software
and a lot of times custom software are
customized software so if you know how
to code you're gonna give yourself first
of all a good understanding of how to
build software even if you don't ever
use those skills and that's going to
give you a huge advantage so first of
all if you think about modern companies
a lot of them right from the get-go
our software base whether you're
building apps for smartphones or you're
building a website or a web app etc etc
so right there by learning how to code
you open up that possibility of that
probability the other thing you can
think about even if your product is not
cold centric a big part about running a
business is being able to deliver a
service or a product more efficiently
more cheaply than your competitor I'm
not saying - so you're going to deliver
a cheap product but you just be able to
do it you're gonna set up processes in
your business to be able to deliver the
product at whatever price point it
happens to be more efficiently and these
days that has a lot to do with using
software and coding so even if you are
using let's say Microsoft Office with
Excel spreadsheets or using Google Docs
with Google Spreadsheets understanding
how to code so you can automate some of
that stuff it could go a long way in
terms of implementing efficiency in your
business and finally if you understand
how to code and you're gonna be dealing
with coders at some point or you're
dealing with people who are gonna be
implementing software by having that
background at least you understand
what's going on and it will make you a
better judge in terms of the software
that you may implement or the code that
you hire
somebody to write for you in terms of
what they're gonna write you me by
learning a little bit about let's say
the web development stack into HTML CSS
you have a script you understand the web
really well and you understand what it
makes sense to develop a web app you
understand your choices in terms of
websites or maybe you learn Python and
you can understand where and how Python
can be used maybe it makes sense to use
Python to do X Y or Z again even if your
business has nothing to do with code and
technology you can be sure that you can
use code and technology to give your
business and advantage by creating more
efficient business processes so it's a
win-win-win if you learn how to code if
you are an aspiring entrepreneur and I
can tell you this from my own experience
going back to the 90s I started my first
business when I was 18 I'm not a rich
kid I built it up and I was able to
pretty much retire at 32 as a result of
my efforts and a big part of the reason
I was able to make progress and to
succeed is because I had a deep
understanding of coding I was able to
implement technology in ways that gave
me advantages and my first business had
nothing to do with technology was the
import-export business water
purification well IT technology and I
imported rare fish and so on and so had
nothing to do with writing code later on
became that I sold out of that first
business went into others but I have to
say if any skill has been super handy
for me it has been coding skills keep
that in mind and there's much more to
business of course much more but this is
the first thing you should master
especially if you're young or any age
sit down take a coding course doesn't
have to be mind be any coding course and
it's good to find a coding course that's
real world oriented business oriented so
that it will speed up your learning
process anyhow that's my tip first thing
you got to do if you're going to get
into business today these days the most
important skill set to have I would say
as a business owner as our
is coding and note the great thing is if
your business doesn't work out for
whatever reason heaven forbid you can
have valuable coding skills that you
could sell into the market for big money
all right that's it for today superhot I
got to go out Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
