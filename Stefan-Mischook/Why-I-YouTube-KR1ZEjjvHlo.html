show couple questions that was put to me
recently so people asked why do I do all
these videos where I talk about you know
coding and the business of coding and
careers and coding and so on there's a
few reasons for it number one I would
keep getting asked questions from people
by email you know people who buy my
courses my web developer course is
people coming to my websites killer
sites or killer PHP or whatever and they
kept asking me a lot of business
oriented questions so I figured I might
as well put up a bunch of videos on them
just to get it out there so people can
watch them I figure some people would
find it useful you notice on my channel
I don't have any ads right I don't put
any YouTube ads on there and I don't
even know how much I would make with
that I think at this point you know in a
month I get maybe 50,000 or 60,000 views
or something so it's not a huge amount
but the YouTube thing is more or less of
a hobby for me it also it also allows me
to communicate with people out there as
a sideline though I find that it
actually has a lot of people who watch
my videos on YouTube end up buying my
interactive web developer package
because when they go and they see how it
is it's a you see the value of it it's
not I don't want to be a commercial for
my package though the big difference
with my my interactive web developer
package versus anything else that you're
going to see out there all the other
video vendors and course vendors besides
that you know you know the quality of
course you can decide whether or not
they're good for you is the fact that
it's it's interactive you have that
whole Q &amp;amp; A type of structure in my
courses which are very very different
than just watching a bunch of videos I
think that's what a big one of the big
things so another reason why I do these
YouTube videos is because it helps me to
keep developing my skill sets as a
presenter I have been teaching code
since 2003 and frankly I'm a better
writing and communicating through
written word that I am through video
although in last several years I've
started I'm starting to finally get
comfortable in front of the camera but I
have to tell you it was really difficult
for me it was really difficult for me to
be to just let my personality come out
when I was on camera because when you're
teaching detailed things like
programming languages or object-oriented
code here so if you have to very you
have to be very specific in terms of the
topics that you cover you have to cover
topic a before you go to be before
you'll see so that's much more difficult
at least for me to present then if
you're just vlogging about you know then
how you make banana cake or something so
by doing these YouTube videos on a daily
basis there's a certain benefit to me
because I'm just refining my skill set
and I'm just grinding it through every
time I do a video every time I present a
subject on YouTube or wherever else my
overall skills as a presenter increases
that's all so what does that mean that
means that I have to do much less edits
now when I do my professional courses I
have to do many less takes so it's just
much easier and the quality overall
improves in terms of my presentation let
me help you understand that when I look
at videos there's when there's two
things you got to look at when you look
at videos especially training courses
you got to look at the presentation
style in terms of how engaging the
speaker's is the monotone like this or
is does he have some dynamics in his
voices or some range and there's also
the teaching value whether or not the
teacher is able to break down the
complex subjects into simple to
understand chunks so there's two things
to get a look at what you see out there
typically is not very good overall in
terms of training courses uses but what
you see more often than not 95% of time
when you do see somebody looks pretty
good it's usually very it's usually
pretty good in terms of present
presentation style they can present well
there's dynamics in their voice and so
forth but in terms of
being able to break down complexity to
make it simple to teach that's where I
find a lot of these online web courses
are lacking and the reason that is
because most people were teaching code
online with teaching development online
they've never taught before they're not
trained teachers they don't understand
how to teach there is a skill set there
is a structure of teaching you have to
understand the psychology you have to
psyche you have to understand psychology
you have to understand how people learn
how the brain learns and so on I am NOT
a trained teacher but I studied
psychology and university my follows a
teacher and over the last five six years
working with schools with my studio web
system we've refined that as well in
terms of really raising the bar in terms
of how I present my my course material
so it's really easy to understand you
you know besides the fact I've been
teaching code since 2003 that also
experience earned in the marketplace
goes a long way and all the feedback and
so on you keep improving you say to
reconsider this goes back to coding as
well when you learn how to code
academically whether it be through one
of my courses or you go to school or
whatever you know that's the beginning
of knowledge you really get into it is
when you jump into the game you're
actually writing code you're building
apps a good coding course should teach
you much more event just to coding they
should teach you the process they should
teach you about the pitfalls teach you
about the reality the reality based
coding training is what you need now to
get that you need somebody who's who's
been coding for years to be able to
teach you all this kind of stuff so one
of the things I've learned over the
years and I keep emphasizing this when
it comes to learning code is to really
concentrate on the basics try not to get
caught up in a new fad framework or new
fad language or a new fad process at the
end of the day what separates the great
coders from the not-so-great coders the
great coders have a nice grasp of
mastery of the basic concepts in coding
in app development and so on and I've
talked about this in many videos so
there you go so to answer that question
I
on YouTube a to just it's just an easy
way for me to answer questions B allows
me to practice my ability to deliver
video better and C it also gives me
promotion like a frankly I'm surprised
at how many people watching my youtube
videos go and buy my course package
because well because the videos are much
more career oriented although I do
explosive on my cold courses whereas
when you go to my training packages my
training package specially the
interactive web developer it's much more
language and you know into the real nut
the boat nuts and bolts of coding and of
course you got the whole QA thing
happening you know just the Q&amp;amp;A portion
of my courses has nearly around twenty
five thousand words to put it in context
my book which I wrote last year what
designs start here that had about 30,000
or thirty five thousand words one edited
I wrote maybe fifty thousand words and
you know through the process with the
editors and you work with the publishers
they added you down and so the
interactive web developer my online
course just the quizzing in a Q&amp;amp;A
section where it's kind of like having a
semi-private Q&amp;amp;A with me is over twenty
five thousand words well around twenty
five thousand words of text and so
that's an extra added value there as
well so that takes it to a whole new
level and it you you see people who post
it on YouTube you similar comments
several people have you know you have
taken my course who found me through my
youtube channel they comment on and they
talked about so you get an idea of how
how much they really liked it so there
you go those are reasons why I do the
YouTube channel it's it benefits
everybody else Chris because I try to
answer questions but also helps me to in
certain ways alright thanks for watching
we'll talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
