begin by discussing how to create a new
document in Photoshop and what we can do
with that document so we can start by
saying file new or take note of the
shortcuts and all of the menus items up
on top you'll notice that there are
shortcuts attached to those menu items
as you can see here at control and
command and or Apple n on mac and these
are very useful for you to start
memorizing and getting used to working
with especially for very common types of
commands like creating a new document or
saving a document control s among others
let's begin by creating a new document
and as we can see here you can name that
document whatever you like in this case
it's just got the default untitled one
we have presets available for us and as
you can see here there are a number of
different ones letter and legal sizes
and as you might as you can also notice
that these are reflected in dimensions
of inches and the resolution is in
pixels per inch a couple of things that
we have to address about that in
particular you'll notice that there are
also some sizes here which have very
common web dimensions as in web
resolution 640 by 480 being Louis
reverent web resolution and you can also
recognize that these numbers are dealt
with in pixels the main reason for that
is because whenever we're doing
something for the screen and what I mean
by that is the computer screen in
particular you should always be setting
your measurements in pixels and pixels
per inch in particular use the
resolution of 72 pixels per inch as
we're going to be discussing a lot of
what we're going to be doing is going to
be and oriented towards the web user and
if you were doing something for print as
we can see here in the standardized
legal or letter size you'll notice that
things are in inches very common for
print pixels per inch the resolution is
set to 300
and the reason being is because when
you're working with print you generally
want to have a higher resolution so that
it will print much more accurately on
the other hand when we're dealing with
the web as we can see here 800 x 600 the
resolution is always 72 the reason being
is because when you're dealing with
something on a computer screen 72 pixels
per inch is maximum resolution you can
get higher resolutions will produce much
heavier files there is no need to go
higher than 72 if you're presenting
something for the screen so keep that in
mind anytime you're working on a web
project set your dimensions to pixels
per inch and the resolution always to 72
anytime you're doing something for print
you can do a higher resolution and you
can have your dimensions in inches as
opposed to pixels another thing about
the difference between print and the web
is specifically related to color mode on
the web anytime we're working with a
projected screen like a computer screen
or any other type of projection like a
television or a film projection or
anything like that you should always
work with RGB color RGB stands for red
green and blue you'll notice however
that if we were to look at the print
sizes here and legal it doesn't show
much difference but if you were to work
with other sizes that are dealing with
specifically print versions you'd notice
that the color mode should be addressed
to CMYK color the main difference being
is that CMYK colors are the colors that
will use in print and we always use CMYK
in print the main difference here is a
simple fact that whatever you do see on
screen is always going to be RGB so in
other words if you are producing
something for print just keep in mind
that even if you set your color mode to
CMYK color what you're seeing on the
screen is still RGB so if you don't want
to have any unsightly as surprises when
you get your work back from the printer
be well aware that you should choose a
pen
in color book or some other sort of
swatch book that are available for you
to choose your colors directly from a
book reason being is because what you
see on the book on the printed page is
CMYK color you enter in that information
and whatever you see on the screen even
if it looks a little different should be
disregarded it's the CMYK color from the
book that you're looking for however as
I mentioned if you are dealing with the
web RGB color 72 resolution pixels per
inch and your dimensions and pixels are
what we need also as we can see here
background contents can be whatever you
want white background the background
color which is defaulted inside of the
toolbar or a transparent background well
why does the default and that's what
we're going to be using here and as you
can see you can also choose different
color profiles specifically related to
different situations like if you're
working with something on the screen
ntsc is the north american standard for
television among other things apple or
adobe RGB color match RGB cannons
whatever the case may be and whatever
you're looking for you can feel safe
working with the working RGB the
defaulted as you can see here the pixel
aspect ratio can be square which is the
vaulted and should be used unless you're
working with film and television or
other elements ntsc pal which is more
for the asian and european markets as
you can see here so square pixels are
perfectly fine for us and if you were to
say okay at this point it would produce
a blank screen for you you'll notice
that in your layers palette it says
background that means you will not be
able to move it around or do anything
with it as it says here because it's
locked a background layer is always
locked by default I'll be showing you
how you can change this a little bit
later on but for the moment that's a
little bit about building your basic
document inside of Photoshop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
