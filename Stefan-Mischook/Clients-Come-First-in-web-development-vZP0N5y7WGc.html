can do as a developer is to be
responsive to your clients yeah and it's
something you don't hear too often but
at the end of the day a big part of your
success will be determined by how much
and how well you listen to your clients
needs being responsive means answering
emails fairly quickly within a day or
not within an hour returning calls
making calls checking up on people to be
sure that everything is cool with them
this is very important because at the
end of the day especially if you are a
developer or in the technology business
likely are you're there to provide a
service or perhaps an app or technology
to facilitate your clients data day's
activities whether they be personal
activities or business activities we are
trying to automate to simplify to
streamline their day or night so keep
that in mind pay attention to your
clients needs in fact when I work with
my developers I say number one thing
when it comes in client question
response quieter questions quite client
bug reports client problems everything
else dropped below that we address
clients needs first number two bugs we
fix bugs number three we get into new
features well new features a number four
we always have this process you should
always be a process of refactoring a
stabilization of your codebase what I
mean by stabilization I mean refactoring
which I mean cleaning up making it more
solid more robust right you know it's a
constant process when you're managing a
nap it's a constant process of
refinement and so very oh that's the
order in which i would suggest you do
things but number one the big point to
take away as you should you should be as
responsive to the client as you possibly
can and if client problems come in
everything else drops because at the end
of the day it's your clients that are
going to pay for the future development
of your app or pay for your time going
forward on projects for them and so on
so that's it I hope you find this useful
