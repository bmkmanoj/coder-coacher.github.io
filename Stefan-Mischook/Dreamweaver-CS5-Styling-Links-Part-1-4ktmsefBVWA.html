the CSS box model and we've seen that we
can add margin as we saw on this side
and padding as we can see on this side
now what I want to talk to you about is
working with CSS links and how we can
make these links look a little bit more
attractive so first thing I'm going to
ask you to do is to come back to your
files menu you can select the word home
let's make it a link remember we saw how
to do this by clicking to point to file
and will point to the index page that's
the file that I want to link to the
about page will link to inside the web
folder just hold it there if it's closed
to the about file and the contact link
will link to the contact file so now
we've got these three links and you'll
notice that there underline their blue
and color and that's the default color
that we have available to us at this
particular point now you may also
remember if we preview this in the
browser these pages are actually linking
to hear the about page which is blank
now check out when I go back let's see
the differences in my color scheme well
when the link is not visited in other
words when I haven't been there yet it's
this bright blue by default and when I
have been there he said I just went to
the about page then it is this color by
default same thing right now I'm on the
home page so that page is loaded into my
cache memory in other words we visited
that page already same thing would
happen for external links for example if
I was linking to I don't know adobe com
and we had that link here well if I
hadn't been there previously then that
page or that link rather should be
displayed like this but if I had been
there in recent you know days or even in
the same day then it might show up as a
visited link now why is that important
because what we're going to be talking
about in CSS is creating or styling our
links
sometimes these things are called CSS
pseudo classes and I'll explain why in
just a second so as you can see we've
got some links in place they look like
standard default links by the way when
you're in your code views and your
design view as we can see here I can
select these links if you want to see
these links actually working in
Dreamweaver without going to the to
preview in your browser you can always
click on live view and look instead of
being able to select those links right
it gives me the finger Thank You link
very nice of you to do so so here it is
give me the finger unlike when I'm not
in Live View it's just the ibar allowing
me to select this area so that I can
style it all right so don't be in Live
View you can switch out of that and now
what we're going to do is to create our
first set of links and how we can work
with those is by going to our CSS
behavior now let's take a look here it's
not custom class that I want to deal
with it's not an ID or a tag even though
a tag would make sense because an link
is really just an a tag right so that
would make sense as you can see here in
my code a tag but it's not really what I
want to do so we're going to choose
compound based on your selection now my
selection happens to be right now inside
one of these paragraphs how do I know
that because wherever my cursor is based
on my selection it's saying one of two
things well on the body you are now
inside of a paragraph see down here you
can see the same information as well as
the selector well that's not what I want
what I want to be dealing with is this
particular set of links or pseudo
selectors here as you can see what we're
saying is here is the selector which is
my a my selector and then there's a
colon and it says link link is my pseudo
class and basically what that means as
you can see here what I'm doing with
this selector is saying I am targeting
what the a lynx look like what is an a
link in other words an unvisited link
one that we have
anh Tuyet and you may also notice that I
am specifically choosing to define a
link first we're going to have to define
all four of these but we're going to
define them in this particular order a
link first a visited means well if I
visited this link already this is what I
want it to look like hover means when I
put my mouse over it we want to hover
effect so we're going to change what the
effect looks like usually just a color
change and a active means the selected
link or in other words sometimes when
you click down on that link what does it
look like now I'm going to have to put
it in this order or else it won't work
hover has to come before a link and
visited an active has to come after the
hover all this has to be in this order
for them to be effective so keep it in
mind if you ever forget you can remember
some handy dandy mnemonics like LVH a
love hate or one of my favorites las
vegas has action so whatever else you
like to remember here I've got a link so
I'm going to click OK what do I want my
a link to look like well I'm going to
move it down a bit and let's see well I
could just define it with the same
information that these other ones are
defined with because it's in a paragraph
right now which wouldn't always be this
way but if I wanted to I could just
leave it with the default font however
i'm just going to reiterate what that
font size is and i'll say for danna 12
and that's cool and for color I'm going
to start with this blue color that we
have here so i'm going to i drop that
blue and you'll see bang right away
already looks like this well let's do
something else let's make it bold and
this way we can see that it's much
thicker let's also perhaps transform
them to be all uppercase letters huh my
links look decidedly different than they
did just a second ago perhaps even 12
points a little too big maybe I want it
to be 11 points now and you can see that
they look fairly similar to what's
happening there but i don't think i'll
go with 12
nice thing about applies that you can
check and see what you like now finally
text decoration I don't like the
underline so I can apply it and remove
that now it's pretty obvious up here
that these things are intended to be
links so the underline is not really a
big deal but if you have links that are
going to be in the body section of your
design probably more than likely a
better idea to choose that the unvisited
link the a link-state make sure that it
does have an underline because people
like to see that and it makes it easier
for them to know that this is a link
enticing you to come click on it right
so coaxing you to the shore like a siren
or a harpy nevertheless so here i have
my elements in place like this now you
know just to show you if i wanted to i
could have kept it underlined by default
and maybe on the hover state we could
remove those underlines it's completely
up to you but nevertheless I'm just
going to say none and we're going to
click OK well that's great but it's only
our first state we actually have to come
in and do the other ones as well now
you'll see a couple of things that may
in fact be relatively redundant when it
comes to what this looks like but we'll
put a couple of changes in here as well
so at this point I'm going to choose
from my compound based on my selection a
visited the second in the list so
visited means well what am i visited
links look like you know I could come in
here and I could save your data 12 and I
could also you know say bold and text
transformed to uppercase and give it the
same blue if I wanted it to but I could
also let me choose a different color for
example maybe we could choose a you know
brown or something that's inside of this
document here so you know I could come
in here and I could say well how about
this color can we apply that well if you
apply it nothing's going to happen it
doesn't show you the visited links
inside dreamweaver you're going to have
to actually have to check that out
through live view or previewing it in
your browser so nevertheless we've got
those elements in place but maybe I want
it to be more just to show you what it
looks like a line through when we have
visited that link like we've crossed it
off a list yeah whatever I'm not crazy
about it but I'll just put it in there
to show you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
