days since I did a vlog so this vlog is
about the long-term implications or
long-term strategy or what you'd expect
in maintaining an app you don't hear
about too much if they go on the vlogs
out there at least from what I've seen
and perhaps because a lot of developers
don't support a product long term so
I've done this a few times and there's
one thing when you create a product and
put it out there there's another thing
to keep the product alive I'm talking
about software I'm talking about apps
keeping it alive developing it refining
it based on user interaction I think
that's the key point to this when you
deploy your app for a first time your
version one if you will you have to
recognize that this is likely just the
beginning of the development cycle
you're gonna find that as users interact
with your app there's going to be a lot
of changes but I'm gonna have to be made
and so as developers you have to be
open-minded to the input that you get
from people actually using your app and
you'll see that if you are open minded
and not defensive about it and willing
to work with users you'll see that the
app will improve exceptionally over time
so case in point most recent case in
point for me is to do web and the first
prototype was built about seven years
ago six seven years ago over that period
of time since it was first deployed and
used by the first couple of schools many
many many updates and changes have been
made quite a bit in fact and it's quite
different from the original app in many
respects the core of it is the same we
got a lot of things right initially but
we've had to got to replace an update
and remove I know you could say maybe as
much as 40% of the app it depends how
you want to look at it it's gotten to
the point now where it's at studio up
3.1 is
to be released and as a result of what I
want to do where I want to take the app
going forward we're going to be well
it's already been started we're doing a
rewrite from scratch to be able to take
advantage of new technologies that are
coming out or have come out since the
inception of the first app so we're
doing a rewrite from scratch and that's
something you want to do very often but
after seven years I think it's time
right down to the database design now
don't get me wrong we're going to be
leveraging a huge part of what we have
in studio web 3 but the studio web 4
branch is a massive it's a it's a
rewrite from scratch so will there be
taking what we've learned in the last
seven years incorporating that into the
new architecture instead of web 4 and
well actually we're actually quite
excited to get going on that we are the
database initial database designs have
been made and we're gonna be continuing
from there over the next several months
I'm not sure I was thinking of doing an
ongoing vlog about that I don't know
we'll see how you know how things go
time permitting and so forth whether or
not I'm able to do that we shall see at
any rate that's about it for this vlog
we'll talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
