killer sighs calm in this video tutorial
i'm going to show you how to deal with a
problem that's common wordpress and
that's dealing with the situation where
you want to upload an image to your blog
but you get an error message so let me
give you an example so here is a blog
entry so i want to insert an image here
so i'm just going to go add image i want
to select files and i'll choose from my
little collection whatever i'll choose
the the lock everything else i go open
and you see we have a never failed to
upload due to an error and it tells you
it is its parent directory writable by
the server so basically what's happening
here is we're press is trying to upload
the image but it can upload the image
and it's guessing it's because of a
setting on your server essentially it's
looking to upload the image into the
WordPress content folder but it can't do
it so what we're gonna do is we're going
to show gonna show you how to go in
there update your server so that you can
indeed upload images so let's pop open
into cPanel now cPanel is very commonly
used in many hosting companies if you
don't have cPanel it's gonna be a pretty
similar operation so you should still
find value with this so see panels are
in common this is you provided this with
your hosting company and so once you log
in you're gonna see something like this
so what you want to do then is go to
file manager I'm just gonna ask you
please select the directory to open I
just go web route public underscore HTML
ww so I just go okay so we go to go
rather so we're in the web route here of
the site so what I want to do is and I
want to go into my wordpress directory
now because of the way we have it
up they go back to killer blogs you see
the URL we're presses the wordpress
installed we we have it on the root of
the site right at the base of a site you
may have your blog your WordPress or
Drupal Joomla because this this type of
procedure I imagine it'll work in most
programs as well you may have those
programs you may have the inside of a
subdirectory
like for instance I go to killer sites
we go over my blog you see I have a
wordpress install here inside of the
blog directory anyway with killer blogs
it's on the root so what I look for is I
want to look for the content folder you
see you got WP content WordPress -
content it would be a similar type of
folder if you were doing something with
Drupal or Joomla or so that we had the
same problem the error message display
would tell you which folds we want to go
onto so what you do is you select the
folder and it turns blue and then you
want to go up here and you want to go to
change permissions so I click on that
you knows the permissions now you
basically want to make that folder
writable so you'll click click so what
does that all mean make that folder
write a book well essentially what's
happening now is that WordPress is
trying to upload images into the
WordPress - Content folder if you recall
the previous message it pointed that out
so what we're telling the server now
here with this change permission say
listen let WordPress write to the folder
see when you're uploading images or
files to a folder you're writing to the
folder or nerves we'll call visit
directory anyhow so you just want to
make sure you make two permissions so
that it's writable seven seven seven and
you hit change permissions so now the
permissions have changed so let's see
what happens so we go to killer blogs
let's try to upload an image once again
so I'm going to select a file
I'll choose our lock again hit open and
there you go
we know that WordPress has successfully
uploaded the image because we see you
know
uploaded here we see it there so I can
change the title of the image to lock
image that's good for search engines and
we can change captioning all in the
description that's also good for search
engines so I'm just gonna insert this
say float to the right insert into post
and there it is right here so let's
preview this when I hit the preview
button here when we get this in into
view so you can see it a little bit more
clearly so I hit the preview button and
here is our little lock of course so
let's that's it so if you've been having
trouble uploading images onto your
WordPress blog and this will apply I
would imagine you have the same type of
problems whether it be with WordPress
Drupal or Joomla where the program is
trying to upload images to your server
and you're getting that permissions
issue as we saw earlier so what you have
to do is you have to go into your your
your file manager in the case of cPanel
is called a cPanel file manager on your
server and you change the permissions if
you don't know how to do that you can
call your hosting company and ask them a
question but I would imagine like 99% of
them provides some sort of visual
interface like this but allows you to go
in there and change all kinds of
settings about your server you know for
whatever sites you happen to be hosting
that's it
I hope you found this video
instructional I'm Stephanie's truck with
killer sites com killer blogs is one of
these cool domains that I have but I
haven't decided how to develop it yet
it's part of our network but anyway
that's another story
