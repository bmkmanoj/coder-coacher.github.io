in this quick little via blog I'm going
to talk about micro services what they
are and how to use them so in a nutshell
micro service has three characteristics
number one they are kind of like mini
apps they are many apps that stand alone
they're not part of a larger app so they
stand alone
Micro Service has a fine-grained
functionality so what does that mean
that means that it does one thing maybe
two but usually one so you might have a
micro service that will authenticate
users you might have a micro service
that will generate a graph or a chart
based on data that you send it it might
generate a composite PNG image based on
the text strings that you send it who
knows you get the idea they're very very
very specialized in what they do they're
very limited and the other thing about a
micro service is that they are language
agnostic language neutral meaning you
have a break a micro surface written in
Python Ruby PHP Java whatever and this
micro service can be used by any other
app and this app could be written in a
totally different language it doesn't
matter typically micro services share
their information through the web a
protocol that's the HTTP hypertext
Transfer Protocol and so you might see a
micro service will send its its
information back communicate with the
calling app using like a JSON objects as
an example so what don't mean like that
so let's say you got your main app here
let's say it's a laravel based MVC PHP
app or maybe it's a ruby on rails app
who knows it's a Java spring app so
anyway so you got your app and you have
particularly maybe you need to generate
a certain type of report so what you do
is you set up a micro service that all
it does is it logs into the database
grabs the data it needs processes it out
and sends back the report to the main
app so why would you use that's just an
example so why would you use a micro
services a micro service there's a few
reasons number one when you have a micro
service this is such a specialized app
that you could have a separate coding
team that would just work on that micro
Service and if you have another micro
service over here you could have another
coding team that works on that one so
it's easier to separate out the work
amongst your developers with micro
services rather than having them all
work on let's say a laravel based app
right in the core of the app or Ruby on
Rails core app and the advantages of
that is that you can separate out the
work and so you're gonna have team a on
this micro service team beyond that
micro Service and since they're working
apart there's less confusion less chance
that they step on each other's toes let
me tell you from my experience when you
have more than three developers on a
particular project working on the same
codebase your overhead increases quite a
bit because then you've got a you got a
broker all the communications between
all these three nerds and they're
talking to each other and then you get a
fourth nerd and fifth nerd and it's
gonna be problems I've been there myself
typically I find the sweet spots about
three nerds every nerd after three your
predict your productivity drops
considerably so the micro services model
where you have your little mini apps
that just do one thing helps in that
regard
another reason for micro services is to
be able to load balanced easily so let's
say you have an app where you got to
create these highly detailed reports
that does a lot of database work and it
takes up a lot of CPU power well what
you could do is you could create a micro
service that you can install on a whole
different server or you know another
process in the cloud and it could spin
off on its own do its thing without
disturbing the main app itself so this
is a good way to to balance the amount
of load that's going on with your
another advantage of the micro service
is it allows for it's it's one thing you
could do if it rather something we just
recently did you can use micro services
to fix problems that you may be having
with an older app a legacy app so let me
give you a story so we have an old quote
igniter app from far four five years ago
it's it's pretty old but it works it's
pretty much bug free but we had some
issues with performance in terms of
generating reports the object relational
mapping layer in coding later the arm
it's called an arm framework it's kind
of wimpy so for most activity was fine
but because of bad database structure
and all this kind of stuff
he was really slow generating certain
reports so what we did is we took a more
advanced or more modern arm and we put
it on another app and then we hit the
database process the data and you know
send back a much more refined result set
from the database back to the old app so
the old app instead of hitting the
database directly with just consume this
new small subset of data it's actually
just a JSON object basically the process
data was sent back to the old app and it
was able to speed up the display of the
of the reports by 20 times it's been
amazing so there you go so that's a way
you can use micro services now to last
point buy those services are getting
kind of popular these days and so some
people are trying to say wow why not
have the Oh whole app just be a bunch of
micro services so we have a micro
services or something acacia animaker
services sends an email maybe service it
logs this now that might work in some
situations but I'd be very reluctant to
do it all the time
my preference what I would suggest is
you have your main app so let's say
you're doing a web app so whether it be
laravel in PHP or spring in Java or Ruby
on Rails in
rales which you can use the
microservices to do is to provide an
extra functionality so you can say wow
okay you know what we want to do some
heavy-duty processing of reports once or
three days or something or whatever it
is so let's put that into micro service
you know or let's we need to generate
some dynamic PNG files on the fly PNG
images based on user input who knows but
that is a micro service so the micro
services support the main app but it's
not just a bunch of micro services
working together because a problem with
that that I see is that you're gonna
have you might have some issues in terms
of having all these micro services play
nicely together how they all flow
together whereas when you use a system
like lair eval a full-fledged project
full fledged MVC framework like laravel
a monolithic framework or a ruby or
spring they've sort of managed all that
where the various components the common
components in most web apps they they've
brokered they've managed the
integrations between the various layers
the arm you the views and so on so
there's an advantage to monolithic
frameworks but I would couple them I
would work with micro services on the
side now micro service is a new term for
something that people been doing for
years there's been other terms for them
and on the simpler in a simplest form
you can think of it like when you use a
server cron job where instead of
creating a timing mechanism in your own
app just use that the Linux or UNIX
server cron too far off some sort of
process some activity whenever you want
so it's it's kind of a micro service but
it's not it's a micro service in its
value and in the fact that it says it's
an app it's a thing that just does one
thing but it's part of the unix a part
of the Linux so sort of built into the
core of it as well so anyway so there
you go now you know what a micro service
is you know why people use them you know
their advantages and you know my opinion
about how they best should be used and
that is you should use it to support
you know more a monolithic gaps ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
