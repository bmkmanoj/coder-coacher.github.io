answer a question that was put to me on
YouTube with regards to a student soon
to be a professional developers career
path or at least his path to getting
into a career so his teacher told him
that he should learn oo P
object-oriented programming and the
basics of MVC before jumping into a
framework like lair values talking about
PHP but these lessons apply to any
programming language of course whether
it be Ruby Python Java etc etc now
learning a framework is a great thing
because besides the fact you're learning
a tool that you can use to be very
productive it also helps you to better
understand how to implement MVC as an
example MVC is a design patterns a way
of organizing apps it also shows you how
object-oriented programming is
implemented in a real world type of app
situation at least it shows you one way
now the good thing about frameworks like
laravel or Django or Java spring etc etc
Ruby rails is that you're seeing a
mature implementation meaning you're
seeing a mature way of doing it because
these frameworks have been around quite
a bit and they've been worked on by
hundreds of developers probably and
thousands of developers have worked with
them such that they're highly refined
they figured out what they did wrong
they took out what was wrong they put
what was what was good in there so it's
kind of cool that way but before really
you could fully understand any of these
frameworks you have to at least
understand the basics of object-oriented
programming that's that's a given
you have to understand the basic
concepts you should be comfortable with
creating objects using inheritance and
basically ready I'm not going to get
into here but basically writing
object-oriented code you should be
comfortable with at least the basic
concepts and in terms of MVC just
simple MVC bass tutorial where you run
through a project where you see it
implemented and once you've just you
know this is not a lot of work once
you've done that then you can jump into
whatever framework you want to jump into
for PHP I would recommend laravel for
Java spring for Python Django for most
people etc etc so you know Ruby rails
although I want to do that right now
JavaScript node yes oh yes that's my
suggestion so it's a bit of a judgment
call but just so much you're comfortable
with object-oriented programming you're
comfortable MVC then you'll be ready to
get into an MVC framework that's pretty
much my advice regards to that so you're
looking just like a few days of work
maybe a week of work and then you can
jump to an MVC framework I hope that
makes sense bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
