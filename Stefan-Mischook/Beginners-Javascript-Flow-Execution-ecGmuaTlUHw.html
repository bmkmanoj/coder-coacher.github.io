look at JavaScript flow and execution
this Wow anyway it's actually gonna be a
quick little video and let's all let's
just just jump into code right away and
you see what I mean
in all the examples that we've been
doing so far we've inserted our
JavaScript code in between the body and
body tags of our HTML and for the sake
of practice and so forth that's fine but
this can get a little bit messy
especially if we have lots of you know
our normal web pages with four of a code
in there our HTML so one thing you can
do is you can actually take your
JavaScript and you can stick it in the
head and that's usually where people
place the JavaScript code so let's just
run this to see how it looks and as we
can see everything works fine so that's
the first thing I want to point out in
terms of the actual execution of the
code just like it is with CSS and HTML
the web browser processes code from the
top down so whatever happens up here in
terms of reading the JavaScript code it
reads this first and then this line this
line so on that's why when we reassigned
the variable last name and we gave it
the value of first name plus the value
of number it over wrote this previous
value here why because this came after
this because the JavaScript engine read
this and read it and read this and I
said oh let's change the variable last
name to this so there's over wrote this
just keep that in mind when you're
working with JavaScript this may help
solve some bugs down the road
so far we've been including our
JavaScript straight in our HTML pages
whether it was in the body or in the
head section of our pages another thing
that we can do is actually include the
JavaScript in our pages via the
JavaScript link or include tags so let
me show you what that's all about and
you'll you'll see what I mean I'm just
going to delete this and we're just
going to modify this tag and here it is
is this source attribute so I'm just
gonna use the capabilities of the text
editor so now I've included into this
page JavaScript that's found in this
file here code AS so I'm gonna pop open
that file and as you can see here I have
the code from that I had initially in
our pages and I just included it here in
a separate file Coco dodge as JSR for
JavaScript of course you notice I have
no JavaScript opening and closing tags
as I have well let's open up this here
as I have here right in the J's file so
I just have a straight JavaScript that's
it
in here I have this link tag to the
JavaScript code this is much like CSS
and you can think of it the same way so
if I preview this in Firefox you see the
code still works no problem
let me just try it again here we go Nick
Jimmy fish and very go
you may have noticed in our examples as
the page loaded the JavaScript
automatically was fired also in this
case of this page here
our lured box automatically pops open as
the page loads so what we're gonna do in
the next videos we're gonna look at
something called a function that's gonna
teach you how to control when and how
your javascript is actually fired off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
