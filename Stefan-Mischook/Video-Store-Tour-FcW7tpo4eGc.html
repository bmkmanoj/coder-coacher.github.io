sites calm and the killer video store
calm in this video I want to give you
just a quick walk through the store so
you understand the different options
that we have and stand the different
packages that we have different video
courses we offer and finally how to get
them these are some common questions
that are going to cover and just to make
the process easier for you so you can
make a more informed decision if this
video doesn't cover some questions you
have feel free to email me at Stefan at
killer sites calm and i'll be sure to
get back to you as soon as I can or just
go to contact page here and you can see
that our contact information so if
there's ever any problems with the
videos or something or having problems
with a credit card processing processing
or whatever you're not alone we're here
we have phone numbers and emails and so
on so it's you won't be left high and
dry no matter what okay let's start off
the first page of here is the video
packages page maybe of these tutorials
etc so let's go to the video packages
again the video packages are basically
are their packages their collections of
video courses in one package and you see
for instance a complete web designer
package we have 29 hours of videos it's
actually comprised of several individual
video courses so if we scroll down you
see we've got our sample videos here you
just click on these links and it will
launch a video for you so I can just do
a quick one you see just press play and
the video will start playing and you can
see what's going on um you can see what
you're getting before you actually buy
you see here this is a list of some of
the courses the individual courses that
are contained within this package so if
we click through it takes us to the web
design one course this is the ultimate
beginners course in web design so this
course itself runs about three to four
hours
and it's contained within that package
so we go back to video packages complete
web designer you see we have web design
one right here so the point of the
packages is twofold number one they're a
great deal because for instance the
complete website arm has I would roughly
say about 160 or so dollars worth of
videos and it's only going forward $99
the other advantage of these packages
whether it be a complete web designer or
complete web programmer and so on is
that they provide extra material that
you don't find elsewhere and the extra
material sometimes some special videos
some special PDFs text documents that
provide supplemental information for you
so for instance with the complete web
designer package you actually find a guy
that teaches you and guide you step by
step in terms of a very skill set you
need to learn to become a complete web
designer or in other words a
professional web designer the point of
this package is about is that by the end
of completing the entire course contents
that the hundreds of the 200 videos or
so you'll have enough skills to be able
to commercially provide web design
services same thing with regards to a
complete web programmer of course this
is assumes that you have some basic web
design knowledge and this gives you all
clients of web programming skills again
so you can provide web programming
services to people so it's a massage so
besides the packages being great deals
if you can think of them as discounts to
begin with they're also they also
provide extra information for you to
guide you through the process
step-by-step of becoming complete web
designer or a complete web programmer
etc let's go over a couple other
packages here now web design for small
business
is a package specifically put together
for small business owners who want to
learn how to build and manage a website
it's very similar to the complete web
designer package except it has several
the same videos courses included but it
actually it also includes a few hours
two and a half hours or so of audio only
podcast that talk about some big picture
issues that web design website owners
have to really consider this is unique
stuff that you won't see anywhere else
and here's a list right here we had I
call it the small business podcast and
you learn you know from 20,000 feet
things like you know winter blog let's
see if s in forums domain names
e-commerce setups templates the web
design workflow such etc again this
course does have a lot of content that
you see in the complete web designer
package but it has it's more or less
structured for small business owners or
people who are looking to actually build
a website for themselves and manage the
website let's continue down the path now
you see the complete PHP programmer and
it looks very similar to the complete
web programmer and the basic difference
is is the complete web programmer is
really designed for people who want to
get a well-rounded web programming
capability whereas a complete PHP
programmer really concentrates on more
hard core PHP programming if you have
any more specific questions about this
feel free to email me or contact one of
us and we'll be more than happy to help
you there complete Photoshop for web
designers is really designed for people
prep with a graphic design background
and I want to understand how they can
use photoshop for of a web so it it
doesn't necessarily web designer but it
teaches you how to create images use
Photoshop to create images that are
ready for of a web
and for screen graphics what's
interesting about the complete Photoshop
for web designers course is that though
we're teaching you web image preparation
using Photoshop and we use Photoshop
because it's the most popular image
editing program out there but the fact
of the matter is that just about every
image editing program it works pretty
much on the same principles have the
same button names you may see buttons
placed here or there but overall if you
know Photoshop you know how to use any
web any image editing program pretty
easily especially comes to a creation of
images for websites so if you're worried
about having to fork out the big money
for photoshop you don't have to worry
about it because just download the free
30-day trial learn the stuff there and
we can provide a list of alternative
programs are far less expensive or are
free although you know there's no if you
know there's no problem there's nothing
wrong with photoshop it said it's a
great piece of software it's just for
some people maybe a little bit too
expensive so I leave that up to you so
if you decide you want to buy a package
you can buy either the DVD version or
the download version the difference
between the download version of DVD
version in terms of videos and the
course content if themselves is they're
exactly the same the only difference is
if you buy the DVD version we ship you
with DVD if you do get the DVD version
if you do get the DVD version you also
get the download version as well so you
get both at the same time so if you buy
the DVD you had a to your card you buy
it you get instant access to the
downloads as well while you wait for the
4v DVD so if we click Add to Cart see
here's our cart page we allow payment
through paypal and through credit card
if you like you can also use paypal to
pay with credit card you
necessarily have to have a paypal
account some people may prefer that
because paypal is that such a
well-established company it's owned by
ebay so you know if you're worried about
your credit card being used on the web
you don't have to be but if you do for
whatever reasons you can use paypal and
you just have to go here don't don't
have a paypal account pay with your
debit or credit card so just click
through and paypal's a little bit slow
but it will allow you to use your credit
card without join paypal so you can
safely pay for your videos you'll notice
that on the cart page we have the
contact information here for you and we
also have to contact information here
for you and you can get to the contact
page through the footers we just really
make it as easy as possible for you to
get a hold of us just in case you're
having any difficulty when you're come
around to down load the videos you'll
notice what we have a video here how to
download the video course you just click
it and it will launch press play and
you'll be able to watch the whole
process of downloading a video again our
goal is to make it as easy as possible
for you to purchase a video may like one
last point I should point out that all
our videos are pc and mac compatible
some are recorded on pc some record on
Mac doesn't matter everything that we do
works a hundred percent on either
platform so don't have to worry about
that sometimes people miss this but we
do provide tons of sample videos so if
you go to video tutorials will click
Dreamweaver and will or dreamweaver cs
cs5 part once you click through and
again we got me know in this particular
video we had five samples about launch
here if we go to I don't know PHP
beginners PHP you see we have another
five video sound
here launch it up where you go so we
make it really seamless for you so that
you can see what you're getting before
you put down any money and actually you
can learn a lot by watching the free
sample videos you know here's another
bunch of sample video so it's like 10
minutes 20 minutes 26 minutes 30 about
35 minutes or so of free video training
for you so yeah we want you to be
confident in what you're getting and
again if you have any questions you know
how to reach me at contact to us it's
defined at kill sites or videos at
killer sites calm and we'll be more than
happy to answer any questions you may
have and again there are real people
here you can contact us from ten a.m. to
five PM typically New York time although
to be honest we we do get back to emails
more frequently because if there's
nobody around or a small company we get
emails remotely we're on the road or
something so there you go thanks for
watching and we shall talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
