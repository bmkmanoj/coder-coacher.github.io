doing in our tutorials is starting to
look at vector based shapes inside a
Photoshop
that's right vector based shapes inside
of Photoshop that's correct not just
available in Illustrator and in fact
since cs2 you were able to work with
vector based shapes in Photoshop
here we are with shapes in cs3 and
everything that we're going to be seeing
here is applicable to cs2 as well so in
order to access your vector based shapes
you can do so right here with this tool
first of all you'll see it called the
rectangle tool and what I'd like to do
at this point is just have you recognize
that everything that belongs inside of
this little square notice how it's been
delineated from the other ones and that
is because all of these sets of tools
are used specifically for vectors and
vector based shapes that's right so the
type tool being vector based shapes of
course it is that's why you have to
rasterize type before you can actually
do anything with filters or any other
sort of effects so you might be asking
what is a vector and why is it different
from the regular tools inside of
Photoshop well let me do something to
explain that in this first little
exercise here and what I'd have you do
is to recognize that number one first
and foremost Photoshop is a bitmap
editing software and it has been
traditionally for many years but since
cs2 some vector based tools were
introduced main difference being is when
you look at a photograph you're going to
be seeing that photograph if you zoom in
on it being composed of a bunch of
little pixels in fact traditionally what
you would do inside of Photoshop in the
past to create a circle as you can see
here I'm just gonna hold shift and make
a perfect selection
it's little selection like this and if I
were to just drop in some of my tools
here's the paint bucket tool so inside
that control D to deselect notice it
looks a little chunky and that's because
I'm not at a hundred percent so I'm
going to use the shortcut ctrl option or
and zero and that off not only just fits
it into the screen but it actually more
appropriately sets it to the optimum
size of 100% anyways as you can see here
this looks great
there's nothing wrong with that it's
perfectly round and it looks wonderful
notice also that I tried to move it but
I had accidentally drawn it on the
background layer so I can't move any of
that because it's locked
yet another disadvantage to doing it in
that fashion let me just run through
that again I'll just go through my undo
steps and for those of you who don't
remember our previous tutorial that is
ctrl alt Z or Apple alt Z on a macintosh
and in the past what you would more
appropriately do is to create a new
layer and then take your selection
holding shift and make it perfectly
round and fill it with a color ctrl D
command D to deselect and now I've got
an object that I can move around ok well
that's perfectly fine there's nothing
wrong with that however look what
happens if I try to increase the size of
this pixel based or raster based shape
ctrl T brings up my free transform tool
and if I make this bigger actually hold
on a second just by holding shift right
you'll notice that as I do the edges get
all blurred and they don't look very
good notice I'll undo that again and
I'll show it to you that got a little
skewed the first time so let me do that
again for you and notice I'm holding
shift to keep this constrained so as I
increase that in size notice how that
looks not really all that great it's all
blurred and that's pixelated and it
doesn't look great so that's a distinct
disadvantage to working with something
when it's a pixel-based shaped whether
it's a photograph or whether it's
selection that's been increased so now
at this point I'll demonstrate that if
we were going to do the same thing with
a vector shape tool and notice what I'm
doing here and just drawing this shape
out
anymore on this in the next tutorial
this is just a brief understanding
you'll see that it's got this ugly sort
of circle effect on it right now but as
soon as we take the move tool and select
a background you'll notice that that's
super crisp and really really looking
good let me show you what happens when
we blow this up as big or perhaps even
bigger than my previous shape you'll
notice that despite being a huge size as
we can see here notice the difference
between the vector-based shape and
notice the difference between this shape
as well it's decidedly different
the vector-based shape because it's
mathematically created and calculated it
maintains its shape and it maintains the
consistency of that shape and it doesn't
get all distorted when you increase it
in size here's something else now if you
remember I just went back a few steps
ctrl alt Z or command alt is that on the
Mac and as you can see here this is my
bitmap object same as it was before
look what happens if I wanted to change
the color of this object if I was to
come in here and say hey now all of a
sudden I want it to be green come in
here and I do this even without
increasing this in size I don't know if
you can see it it's rather small right
now but you'll notice that it did get
chunky doesn't look very good at all on
the other hand notice this if I were to
start with a vector base shape and you
see here it looks good it's green but
that's because we started it as green
now to change this shapes color take a
look at this this little box here on the
shape layer allows you to double click
it and choose a completely different
color beautiful it looks very sharp it's
crisp not no none of the problems that
we have when we try to drop in some
color on something that's a bitmap image
so that looks really great the
anti-alias is crisp it looks wonderful
so therein lies a little bit between the
differences of the two
and we'll talk more about this in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
