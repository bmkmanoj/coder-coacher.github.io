in this course so far and I hope that
you've done the previous videos because
in this video tutorial we're going to
learn how to create css-based page
layouts
so I'm assuming that you've done the
previous videos of course so you
understand the basics of CSS and you
understand how we can use Dreamweaver to
apply CSS to our pages now though we're
going to move beyond the simple work
that we were doing before and we're
going to look at the techniques and
strategies used to actually lay out
entire pages with CSS basically we want
to look at how we can get this kind of
structure or maybe this kind of
structure and we're going to look at how
Dreamweaver will make this easy to do
before we get into it I wanted to
discuss a couple points first of all why
use CSS for page layouts so you might be
asking yourself well okay was it another
way and the answer yes there was another
way to lay out your pages and in your
days we used to use something called
tables if you look up here we got table
now this is a whole different structure
in terms of laying out pages and in fact
it's sort of the old way of doing it
well it is the old way of doing it and
it's now the way that you shouldn't do
it I actually cover tables in another
video just look in the miscellaneous
folder it comes in this course and
you'll learn how to use tables properly
and what they're useful were there for
now what you should take away is that
when you're laying out your pages you
want to use CSS to do this and you're a
couple reasons number one when you lay
out your pages using CSS the pages will
more easily work in many different
devices many different types of browsers
so we're talking not just web browsers
on your computer's we're talking iPhones
we're talking cell phones and other
types of PDA is BlackBerry's etc and
also when you do out your pages with CSS
it's really easy to make the pages
printable
the second reason why you want to go
with CSS to lay out your pages is
because css-based layouts are much
easier to update and to maintain it will
save you a lot of time that said CSS is
not perfect there are couple problems
when it comes to CSS and page layout
well major problem is this is that
needle the structure of CSS when it
comes to page layout not when it comes
to the design stuff that we looked at
before but when it comes to certain
types of page layout CSS is not very
well designed in terms of a technology
it's I can tell you this compared to
other languages I've used over the years
it's really lacking and it's just in
many cases it's not logical fortunately
for us over the years a bunch of web
designers have figured out how to work
around limitations of CSS and now we
have a bunch of recipes if you will that
allows us to have pretty much any type
of layout that we want done with CSS and
fortunately for us Dreamweaver comes
with all these things built in for us
all these CSS templates that I highly
recommend that you use it's kind of
crazy for the most part to build a CSS
based site from scratch you should
always start with a template because it
will just save you a lot of headaches
and a lot of problems
another reason why you want to use they
built in Dreamweaver templates is
because a lot of the techniques that are
used currently but have to be used
currently to lay out your pages with CSS
our techniques that will eventually fade
and the reason I say that is because
first of all they're nonsensical
techniques and that they don't make any
logical sense a lot of the times so it's
it's really you couldn't figure it out
like you could with so many other think
it's not mathematical it's you know it's
it's anyway it's confusing and
eventually these techniques will fade
why because the people in charge of CSS
that CSS nerds they realize this too and
in the new versions of CSS they come out
with new technology or new techniques
that are logical that make laying out
pages a snap at CSS the problem is now
in 2008-2009 most browsers that are
being used out there don't support the
new versions of CSS so you can't use the
new the new version of CSS you just
can't use this so you have to use the
old version again fortunately for us
dreamweaver comes with the templates so
you don't really have to fudge around
like i have and so many other web
designers over the years try to figure
out how to get the particular page
structure that you're working on so what
am i talking about I'm talking about
page structure well here you have a more
of an old-school look you got two left
the line site right left on the left
sides of line you know on the left side
and here we have another type of layout
where we have a center line right in the
center of the page so these are two
different layout structures and these
are both done with CSS and this one here
you left a lie is actually pretty easy
to do but this one here can be a lot
trickier anyhow we'll get into some of
these details as we go through the
course
what I'm going to do in this course is
concentrate on teaching you Dreamweaver
and how to use Dreamweaver to create
your page structures and CSS I'm not
going to get into micro nerd details in
terms of what's going on behind the
scenes in terms of the code and the
logic behind well I use logic and quilts
here but what I will do I will teach you
some of the basics in terms of what
people are doing and what you have to do
to get a basic structure some of the
basic structures rather in CSS and
talking page structures and the reason
I'm going to teach you some of the
basics is so that when you actually do
use the page templates you'll be able to
much more easily tweak them and modify
them to suit whatever whatever the needs
are for your particular website
I hope I didn't bore you with this eight
minute monologue this is a the nerdiest
part of course I promise I promise in
part 2 we're going to actually get into
building some CSS base layouts from
scratch so you get an idea what's going
on and then we're going to move on to
using some of the templates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
