sighs calm Killa PHP in this quick
little video blog I want to talk about
the move it seems from the cold igniter
camp into laravel I've gotten this from
a few PHP programmers and they tell me
that's pretty much the mood on the PHP
nerd street so what are my comments
about that I think what it is is that
the codeigniter development crew or the
people in charge of CO tonight are
they're leaning towards backward
compatibility and they're supporting
older versions of PHP and I guess
they're pretty dogmatic about that I
haven't looked at it too closely I can
just tell you from people who work with
me closely here they tell me that
laravel is far more productive and
CodeIgniter in terms of the number of
lines of code that you need to use to
get the job done they're saying that
they could do jobs of marital with 4050
percent less code than if they did the
same job in code ignitor again I haven't
looked at this myself although there is
a history going back several years where
I didn't like certain things in how they
were implementing encoding ignitor
you can google that up if you wanted to
so beyond that what was interesting
about the laravel framework is that from
what I gained from what I understand
from people that I trust they're taking
laravel utilizes libraries from other
code from other projects and it
integrates them trying to pick the best
of the best and apparently it's working
pretty pretty good in that regard we had
recently well recently and last year two
had developed a couple projects using
CodeIgniter internally because the
at the time preferred that framework so
I let it go and what we found we found
some core problems with the framework
the sessions library did not properly
support ie so we had to use a
third-party library and this has been
going on for a while of course we
haven't looked at the latest
developments encoded neither but it's to
me it's a sin when a core library like
session is not functional in a framework
especially for an extended period of
time makes no sense so what to take away
from this quick little V block take a
look around if if you're a coding that a
guy and you're not sure what whether or
not you should look at laravel you may
want to take a look at it because from
what we see in here and from our own
experience there's some great advantage
there's some great advantage to using
the laravel framework and that's about
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
