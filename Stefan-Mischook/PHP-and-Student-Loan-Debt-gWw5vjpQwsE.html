my previous vblog with regards to
certification web design web programming
and getting degrees how that affects
jobs etc you can look at a previous
vball this video what i want to talk
about very briefly very briefly you say
before you get into a student loan debt
for a web programming or web design
degree think long and hard about that
because i'm going to i'm going to keep
emphasizing this because people don't
know and it really bothers me but they
don't when you get a student loan debt
this is dead that you cannot get rid of
through bankruptcy so remember if you
lock yourself into ten throughout 10,000
20,000 30,000 or whatever in debt for
student loans remember that this debt is
shackled to you for life for life you
cannot get rid of the debt you cannot go
bankrupt you know if you start a
business and you fail you ran up all
this debt with the business you can just
go into bankruptcy done which is a good
thing because otherwise if if people
were afraid to go to debtors prison as
they did in the past that nobody would
be willing to start businesses or very
few because it's just too dangerous
right and North America has shown us has
shown and Canada shown that if you if
you have a loud bankruptcies it really
helps the economy in the end and overall
but anyway when it comes to student
loans you cannot get rid of them through
bankruptcy so be very very very very
very very careful about getting into
student loan debt to get a degree so I
would argue especially given the
circumstances we are the job situation
where r we're in now in norfolk in the
world really in the western world and i
think we're going to be going back into
an economic
downturn once again I'm recording this
in fall of 2011 and that's pretty much I
think what's going to be happening so
you have to be very careful about that
because you don't want to go to school
rack up ten 20 grand in debt and then
find you can't get work but now you got
this debt over your head which can get
rid of her life you know then you become
a debt slave and it's not an
exaggeration so and people aren't real
you know x student students are in a
really bad situation as a result of this
so if you can't afford to go to get a
comp sci degree or five hours of the
Greve you know university degree related
to web designer web programming that's
relevant as they discuss in the previous
video and you're looking to get a job in
the field remember i would say listen if
you don't have the cash and you're not
certain about any work you don't have
the cash then do online courses yes I'm
talking my book here I and I know that
you know but under nonetheless this is
you know I do what I do because I think
it makes sense so anyway if you don't
have the cash get learn this stuff on
your own rather don't go into debt
because remember eighty percent of jobs
are derived from small businesses and
small businesses in generally speaking
couldn't give a rat's ass whether or not
you have a degree they all want us they
just want to see skill what I hire
people I don't care about the grease it
sometimes say look I got a degree a guy
or whatever okay I okay whatever because
I know how that is you know I went to
university I know how that is so yeah so
if you have no money your figure going
to debt they get a degree don't do it
Rick if I was if I was your counselor
safe talk to a dude oh do it learn on
your own get no debt you know get no dad
know that you can learn on your own for
for very very little money
and you you can you can put together the
skill sets and then you're going to be
able to apply to eighty percent of the
potential jobs up there I'm not even
talking about freelancing either so I
think note that access to eighty percent
of the jobs is very very good ratio a
very good equation here rather whereas
going into debt to maybe get that that
job position at twenty percent were a
big business or government that's just
dumb you know especially consider this
federal state provincial in Canada all
these government cities they're going to
be cutting employees they're cutting
employees now to cutting workers now for
first time in 30 years and they're going
to keep cutting for next several years
at least so if you think getting a job
working for government is going to be
you know the greatest thing ever working
for big business think twice also
remember that big companies typically
they're not gonna be less likely to hire
PHP geyser to me looking for dotnet guys
are looking for Java guys and remember
big businesses are the businesses that
outsource right whether you're in US and
the outsourced to India are women are
the Indian companies are probably start
outsourcing to Bangladesh or some other
cheaper nations like I hear much I'd
apparently starting to outsource to the
Philippines or Malaysia or something if
you can imagine that I don't know that
the details about that I forget now I
don't study that particularly too
closely but anyway you get the idea so
remember and today especially in today's
environment we're big companies big
businesses government are contracting
why would you go into debt and put
yourself into debt slavery for that
twenty percent that's contracting four
or five if I were you it was me getting
into this I'd say no no no no no I'm
going to go do something I'll have no
debt no monkey on my back and
going to go after that eighty percent of
the market the small business market and
go out there yeah that makes sense to me
anyway i hope this is useful a little
bit of a rant i suppose and you know i'm
speaking to you not from a theoretical
perspective here you know I've been
entrepreneur for 20 years I 18 20 years
yeah 18 20 years and I've been in
different types of businesses
import/export by the factory web
services web education now online
offline so I got a pretty good
perspective in that regard as far as the
business owners as far as the CEOs
concern and I forget my second point so
i guess i'll let you go anyway hope was
that i hope this was useful bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
