to talk about being too much of a
perfectionist so we all have our
failings and one of my problems that I
have a bit of an obsessive-compulsive
behavior a lot of total you have a DD
but I do have a tinge of that and that's
probably why I was able to write code
because you have to be very precise when
you are writing code as you know but
here's the thing here's the point of
this law when you're writing an app
building a website building any type of
product launching a new business there's
a time when your effort in development
of your product business website cetera
when it has to be good enough and you
have to launch that's been my problems
those very young 18 or 19 when I had my
first business which was import-export
and we had a product line I was the guy
doing the artwork for the labels of the
packaging and my nature is to to be a
perfectionist now
sounds great to be a problem perfection
sheer perfectionist
the problem is perfectionism can get you
into a state where you're just
continuously working on your product or
service waiver and you never take it to
market and this is something I have to
work on all the time for example with my
recent Python course I spent months on
it not full-time but months on it
because or things I was tweaking and
polishing and I was adding more sections
so you know I wanted to put a little bit
more on this a little bit more
that etc eccentric setup sorry but at
some point you have to save yourself is
this course accomplishing the goal is
this website accomplishing a goal is
this product that you're launching able
to accomplish what you want to
accomplish with that product right so
federal you get the idea so you have to
let things go because when you start
getting into anything you could be you
could be updating you could be refining
perpetuating forever there is always
room for improvement that is for sure
but at some point you have to get your
product your service your idea your
website whatever you have to get it into
the marketplace because the ultimate
testing ground is the marketplace so you
may work on this product as it is the
most amazing product ever and you're
going to tweak and you're going to tweak
any of them you're going to polish let's
say it's a website you're working on
this website it's a website that's
selling a particular item and you're
working on it now if I just change the
colors they just line this up with Boom
Boom Boom
at the text change the text I just keep
affecting I know once it's perfect it's
got a large it's going to be amazing and
you working your work your work and you
delay launch by first few weeks and a
month it's two months and there's three
months whenever you're not launching
eventually your launch and then you
realize what the public's not
appreciating my perfection here and then
you're saying oh boy would I have to do
now and it goes on and on you see to
really refine a product you have to do
what I did with sticky web you have to
get it into the hands of the users the
end users as quickly as possible that is
the key and let your users dictate how
the product should be built feedback
from the users and that's what I did
with steady web going back seven years
it was about seven years ago we built
the prototype and over the years
feedback from our teachers
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
students we're able to keep refining
keep refining keep refining
incrementally so study web today is far
different than what it was when the
prototype was first built and it's far
better but if I would have spent too
much time trying to perfect it before
getting it getting it into the hands of
the end-users it would been a huge waste
of time so that's my advice just using
good enough principle get your product
out out as quickly as possible whether
it be a website a web app an app what
have you any type of business product so
here's an example by the way I'm going
to close this video of how I'm going to
be transitioning from pure code because
my coding courses weathered my Python
course my may interact web developer
course where at each stage of my age of
five css3 a responsive design of
expedience user these things cover
basically everything that you need to
know about software development
programming and development I don't need
to produce other courses because once
you have those fundamentals you're ready
to go it's a room for improvement of
course I could look at anything I could
take the most refined Porsche 911 Targa
has been basically they have the same
basic structure and body for 50 60 years
and you can still tweak it you can still
tweak it you know and it's going to be
very minor improvements probably not
probably just going to be having a
baseline improvements that would be too
significant anyway what else inattention
see this last sentence could have been
improved anyhow I hope you get the idea
behind this you want to get your product
out you want to get your website out as
quickly as possible get feedback don't
get caught up in the perfection trap
because you'll never get anything done
