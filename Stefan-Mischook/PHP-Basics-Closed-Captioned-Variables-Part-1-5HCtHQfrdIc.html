variables variables are one of the
fundamentals of programming and it's
very important that you understand this
because it will have a great impact in
terms of your ability to code down the
road
one of the benefits of understanding of
basic like variables is that once you
understand PHP variables you pretty much
understand what variables are in every
programming language that's really used
today in our exploration of variables
we're going to cover them while we're
going to cover three major parts a what
exactly are variables how to create
variables and why where we have
variables in the first place
let's start off by actually creating a
PHP variable and then from there we'll
get into some of the details
so I popped open windows notepad and our
basic HTML template page here and here's
our PHP tags so let's create a variable
PHP variables always start with the
dollar symbol when the PHP engine seized
a dollar symbol it knows that we're it's
about to look at a variable here let's
give the variable name and what's a will
call it name variables always start with
a dollar symbol there has to be no space
between the dollar symbol and text and
the text itself can be uppercase or
lowercase this is fine this is fine
doesn't matter and you can start with an
underscore they cannot start with a
number or any special symbols like
anything like this so I would suggest
that you create all your variables with
the dot well obviously start with the
dollar symbol and keep it lower case and
there's a reason for this later on when
we look at other aspects of PHP
as we learned before whenever you write
a line of PHP code you have to end it
with a semicolon so I'll say that that's
it we've created our first variable so
the next step is to look at specifically
what's happening and what are we doing
when we're creating a variable
in a nutshell a variable is essentially
a container in memory think about your
computer memory that contains
information sometimes it can be text
information sometimes could be numbers
and sometimes will be other things which
we'll get into later on so right now
when you create a variable like this or
just go dollar sign and I give the
variable name I basically reserved a
spot in memory an actual physical spot
in your physical memory it well this
case because this is server-side
language is actually in the server's
memory but I've actually haven't filled
this container with any information so
let's fill it with some formation and
you do that by using equal signs so
going to go name equals double quotes
Stefan now we've used double quotes
because this is a text string member of
string of texts just one piece of text
followed by another so now we've created
a variable and we've given it the value
of Stefan when Stefan happens to be a
texturing we know that because get the
double quotes right
this equal sign here nerds call this the
assignment operator because it assigns
the value of Stefan to the variable
called name it's called an assignment
operator because it's you can think of
it in terms of an operation it operates
on so it's the best analogy I can come
up with anyhow so this is the assignment
operator and it assigns the value of
stuff on the variable called name what
the variable name is really is just a
reserved spot in the server's memory
think about your RAM memory you can have
you know 500 Meg's around 1 Giga ram so
this is actually putting the value of
Stefan into a spot in memory and we've
named that spot or memory we called it
name so this begs the question why would
you want to do this
but the reason that you create variables
and we know about creating burials
variables just basically putting
information inside of a container and
giving it a name the name being the name
of the variable the reason that we do
this is so that we can use this
information in this case it's the stuff
on later on in our scripts think of it
as a bag you know you're sticking some
you know so I'm going to some stuff in a
bag in this case it's the name stuff on
and so then we can use that bag and we
can carry around this information using
different part in our scripts to do all
kinds of interesting things this will
all become very clear later the main
points you want to get out of this is
that a variable is basically a container
for information this is the information
you assign information to a variable
using the assignment operator which is
the equal sign and you know that in a
variable name excuse me a variable it's
just a reserved spot and your servers
memory now I'm talking about ram memory
so now that we got this basic Theory
covered what's actually put this to some
use so I'm going to just copy this and
we've looked at the print function
before so I'm just going to go print
name and it with a semicolon of course
because we all always have to end that
I'm going to save that and now i'm going
to view this in the web browser and
we're going to see what it looks like
I've popped open Firefox i'm at the page
and we see the text stefan review the
source as simple as what gets it just
prints out the text of fact so we've
seen how we declared a variable here
when you create a variable it's called
declaring a variable that's what nerds
will say we assigned it a value Stefan
and now we've used that variable in a
PHP statement and said print the
variable name PHP is smart enough to
know that the variable name contains the
sticks but text Stefan so it just prints
it out for us to give you an idea of the
power variables take a look at this copy
paste this bring that here and i'll
insert the old horizontal rule which
nobody uses anymore all right so you see
a nurse in our code here our first PHP
block some basic HTML and our second
date our second PHP block you notice
here we've declared a variable our name
variable here and we haven't used it
here and down the road we basically now
asking PHP to use the name variable and
to print out its value on the screen so
just save pop open the browser there you
go so we got our horizontal rule our
names to fan here
so this is a very very basic example but
you can see how we basically stuck the
value of stuff on inside of a container
and we've used it later on or script
here this is a this is very basic and
you're going to see how variable to come
very very useful as we move along deeper
into PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
