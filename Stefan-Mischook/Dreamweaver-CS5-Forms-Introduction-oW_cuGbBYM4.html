we're going to be talking about form
elements and working with forms is
probably a very important element for
anybody in web development because as
you probably well know having filled out
many a form yourself online they are an
integral part of most modern web sites
so in order to take a better look at how
Dreamweaver handles forms and ultimately
how we can also style some of these
forms what I want you to do is to first
and foremost define a site going towards
the practice files that are on your
desktop so if you've been following
along with us and you have the files
that you've downloaded from killer sites
com we can go to site new site and will
define a new site let's call it stitch
in time and stitch in time as you'll see
is the name of the website that we're
going to be using so if you go to your
website your desktop rather and you go
to your practice folder go to chapter 5
where you'll see a stitch in time and
stitch in time complete if you want to
take a look at the complete version you
can open it up just by going through
here but we're going to use the stitch
in time basic one because it doesn't
have the form elements in place and
we're going to put them together
ourselves so I'll save this and as you
can see we now happen to have a little
bit of information inside here let's
take a look if you double-click the
index page basically and we could even
you know check it out in live code or
excuse me rather live view if you wish
and you can see how those things will
react and it's just basically the three
column layout that we had before except
I've included this small little element
in the head section so you can check
that out you can preview it in your
browser's you can take a look at how
these things look and as you can see
that's kind of what I've got going on
here it's very simple design all I've
done is replaced what was in the head
section with this image and you know
styled some color and some texts and
stuff like that so rather than having to
repeat that you can feel free to build
that on your
own if you wish I've provided you with
that image and it'd be good practice for
you but nevertheless what we want to
concentrate on are the files inside the
web folder now if you'll notice the
about page is blank and so is the
portfolio page if you want to create
your for page website remember what I
was doing in the previous example was
you know we made our links and then we
just said save as and for example if we
were to look at the contact page this
page has already been saved as and what
I've done is I've just included
everything in here except the fact that
your contact us is the only thing that's
left it's your headline and as you can
see if we split this view into something
that we can see a little bit better in
our code view you'll find that you know
this area here has the information we
could even remove that paragraph we
don't need that as well so what we're
going to do is to implement on this page
a form element so let's come back in the
next video and we'll do that together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
