done is I've just taken the opportunity
to login and as you can see here if you
have an Adobe ID you can do the same
thing and you can feel free to peruse
through any number of different swatches
the one that I'm using here for our
little design is one called wave by
lucia von z no and a bow zeno and as you
can see what you can do with these
things sort of opens up after you have
in fact signed in so not only could you
go about making changes but you can
download this as an ASE file or an Adobe
swatch exchange file now I've taken the
liberty of assuming that perhaps you
don't have an Adobe ID so the source
files that come with these videos also
include the ASE file the adobe swatch
exchange file that I've downloaded for
this one before we go about opening that
just let me also mention a couple of
other things when we're inside here if
you'll notice that when you have a base
color set or any color set for example
what does that mean it means you can
move things around it also means I could
say hey look based on that base color
give me a series of analogous colors and
as you can see here there are a lot of
things you can do what about
monochromatic monochromatic means the
same color but you know just with a
little bit more black or a little bit
more white placed inside of it triadic
is actually kind of interesting because
what it does is it allows you to you
know here's your base color or whatever
color you want and as you can see if
this is mine in fact my base color what
I can do then is to say well here look I
want this to be my base color so you see
how it's sort of circled triadic means
on this color wheel that we have here
give me ones that are split in a triad
so for example just to make it easier
for you to see if I wanted this to be my
base color I could do so and look you
know you could use this slider to
brighten up your bed
color base color being the one that's
selected I could brighten it up and I
could say hey give me a try attic option
here so as you can see these are your
triad options and look you could also
change some of the other colors that are
here as well and what about
complementary complimentary zar directly
opposite each other that's why we
oftentimes see reds and greens at
Christmas time they're high levels of
contrast when you're working with try a
complementary direct complementary
compound colors sort of do very similar
things but as you can see they work on
one side or the other of that so these
are just to show you a couple of things
inside cooler and analogous colors are
right next to each other on the color
wheel as well but if you you know have
some trouble picking out your own colors
and moving things around and you want to
make some changes as you do so you can
try a different variation just by
experimenting here or as I mentioned you
can choose a theme from cooler directly
or there's another option you can
actually upload your own image at cooler
which is extremely cool as you can see
here you can upload your own that's on
your computer you can select one from
Flickr and what it will do is choose or
prepare for you a number of different
colors based on the colors that are
available inside of your picture so you
could say select a mood give me the most
colorful colors give me the brightest
colors you can say and you can see that
those things can be manipulated as well
you can make changes and do different
things as well you can say give me the
muted colors give me deep colors and
give me dark colors all of these things
allow you to choose and pick and they
can be done quite easily once you're
logged in you can even save those and
you can make those colors palettes that
you've created down here either public
or private only for yourself and if you
do make them public or private
irregardless you can give them a title
and you can add some tags that are
easily and readily searchable all right
well as I mentioned to you
you here i am in photoshop remember our
type layout that we had before and we
saw that there was a bunch of swatches
and stuff like this well let's clean up
this little swatch palette that we have
at our disposal and what I want you to
do is to just click on this little
options for the window right here we can
replace the existing swatches do you
want to save the current swatches no
don't save that and wherever you have
the source files for this particular
project available you'll notice that
right here there's something called wave
ase so that's our Adobe swatch exchange
file which I will load and because we
replace the existing ones now we have
these ones here so looking at my final
website i can see what the color scheme
was and you guys can feel free to do the
same thing so i'm going to choose this
bright color and with my paint bucket
tool just drop that into the background
perfect and as you can see we've now got
not only a good background that we're
going to be using to sort of turn it
into what we have here but also we've
cleaned up our swatches palette and
we've got only the ones that we need
great absolutely perfect we're ready to
start moving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
