killer PHP killer sites comp in this
video I want to talk about dress codes
for web designers and web programmers
I'm on a roll today this is by my third
video blog today we're going to post
them but you're probably gifts by the
fact I'm wearing the same clothes over
and over again no it's not you know I
don't wear to sing shirt ten days in a
row I've graduated from that stage of my
life but it's the same day anyway dress
codes a great thing about being a web
professional we can dress down relative
to many other professions you see if I
saw my accountant expect him to wear and
all slacks and my shirt and I see my
lawyer you have to add a tie doctor
again he's going to dress they got a
dress in a particular manner but when it
comes to technology in the technology
field there's a lot more in the way
especially if you're a programmer or a
designer now you can't go in there
dressed like a total slob all the time
but you can go in there as a total slob
half at a time as long as you don't
stink up the place you know if you look
at Steve Jobs when he gives a pretty
presentation he's wearing jeans running
shoes and a black turtleneck to have
most of the time and that pretty much
gives you an idea of where we are and
you know I actually in our field in our
profession has a web professionals
whether it be programmers or designers
you know I actually feel what I see if I
see a web professional walk in designer
programmer wearing a suit and tie
i i I'm suspicious of that person
because it doesn't fit the character and
I'm wondering if you're overcompensating
for their lack of skill by wearing a
shirt and tie and a suit web programmer
should dress very casual need but casual
and I trust those people much more so
than I would somebody will sure tie you
know this is the nature of our business
so that's it so just call me hair clean
shirt some jeans good shoes and you know
the trick is if you you know if you're
doing business on a freelance basis
you're freelancer you want to dress
casual but you want to dress with good
stuff so you know if you can get good
you know good shoes but that's not like
fancy shoes that you do you know we're a
ballroom but maybe some expensive Hugo
Boss your shoes or Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana shoes
or something like that it's a bit of a
pulsar thing but you know it shows that
you're hip and cool but you got a few
bucks to throw around and just like in
high school where everybody likes the
popular kids everybody want to hang
around popular kids in life and
adulthood if there's a perception that
you're successful financially they will
more likely want to do business with you
because there's going to be a sumption
that you know what you're doing and
there's a summoner's of assumption that
you'll deliver on what you do that's why
they figure you make it money because
you're good and that's the on the
surface intellectual understanding of
that situation but in fact there's also
a subconscious charge like wanting to be
it's a high school type of
predisposition to want to hang around
the popular kids and again popularity
popularity these days is perceived you
know with wealth and wealth is is the
perception of wealth is the sikita bad
thing anyway you get the idea I fumbled
that last part that's it so if your
weapon or whatever don't worry about
trusting debts and start to sharply and
actually don't wear a suit and tie
because I'll hire you if you do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
