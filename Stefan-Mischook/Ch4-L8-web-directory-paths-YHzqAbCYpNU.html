about something called paths think of it
as paths in the woods and what this is
all about is being able to connect one
webpage to another even if you have
webpages in different directories so
what do I mean by that so let's go to
our my website and you notice that all
our webpages are in the same directory
they're sitting right beside each other
so let's do something that could screw
up a lot of people we're going to create
a new folder I'm gonna call it sub -
pages now if you remember I always put a
dash or no space you don't want a space
if you remember you want to you want a
dash or something in between
your words in a file name so what we're
gonna do now is we're gonna take my
friends and I'm gonna put it into this
folder here so here it is my friends
okay so let's see what happens when we
try to load my friends web page not
found why is that let's go back your
page source you see my friends were
pointing to the file my - friends dot
HTML if you look at it right here not a
problem is if you look at our directory
structure you look at our folders this
is the index page right this page right
here but my friend's page is no longer
here it's in sub pages here it is so we
have to tell the web browser that then
my friend's page is actually in that
that subfolder which is called sub pages
so let's do that in our code editor so
what a pop-up in sublime text here's my
friends know sub oops
-
Paige and slash let me just confirm that
Oh No Paige's oops
Oh save that so the rule is whenever you
have a subfolder you have to name that
subfolder in your link so in your H ref
so I'm saying check in subpages sub -
pages and look for the file
my friends dodd HTML so you go back
there again so my - Rammstein HTML so
let's see if this works that well first
so I have to save it save so let's see
if it works now ah it works we've loaded
up our friends pages so let's go back
home dope it's broken so we're back in
my website again so why when we click
the link in my friend's dot HTML we
clicked it to go back to the index page
why was it broken
well that's because if you look at the
my friends code let's go in here my
friends open with sublime text you can
see the link to back to index it says
that index is just right beside it as it
was originally right we're saying it's
right beside my friends page is right
beside the index page but we know it's
not we know it's actually up a directory
level it's up above sub pages and what
they call the root of the website this
is the root of website when you first
open the where the index pages of a
website that's called the root
this is subdirectory we call it the
subdirectory sub pages could a call to
anything we wanted so now what we have
to do with our code our code that's in
my - French on HTML we have to tell that
page that the index page is actually up
in the root subdirectory so the way you
do that is like this you go dot dot
slash dot dot slash means go
the previous directory that's what that
means so let's save and let's preview
this and yeah let's go back home it
works fantastic but if we go back to
that friend's page and if we click any
of these links because we didn't tell it
to go up a directory level you see it
just goes right to the directly to the
page it's not gonna work so let's just
click on this oh of course that one
works because we're on my friends and
we're saying go to my friends so yeah it
can find that page but this won't work
there we go nor will this work there we
go so that's the basics of paths PAHs in
HTML and this will have a major impact
in terms of building your links because
if you have a very complex site you're
gonna many subfolder these many
subdirectories and also impact on other
things like images so we'll get to that
when we get to the images part of this
course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
