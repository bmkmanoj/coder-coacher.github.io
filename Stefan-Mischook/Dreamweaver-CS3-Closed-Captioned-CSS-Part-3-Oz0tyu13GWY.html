CSS mom there's a lot more to it but you
know since you're new so we've learned
to create what is called classes and
let's take it just a quick look at the
code scroll to the top and you see here
we go we got our three classes right
remember opening closing and we see them
also defined up here as well now there
are different ways to apply CSS to to
your pages this is just one way let's
look at another way now and we're going
to do that by going into it's going to
occurred no at all does it really matter
actually but I won't say let's create a
new CSS rule so I click that and we're
going to do something called we're going
to select the selector type tag route
now says right here redefines the look
of a specific tag what's really cool is
that you can now select a tag and then
create some CSS so that affects v
whatever happens whenever that tag
appears it automatically affects that
tag so if you recall in our previous
rules we had created a para rule so we
could apply to our paragraphs so instead
of having to apply this class to all our
paragraphs we can create a tag CSS rule
that affects all paragraphs
automatically so we don't even have to
bother to do that again along the way if
anything doesn't make sense don't worry
about i'll just go with it in time you
will you'll learn how to do it and now
so we've created a selector type we say
we want to tag style.css we're going to
affect the P tag which is a paragraph
tag and we're going to define it in this
document only so I hit OK and we see
this thing but we're so used to so let's
let's go to box
and let's give it a a left left left
hand side value 25 and then we're going
to go and do something interesting we're
going to go and hmm let's uh let's give
it a background now what you can do is
you can automatically give it a
background color so I'm going to give it
a nice light grey background color hit
apply you see what's happening here so
let's uh go k so all sudden any text
what's inside of a paragraph tag see
paragraph this is a paragraph right p
well let me just open this up CP p
anything that's in a paragraph will also
get the what's cool it gets this
styles.css stuff applied to it just to
make my point clear what's uh let's
remove the c2 system let's remove
actually you know what's cool right here
so let's remove the para collapse how do
you do that you're going to you select
whatever item you want to remove this
style information from you select this
Neagle none strangely though you see it
still has style information applied to
it why because of this new rule we
created the P paragraph class rule that
applies to any paragraphs in our pages
so here's another example again we're
understanding tags plays a big role so
this also has the background gray
because it has the class header small
part applied to it it's also paragraph
now this brings us to another important
rule you can apply multiple CSS rules to
the same element and they may conflict
and CSS has a way to override each other
and we'll get into at a later point
perhaps but I just want to understand
what you want to take aways that you can
apply multiple styles to one particular
element on your page
element again it could be a paragraph
tag it could be a list tag it could be
it just one letter even this really
matter could be an image you know what
never had it let's see we sweat our
image and you look under class down here
when the properties you see that we have
the option of the class now a lot of
these classes that we created will not
be applicable to the image because it
has to do a text right so maybe we
should create our own special style our
own special class for for images or
better yet let's create a style that
applies to images automatically so let's
do that let's go and we'll hit new CSS
rule again and we're going to say
redefine tag and then we're going to
choose image so we're going to scroll
down image IMG so again this assumes
that you know you have to know a little
bit of HTML this is the tag for images
this document only it ok so this is
going to automatically apply to all
images now of course font and weight and
variant well do anything because this
has to do with fonts but background
might but it's not a perfect for us what
we want to get into actually its margins
so this is cool now you see this checked
off same for all sizes this allows us to
not have to type in the same thing over
again so what I want to do is I want to
give a margin of 25 pixels well 224
images so automatically images I have to
save this without automatically images
will have a 25 pixel border so we go
here here it is right let's edit that
c20 pixel border rather automatically
around our our images this was kind of
ugly so let's go back and change our
paragraph it and let's say the
background colors is white for now there
we go so let's save that you notice how
the text is now wrapping more because
the image has a much bigger border let's
give me let's give it an even bigger
border for the sake of
for the sake of our video
now you see how big the margin
everything is being pushed over let's
f12 that preview now we have a big
margin around our image it's a little
bit too big so let's let's reduce it so
we will enjoy our images edit I will
just give it a nice value of 10 out of
10 save that preview and there we go so
we got our border so the image doesn't
get squished up on the text but we can
really control that in a fine-tuned way
right down that a pixel we can give this
a 1 a 1 pixel border if we want we can
make what's let's do something let's do
this let's say the bottom we want a big
one let's say we want not on oh let's
say we want if now 100 crazy so we go
100 fly now we say that let's take a
look you notice now how we just get this
into the video screen here you notice
how the image now pushes this down quite
a bit now this may not be obvious to you
guys right now hold on but I'll make it
obvious in about two seconds there we go
so let's make this obvious let's push it
down image and I was going to current
see hit current so dream we were smart
and knows that we've this image has the
image property attached to a so it's
gave margin bottom let's give it three
hundred hit enter hit save f12 preview
so you can see it's really pushing down
stuff quite a bit the CSS is now
allowing us versus this it's pushing the
image over this may not be intuitive to
you looking at this and why is it
shifting over and the reason is shifting
over is because we're pushing imagine
there's a margin here at pushing down
and it pushes this back over here CSS
when it comes to laying out pages in a
big way can get pretty complex
and tricky but we're going to show you
i'm going to show you rather a way
around this in future videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
