killer sites in this video I'm gonna
talk about the keys to coders success
the keys to coders success so first
thing I just want to point out is that I
am NOT going to talk about technologies
in fact one of the main things that
separates a successful coder and
developer versus somebody's not so
successful is actually something called
human skills or soft skills so before
you go to sleep before you go off forget
this and turn it off pay attention it's
actually quite simple but in explaining
but it's actually a lot of people seem
to have a difficult time dealing with
this you see most people were inclined
to be coders they TechEd they tend to be
a little antisocial introverted it's
almost a prerequisite to a certain
degree because you got to be you know
somebody who can really focus in on
things to become a coder especially
initially although if you have a fun
coding course a fun teacher lively
package you know where you train from
then you know you could bring in other
people but anyway so I'm assuming a lot
of you out there are much more the
introverted types may be a little
uncomfortable deal with new people and
if you can get out of that she'll if you
can learn to be a little bit more
relaxed around people be a little bit
more friendly smile a little bit more
I'm telling you it sounds silly I know I
know it's not silly but this goes a long
way in terms of being successful in the
field so first thing she learned to be
as professional as you can and as polite
as you can even when you hear stuff that
is silly and trust me I get that all the
time dealing with that just recently
doing with an organisation and they they
put to you these crazy I know that's
crazy but these really difficult to
implement requests and your instinct at
least my instinct is to go no you know
this is not know this is gonna be
terrible you got to be more diplomatic
about it you got to use some
you know some verbal emotional jujitsu
to trying mold them in the right
direction as opposed to being
confrontational because at the end of
the day you have to remember as a
software developer as a coder you are
providing a service it's a service just
like a waiter provides a service
although you're a much higher paid
service provider than a waiter but a
typical waiter but nonetheless you are
providing a service and a key to
providing good service is to be polite
and to be professional people really
appreciate that in you and it's going to
go a long way in terms of you either
advancing your career within an
organization or you getting more jobs
and managing more clients because when
you're polite and you're professional
and you're courteous you develop a lot
of goodwill with people people say this
guy is a good guy you know he's a good
guy he listens to us he's polite and so
it's if if should go down problems
should occur my apologies for swearing
there but if problems should a cure all
that goodwill will really come in handy
because they're gonna be much more
forgiving of things that should go wrong
if they like you so keep that in mind
another basic tip goes along with
professionalism we turn your emails
return your emails in a timely manner so
if they email you they have a question
whether it be an oak line new client
prospective clients respond to them even
if you don't have a direct answer to
their question within the same day at
least say I got your email thanks a lot
I will get back to you as soon as I can
and best if you can give a date within
the next 48 hours I will get back to you
that goes a long way it is much better
than you then them sending you an email
and you not responding for two three
four days even if you're at a funeral
even if you're at a wedding you know
even if you're in a jacuzzi you get out
you spend a to sit in a minute the 30
seconds is this response say I got your
email and I am I'm gonna get back to you
and this this is very cool because it
shows that it was
relax them figure it put yourself in
their shoes if you send a tech support
email you have a question about whatever
and you don't get a response back here
like all I did they respond when are
they gonna respond whether they're you
know it's it's not a good thing to do so
we're doing a simple little thing like
returning your emails responding to them
is this a basic courtesy that it goes a
long way towards creating goodwill
between you and the people that you deal
with point number three make your
deadlines make your deadlines now I
talked about pricing I talked about this
a little bit in pricing of projects and
so forth if you figure a particular jobs
gonna take you two weeks say it's gonna
take me about four weeks and you do vApp
show you give yourself some breathing
space and whatever you do make your
deadlines make your deadlines don't be
late even if you haven't the best excuse
in the world there's no excuse make your
deadlines very important it goes again
to you back to your credibility and your
goodwill at the client because if you're
not responding to emails always late on
your projects they're not gonna want to
deal with you they're not gonna want to
deal with you and then when the next
project comes up or their buddy says hey
you know any good developers and I say
well no not this guy doesn't respond to
his emails very quickly he says he's
gonna have it done in a month and it
takes in a month and a half he's not
gonna go good for you so for you in a
long term it's best that you be sure
that you make your deadlines and so one
of the things I do again create a nice
buffer for yourself by overestimating
the amount of time it's going to take
you and in this way you know trying to
get there a few days earlier so what do
I mean by that if you are thinking that
the project that takes you a month to
complete say to the guy I maybe two
months will try to get a little sooner
but it's probably gonna be about two
months and Bill's hard so you get it out
of the month and don't give it to him in
a month because then he's gonna feel a
little ripped off he didn't know me in a
month and he charged me no no you give
it to him like a month and a half four
months and three weeks hey I got our
little early that looks really good it
looks like you didn't rip him off and
you create a lot of goodwill so keep
that in mind that's
another great trick it's not a trick
it's just a good strategy a good way of
dealing with people I hope you see how
this is all about managing your clients
in the psychology of the clients let me
give you another tip if you're going to
meet a client and you have a meeting
plan to be there 15 minutes earlier at
least 15 minutes early if you think
there could be some traffic glad to be
there a half an hour earlier why do I
say that well just in case something
should happen right you have that buffer
time of 15 minutes to half an hour you
know it's even better you get there
early well it's not even better but if
you get there early let's say everything
goes perfect and you you plan to be a
half an hour early and you're there
early don't walk in a half an hour early
that takes people off big time just sit
in the car listen to some radio listen
to a podcast watch a video do some
reading
you know this wait never show up too
early and don't show up late I try to
get there five minutes before meeting
that's a nice time you're not you're not
getting the you're not freaking out the
secretary you're not invading on their
time five minutes early all the time and
you're gonna do really well and give
yourself that buffer give yourself that
buffer maybe half an hour or 15 minutes
if you're going to meet a client on a
particular day another general tip is
don't be a douche bag don't be a douche
bag just be a nice person don't be
snippy don't be arrogant trust me I've
been guilty I've been guilty of that in
the past be a nice guy I think it's
they're just gonna want to deal with you
so yeah don't be a douche bag that's a
big one that's a very big one and let me
give you one little story it goes back
to the 90s about how I landed one of my
better clients when I was a freelancer
so at the time I was living in downtown
Montreal Atlanta my apartment my
high-rise apartment which I prefer a
high-rise apartment so and it was a nice
place clean place so the client to come
and see where I worked and they were
part of a group of companies and I
didn't make any bones about I was just
myself or some assistants so they came
to my apartment now I'm a bit of an
obsessive-compulsive everything's there
need them very clean and tidy I can't
work in a messy environment that's just
me but what happened is he came to my
place the prospective client and we
talked and you know went over stuff and
I got all these contracts I got no ten
ten ten apps to build or something like
that so it's pretty lucrative for me and
about a year after I started dealing
with them he I got to know the guy he
told me he said you know stuff you know
why I gave you the contract why I
decided to go if you ever go why well
big part of this because when I saw your
place he said I saw that everything was
neat and clean and tidy
I saw your place wasn't a mess I saw and
he said he said I figured since this guy
keeps his own place clean chances are
his work is going to be clean and tidy
as well
so I created a nice impression with him
right so city goes to like just like
wearing clean clothes making sure your
home your your hair is combed
although nerds can get away with messy
hair and when I had that problem you
know sometimes but when you go see the
client that impression of being you know
on time being courteous being you know
dressed well you know I don't wear a
suit I never trusted a nerd who shows up
in a suit but you know looking looking
you know not disheveled being orderly
like that this this goes a long way all
these little impressions that could
sound kind of silly the affect people's
monkey brains they remember the monkey
brain the largest part of a brain and we
make a lot of all our decisions really
based on emotional responses and
impulses I studied psychology and
university that was my major and so I
have a bit of knowledge on that stuff
I'm not by any means I'm not an expert
in that field but I studied a bit of it
so whatever things I remember is that is
that really we make a lot of our
decisions based on impressions that's
why when when they advertise most
products they get stars they get
good-looking people because we're
creating associations right they're
creating associations when they're
trying to sell you a high-end sports car
or even a normal car they're not trying
to they're not saying you know buy this
car cause you know you know it's got
this in this quality super well-built no
they usually sell it based on a feeling
or based on an association
particular type of thing you know so you
see the jeep commercials and people are
off-roading with their jeeps and they're
creating impressions or you have like
some sports star pitching a particular
drink or something and all these little
micro communications if you will do play
a role so keep that in mind and that's
it that's it so these are my keys to
coders success you notice I didn't talk
about coding of course it talked about
coding other videos you got to be a
decent code of course and blah blah but
these things these things that if you
practice these things I've discussed
this will go a huge way to helping you
establish yourself in the industry yeah
I hope you found this interesting bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
