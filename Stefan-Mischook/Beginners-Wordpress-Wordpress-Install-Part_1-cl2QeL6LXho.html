to install WordPress on your ownself
hosting account so there's a couple
options and what you have to install
WordPress well you can go to wordpress
com and use their free service but then
you're running wordpress on their server
and you will have restrictions in terms
of the themes you can install themes are
just wordpress templates in terms of ads
you may want to place and ultimately you
will not be building your own domain
name so what we want to do is we want to
actually install wordpress on our own
servers and to do that you have to a
first register your domain name and b
then you have to buy web hosting now web
hosting for ninety nine percent of sites
will crop require basic hosting packages
and you're looking at maybe five six
bucks a month max domain name will cost
you between nine and ten dollars per
year so what we want to do is we want to
download the WordPress installer which
is basically just a file that includes
all the WordPress files that create the
WordPress site so we're going to
download it and then we're going to
upload it to our web server where we
rent space to put our web site up online
okay so we go to wordpress.org and it's
pretty simply just go download WordPress
I'm recording what we're recording this
in 2013 January so this is the current
version you may be watching this in the
future so you may have 3.6 or four point
0 or etc but the process is going to be
pretty much the same so we're going to
hit download we'll just click download
and we're just going to download the zip
version 5.2 if you know what the tar.gz
version is then you can download that
that's for linux users but for windows
and mac users you can just download the
zip version so i've downloaded it i'm
downloading it you see down here it's
appearing here on your web browser you
may see to download
some others part of your screen it's
pretty big file and so format for Meg so
depending on how fast your internet
connection is you take a 30 seconds or a
couple minutes to download so we've
downloaded about five make file was five
point two medics is right here not so
bad so we're going to then show it so
I'm going to take it to my desktop so
it's just easy to find so now what we're
going to do is we're going to go to our
website so in this case the website is
called W aqua turtlecom so what we're
going to do is we need to login to the
Turtles the Aqua Terra coms control
panel if you don't know what that is you
have to ask your hosting company and
they'll tell you what that is now there
are different control panels depending
on your hosting company but the majority
of them will use something called cpanel
this is pretty standard if you don't use
cpanel it doesn't really matter because
the process the procedure you're
learning here is going to apply to any
control panel at your hosting company
may provide again your hosting company
will provide that for you but for our
demos you type in the name of your
domain colon and 2083 now this is if you
have cpanel installed and this is a very
popular as I said a very popular control
by oh so then you enter your username
and password and again you get this from
your hosting company you may use another
control panel called plesk very similar
though again it make it will look
different but the process is going to be
very similar so we've logged in here to
the control panel for aqua turtles and
there's a couple of things you need to
do to get wordpress up and running for
your website the first thing you have to
do is you have to upload the wordpress
zip file the zip file here we have to
upload that onto our server so the way
to do that in cpanel because we're going
to use the file manager and the file
manager is a program inside a cpanel
that allows you to upload and download
files rename files and do all kinds of
now plus cash something similar if you
don't have a file manager you want to
use something called ftp you see that we
have ftp here i'm not going to get into
ftp in this video since this is not a
video on how to use the control panel
but again you ask your hosting company
you need your you tell them you wanted
ftp files they should point away for you
okay so we're going to go into the file
manager i'm going to have to relog in
again
so let's log in to the file manager here
let's use the file manager program and
it's going to ask you do you want to go
to a home directory or the web root
we're going to go to the web root the
web root is basically where all your web
files are going to go and that includes
your WordPress files so I'm going to hit
the go so this is the webroot the web
root is typically in a directory called
public underscore HTML so what we need
to do now is upload button there on the
upload button we're going to upload our
WordPress files and now we're uploading
your files you see starting upload right
here on the right so we've uploaded the
files and now we don't see anything here
back in the screen but I'm just going to
hit this reload button and there it is
now what we have to do now is we have to
unpack it from this zip file you see a
zip is a package it's like a box that we
put files into and the reason you put
files in a zip folder like this and a
zip file this because you want to it
just makes it easier to move many files
around so what we're going to do here is
we're going to right click and we're
going to say extract asking us here
where do you want to extract it am say
and by default goals into the same
folder where your zip file is in this
case it's in the public underscore HTML
folder so let's extracted all these
files
that's all here as any folder called
WordPress there are two ways you can
install WordPress on your site you can
install it so that it's on the root of
their site so let's say you were killer
sites calm you can install WordPress
right here or you can install it in a
subdirectory like the blog directory and
you can install it in the subdirectory
it doesn't make too much of a difference
except it depends on how you want to use
WordPress if you want to use WordPress
to control your entire site like we do
on CSS tutorial dotnet this is where
press right here this is total WordPress
and if you want to do about then you
need to install WordPress right inside
of the public HTML folder or your web
root folder but if you want to install
WordPress that we did on for instance on
killer PHP here's blog this is not
WordPress here so let's say you wanted
to install WordPress in a part of your
website let's say you want to install it
in an article section you would create a
folder called articles and you stick it
in here for instance right now the
WordPress files are in a folder called
WordPress so if we were going to go to
aqua turtles and we assume that this
WordPress was installed i'm going to
show you if we go two pairs aqua Turtles
is nothing there we can actually see
bright aqua turtles calm can see see you
spot WordPress dash three point five
time dot zip WordPress now if you look
showing us right here the same thing now
okay so you notice there's a forward
slash after WordPress there's a 4 / here
and because that's the browser telling
us that this is another directory so
look at that see you got WordPress and
this because this is a zip there's no
forward slash so if you want right now
this is the recall is the root of the
website aquaculture knows com this is
the first page the homepage of the
website and because there's no HTML
files there or and because WordPress is
not installed there this is what we see
so if we wanted we're
to be in a subdirectory we could right
now because it's in the folder called
WordPress right it's in foot WordPress
click through so now this is the
WordPress program saying so you didn't
configure it WordPress properly so it's
giving this message so you can I guess
you can click right here's and create
yeah so it's giving you well it's just
giving you instruction you have to go on
to the files which are in this folder
here and you're going to have to change
this wp-config.php file so now we have
to decide do you want aqua turtles
WordPress to be in a subdirectory as we
have it here or do you want it to be on
the roots right here okay so what we
have to do that is we're going to have
to take these files out of WordPress way
out of the wordpress folder and stick it
on the roots you see all these fucking
so what we're going to do is we're going
to select them start at the top you hit
the shift key in this case you got em
all select now they turn blue so no work
and we know what they are selected now
we right-click and we want to go to move
so I hit move so it's saying you want to
move always falls here so these are all
files what do you want to put them so we
want to put them right in public each so
we're Italian right here public HTML we
click move so you see there are gone
help they were in the wordpress folder
so we're just going to go click this one
up one level so up one level of the
folder hierarchy this may be a little
confusing for you but dis understand
that there's there's a folder hierarchy
so if we go in here let's see see this
is like a folder hierarchy one folder
inside of another folder so public HTML
is a top folder because in public HTML
is under this home aqua turtle photo
it's the web root the root directory is
actually this one here I if you were on
Windows be like being on C colon slash
so then now under home / aqua turd you
have another directory called public
underscore HTML the way the server setup
this is the web root directory remember
we mentioned that before so
in this folder is all the web file so
now we're in the root of this particular
folder so now we want to do is when I
look for this file here WP config sample
dot PHP because we're going to have to
put in our settings for our database so
that we can get wordpress up and running
but we're going to discuss that in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
