CSS mom there's a lot more to it but you
know since you're new so we've learned
to create what is called classes and
let's take it just a quick look at the
code scroll to the top and you see here
we go we got our three classes right
remember opening closing and we see them
also defined up here as well now there
are different ways to apply CSS to to
your pages this is just one way let's
look at another way now and we're going
to do that by going into it's going to
occurred no at all does it really matter
actually but I won't say let's create a
new CSS rule so I click that and we're
going to do something called I'm going
to select the selector type tag route
now says right here redefines the look
of a specific tag what's really cool is
that you can now select a tag and then
create some CSS so that affects the
whatever happens whenever that tag
appears it automatically affects that
tag so if you recall in our previous
rules we had created a para rule so we
could apply to our paragraphs so instead
of having to apply this class to all our
paragraphs we can create a tag CSS rule
that affects all paragraphs
automatically so we don't even have to
bother to do that again along the way if
anything doesn't make sense don't worry
about just go with it in time you will
you'll learn how to do it and you know
so we created a selector type we say we
want to tag style.css we're going to
affect the P tag which is a paragraph
tag and we're going to define it in this
document only so I hit OK and we see
this thing but we're so used to so let's
let's go to box and let's give it a
a left left left hand side value of 25
and then we're going to go and do
something interesting we're going to go
and hmm let's let's give it a background
now what you can do is you can
automatically give it a background color
so I'm going to give it a nice light
grey background color hit apply you see
what's happening here so let's go Kim so
all seven any text what's inside of a
paragraph tag see paragraph this is a
paragraph right p well let me just open
this up see you p p anything that's in a
paragraph will also get the what's cool
it gets this styles.css stuff applied to
it just to make my point clear what sir
let's remove the see this is let's
remove actually you know what school
right here so let's remove the para
class how do you do that you go into you
select whatever item you want to remove
this style information from you select
this niggle none strangely though you
see it still has style information
applied to it why because of this new
rule we created the P paragraph class
rule that applies to any paragraphs in
our pages so here's another example
again we're understanding tags plays a
big role so this also has the background
gray because it has the class header
small apartment applied to it it's also
paragraph now this brings us to another
important rule you can apply multiple
CSS rules to the same element and they
may conflict and CSS has a way to
override each other and we'll get into
at a later point perhaps but I just want
to understand what you want to take away
is that you can apply multiple styles to
one particular element on your page an
element again it could be a paragraph
tag
it could be a list tag it could be it
just a one letter even doesn't really
matter it could be an image you know
what now what we're at it let's see we
selected our image and you look under
class down here when the properties you
see that we have the option of the class
now a lot of these classes that we
created will not be applicable to the
image because it has to do a text right
so maybe we should create our own
special style our own special class for
for images or better yet let's create a
style that applies to images
automatically so let's do that let's go
and we'll hit new CSS rule again and
we're going to say redefine tag and then
we're going to choose image so we can
scroll down image IMG so again this is
seems that you know you have to know a
little bit of HTML this is the tag for
images this document only AG ok so this
is going to automatically apply to all
images now of course font and weight and
variant will do anything because this
has to do with fonts but background
might but it's not a perfect for us what
we want to get into actually its margins
so this is cool now you see this checked
off same for all sizes this allows us to
not have to type in the same thing over
again so what I want to do is I want to
give a margin of 25 pixels while 224
images so automatically images I have to
save this without automatically images
will have a 25 pixel border so we go
here here it is right let's edit that
c20 pixel border rather automatically
around our our images this is kind of
ugly so let's go back and change our
paragraph it and let's say the
background colors is white for now there
we go so let's save that you notice how
the text is now wrapping more because
the image has a much bigger border let's
give you let's give it an even bigger
border for the sake of for the sake of
our video
now you see how big the margin
everything is being pushed over let's
f12 that preview now we have a big
margin around our image it's a little
bit too big so let's let's reduce it so
we want our images edit I will just give
it a nice value of 10 out of 10 save
that preview and there we go so we got
our border so the image doesn't get
squished up on the text but we can
really control that in a fine-tuned way
right down that a pixel we can give this
a 1 a 1 pixel border if we want we can
liquids let's do something let's do this
let's need a bottom we want a big one
let's say we want not on oh let's say we
want if now 100 crazy so we go 100 fly
now we save that let's take a look you
notice now how we just get this into the
video screen here you notice how the
image now pushes this down quite a bit
now this may not be obvious to you guys
right now hold on but I'll make it
obvious in about two seconds there we go
so let's make this obvious let's push it
down image and I was go to current see
hit current so dream we were smart and
knows that we've this image has the
image property attached to a so it's
gave margin bottom let's give it three
hundred hit enter hit save f12 preview
so you can see it's really pushing down
stuff quite a bit the CSS is now
allowing us versus this it's pushing the
image over this may not be intuitive to
you looking at this and why is it
shifting over and the reason is shifting
over is because we're pushing badging
there's a margin here at pushing down
and then it pushes this back over here
CSS when it comes to laying out pages in
a big way can get pretty complex
and tricky but we're going to show you
i'm going to show you rather a way
around this in future videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
