started to get a PHP file set up and
we're ready now to start working on the
PHP validation so just to briefly go
through this file again we set up a
couple basic variables to start with we
went ahead and set up two arrays one to
hold all the form elements and excuse me
the names of all the form elements and
another one to hold just the names and
the form elements that we have to
validate and I do this primarily so we
can set all these elements to nothing so
we don't run into errors however it is
nice to have it as a reference just to
keep it fresh in our minds so the main
part that we need to start working on is
this section here what happens after the
form is submitted what do we do so the
first step that we need to do is we need
to get the form data and because we have
each of these form elements in them and
write like this it makes really easy so
I'm going to go ahead and copy and paste
my full loop again and this time what we
need to do is we need to go ahead and so
form elements as element and we need to
set form element equals and we want to
make sure we use HTML special characters
like so this will help make sure there
aren't any invalid characters in the
input and then we're going to do post
and element so what this is going to do
is it's going to loop through each of
our form elements and it's going to set
our formal ray that'll hold all the form
data you'll grab that from our form so
that's the first step and then the
second step is we need to actually check
those form elements I'm going to skip
the check step for now just in case or
excuse me I'm going to I'm going to step
the check form elements section for now
I'm going to come back to in a minute
and what we want to do we're going to
assume that we've checked through all
the form elements and then let's go
ahead and see if the form is still valid
so because how we're going to work this
is if you'll notice we have a valid form
variable up here and it starts out being
true and we're going to check through
all the form elements and if there's an
element that's invalid we want to
display the form again and we'll set
this value to false so down here and
we're going to go ahead and check if
it's valid and so if valid form
so if it is valid we want to redirect
because the form submitted successfully
at this point for example if you were
building out a full functioning contact
form this is probably where you would go
ahead and put your mail script or
however you want it to process it but
just for the simple example I'm not
going to do anything with the data I'm
simply going to redirect the user so I'm
going to redirect using header and
they'll be location redirect like so now
for some reason the form does not pass
validation we want to go ahead and
display the form back to the user so
what we're going to do is we'll do an
include actually we don't even it need
to write it out we can just copy and
paste so copy and paste might include
here okay so that's a good chunk and the
last thing we need to do is go through
and check all of our form elements so
let's go ahead let's assume for some
reason that our form elements come back
well I'll put that on pause for now
let's let's go ahead and start checking
our form elements and I'll set up the
code at least some of the basics and
i'll go ahead and show you how it's
working so far so the first thing of all
let's go ahead and check any required
fields so that's pretty simple I'm just
going to do if form i'll start with the
name variable and make sure that is set
up properly so if form name equals
nothing so the user didn't input
anything i'm going to go ahead and set
an error message
so our name equals and i'm going to say
please fill in all required fields hey
like so and then like i was talking
about a little bit earlier let me go
ahead and set that led form equals false
okay so then i'm going to just go ahead
and copy and paste this two more times
like so and so we need to check the name
want to check the phone and finally the
email
can I save it and let's go ahead and
preview it and see how things are
working so far okay so when the form
first loads we get a standard blank form
so I'm going to go ahead let's say that
I somehow made a mistake and I hit
submit let's see what happens please
fill in all required fields it doesn't
look quite exactly right might have a
bug here so let me just double check
those you're correct
let me check the source code and see
what's going on
oh I know what happened let's go back to
the code itself and i realized i missed
something this arrow message needs to
include they are open and arrow closed
variables so I missed that there we go
so I'm going to just briefly copy and
paste the section save it and now let's
preview and it should be working fine
now there we go looks like one is
missing somehow so let me check that too
maybe you have a typo
check my phone
believe it was entering in a couple
extra spaces and those spaces were being
picked up so let me go ahead and double
check and make sure that was the case
okay there we go so yeah I had a little
bug in my forum code I had tabbed this
in earlier I guess he was adding some
extra spaces that were messing up the
value so just doing that took care of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
