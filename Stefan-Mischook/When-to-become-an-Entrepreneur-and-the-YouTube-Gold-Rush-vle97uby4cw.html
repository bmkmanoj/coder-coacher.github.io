block let's talk about the YouTube gold
rush the YouTube gold rush what am I
talking about I'm talking about all
these young vloggers who see a potential
to make a career out of building videos
or creating videos rather for YouTube so
let's talk about that let's talk about
some reality so I'm not trying to
discourage you because I think any
entrepreneurial activity whether it be
creative or technology or wherever you
happen to pursue that I think it's cool
it miles will try especially when you're
young when you have the opportunity to
be able to make mistakes and fail and
there's no major consequences because
when you get older and you're married
and you may have kids you may have other
dependents and that is a much more
difficult time to start a business
because you're going to pay the bills
but when you're young you got some
flexibility there so that's a good thing
so let me tell you a little bit of story
that it's very much related to strangely
enough to the YouTube gold rushes are
called the rush to become a YouTube
Walker and to make money selling as
becoming an execute eep I or casey
neistat or whatever so first of all
understand that people like pewdiepie
Casey nice that are very rare and lucky
they hit something they probably didn't
expect to hit and one thing that's kind
of interesting about these big youtubers
is that they were amongst the first or
the first do something on youtube so
PewDiePie was one of the first gaming
vloggers far as understand Casey nice
that was one of the first guys to come
out there with his style of editing and
heavy use of drones and so forth so it's
kind of his thing so on so forth so if
you rule number one if you get into this
and you're just copying them
chances are not going to do so well
because you're just copying them like so
many other people so let's go back to
the California Gold Rush because it
relates to this whole YouTube Gold Rush
now the California Gold Rush happened
whatever a hundred years of those 1900s
and I think you can look it up on
Wikipedia the point is is that people
discovered gold in California so
everybody said okay we got to go to
California we're going to get rich we're
going to discover go over there go
prospecting for gold so the reality
situation is most of the people who went
prospecting for gold never found gold
most of them failed and the biggest
fortunes ironically made in the
california gold rush was not digging for
gold the biggest fortunes were made in
supplying the equipment to the gold
diggers the pickaxes and shovels and the
tents and all the other supplies are
required those suppliers of these these
tools to get into the California Gold
Rush they're the guys who made most of
the money so there's a lesson in that
with regards to YouTube I will watch a
lot of these YouTube creators and a lot
of people out there I going out there
buying very expensive canon canon or
sony cameras or panasonic camera gh5 and
it got dreams of becoming the next big
youtube vlogger now chances are it's
will shear because it's a sheer
competition and sheer number of people
out there there we go you're not going
to be one of the big successful once
again I'm not trying to dissuade you but
I'm trying to help you to understand
that when you get into any business
venture you have to consider the
averages the averages are always a good
indicator why because they're the
averages if they want the averages
that means a lot of people wouldn't be
in that positions right you know I hope
I'm making sense there so remember the
average is equal with the what happens
to most people most of the time that's
why there's the averages right people
like case you guys dad PewDiePie
especially PewDiePie and so and so forth
these big vloggers they are far from
being the averages they're what we call
the outliers they're they're rare cases
again I'm not saying don't do it but I'm
trying to help you understand as you can
understand that this is a highly highly
probable that you will not be the rare
person it's like the lottery ticket
winner it's very rare for some it wins a
lot of yet people win the lottery every
day but you know out of millions and
millions of people one person wins
lottery saving with YouTube I don't know
the exact numbers are highly unlikely so
with that in mind you should not bank
that you're going to be that rare
successful person in YouTube you know i
do youtube as i explained in a previous
video for a few reasons and none of
those reasons has to do with making a
lot of money on youtube now make a
little bit but nothing much i just put
on monetization like man well as well
you know helps pay for some of my
cameras but in the end the youtube thing
for me allows me to a promote my work in
my business which has to do with studio
web helping schools teach code it helps
me to perfect my ability to speak in
front of the camera it helped me a lot
by the way where by doing daily vlogs
almost for like six seven eight months
now not quite daily but quite a few it's
really helped me to become a better
presenter and becoming a better
presenter translates into somewhat
better courses you know courses that are
more easily presented makes a lot makes
a lot less work for myself and my
editors since i'll be making less
mistakes but then
there are other reasons as well so back
to the California Gold Rush remember
before you go out and spend all kinds of
money on expensive gear and so forth
remember that these you to bloggers out
there they were able to succeed with you
know by today's standards a lot of them
with less much less expensive gear in
fact PewDiePie I believe uses a one
camera video camera it's just him and
he's the most successful in the world by
far by far so before you go out there
and start nitpicking the gear spending
thousands on mics and cameras and stuff
consider the fact that chances are you
won't make much money if anybody chances
are now I'm not saying not do it but
you've got to proceed with some caution
and you got to proceed into this whole
YouTube thing like any of the business
with caution and with realistic
expectations and an ability to be
flexible and how you approach things and
previously have talked about being
original don't copy everybody out right
you can bro ideas but don't copy because
it's been done it's not going to work
what are the key things but you learn in
businesses is that the early movers are
the ones who make the money the first
ones to market with an idea or a concept
or business model or the ones you read
dominate so for instance Microsoft came
in there was really the first to do the
operating system for the desktop PC and
it really dominate that dominated that
and nobody else comes close and I can
recite a whole bunch of other examples
but in terms of yacht logging and
YouTube and so forth again guys like
Casey Neistat and others they sort sort
of established the style that they are
known for and you copying them chances
are won't lead to much success at all
especially cuz everybody's neighbor is
now copying these people so the
California Gold Rush is a great teacher
and I would have to say that chances are
the people making the most money off of
youtube are
the people selling the cameras canon
sony panasonic and all the dealers and
the microphone suppliers as well i'm
sure will mike is doing amazing business
selling microphones to bloggers and sure
canon and sony are doing fantastic
selling cameras and to vloggers keep
that in mind so again i would say get
into it's a lot of fun if you want to
get it to it but be realistic with your
expectations and be cautious about the
amount of money you spend at the end of
the day if you get a five-hundred-dollar
camera which is pretty good and versus a
five-thousand-dollar camera she was very
very good I don't think the video
quality between the two is going to have
any impact in terms of whether or not
your youtube career is successful or not
just keep that in mind I hope that helps
