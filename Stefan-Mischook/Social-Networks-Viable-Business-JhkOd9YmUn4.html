killer sites calm in this video I want
to talk about social networks as a
business so we're looking at things like
Facebook Twitter Google+ and others so
I'll get to the point I do not believe
that social networks are viable
businesses in reality I think that
things like facebook and zynga can only
exist in a Ponzi economic situation and
that's what we're in now but this is
collapsing so let's take a look at this
look at the facebook stock so we've seen
that just the last day of trading on the
markets it's already down eleven percent
so let's look at you know since it's
gone it's gone public it's gone it's
lost thirty-seven percent its indicator
right here thirty-seven percent of its
value since May I guess that's when one
public so if you invested you know it's
opening you've lost thirty percent per
cent of your money and the reason that
the stock is losing its money is because
it's not making any money it's actually
since they've gone public Facebook is
lost I think around 157 million dollars
and it's only going to get worse because
of the nature of social networks
especially things like Facebook I'm and
I get into that in a second before i get
into that the question you to ask
yourself now so you know what this is
half what does this have to do with
being a web designer web programmer it
has to do with where you want to invest
your time and efforts I believe social
networking is is something that can only
exist within the context of a viable
business so for instance Google Plus
which I believe by the way is a far
better piece of software than facebook I
think things like Google Plus any social
network can exist within a profitable
business and the profitable business can
use
network as a way to to keep an audience
to engage your audience etc etc but as a
standalone business I really doubt it's
going to survive so people might be
questioning lastly well how could you
say that look at facebook we could sing
yeah well look it's Angus stock right
you've lost sixty-seven percent of your
money since investing if you bought it
at the initial public offering when they
first one public again the the fad that
is the social network and social gaming
is already starting to wear off and
there's many other examples of social
networks failing miserably Facebook is
no hasn't hasn't gone there yet but my
space myspace was by far the dominant
player who goes to myspace now how about
friendster right who goes there now
another very very popular social network
is Twitter and I happen to like Twitter
but in terms of a business something
that you can monetize make money with I
don't think to be able to do it I think
eventually if they're lucky they'll sell
themselves to a large player like a
Microsoft or something and if I was a
Microsoft or Google I would want to
acquire a Twitter much more than I would
a Facebook simply because Twitter is a
much more precise to the point type of
type of social network worse Facebook
has really become very cluttered these
days as all social networks typically do
to become clutter to become useless and
people just start stop engaging them in
fact that's just a statistic apparently
for a first-time facebook us usage from
the year from the United States has
dropped five percent not sure about that
but I think that's the case so that
gives you an idea of what the trend is
and that's why these stock values are
dropping like crazy because the
investors are starting to pick up on the
fact that these are fats these are not
viable businesses I see the social
networking fag that we're in now it
reminds me of the dot
home bubble glad that we had in the late
1990s very similar very he had a very
hyped up web based companies but didn't
speak about how much money they were
earning they spoke about how much
traffic they got how many hits you yet
well now Facebook talks about you know
how many users they have and how many
times it come to the site they don't
like to talk about too much about how
much profit they're making why because
they don't make any profit it's kind of
the opposite of traditional business you
know I'm a second-generation
entrepreneur and whenever my family are
people I knew went into business didn't
go into business thinking I might start
this business and then we'll figure out
how to make money it's the that's what
you see with these social networks what
we did was try to we saw an opportunity
to make money then we would create a
business around that opportunity you
know that's the whole point of business
in the first place is to generate
revenue the final point I want to make
about social networks is is the nature
of the traffic and the nature of the
traffic is not easily monetizable so
what does that mean it means that it's
hard to make money off of social network
traffic and that's what people are
finding out when you advertise on
Facebook and so on they find that the
users are not very responsive to ads and
that is no surprise to me because really
all facebook is it's just it's just a
giant form all right forms have been
around forever and that's on facebook is
and forms are totally bad for
conversions just out of curiosity it's
related to his subject I popped open and
the archive of the original killer sites
forum now this thing has been offline
for years but it still gets within the
home half now period half an hour period
you're hundreds of
viewers now at the Edit peak you know
every half an hour on average we get a
you know 800,000 people visiting the
site checking out things and for a few
years I tried to monetize this I would
put a banner ads and sales and try to
sell us of my video products etc etc etc
and it was terrible the conversion rates
are so low it was like a fraction of
what they were on the main web sites so
as a result of that I stopped putting
any ads you see it's ad free well this
is the old for if we go to the new form
either see the new form it's just a
standard form nothing to get excited
about that you know quality of form
comes down to the quality of the
information that's it so as you can see
here it's very simple you know and you
see any ads no ads why because ads don't
make any money on forums and social
networks are basically giant forums so
if you're looking at creating a social
network I would suggest and I could be
wrong I don't want a crystal ball but I
would suggest that you consider the
social network as an add-on to another
business that is actually viable use it
as a loss leader as a way to attract
traffic and maybe engage your audience a
little bit but as a business where you
can set it up and then you're going to
make money selling ads good luck you're
gonna have to compete with every website
on the web it sells at space you can
have to compete with the facebooks and
the Twitter's and the Google pluses and
to be able to compete against these big
boys is going to be very difficult and
more importantly you can have so much ad
space out there so much ad space that
the amount of money people are going to
be willing to pay for ads on a website
are going to be far far less
in a few years from now than they are
today that's almost guaranteed why it's
supplied the man you got more websites
with more ad space you're going to be
getting a lot less money for your ad
space so yeah so instead of building a
website to sell ad space perhaps you can
build a website to sell services or to
sell products or something anyway that's
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
