with killer sighs calm killer PHP calm
and you know a few other sites in this
video I want to quickly talk about how
important it is to keep the site looking
busy looking active looking up to date
and we'll give you a couple of tips on
how to best do this
first of all why do you want to keep the
site looking up to date or busy well
think about it if you have a site and
you got some guy coming over to web
coming to visit it and it looks like it
hasn't been updated in a year people are
going to have the less confidence about
the content on your site especially if
you're selling products you know nobody
wants to buy from a store but you know
you're wondering if there's anybody
there if they place an order will you no
will somebody be there to actually take
the order to respond this happened to me
actually so it's important for the sake
of creating a more sticky site sticky
meaning say fat people are willing to
come back to and and they say that
people will have trust in it's important
that you make it seem active seem like
there's actually people behind it now
keeping up to date so I gotta e5 quick
little tips that can help and we'll
start with the simplest first of all
many sites and i'm here on killer sites
here i'm going to scroll down many sites
will have a copyright notice now try to
keep it up to date so if it's 2010 we're
in 2010 when i'm recording this video
you know it should read 2010 and you
know if you are you know assuming that
we were in 2010 now if this was 2008 you
know i came here and was written only
2000 a tour 2009 I'd be wondering if the
set was actually active because you know
shouldn't this be updated right and
actually also goes to the credibility of
the people behind the site if they're
too lazy to update their own copyright
notice you know you wonder you have to
wonder about everything else that they
do
another option that you have is to use
the last updated text somewhere on the
site now we don't have it on killer
sites here simply because we have a lot
of other aspects to this page that give
the impression of activity I'm going to
get to those soon but one other option
you might have right up here or someone
do somewhere very visible could be up on
top of the search here last updated
whatever date you put you can actually
use PHP or java script to cheat and have
a list the latest date but again this is
something that's still usable it helps
to give the impression that the site is
active the people behind the site are
actually there another great way to keep
the impression of an active site is to
use a blog now everybody knows what a
blog is it's a date ordered you know
weblog list of articles it could be
comments about what your company is
doing etc we use killer sites blog to
talk about what we're doing like here
I'm talking about new tips and tricks
collection that we have and it could be
used if you're selling products to talk
about new product updates or whatnot the
point is the blog is date orders you see
right here from your 20th etc no fair 21
februari 20th one on februari teen now
what we've done is we've taken our blog
articles and we stuck them in the home
page here so soon as people get at home
page they see oh yeah I know today he is
februari 20th by voy as i'm recording
this video so people coming to this I
can see that yeah the site is active
look there's a couple of blog entries
for today and you see that there's
regular entries of articles
another way of keeping the impression of
an up-to-date site is to actually update
the look and style of the site we have
to do it more often than others perhaps
because we're in the web design training
business if you will so you know we have
to have a really up-to-date site but you
know if you have a site that has a 1994
look to it you may want to consider
updating it so for instance I'll go to 0
CSS tutorial is one example this is one
of our niche sites you know the CSS the
dedicated site and we just updated
recently after several years and let me
show you what the old one looked like
now this is the old version of the site
and when I design is and he was night
2004 for 2004 this was pretty good but
by today's standards in 2010 it's not so
cool so I decided to update it with
something more modern and to also bring
it into a lockstep that's the right term
with the new cure site's layout as well
so the site read designs are or
additions or changes on a fairly regular
basis does help a lot of course in
creating the impression that there's
actually somebody behind the site and
again it gives confidence in the site as
far as the people visiting your website
are concerned finally there are other
miscellaneous things that you can do to
create an impression of an active site
so what we've done for instance is we've
listed recent forum talked with topics
now we have an active form you may not
have that but we list them so people can
click through and you can see how you
can see stuff that was pasted today
yesterday you know they see that there
is activity on the forums what we've
also done is we've listed here
dynamically our latest subscribers to
our newsletters so you see like right
now recording this at 350 about
and you see we've had in somebody
subscribe to newsletter not 345 and
another guy while Denise I guess a woman
here at 252 so again it gives the
impression that yes there are people
visiting the site the site is active
site is made it up to date so people
come here know that if they decide to
want to purchase one of our videos or
Azure subscription or any of our other
services they'll know that you know
there's people there to support them
they know that they're not throwing
their money at some black hole there you
go i hope you found this tip useful and
my name is steph miss chuck with killer
sighs calm thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
