do is to take a look at some of these
brushes here which are all within the
sub confines of the Healing Brush tool
and The Healing Brush tool is an amazing
tool it's really great to work with and
easy to do but we'll take a look at the
Spot Healing Brush tool patch tool and
he'll even the red eye tool which is not
necessarily the greatest but we'll still
be able to work with that in a future
video but first let's take a look at
what the Spot Healing Brush tool does in
fact what a lot of these healing brushes
are attempting to do is to notice where
my brush is to allow you to get a small
section of an area and it will figure
out what's going on outside of that area
and it'll try to blend all of those
things all together well the first one
that you can work with here is the Spot
Healing Brush tool and if you make it
smaller and notice mine's a little
feathered there you can go to a small
spot like right here and if you wanted
to get rid of this little blemish you
just click on that you can see what it's
doing you can see where it's sort of
painting and then at this point when you
let go wow you can see that it's done a
pretty good job of actually you know
getting rid of that little black sort of
Mole that was there and sort of
replacing it with something else now
it's not going to be perfect in a lot of
situations so you really have to think
about what you're trying to do and how
it's going to try and work out with what
you're attempting to achieve now there's
a couple of other ones that you can work
with the Spot Healing one is fine but if
you wanted to sort of attract or sort of
work with a specific area for example
I'm going to take the patch tool but in
order to prepare for the patch tool what
I'm going to do is to grab the lasso
tool all right now let's say we wanted
to remove this area here in fact why
don't we just zoom in now I'm not going
to go crazy with this because he's got
way too many wrinkles for us to really
work at
sort of work with successfully but let's
say just for examples sake I'm going to
come in here and I'm going to make a
selection around this area now if I
wanted to change this area into
something that looked a little bit more
like this area or this area here you can
work with the patch tool which basically
allows you to get into the selection and
say hey I want this selected area to
look more like and drag it and then let
go and say more like this area so if you
let go at that point and now command D
or control D you can see that we've
gotten rid of the specific area right
there and again I can do the same trick
that I did before file revert and you
can see what it looked like and you see
the simple area right here where there
was that wrinkle and if I press command
D or control D on a PC bang that wrinkle
is gone and it's a real easy way to sort
of get certain areas to work to your
advantage
however you know I mean it's not always
going to be perfect because on certain
areas there's not much you can do for
example if I were to come in here and
just say oh he's a little too wrinkly
right there and then grab this area
right here and sort of put it there well
let's see what happens well it just
really doesn't look very realistic kind
of looks like he's had some extremely
bad plastic surgery or something like
that
and you'll notice there's still wrinkled
area so you might say well what if we
just extended that well you know I mean
especially a person of his age he's
expected to have some wrinkles there and
it's going to look that way so you
should be you know having things look a
little bit more realistic than it does
right here so that's created these areas
that don't really match up so not
something that you should sort of
specify but if you want a small or
slight little change here and there in
certain areas it's a really great way to
work and it's an interesting way to try
and attempt to fix damaged photos among
other things one of the real easy things
that you can do with these healing
selection areas so at this point we're
going to come back in the next video and
I'll attempt to use the traditional
healing brush tool and we'll talk about
how that one works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
