about in the previous video tutorial we
had discussed some of the advantages of
working with CSS and we also discussed
why it was more advantageous for us to
do so than working with the really old
and antiquated means of styling text in
HTML which was to use the font tag and
the font tag was always embedded inside
of the body tag so if I wanted to make
this h1 be read as we saw font and
closing font tag would be inside of the
h1 all right well before we discuss and
talk about how we're going to create CSS
properly and to our best advantage
inside of Dreamweaver one of the things
we have to understand is well why is it
called cascading style sheets and the
reason it is called cascading style
sheets is primarily because there are
many different ways of defining a CSS
style and they have a hierarchical
structure in other words what that means
is one will take precedence over another
and so on and so forth
well as we can see here we've got plain
old default HTML and what we have is a
white background black text on top of it
all right fine we've got a serif style
font and that may or may not be what you
want to see more than likely you want to
change this so there's a couple of
different ways to introduce CSS let me
show you how well first of all we see
that inside the body tag of my HTML
document I could actually introduce CSS
right directly inside of this and what
does that mean exactly well let me show
you what I mean first of all if we go
down in the properties window you'll see
that right now we are getting HTML
information for this particular page
great but I could also switch to CSS
information all right now if I were to
for example just select the word lorem
here the first word and targeted rule
and say listen I want a new inline style
all right well let's discuss what is
inline me
in line is the first way that you can
introduce CSS and it is introduced
usually here in the body section of your
document so for example if I just simply
come in here and say I want this to be
the color red you'll see that in my
preview yes it did turn red and what do
we get in our code well we have our code
littered with information what's not
terribly littered but there is extra
information that technically speaking I
don't really need so what is this this
is just as good or I should say just as
bad as doing it with the font tag it
introduces a span tag which basically
says between here and here in other
words the word lorem and then it
introduces a style style equals color
and in this case the color red with this
hexadecimal number well as you can see
and as you might imagine when I was
discussing the you know inherent
difficulties of working with the font
tag we can see all of those difficulties
exist here as well so the first way that
you can introduce CSS is by using inline
CSS is that a good way to do it wrong
it's a bad way to do it so I'm going to
select and remove those open and close
span tags we don't want that that's not
what we're going to do all right what's
another way that we can introduce CSS
well here if I say targeted rule for
example and I will say new CSS rule okay
and what do we want well I could say
make it the color red and when you do
that it opens up this new CSS rule
window which we're gonna learn about a
little bit more as well well if we were
just to come in here and say tag I want
all my paragraphs to be red okay in
theory this sounds alright I'm just
gonna click OK but notice it says this
document only what does that mean well
this document only means as you can see
here in my code view if I scroll up to
where the head section is here's the
beginning of the head here's the closing
of the head
what did it introduce to us well it
introduced this information here now
it's better than the in-line system that
we had before
or and this is called internal CSS in
other words its internal to this page it
belongs only to this page what does that
mean well it's better than what we saw
before because I don't have to add extra
information in all of my paragraphs
because I have quite a few in here
basically what it's saying if I scroll
through my design you can see that it's
turning all of my paragraphs red and
that's exactly what it does here it
basically indicates look any paragraphs
on this page will be red sounds great
better than the previous version but
still not a great way to work with CSS
why is that because if I had a hundred
pages I would still have to open up each
individual page one at a time
target the head section and the style
tags and come in here and change the
color that's a bit of a pain as I
mentioned last time the best way to deal
with CSS is using the third method which
what we call external CSS in other words
create one external file that will rule
all of my pages right the precious CSS
file so let's go about creating CSS and
creating it properly incidentally
remember what I was telling to
mentioning to you about the three
different ways of introducing CSS we
looked at number one in line which was
in the body section number two internal
which was in the head section and number
three external which is in the external
CSS folder that's the best way to do
that but do remember CSS is called
cascading style sheets because much like
a waterfall cascades down the same thing
happens with the three different ways of
writing CSS inline takes precedence over
internal internal takes precedence over
external so you might be wondering hey
sounds great I mean should I be using
internal and inline to overwrite what's
happening inside of my external CSS you
might think so but you know what there's
still better ways of doing that and we
can do everything in an external fashion
the less extraneous code I have in my
code page
here my HTML page the better
specifically for search engines right it
makes it easier for the search engine to
get to the content that we want them to
index so that's what we need external
still the best way incidentally and of
course if there is no example of
internal excuse me inline internal or
external CSS what does it give you the
default which is what we see here white
background black text on top of it
alright with that said let's now start
by looking at working with external CSS
and we're going to do that when we come
back in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
