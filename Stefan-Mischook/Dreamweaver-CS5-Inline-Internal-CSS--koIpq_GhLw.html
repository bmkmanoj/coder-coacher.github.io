about in the previous video tutorial we
had discussed some of the advantages of
working with CSS and we also discussed
why it was more advantageous for us to
do so than working with the really old
and antiquated means of styling text in
HTML which was to use the font tag and
the font tag was always embedded inside
of the body tag so if I wanted to make
this h1 be read as we saw font and
closing font tag would be inside of the
h1 alright well before we discuss and
talk about how we're going to create CSS
properly and to our best advantage
inside of Dreamweaver one of the things
we have to understand is well why is it
called cascading style sheets and the
reason it is called cascading style
sheets is primarily because there are
many different ways of defining a CSS
style and they have a hierarchical
structure in other words what that means
is one will take precedence over another
and so on and so forth well as we can
see here we've got plain old default
HTML and what we have is a white
background black text on top of it all
right fine we've got a serif style font
and that may or may not be what you want
to see more than likely you want to
change this so there's a couple of
different ways to introduce CSS let me
show you how well first of all we see
that inside the body tag of my HTML
document I could actually introduce CSS
right directly inside of this what does
that mean exactly well let me show you
what I mean first of all if we go down
in the properties window you'll see that
right now we are getting HTML
information for this particular page
great but I could also switch to CSS
information all right now if I were to
for example just select the word lorem
here the first word and targeted rule
and say listen I want a new inline style
all right well let's discuss what is in
line mean
in line is the first way that you can
introduce CSS and it is introduced
usually here in the body section of your
document so for example if I just simply
come in here and say I want this to be
the color red you'll see that in my
preview yes it did turn red and what do
we get in our code well we have our code
littered with information once not
terribly littered but there is extra
information that technically speaking I
don't really need so what is this this
is just as good or i should say just as
bad as doing it with the font tag it
introduces a span tag which basically
says between here and here in other
words the word lorem and then it
introduces a style style equals color
and in this case the color red with this
hexadecimal number well as you can see
and as you might imagine when I was
discussing the you know inherent
difficulties of working with the font
tag we can see all of those difficulties
exists here as well so the first way
that you can introduce CSS is by using
inline CSS is that a good way to do it
wrong it's a bad way to do it so I'm
going to select and remove those open
and close span tags we don't want that
that's not what we're going to do all
right what's another way that we can
introduce CSS well here if I say
targeted rule for example and i will say
new CSS rule okay what do we want well I
could say make it the color red and when
you do that it opens up this new CSS
rule window which we're going to learn
about a little bit more as well well if
we were just to come in here and say tag
I want all my paragraphs to be red okay
in theory this sounds all right I'm just
going to click OK but notice it says
this document only what does that mean
well this document only means as you can
see here in my code view if I scroll up
to where the head section is here's the
beginning of the head here's the closing
of the head what did it introduced to us
well it introduced this information here
now it's better than the inline system
that we had before
or and this is called internal CSS in
other words its internal to this page it
belongs only to this page what does that
mean well it's better than what we saw
before because I don't have to add extra
information in all of my paragraphs
because I have quite a few in here
basically what it's saying if I scroll
through my design you can see that it's
turning all of my paragraphs red and
that's exactly what it does here it
basically indicates look any paragraphs
on this page will be red sounds great
better than the previous version but
still not a great way to work with CSS
why is that because if i had a hundred
pages i would still have to open up each
individual page one at a time target the
head section and the style tags and come
in here and change the color that's a
bit of a pain as i mentioned last time
the best way to deal with CSS is using
the third method which what we call
external CSS in other words create one
external file that will rule all of my
pages right the precious CSS file so
let's go about creating CSS and creating
it properly incidentally remember what I
was telling to mentioning to you about
the three different ways of introducing
CSS we looked at number one in line
which was in the body section number two
internal which was in the head section a
number three external which is in the
external CSS folder that's the best way
to do that but do remember CSS is called
cascading style sheets because much like
a waterfall cascades down the same thing
happens with the three different ways of
writing CSS in line takes precedence
over internal internal takes precedence
over external so you might be wondering
hey sounds great I mean should i be
using internal and in line to overwrite
what's happening inside of my external
CSS you might think so but you know what
there's still better ways of doing that
and we can do everything in external
fashion the less extraneous code I have
in my code page
here my HTML page the better
specifically for search engines right it
makes it easier for the search engine
you get to the content that we want them
to index so that's what we need external
still the best way incidentally and of
course if there is no example of
internal excuse me in line internal or
external CSS what does it give you the
default which is what we see here white
background black text on top of it all
right with that said let's now start by
looking at working with external CSS and
we're going to do that when we come back
