CSS layout what we're going to take a
look at first and foremost is seeing an
example of a fixed pixel layout inside
of a browser window as you can see here
I'm on a Mac and I'm on Safari but this
will show up in any browser whether
you're on a Mac or a PC in the same
fashion my screen resolution happens to
be set to 1024 by 768 you may in fact
have a higher screen resolution if we
believe our statistics and I'll show you
where you can go to check that in just a
second but nevertheless as I mentioned
what we're going to be attempting to
create is a fixed pixel CSS layout and
it's going to contain a header section
so something up at the top it's going to
contain three columns of information you
can see that - these columns are smaller
and the one in the middle is larger to
indicate our main content these columns
on the side could be used for extraneous
information extra stuff or as you can
see you can even put in some links and
stuff inside of there we'll be
discussing how to create these links in
a future video tutorial as well these
links however could have been created as
a horizontal pattern that we could have
introduced inside of our head section
however as we commence we can see that
the three columns that we've created
here will also contain a footer section
and this footer section down at the
bottom you know you don't have to
include that in your particular design
however we will be including it in ours
because it's very often that you may in
fact wish to create something like a
footer in here so that's what we're
going to be doing now you might be
asking what's the difference between a
fixed pixel layout and a liquid layout
well a liquid layout is something that's
a little bit more malleable and when I
mean malleable what I'm trying to say
there is if I were to resize my browser
window as you can see here and as I'm
doing first of all you'll notice that if
I just move it just a little bit
my content my web page is always
automatically set in the center of this
particular screen and that's great for
us that's exactly what we want to be
doing however there are going to be a
couple of differences as well because
you'll notice that when we squeeze this
down what ends up happening is the area
in the website does not move and instead
what happens is we end up with a
scrollbar sorry let me just get back to
where we were in just a second ago and
we end up with a scrollbar that will
allow us to you know scroll between
content now that's not oftentimes the
most desirable effect however do keep in
mind that the screen resolution that I'm
using right here set to 1024 is sort of
like the very basic default the one that
that the smallest portion of your
audience is probably using the vast
majority of your audience probably has a
very larger screen resolution as you
probably do at home as well so by the
time we finished this what you're gonna
be seeing is a centered design centered
website always inside of things and it's
very often rare that you'll have
somebody that's going to be using or
looking at your website you know at this
size or at this size so a fixed pixel
design is oftentimes great for us and it
works really well some of the advantages
if a fixed pixel is that you know your
text is very much fixed on this area and
it doesn't really move in its size so
that sort of avoids having too many
words on a line if you had an extremely
large screen resolution on your computer
and it's one of the drawbacks of a
liquid based design is that you end up
with too many words on a line however in
a fixed pixel based design nothing
really changes everything's really fixed
in this area now in a liquid based
design on the other hand as I sort of
alluded to just a second ago when I
would be
moving my window as you can see here
what would end up happening is the
design would actually squeeze in a
little bit and the text would actually
sort of rewrap itself if that got too
small that wouldn't look very attractive
either they got too big again a little
bit of problematic issue because it it's
not really conducive to good legibility
on your website so you know if you want
to have a little bit more control if you
want to introduce other images that will
work really well it's much easier to do
so inside of a fixed pixel based design
it's easier to design for and it allows
you a little bit more control over how
your text looks however there are a lot
of advantages to a liquid based design
and of course we're going to be looking
at how to do that as well so this is
what we're going to be doing now you
might be wondering as we look at this
pixel a fixed pixel based design you can
tell that the amount of information that
we've included in this website is
fitting within the 1024 by 768 framework
that I'm using here so why am i
addressing the 1028 by 768 well first
and foremost I'm doing so because I'm
recording this video at this size rather
than a larger size however you might
also be wanting to get some information
some statistics about what your audience
is going to be using what's the most
popular screen resolution that they are
in fact using so I'm just going to go to
a website here called market share net
market share and net market share allows
you to see usage share statistics for
internet technologies and as you can see
as of April 2010 I do happen to have
some statistics opened up here on screen
resolutions let's take a look and what
we will encounter is that 24% of our
audience almost 25% of our audience are
still using 10th
twenty-four by 768 the smaller portions
as you can see here account for smaller
than 1024 which again is really only
about like 1% of people are using 800 by
600 and hardly any are using 640 by 480
anymore that's something that we would
see you know in the 1990s a lot more
when monitors were not able to support
larger screen resolutions but now we
don't really worry about that so much so
the base screen resolution that we're
talking about and looking at is 1024 by
768 there are a lot of people who are
using higher than 1024 by 768 let's look
here 800 by 600 it's only 8.2 percent
right and if we were to continue looking
down here you'd probably also be able to
see you know smaller than that and you
know these smaller numbers account for a
lot less than what you would imagine
less than 1% at least so when we think
about your audience a good chunk of your
audience is higher than 1024 so a fixed
pixel design will not have any problems
in that environment
anybody lower than 1024 would incur the
scrollbars but as we saw you know it's
only like you know 2 percent of people
that are lower than 1024 so why do we
target a 1024 audience because 24
percent of people are looking at that
what that means is that's the lowest
common denominator if you had a business
that did you know a million dollars in
sales a month would you want to alienate
24 24 percent of your audience meaning
if I created a website that was larger
than 1024 then 25 percent of our
audience would have to have scroll bars
and that's not something we want to do
so we want to be able to allow 24
percent of our audience and more to be
able to see the entire website so based
on this information when we go about
creating our
fixed pixel design we will be targeting
1024 however do keep this in mind 1024
means the top of my computer screen to
the bottom of my computer screen there's
a lot of junk that gets in the way for
example you know we got stuff on the top
you've got scroll bars here on the side
and other things like that so when we go
about creating our design we're actually
not going to give it 1024 we're gonna
make it a little bit smaller on the
width and that width will be set to
about 960 so when we come back in the
next video we're gonna start doing this
inside a Dreamweaver and we will be
targeting 960 for our 1024 audience and
you've seen where you can go get those
statistics as you continue in your web
design career oh let's check back on
that because perhaps in five years 1024
will be inconsequential and nobody's
really going to be using it anymore
however we'll see how that goes and
we'll continue in this process until
that day arrives so when we start next
video we will be working in Dreamweaver
to create our fixed pixel CSS layout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
