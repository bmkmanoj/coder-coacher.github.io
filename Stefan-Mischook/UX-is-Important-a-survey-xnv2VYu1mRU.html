haven't done for a while though
screencast here so remember I don't know
how many vlogs it was ago I talked about
how you x user experience was the most
important things in software today UX
and so here is a chart and I wish I
remember where I got this this is
something I saw on the web recently or
sent to me I'm not sure so you see in
this chart you see frustrations
experience using enterprise software or
surveys they've done so let's look at
the first few items lack of intuitive
this 71 percent number 2 complexity
sixty-nine percent these are the top
complaints clunky slow interface
sixty-four percent so the top three
items in this list obviously has totally
to deal with you x user experience goes
to what I was speaking of before so we
look at the next item desired features
left out okay that's not really UX
Pacific but let's look at the next one
insufficient training and support now
that tells you you have a piece of
software if you're frustrated that
there's not enough training support that
tells you that the first three items
lack of intuitiveness complexity clunky
slow interface is related to that well
maybe not clunky slow interface but at
least the first two let's look at the
next one on the list too many hoops to
jump through to get it to cooperate
again that's back to you x again user
experience the next point number two
much support needed again thirty-six
percent the next one resource hog okay
that's nothing UX the next one no two
difficult to learn again you Xu Xu Xu Xu
x ah look at this too many bells and
whistles unnecessary features that's a
24-percent you xuxu you X so the rat
not going to do what u X but as you can
see of this list I don't order the 10
items 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 like 12
items 10 of the 12 frustrations
experience in using enterprise software
in court according to a survey directly
have to do with user experience so this
study here reinforces what I mentioned
in the previous vlog the difference
today between successful software and
not successful software is user
experience ux pay attention to it learn
about it and you will be at head of the
game as a developer that is for sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
