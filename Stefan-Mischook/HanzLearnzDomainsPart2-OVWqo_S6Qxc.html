so we're going to go ahead and register
it you also have the option by the way
you could register many different
extensions with your headphone dude calm
so you can register at the same time
headphone dude net org etc with why
would you do that doesn't it custom one
it costs more and some people might want
to do that because they want to walk in
the name but I wouldn't bother because
there's so many extensions now these are
just some of them that you can get
there's no point is it because most
people when most people find a site they
find after the search engines and they
click through to get to the site to
actually click on links very rarely does
somebody actually type in the name
manually so I've are you I would just
get the headphone dude calm and you'll
be go you'll be okay okay let's do it so
off camera we added the domain to the
shopping cart so it says right here one
domain name penning registration so to
register will continue to check out when
you are registering domain name with a
registrar and registrar just a domain
name registration company right you have
to enter in your personal information so
that they can identify you and associate
yourself with the domains or the domain
that you buy so in other words so that
the domain belongs to you exactly it's
just like when you buy a house you have
to put your name on the deed of
ownership I suppose right so what we're
going to do is off camera we're going to
fill this in so that you can take
ownership of this particular domain
great now that the registration form has
been filled in and we're an official
member of the system if you will we have
our options here with regards to the
domain well specifically how long do you
want to register the domain for I don't
know would you suggest I think to begin
with just do a years because you're
going to be paid
nine ten dollars per year it will
automatically renew for you anyway so
you try it out for a year and if it
works well and you got an established
site then you can register for you know
two or three five or ten years but it
makes sense so in terms of certified
domain certification it's not really too
needed and I'm not going to get into
here just leave it uncertified for now
okay all right so then we click Next now
a lot of hosting systems are going to
ask you if you want any of these extra
tip that you have to look through this
yourself generally speaking I just keep
the standard registration I don't go
with private registration or protected
what does private if you don't want
people to know who who is registered
your domain because once you register
domain it's searchable in the web and
we'll see that that you own this domain
if they search it out so you can go off
a private registration where you can
hide that information from the general
public even people can find out who I
really am exactly so if you don't want
if you want to register site and you
don't want people to know who you are
you can use private registration and
that will protect you from being found
out now I don't know how secure that is
if there's court action against you and
stuff I would have wouldn't but I would
imagine that this information would be
released but as far as casual searchers
to find out who owns up your domain they
wouldn't be able to but you have to pay
more for private registration so that
this twelve dollars that means an extra
12 dollars i believe so I believe that's
on top of normal registration fee wow
I've never used it because I have
nothing to hide personally but it's
something to look into right but if you
do add it would it would show up in the
card anyway at the end and you can
always back out of it if it's too much
right so that make sense it does should
not sure what to do but it makes sense I
would just go with standard registration
right and this is what's in cart right
now
okay that's why it's grayed out in cart
and this is so I because we haven't
selected these options as extra features
so we're going to hit next and again i'm
going to ask do you want to add an email
count you want to have web hosting now
if you don't have web hosting you could
add web hosting here and you can have
different levels of whole state now if
you're not sure web hosting is
essentially it's basically renting
server space on a company's servers and
you've done if you've done my HTML
course you know what that is and
essentially you rent server space so
that your website can be placed live on
the Internet registering a domain name
does not include the server space it
does not know so in this killer sites
interface here and a lot of companies
will provide that you have the option of
buying hosting here or not right you
don't have to but it's just an option
for you and also have other options
other products you can we'll ask you if
you want to buy email addresses again
this usually comes with hosting so you
don't really need to do that and if you
want to ask the cell certificate again
that goes into e-commerce stuff again if
you have a basic website you don't need
to do any of these things right now all
right okay so we'll just ignore that for
now we won't select them a hit next now
we've come to this page here because you
are a client is asking if you want to
renew these products you bought before
so we're just ignore that for now a
really good few days left so if you want
these deluxe calendar you don't need to
add
so just go no thanks so don't lose my
websites no right here they're just
asking if you are if you want to
register these other headphone dude
domains dot co net this is what you were
talking about before yes exactly right
so again all we have to do is ignore
that and just continue to check out so
far to register domains ten dollars and
five cents canadian dollars that's what
see is if you were in us would be listed
in u.s. dollar right this is here we in
canada exactly I don't know why we're in
Canada but we are so here you go we can
log in you choose your payment method
and you just place your order and away
you go great once you've ordered your
domain then you have to find hosting for
it you can you could have used the
hosting options here or if you have a
hosting account with some host you could
use that as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
