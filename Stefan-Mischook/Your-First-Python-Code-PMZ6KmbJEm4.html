installed let's play around a little bit
with the Python IDE
it's called IDE but this is an IDE
what's an IDE is short for integrated
development environment and it is an app
that allows you to write Python code
very easily ok so here it is now when
you click on the IDL
linker button or whatever in your
launcher here it launches the Python 3.5
point to show you may have 3.6 you may
have 4.2 shell shell it's just like a
little program that sends commands
directly to the Python app now python is
both a programming language and it's an
app the Python app processes reads and
processes the Python code that you write
remember when you are writing code you
are basically sending commands
instructions to the computer to tell it
what to do now that's why we had to
install Python on our computer so that
we could actually process the Python
code we are writing so write in Python
shell right here we can send direct
commands like we did before we did a
print and we printed hey and it just hit
enter and it comes back and says hey to
us now these three arrows again are
called the prompt they just give you a
spot they're just pointing to where you
start typing code but this is very
limited when you use Python shell to
type in your commands directly it's much
better to have a Python page or a Python
document where you write all your Python
code and then you process it so let's do
that now so we're gonna go to file new
file and here it is we got our new file
and I'm just going to do the same thing
I don't this type in print then rather I
type in
hello nerds see one day we work really
hard we will be nerds now this is a
separate document is untitled right here
right at the top so let's save this file
save as so I'm gonna save it on the
desktop just for sake of simplicity and
we're gonna type in hi dot py y py
because P Y right here py is a Python
file extension just like dot DLC is the
file extension for a word document dot
HTML is the file extension for a HTML
page web page now the extension is
anything in the filename past a period
so I put high and then a period P Y so
py just tells the computer in this case
windows what kind of file this is it's
gonna hit save and it will appear on our
desktop somewhere where are you where
are you py oh here we go I gotta get him
to view here let me just move this over
move this over here it is hi dot p wide
now you notice it's got a little python
logo right here a little sneaky that's
because since we installed well it's two
snakes blue snake here and blue snake
anyway windows knows that this is a
python document because it has dot py
and windows was configured to know this
because we installed the Python app the
ID le app where's MN NOP here it is
Python since we installed Python 3.5
windows knows but when a py file is
that's all so now we can run this
there's two ways to run this we can just
go run and just click on this or we can
press alt F excuse me function f5 so you
press the function key you press f5 on
your keyboard and watch this window
right here this is where you're gonna
see the output should say hello nerds so
we're gonna select this window function
fi
there we go
function f5 hello nerds right and even
tells us C says restarting shell Python
and then it says we're looking in C
users that's my directory stuff on
desktop and it's processing hi dot P why
there you go hello nerds so why would
you want to do it in a separate file
over here versus just typing in print hi
here because when you want to write more
complex commands more complex code it's
trickier to do it right in shell and you
can't save it whereas here we can save
our code so if you want to create an app
in Python you're gonna be writing it in
a separate Python file which is a py
file py file so let's try something else
so we're gonna do many hi nerds write
save function and we're gonna have five
it again f5 there it is not bad let's
say we want to do some some math we can
go print and we can go I don't know two
plus two
we'll see what happens I don't know
what's gonna happen you know we'll see
what happens right I was running like
this Hey look at it did the math for us
can you do other math I think you can do
other math so you can cut and paste save
times we can go 2 times 24 no 22 save
that running again see 2 times 22 is 44
still as you can see here Python allows
us to do math not bad not bad
so for the rest of our demos I think I'm
just going to be doing this we're gonna
be using the IDL e built into Python to
create Python files so we can save our
work and we'll view our code running
with the Python shell open like this
pretty pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
