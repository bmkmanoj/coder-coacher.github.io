question when should you trash your
codeigniter codebase to move into a
Python Django
rewrite or maybe you're gonna rewrite it
in another PHP framework like laravel
something that we recently did so that's
always a tough question because when you
have an existing app that pretty much
works pretty pretty well but it's such a
mess the codebase is such a mess because
of changing frameworks different
programmers different developers have
jumped on here and there
it just happens when you are under
deadlines and so forth the code gets
messy especially when you have a
turnover of new developers it's it's
something that I have always seen in
theory you shouldn't do that but when
you got to get the project out by the
end of the week you start cutting
corners here and there and then as I
said you got multiple developers and you
have a recipe for spaghetti code this
happens so what should you do somebody
asked that question should I dump my
code ignitor spaghetti code app and move
to Python Django well whatever framework
you're gonna move to or language you're
gonna move to when you decide to dump
the old code base the dumping of the
code base should be done only when you
find that the app is so difficult to
update that if you want to add new
features you're getting to the point
where you're so worried that you're just
gonna break things every time you add
new features that I think is a sure time
a sure sign when it's time to rewrite
from scratch and the region you should
be reluctant to rewrite from scratch
because you're gonna introduce new bugs
that being said if you find that so she
would coordinator coordinator is an old
framework and there's been a lot of
advances in MVC frameworks since that
time and so you could leverage for
instance Petri laravel it's far superior
CodeIgniter or perhaps getting to Jiang
or whatever other whatever other modern
framework what you want to look at so
yes that's another reason to upgrade
your old codebase when you see that in a
new MVC framework or a new structure
would provide extra capability
functionality so we recently did that
with studio web where the app is pretty
much bug free but it's a bloody mess
written in cold night originally and
then we added in a laravel base so
micro-services support app if you will
to extend the lifespan of the code
igniter application because the code of
niter arm which is a or b short for
object relational mapping it's basically
a layer of code that accesses the
database in our case was MySQL but
whatever database that you're accessing
the arm allows you to access the
database more easily using the standard
PHP code or whatever language they all
have arm Java Ruby Python PHP c-sharp
you know all these languages have
frameworks that have arms anyhow so the
arm
encode ignitor it was this very old and
but the problem was that Orem was the
heart of the system and so we didn't
want to have to gut the arm in the core
system because most the system was
flying but some some database server
calls or getting way too slow so what we
did is we created a new app a laravel
vase based app which had a much more
advanced more robust faster or and then
we would connect to the database with
that laravel based app and then we would
send we would make calls to the level
based app using a using a micro services
type of framework or design pattern
rather and then we would we were able to
bypass the slow-ass or built into
CodeIgniter and of course we just used
JSON objects to exchange the data from
Valera Bell Basin micro services app to
the old coded better legacy app anyhow
so that's one way to extend your
codebase
to maybe create another another app that
supports the old code base until that
time we decided to pull the trigger and
just dump the old code base because
again when you rewrite from scratch
you're gonna introduce new bugs but if
you're rewriting from scratch because
you can take advantage of new frameworks
new arms because you have a much better
idea what the app is the end app is
supposed to look like now so you can
write it much more cleanly again that
was one of the problems was to do web
the original studio web was conceived of
in this way so I came up with the
concept I sir laid it out and we decided
this way but as we deployed it in more
and more schools and got more and more
feedback from teachers and students we
were modifying the app according to the
needs over the years and it was it
became like a Franken a patch job
because we had to move quick because we
would get requests from schools that we
need this this is not working properly
we have this so we were just deploying
on a need-to-know basis we just had to
get it out get it out get it out and
then finally we stopped patching the
core app we created the micro services
base laravel app started consuming data
from there exchanging data would JSON as
I said but it got to the point that this
were just to do anything
well not did you to do anything there's
a lot of things we could have done and
not disturbed the whole thing but if
there was there's a set of core
functionality that we're going to be
introducing it to studio web for and
going forward and to be able to
introduce those new capabilities to rely
on the old code ignitor app which has
seven year old code base it just didn't
make any sense at this point it was it
was too much so we took that decision to
let it go to seal that up and move on to
a new version just like with Python
since we're on the subject of Python
Python 3 was brand new rewrite it wasn't
an extension of Python 2x it was brand
new because they had to change the
fundamental aspects of the language so
now you have two branches of Python you
got the 2x branch I think there are 2.7
- last time I checked and then you got
the 3x
branch of Python which is at 3.6
30.7 that will be out pretty soon so
they're they're very similar mid
respects but there's some core aspects
of each version of Python that are not
compatible and they had to do it for
whatever reasons they felt they needed
to create a whole new version of Python
as a result of the needs of the language
going forward so think about that with
regards to your app that these are the
considerations but you should consider
that which you should look at when
you're deciding whether or not to draw
up a code base alright I hope that's
helpful and I did this vlog today
because I'm avoiding doing my accounting
paperwork but I'm gonna get the calls
I'm gonna start getting good calls from
the bookkeepers any day now so I gotta
get to it
