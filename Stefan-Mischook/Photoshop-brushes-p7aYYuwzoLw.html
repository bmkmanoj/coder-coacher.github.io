brush tool and you'll notice by
accessing the brush tool right here
you'll see that there are a number of
different options available up at the
top and we'll try to address as many of
them as possible if we click on the
first one you'll see that it is
indicating what the master diameter for
that brush is and as you can see that
indicates what the size of this brush is
it indicates also the hardness of that
brush and what that means is if we're at
a hundred percent they'll see a very
hard edge around this brush and if I can
show you what that does here if I was to
create a stroke you'll see that that
stroke is a very hard edge to it however
if we reduce the hardness let's say here
20 and then I make the same stroke
you'll see the differences between those
two one of them looks a very harsh and
the other one is much more feathery
almost like an airbrush effect as well
you will also notice that modes are
something that will be addressing a
little bit later but once you see the
video on the screen modes you will
recognize that as you draw these that
you can place them in overlay mode or
soft light or any of the other modes
that you're going to be working with as
well so pacity which indicates how much
visibility comes through this how opaque
the thing is how clear it is so we can
give it almost like a ghost like
feathery impression you'll notice that
by clicking on this there's a slider
that you can use or just by going right
on to the word opacity you'll notice
that to set opacity for stroke you can
slide it to swear that way directly
right there so recognize that as I'm
drawing this it's very very opaque it's
only twenty five percent and if I
increase that you'll notice that I can
see what's underneath simply because
we've set the opacity as opposed to this
where we don't see any difference so the
flow is also indicating how much flow
we see on that and you see almost a a
harshness that is sort of brought back
down so here if I have the hard edge
again you'll recognize that the flow is
making things softer
you
and as you can see here you can set to
enable airbrush capabilities and you
know if you've got a stylus that you're
using or some other type of device to
draw with other than a mouse you can
work in that fashion as well also you
can recognize that there are many
different types of brush strokes that
are available some presets and there are
also some other sort of dirty brushes
and as you can see here very small but
perhaps what i can do is make them in
black so you can see them a little bit
better now if you were to stroke with
that you'll see what that looks like as
well you can see there's other ones that
are much more sort of dirty and
aggressive if we stroke them they look
like this but you can also just use them
to sort of create some mess or junk on
the page as well you'll notice that
there are many other ones that do get a
little bit bigger as you can see here
sort of have it look something like that
and if you were to draw with them they
would make a black line like anything
else but you'll notice the edges will be
a little bit rougher and I can come in
here and I can harsh up that edge even
more just working with this and get
creative you know this is the time when
you can have some fun with your imagery
and play around with these elements
remember you can always undo things as
well as you can see here we can access
different colored elements files to take
my foreground color and my background
color and sort of give them a different
look and feel these brushes as you can
see will show you different colors
there we go
so these brushes are really a lot of fun
if you know how to use them properly
there's something else that you can do
by accessing some options over here you
can add calligraphic brushes to your
work as you can see here we can append
them to the end of our file and now that
we have calligraphic brushes you can
create all kinds of brush work and
stroke work so for example if I start
with a new document and come in here you
can spell your name
do whatever you need to do these
calligraphic brushes will allow you to
do that in any different file and
fashion so here we are
you
some other things that we can access our
external files as well you can go online
and you can download all kinds of
photoshop brushes and then all you would
have to do is to load those brushes as
you can see here I've got these faux
finish brushes now in here and they have
different effects to them as well you
can apply those elements here I've got
one going in the opposite directions
notice this creates sort of a different
impression almost as if you're giving a
little faux sort of texture on a
background wall so all of these things
are available through the brushes one
other key element that I want to bring
to your attention is that certainly we
can access brush size here by doing this
you can also right-click and access the
brush size as you can see there another
thing that you might be able to do and
be aware of is that the square bracket
right next to the p on your keyboard
shortcuts the square brackets will allow
you to increase the size or decrease so
the opening square square bracket
reduces the size of your brush the
closing square bracket increases the
size of your brush and as you can see
that's what they look like so that's a
little bit about the brushes inside
Photoshop will see more as we continue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
