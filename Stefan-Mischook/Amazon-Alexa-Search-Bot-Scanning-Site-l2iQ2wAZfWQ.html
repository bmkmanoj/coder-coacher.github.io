checking out the killer sites community
status checking to see how things were
going in terms of the visitor count and
so forth and I noticed that we had a lot
of users come on within a 15 minute
period 620 users online on the forum so
I want to check things out and I noticed
that we have a lot of the same IP hidden
CC 54 254 206 which for 200 250 for 206
so that to me meant either it was a bot
or some sort of hacker so what I did is
I did a search for the IP and you look
down here so the IP from the United
States Amazon Inc so it seems that
Amazon will not it seems Amazon was
hitting the site scanning it hundreds
and hundreds of posts going through it
while thousands tens of thousands of
post on the site and yeah so that's kind
of interesting and we had it we have it
again today I decided to just do this
video now and just today Amazon was
hitting the forum once again so what's
going on here I I'm guessing that Amazon
is sending out its bought for Alexa and
Amazon is just indexing the web which is
pretty interesting I think that for
these systems to work whether it be
Google assistant or Alexa etc they're
gonna have to get a better database of
the web if you will so that they can
serve pulling information so just a
little interesting note I think given
the nature of where the business the IT
business is going with search and
personal assistants assistants and so
forth SEM and SEO are things that you
should not ignore getting traffic
through good old-fashioned search
engines traffic through search engine
marketing and just optimize search
engine pages well optimized sites for
search engines now let me just point
something out the old days of SEO we had
to hire SEO experts to go in there and
jiggle your code so that it was search
engine friendly that that is
of the past you don't need to do that
anymore because modern-day websites are
built all very search engine-friendly
and also the search engines are just far
more sophisticated now so very able to
scan into websites far more effectively
than they could 15 years ago anyhow a
little interesting tidbit here we'll
talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
