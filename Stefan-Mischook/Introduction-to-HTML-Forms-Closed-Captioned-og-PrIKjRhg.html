developers and welcome to yet another
killer sites calm killer video tutorial
as you can see here the subject of
today's exercise is going to be a little
bit of a closer examination at HTML
forms and we've all used HTML forms
before we've seen them a million times
on the web if you've ever had to
purchase something in an online
environment then you've certainly had to
fill in a number of forms and as you can
see here when we're talking about forms
and what we're going to be doing with
them
what we'll be learning is how to create
these text fields like you see here how
to create submit buttons and talk a
little bit more about what they do and
how they work and once you are able to
come in here and enter your information
we'll talk about how these submit
buttons can also send information so in
today's lesson we're going to be taking
a much closer look at the elements of
forms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
