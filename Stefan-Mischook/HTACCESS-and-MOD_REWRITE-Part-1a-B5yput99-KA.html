comm today I'm gonna be talking about
mod rewrite and I happen to cross this
post by W John on the killer sites web
forums and he wants to know how to
change the URLs from an ugly URL for
example index.php question mark action
equals log in to something that's much
cleaner so just slash login similarly he
wants to change admin dot PHP question
mark action equals add user to simply
admin / add user so we're going to be
using a dot htaccess file and mod
rewrite to take care of this and this is
something I've been getting into a
little bit just recently it's something
that I don't know everything about just
yet but I thought it was worth the time
for me to show you at least some of the
basics because this is incredibly
powerful and I'm sure you may be able to
find it useful if you're working with
PHP and dynamic websites before we get
too far along in this screencast I do
want to make one thing clear that
htaccess files are Linux files so they
aren't going to work on your Windows
machine so keep this in mind if you're
running Windows for example if you're
running WAMP
on Windows you will not be able to test
this locally similarly if you're running
Windows hosting for some reason if you a
server itself is running the Windows
operating system unfortunately this
isn't going to work for you however if
you're running a Mac if you're running
Linux or if you have access to a Linux
based server awesome you can follow
along I'm going to switch to my text
editor and the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to create a temporary
PHP file that's going to check if the
mod rewrite module is enabled
so I'm just going to create index dot
PHP and I'm going to do a simple PHP
info statement
like so and let's take a quick glance at
our PHP info file so when I preview it
I'm going to scroll down a little bit
under the configuration section you'll
notice there is a loaded modules item
and you need to look for mod rewrite and
make sure that's enabled if it isn't
enabled it's quite possible that your
host has disabled it for some reason I'd
say that doesn't seem to be that common
I've never run into that sort of
situation but if so you might need to
talk to your host and have them enable
it for you but for the most part you
shouldn't run into this it should be
automatically loaded for you so we know
that mod rewrite is enabled so let's go
ahead and talk a little bit about the
syntax the syntax and how you use mod
rewrite so I'm going to create let me go
back to edit view I'm going to create a
new file I'm going to call it dot
htaccess and I should mention that by
default a file that starts with a period
is a hidden file in Linux based machines
and Mac included so if I go to my finder
and I'm going to open up this folder
you'll notice that the HT access file is
not visible so if this is an issue and
you can't access this file but I would
suggest you do is you create a file that
you call HT access dot txt write your
code in that and then change the file
name after you upload it to the server
to go back to my text editor let's get
started first by talking about the basic
things you need every single time when
you use mod rewrite so you need two
lines to get started the first line
starts at options plus
follow symlinks and then the next line
quite important is we need to turn the
rewrite and then on like so so these two
lines you need to include at the top of
your htaccess file every single time you
want to use mod rewrite you only include
them once so if you have multiple mod
rewrite rules you only include these two
lines once not multiple times so the
first thing I want to cover is a little
bit of basic syntax now that we have
these two lines in place the rewrite
engine is turned on and mod rewrite is
activated let's talk about the syntax so
within dot htaccess files the hash
character indicates a comment so you can
use that to comment each of your rewrite
rules and I would highly suggest you do
sometimes the regular expressions that
you use might be a little bit confusing
if you haven't looked at them for a
while
so I would suggest you comment each of
your mod rewrite lines to indicate
clearly what you're trying to do so to
talk about the syntax a little bit it
looks like this we start with rewrite
rule and then we have a pattern of some
sort followed by a space followed by
what we want the server to substitute
for that pattern and finally any
optional flags which I'll talk about in
a second
so that's what a basic mod rewrite line
looks like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
