about the business rules but the YouTube
Partner Program change can teach you the
first rule you gotta understand is that
business is not fair it's not fair it's
not fair that you have a computer
high-speed Internet and the cameras to
be able to upload create videos to
YouTube there's millions of people who
just don't have the money to afford a
computer if there are millions of people
don't have the laptop they don't have
the cameras there's millions of people
don't have the ability to be able to
speak in front of camera like you do
life is not fair
yes some people are more talented some
people come into this life richer the
reason I'm telling you this is not to
beat down on you because if you have
this idea of fairness in your head then
it's self-defeating what does that mean
that means that if you think that life
is not fair or you think in that way
you're going to make yourself less
capable less able to compete in the
world you have to forget about the
fairness thing it isn't fair
I wish there are certain things I wish I
was born in a super rich family I'll be
amazing I wish a whole bunch of
different things but unfortunately I
don't have that opportunity but of
course I've been gifted with other
advantages as have you the fact that you
can watch this video it's not fair for a
lot of people they can't even watch the
video they don't have the money to buy a
computer so fairness is a self-defeating
feeling it's fake there's an exist in
the real world so you got to try to
forget about this idea of fairness now
I'm not saying we should break the law
we should cheat and stuff no we
shouldn't because then that's not cool
it causes all kinds of problems but at
the end of the day YouTube is a business
it's a competitive landscape lots of
people on there want to sell video ads
and so on
so you got to stop thinking in terms of
fairness if you once you start doing
that you're gonna be much better off the
next business rule that this whole
YouTube thing teaches you is you got to
diversify what is diversify mean it
means you can't be dependent just on
YouTube if you were just dependent on
YouTube for your ads
to add revenue that's that's not good
every business owner will tell you you
have to spread around your opportunity
there's an old expression don't keep all
your eggs in one basket and that
basically means you got to diversify so
you don't want to keep all your video or
your video eggs in the YouTube baskets
you want to make sure that you've got
your video spread around you got to look
at different ways of earning money with
your video content maybe look at
podcasts look at getting sponsorships
etc etc so you can't be so dependent on
YouTube that's not a good thing look
what can happen right you don't own
YouTube YouTube owns YouTube and they
can do whatever they want and that's
because it's their business
you have to diversify so remember that
lesson it's you do it's going to serve
you really well and everything that you
do in life so related to that is you
learn to be flexible you're going to be
ready that in business you know don't
get me wrong you're a content creator
you're in business you're in business of
selling yourself right you just partner
with YouTube and you have to be flexible
you have to be able to adapt to the
situation and it's related to being
diversified in that if you're not just
dependent on YouTube if YouTube does
something that's not hurt you if you
have other avenues of revenue and other
avenues to distribute your video you
still be ok you won't be in a bad place
so whenever I found myself in a
situation where I'm too concentrated or
too dependent on YouTube or I have too
much money in a particular stock or I
have too much investment in a certain
anything I diversify my diversifier
that's why you should have multiple
girlfriends so that you can diversify
just in case you get one gets angry at
you you can move on to the next
girlfriend I'm just joking don't you're
gonna get out I'm just joking about that
the final lesson is that business and
YouTube you have to play the medium and
long term game or as they say play the
long game
what does that mean well the average
youtuber takes about three years to
establish the average establish meaning
they make pretty good money the average
business takes three to five years to
established so you have to
for long game you have to be patient
persistent etc etc etc so if business is
easy everybody would be in business if
you to was easy everybody would be in
YouTube and making lots of money it's
it's it's just a reality of life you
have to play the long game if you're not
willing to spend at least a few years on
it unless you're really lucky you're
probably not going to make it in fact a
lot of people take longer than that
before they get there so you got to play
the long game you got to be diversified
they gotta be flexible and you gotta
stop thinking about being what's fair
was not fair think about what how things
really work and eventually you'll make
it but again don't just depend on
YouTube and play the long game here's a
good thing though this YouTube Partner
change this will in fact benefit you if
you do play that medium game that
long-term gain but I'll talk about that
in another video I hope this video is
helpful I put it out to encourage you to
help you to help you deal with it if
you've been knocked out of the partner
program I know it hurts it ticks you off
but trust me remember these business
lessons take it to heart and keep
working towards your goals calmly
relaxed they Versa fie be flexible and
you'll do well and as I said this
changed the partner program actually it
does benefit YouTube but I think it also
will benefit long term medium term long
term creators who put in the time and a
consistent effort in a way you wouldn't
expect in fact you probably make more
money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
