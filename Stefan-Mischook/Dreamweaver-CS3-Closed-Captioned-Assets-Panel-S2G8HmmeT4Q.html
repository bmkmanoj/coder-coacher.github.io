over the assets panel to give you an
idea of what this is all about and how
you can use it in your own dreamweaver
work
the assets panel of course inside the
files panel group which by default you
should have here on the left-hand side
and what you want to do is you want to
click the assets tab here now the assets
tab gives you a summary of all the
assets all the components of your
websites so for instance here we're
looking at images then you have all the
colors that we've used in the website so
this is basically a list of all the
colors but I've used inside of killer
sites calm quite a few actually it gives
me all the links so if i expand this a
little bit you see all the links here
that are contained within killer sites
calm again quite a few we also look at
any flash objects are floating around
inside the site any shockwave stuff no
shockwave is sort of like flash movies
except they're made with macromedia
director so you're not gonna see this
too often goes director well Dolby
director now because director is not
really used too much these days any
movies again no movies any scripts that
we see we got a bunch of JS files JS
files by the way our files are contained
scripts things like JavaScript any
templates any library items now we'll
get into templates and library items
later on but these are components that
you can insert into your web page but
Dreamweaver uses to make a web page is
easier to manage so let's go back to our
little icon here the images and we can
see the images panel gives us a bunch
information about the image we get the
dimensions the size and kilobytes the
type of image and it is so we have gifts
it's like here we have PNG's and JPEGs
as well so by clicking these buttons at
the top you can reset the order so I
click type resets the order in terms of
the type of image so now we have PNG's
first followed by JPEGs the gifts and I
click it again then we start with gifts
and so on and say what dimensions we can
start with the small
image is 13 by 13 and slowly grow to a
larger images or we can flip it back
when we select an image we see what it
looks like here in the preview and we
can increase the size of preview as well
so this is a good way to scan through
your site would see what images you're
using and then from there you can
actually check to see where exactly
these images are in your website so this
is under full path of course so this
could be a good way to scan through your
site or you could just drag and drop
images onto your web page if you haven't
have a web page here
to finish up this demonstrations of the
assets tab here what I'm going to do is
create a page inside of my dream weaver
subdirectory inside of killer sites calm
so I do that by right-clicking selecting
new file or Apple clicking with fee on
the Macintosh of course and then I'm
just going to put in test dot HTML
because I'm just going to use this a
test also to launch it and our editor
here I just double-click it and we could
see in the editor we have our test page
so what I want to do now is I want to
drag a particular image found inside of
our assets panel this particular
Dreamweaver image is what I drag it onto
our web page so i have to do here
instead of digging for it digging for
this image using the images button here
what would have to start digging and
looking around for which could be pretty
difficult in a larger site all i have to
do is find the image here that is drag
it like so and dreamweaver will it drop
the image in place for me finding a form
a so we'll get into adding images later
but we'll just leave everything blank
for now I'll just hit okay and here's
our image so dreamweaver assets panel
allows you to find various assets in
your site whether it be colors images
links flash movies scripts and so on
allows you to find these things very
easily so that you can easily insert
them and organize them in your site so
this for example I was able to find this
particular image and bring into web page
without having to dig for it through the
usual means of adding an image which in
this case would be using the images
select the image source button here
another thing we can do is use the link
assets I selected it here and I selected
the killer sites i call / sitemap JSP
link and what we can do with the links
asset subsection is actually drag and
drop links on to our main page so let's
say I have an image and I want to create
a link out of this image all i have to
do instead of having to type it all out
as you normally would in the properties
inspector down here where you would
select it and you would put in your link
information all i have to do is go here
into my link assets grab the link and
just drag it over on top of my image and
if you look down here you can see that
we dragged it's actually excuse me
attached this link to its image
automatically again so we don't have to
type in anything the same thing can be
done with text
so I will select these text links over
here and I can just drag and drop it
once again onto my text and i'll set in
my text gets linked without having to
type in any of this link information but
it normally would have to type in here
so that's just a couple of useful
functions inside of the assets panel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
