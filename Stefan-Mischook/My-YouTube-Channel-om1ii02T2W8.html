video for a while so what is the main
theme of my youtube channel so it comes
down to careers code and cash careers
coding cash so I've always looked at
coding as being a means to an end i am
not a coder because code is my religion
although i think it i really enjoy i
like the act of creation with you the
power of creation the act of creation
the ability to to express your ideas
that code gives you trust me i really
like that a lot but my mean go with
coding has been in the end to create
something the code to me and the
frameworks that are used and so far have
always been just tools their tools that
can be replaced in a moment's notice
like this camera i just got this new
camera and a new mic and it replaced
this other camera and other mic which I
thought were great but this one has
certain advantages that the other camera
did not have so it's super happy with
this new camera and the same thing with
coding languages i have written apps
commercially over the years with eight
or nine languages I lose count some of
the languages you heard about java
javascript your city so we're language
you heard of java javascript PHP SQL and
some of the language you never heard of
lingo foxpro visual foxpro i can't think
the others will have to be for a c-sharp
i would jump to different frameworks
different environments different
languages depending on the needs of the
project at one point I was like I'm a
Java guy I would just stick to java and
i would try to put everything into the
java box everybody had to be java but i
realized when i got a little older a
little more experiences you know what
job is great i love java i still have a
you know it's strange to say i still
have a deep affection for java it brings
me back to my 20s right
I've written more Java code than any
other language that's probably part of
it so yeah abscess deep affection for
java no question I find that Java had
its uses but I found other applications
certain apps i would very quickly jump
to some other language some other
environments so i always to say rather
this channel has been always is always
about now practical coding as relates to
business and as i said before I don't
teach here some advanced code and
frameworks because AI get courses that I
teach that and I put up a bunch of
videos here and i got my up-to-date
courses you can get if you like and
videos alone are great but my
interactive chains far greater so why
put an inferior learning environment
here when you can do something better
but anyway there's also a lots of videos
where you can learn how to do X wire and
set so I concentrate on the business end
of coding that's why I decided to call
it careers in code I guess that's what I
call dad youtube channel forget what it
called it now and a business of code
there we go youtube advises creators to
put up a video like this sort of
describing your result date that's a
French word for your reason of being and
that's my eyes on data it's to bring
business and and business decision
making when it comes to code and app
development and as I said in a previous
video and several previous videos the
key to all this stuff is to aid to
master the basics to understand the
basics and then be aware of the
environment which is what the options
are and then when you are developing an
app you have to find solutions to real
problems and i have a video i think i
had them publish it yet actually where I
talk about that the how do you approach
looking at app new apps and app
development and so forth that's pretty
much it I hope you found this vlog
interesting
