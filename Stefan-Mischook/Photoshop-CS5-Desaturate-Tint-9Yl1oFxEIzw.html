going to be looking at are many
different ways of desaturating an image
and what does that actually mean
desaturating an image well technically
speaking if we completely desaturate an
image that image will become a black and
white image now again we can do this in
many different ways there happens to be
a black and white adjustment which I
will be showing you it's a great
addition that came in recently not in
cs5 but I believe in cs4 to photoshop
and that's one way that we can work with
this but notice there's also a
hue/saturation adjustment and there are
other things like vibrants which talks
to you about how vibrant and how
saturated an image happens to be well as
you may have already noticed under the
adjustments there are vibrance
hue/saturation as well and there is the
black and white right here we already
saw color balance in a previous video so
let's take a look at vibrance and see
what it does well first and foremost
I've opened up when women in red jpg and
this is the original one that is very
red we saw that before we applied some
color balance to it if you were working
with that color balance just delete the
adjustment layer that you happen to have
here and we will work with a new one so
as you might notice the vibrance and
saturation sliders here will show you
exactly what I was intending to
illustrate here if I were to completely
desaturate this image we would end up
with an image that is devoid of color
and in fact now just completely black
and white there are other ways that we
can do this as well as you'll see in
just a few minutes so now if I was to
increase the vibrance well it doesn't
really affect anything in this black and
white area but if we were to bring this
back to say our zero amount and you can
even enter that numerically just by
clicking on zero you would see that the
vibrance is really adding some life to
that color if I was to take the vibrance
to minus
100 see everything is very flat and not
really jumping out any of those colors
whatsoever so we certainly still could
reduce the amount of red that's in this
and I'd probably do that with the color
balance but as you may notice right the
vibrance is also determining how bright
or vibrant those colors happen to be all
right well i'm just going to trash this
particular adjustment layer and let's
take a look at hue and saturation now
notice this here we have a number of
things that are at our disposal number
one there is the hue which determines
what colors you're going to be working
with and if we were to just randomly
move that through you would see that you
know depending on what we're using here
that's going to determine what kind of
effect your image is going to have its
not really exactly what I want to be
working with so I'm just going to leave
this out its original 0 so that we have
the original hue that this was in and
you'll notice the complementary colors
on the other edges of that if we
desaturate the image here again complete
desaturation means a black and white
image and also notice that there are
other elements that we can play with
here as well so if I put this back to
zero lightness determines it's sort of
like a brightness contrast thing except
it's really just adding more white or
more dark to this so it's a brighter
lighter image brightness contrast still
better to work with if you want to
control those individually notice also
that hue/saturation has been around
longer than the new black and white
feature which I'll show you in a second
and there used to be a means of
colorizing your work just by clicking on
this little color eyes here well you can
see that this is sort of a means of
creating like a do tone effect on your
image where you're really only using one
color and blacks and whites and that
particular color can be changed just by
clicking on the different hues so if you
wanted it more of a yellowish hue or
greenish hue or something along those
lines all you would need to do is to
click in the
areas are slide I should say in these
areas now that's great really nice work
and is a wonderful way to produce your
images however i'm going to delete that
and i want to introduce you to the black
and white one as well and in the black
and white one well take a look first
thing that happens is well your object
becomes lo and behold black and white
makes sense given what we're trying to
do with this particular file here now
notice there's a couple of options here
click and drag an image in the image to
modify a slider this is a little feature
that allows you to you know click and
drag here with the amount of Reds that
we want to be using or if I was
affecting the yellow and clicking and
dragging we could do that as well coming
in here just by doing something like
that but I'm going to go through command
Z and I'm going to press command alt or
option Z to get us back to where we were
now it's not the slider that I'm really
interested in what I wanted to show you
was the tinting ability and as you can
see whatever color you happen to have
here that's what is going to be the tint
color so that's automatically worked out
here for you now certainly if you wanted
more yellows you could come in there and
apply more yellows or do anything that
you wish I'm just going to step back
again hit the tint so by default you
have this beautiful little sepia tint as
you can see here and that's really
wonderful but if you wanted a different
color just click on this area here and
you could come in there and you can
apply more rich or you know more leaning
towards the black and whites or
something like that or if you wanted
something to be a bluish tone or
something along those lines well that's
easily done just by coming in here
clicking on these colors so those are
three really good adjustments at working
with black and whites or working with
elements that you wanted to use so that
you could tint your particular photo in
any fashion you wish</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
