show you how to quickly link from one
page to the other by using dreamweaver
cs4 s WYSIWYG or what you see what you
get clicking point tools it's quite
useful so I have a basic site here just
an index page so let's create a new page
and you know i'm going to go well i'm
just going to right-click i'm going to
go new file i'm going to call it a belt
this would be the about us web page so
i'm just going to go on to the about
page and if you're familiar with
dreamweaver just code view so i'm just
going to go into design view i'm going
to say about us very simple change the
title to about us too and you see we
have stars that means we have to save
something to control save or just going
to go file save so we say that page so
now i'm going to go into the index file
i was going to call it home for now
Molly LMS a killer staff and okay it's
no good killer sites alright so we're
gonna say a menu you know i'm not trying
to demo how to create a beautiful
looking site here I hope that's clear
this is just to show you some tools
within Dreamweaver just as a series of
quick videos that's all and say that so
what I want to show you is this
properties bar down here at the bottom
of the screen so let me just put this
into can't review for you guys here you
go so what I want to do is I want to
create a link hyperlink from about this
excuse me from this index page index
here to this page so there's many ways
to do this and remember but the easiest
way is to use this properties bar at the
bottom here now you have you can collect
these main buttons here are changes
things are going on here so this CSS
button allows you to more control about
controlling CSS and the page yeah and
in this button here the HTML button
allows you to do some basic HTML stuff
so let's first create a link so we're
going to hit the about and I just
selected it you see the wheel here point
to a file so you go like this you point
to file it will highlight a box so this
point to this file about there you go
now you see it turns into link right
under lines and then we add a little
star which tells us we should say this
page they go file save and very go
that's how you can easily create links
with a dreamweaver cs3 well let's create
another link we're going to create a new
page we're going to call it products so
we need we actually need a page here so
you know what's a greater page here I'm
going to shut this HTML page for now so
I'm going to save this control save I
know that because you go to the file
menu you seek as ctrl + save now Mac it
it's probably Apple + s so keep that in
mind so we're just going to close that
and i want to show you how to create a
new page a different way so we're going
to create new now this page is not open
this welcome screen you go file it sees
we edit preferences let me show you
something go edit preferences you see
this ctrl + you that tells you what the
keyboard shortcut is so i'm just going
to use the keyboards when it will
control you see when you start using
keyboard shortcuts to operate your
program people think you're really cool
and actually they're much quicker so
what you want to do is you want to on
the category here we won't hit make sure
we got general selected anyone hit
document options you want to select show
welcome screen that's the key wanna make
sure that's checked off this won't
change the next time you launch
dreamweaver low-salt if you don't see it
now just click that on relaunch and you
should be okay so i'm going to go cancel
that so we have this welcome scram and
hit HTML because there you go we created
a page so i'm just going to call this
the products
page so I'm going to go products or a
title and I'll click ctrl s or save now
drooler pops open the save ass box i'm
going to say call it products please
products and it's going to save it as
type you know these are all the types
you can save it as it's quite a few but
if you just leave it as products
probably going to default to dot HTML so
let's see what happens save here we go
you see look over here products on HTML
so I just showed you another way to save
and create documents in Dreamweaver so
let's go back to the homepage which is
the index page select it again and we
can actually create links by just typing
into the into this box here what the
name of the pages we want to link to
something to say your products dot HTML
and then just hit enter and a link it
has created you see dreamweaver provides
many of the times many different ways to
do the same thing and really just just
depends on how you like to work so there
you go we've created links in
dreamweaver to showed you a couple of
different ways to create pages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
