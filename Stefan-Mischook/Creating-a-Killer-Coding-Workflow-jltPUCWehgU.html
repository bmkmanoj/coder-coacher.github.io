workflow is essentially just the steps
that you take to get a job done
you can have a coding workflow you can
have a vlogging workflow you can have an
exercise workflow and establishing a
workflow is very very important in terms
of your output in terms of your
productivity it's one of the most
important things you can do now here's
the thing though the trap that I get
stuck in I get stuck in these traps of
always trying to modify and streamline
the workflow and what happens you become
a workflow modifier and not somebody who
gets the job done that said you still
have to try to improve your workflow so
let's talk about coding a workflow could
be how you process your coal let's say
you're writing Java for instance how
often do you compile which compiler to
use which JVM do you use if they use
multiple JVM these days which code
editor you use how often do you do do
you run the code to see if it works how
often do you compile how do you deploy
with deploy with methodology and so on
now I'm just coming up with some things
off the top of my head in terms of my
own experiences but you have to sort of
adapt that as well now the thing is if
you keep on tinkering with different
code editors or different IDE s ideas
short for integrated development
environment if you keep tinkering with
all these gadgets and all these
processes you're gonna get caught up in
all this thing and it could be pretty
bad spiral to be in and trust me I've
been there since I have a bit of a seedy
AC obsessive-compulsive disorder
whatever I caught up in all this stuff
lately I've been getting caught up with
cameras although I've gotten much better
at it so I research a researcher
research trying to figure out which
camera is best given my needs and a lot
of times you're wasting your time but I
have to tell you I just made a decision
on this camera here
and it is saving me a huge you at a time
saving with this mic here it's saving me
a huge and latter time I got everything
set up and now my compulsive tendencies
would want me to do even more to tweak
even more to see if I can get something
a little bit better here a little bit
better mic or maybe a different
positioning or maybe a different lens
but at the end of the day I have a head
set up and now I have a set up now
sounds pretty good
requires no effort in fact with the new
sound setup I don't have to process the
sound anymore the lens is very good we
get pretty good picture good framing the
cameras Graco's got that crazy dual
pixel autofocus so it makes it easier
I'm always in focus of always in focus
this seems like a minimal thing to you
if you haven't done any solo vlogging
but my other camera which is an
excellent camera first of all I can't
see myself because it doesn't have a
flip screen and the autofocus is not
even close to as good as this particular
camera this is a Canon a TD so that are
amazing autofocus capabilities so now I
have in terms of my vlogging I have this
amazing workflow sound this is great the
the framing is great the video quality
is great so now instead of taking me 2
to 3 minutes to set up a shot to vlog it
takes me literally 20 seconds
not even so if super quick saves me a
lot of time so now I gotta go that's it
it works great let's get the content out
because my job here is not to come up
with the best camera setup for vlogging
my job here is to vlog and to put out
material to put out the content same
thing when you write a code right you
don't want to get caught up in the
processes trying to create the perfect
ideal process yes you should look into
that a bit but you should really
concentrate on putting out the best code
that you could put out so yeah this is
advice for people who maybe like me who
have that problem or you get obsessed in
the process and
not obsessed in the results so try to be
obsessed in getting the result because
most of the time your tweaks to your
tools your tweaks to your process will
only marginally improve your results
sometimes that huger's difference it's
like this camera setup what I have here
is haveyou difference in terms of how
easy it is for me to put out material
but most of the time it doesn't so I'm
here with my camera now I have no
intentions of upgrading this camera for
at least a year maybe two years
including the sound there's a sounds
great and I'm very happy about that
because it just drives me nuts trying to
tweak all these things and that's pretty
much it we'll see you in the next vlog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
