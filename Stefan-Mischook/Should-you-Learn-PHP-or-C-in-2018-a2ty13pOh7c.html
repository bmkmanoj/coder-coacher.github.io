vlog my name is Steph in this video I'm
going to talk about PHP vs. C++ now for
some of you out there you probably know
the answer to this discussion about the
two programming languages but I'm
putting this out because some people may
be searching for that particular answer
because they're noobs they don't know so
I want to make the information as
accessible as possible for everybody
concerned ok so let's get into it
HP versus C++ which language should I
choose number one principle I always
talk about is that the language for the
most part doesn't matter you don't want
to learn languages like Perl or
ActionScript which nobody uses anymore
but all the actively used languages C++
Java Script Java PHP Python c-sharp and
there are several others there's jobs in
all of them and the number one thing
that you got to consider when you're
choosing a programming language is not
so much the market although you should
check to see what your local market is
all about meaning if you live in New
York City check to see what people are
doing New York City if you live in Hong
Kong check to see what people are doing
in Hong Kong in terms of programming see
where the demand is you may find that in
Hong Kong there's a whole bunch of work
for PHP developers but you may find in
New York City but there's no work for
PHP developers there might be a whole
bunch of work for C++ guys or JavaScript
guys or Java guys you get where I'm
going right so first thing you got to do
is check the local market ladder if it's
the first but what are two top things
check the market see what's available
and number two you got to look at the
type of programming that you want to do
C++ programming is a very low-level
language meaning you're you have total
control over the software that you're
writing but it requires a lot more work
a lot more detailed effort to get out
some sort of working application the
upside would be C++ so it runs
superfast is very performant so people
build gaming engines and the build
little apps a little programs to riding
the small devices that don't have much
power because C++ is just very very
efficient you can write very efficient
code that power and efficiency that you
get with C++ though comes at the cost of
complexity and the amount of effort it
takes to get anything else out you have
to build from scratch almost whereas
although they do have libraries and so
on but compared to higher-level
languages like PHP Java a c-sharp Ruby
Python JavaScript these languages
are not they don't run nearly as quickly
as C++ but they require much less code
to get anything done and that's the cost
of that so you have a lot less code to
write but the cost of speed at runtime
meaning when your program your code is
actually running it runs much slower
so when you really have PHP for to C++
you got to first look at your local
market and number two you got to look at
the kind of work that you're doing now
that's why I mentioned about the speed
and what kind of you know I'm talking
about you know detailed work with C++
whereas with PHP it's very high level
now PHP is pretty easy one to discuss
versus say Python why because PHP is a
very specific language in that it's only
used for the most part to create web
apps with whereas Python you can do all
kinds of different things with it but
when it comes to building web apps PHP
is king it's so easy to get up and
running with PHP and it's been designed
for the web from the get-go so to get
web apps going and PHP is just really
easy and there's a huge demand for PHP
especially for the freelancing world now
again people watch my vlogs you know
that overall I don't have any favorite
language generally speaking it depends
on the type of work that you do in my
own career as a software developer I was
writing apps in many different languages
depending on the needs of the particular
job when I was younger immature or only
a few years experience under my belt I
was going there say I'm in this type of
I'm like I'm a Java programmer that's
everything is Java it's kind of like
that that old expression yeah if you if
you have a hammer everything is a nail I
saw something like that you get the idea
the point is you gotta got to get away
from that you got to get away from the
the idea that you are this PHP
programmer or your C++ programmer or
your Java programmer no you are a
programmer who uses the language based
on particular needs of the job you're
not going to be using C++ to write web
apps because although it could do a
fantastic job but the amount of work
would require be crazy you much better
off to build your web apps with PHP on
the flip side you're not going to be
writing using PHP code to create AI you
could I've seen actual people implement
a machine learning algorithms with PHP
but why would you do that when you have
languages that are better suited towards
that C++ in a big time path Python and
the goal language
anyhow so here so we are here to talk
about PHP versus C++ again consider the
local market demands to think about the
type of programming we want to do PHP
you're doing web apps you're doing maybe
WordPress customizations and that's what
you're doing very lucrative it's a very
visual type of programming relatively
speaking a little bit of code gets a lot
done
whereas with C++ you do whatever you
want to it but you're you're using C++
to build gaming engines writing code for
small devices that need that super
refined and ultra performant software so
there you go this is consistent now for
years so I'm recording this in late
November 2017 but this is a it's going
to be applicable for 2018 that's why I'm
calling it PHP versus C++ and 2018 and
yeah because 2018 is just around the
corner
I'll hope you find this video useful
I've actually written a piece I've
written an article I linked to a right
under this video you can read it it's a
kind of a covers pretty much the same
thing but maybe a slightly more
organized take because it's written
where it
you can edit it and so on alright that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
