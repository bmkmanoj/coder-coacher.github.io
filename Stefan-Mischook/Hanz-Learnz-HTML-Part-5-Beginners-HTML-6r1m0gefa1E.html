what we're going to do now is we're
going to make this page look like a real
page so for instance i'm just going to
paste in a real paragraph of text and
I'm split format it so it's a little bit
easier on the eyes you know what I'm
going to go view no we're wrapping there
we go format word right now your wrap
yeah so this way we're going to see
what's going on and so we have our main
title let's say I saywhat the rap does
you see everything on the onion screen
doesn't go off the screen yeah now this
is not going to affect the way it looks
in the browser we're just doing here so
it's this easier to code right this is
the main title this is the subtitle so
with that now let's learn to type first
we're going to add another header h4 so
this should be smaller than h3 yes
exactly alright so my grocery list of
groceries which reminds me I've got the
dewitt groceries me too actually so now
we're going to learn something called
the list tag its list in HTML how to
create lists now there's two types of
lists in HTML there's the ordered list
ordered list 0 l ok let's see it's
pretty obvious now let's just close it
up the forest lunch now this is a new
type of type because you got the opening
and closing right but you also have
subtags sub tanks yeah so these tags
exists only within me list tags you
can't have these tags outside of it was
tags so this takes needs to be in the
listings exactly and the Li tag is short
for list item right it's like a cyborg
you know the the flesh can live with
that the robotic part and vice versa so
what's
think of what would be some items on
your gorillas let's see I mother of
apples myself those you know the
Macintosh I'm just going to copy and
paste because copy and paste is what you
want to do when you're coding because it
provides mistakes okays you're copying
exactly the same thing let's say I need
some bananas yeah mother but now you
know when they get black and they're not
good anymore so then you've got to buy
fresh bananas let's see what else i need
some oranges kind of out of season but
they still like them what else I wanted
to make some french fries that I know
that's not right you know it's fattening
but potatoes exactly I personally like
watermelon that everyone does it's too
big I like I don't know what else is
that they're the fruits i would an onion
Oh summer fruit I like cherries yeah
that's right to our as to us and
cherries I think I don't know the asking
an Austrian so I'm going to save this
right so I've got the grocery list here
you're going to groceries don't see what
the HTML does to present everything
we've just done here right I'm going to
launch it this way all right put the
number in front so let's take a look at
the code view source but we didn't put
any numbers in there now we didn't but
hTML is smart enough to put numbers for
us why that's because the programmers
the guys who created HTML made it that
way ok again HTML is not only providing
formatting for us sort of organizing
things on the page that's actually
providing a logical meaning right where
we know now that this is an ordered list
it has order right one two three four
five nicely or demeaning the numbers
yeah and
and if I just puts them in water you
have you just actually I want to get out
of this just edit the code this is
fantastic so let's say we move charities
from the bottom put it in the second
position all right I'll say that now
it's in second position that sets these
potatoes are way on the other side so
now you got the cherries at the bottom
here so let's refresh where we had put
in a second position I'm cherries number
five it's number till because you moved
it up exactly so the position of the
list item in your list will dictate what
number you see beside it and this is
because it ordered ordered list exactly
it has order so let's actually learn a
new list type yeah there are the types
of lists yeah there's actually two other
types but the one these are the two
types are used all the time list of
groceries too and this is the only
difference you place the oh were you
what does that stand for I'm ordered
this island ordered list so save that
they get messy list exactly see again
we're getting that the process cannot
access a file because it's being used by
another process are going to go okay
let's cancel that I just going to go
back into the eve unselect that and some
weird behavior in windows seven cents i
just save it and we can just refresh
this again this time it it looked it put
bullets exactly because the unordered
list by default has no order so the
browser just adds bullets I get it all
this time I've been going in the web and
this is what it is that's all it is this
is amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
