the eighth video in a series to set up a
very simple paypal shopping cart so far
we've got the beginnings of a shopping
cart object it's can add an item we can
get items from it we can get item
quantity from it we can empty our cart
and we've also created a couple of
interesting little templates and we've
got two pages for our shopping cart
we've got an index page and we've got an
add to cart page and what we're going to
do in this video is we're going to
create the amount in our order form
we're also going to put in the unit cost
and we're going to flush out the rest of
that shopping cart class so let's get
started just like we have a quantity
here i also want to get the I the item
amount it's going to do something like
for each get xml catalog as product and
if product ID is equal to product ID and
this is from the the node in the xml
collection then we want to basically
have the amount equal the product price
right and that's the cost of the item
now I'm going to wrap this up into a
function we're going to call this get
item cost and I'm going to take this i'm
just going to paste that in there now
you're noticing that there's a function
inside of a function but don't worry
we'll pull that out and we'll just put
that here whoops and what we'll do is
we'll actually return the product price
and if we don't we're going to do
something we're going to throw an
exception and an exception is basically
a way of saying hey something went wrong
with the program we couldn't find
something or the item wasn't found or
there was an issue so I'm just going to
say throw new exception so an exception
object is
object that comes you know this is just
like new shopping cart but new exception
but exception is part of the PHP 5.2
language so it's an object that has been
written into the PHP language and I'm
just going to say item not found and I'm
going to put in the product ID so oh and
the last thing we're going to do is
we're going to ask for the product ID
here now oh we need a semicolon so
either what's going to happen is we're
going to find this product and then
we're going to return the price and if
we don't find the product then we're
just going to throw an exception and
that way we're going to know something
bad happened now I'm going to cut this
out and I'm going to stick it in my
functions file so we're starting to get
these neat little functions that really
describe what we're doing we have get
xml catalogue get shopping cart set
shopping cart product exists which
returns true or false get item cost and
we've got this shopping cart object
which has its own set of that functions
that are specific to the shopping cart
so add item get items get item quantity
and empty cart now that we have that we
can go back to our add to cart page and
we can say that the amount is equal to
get item cost product ID now I'm just
going to add a dollar sign here and if i
refresh that you're going to see that
the amount is a dollar 33 now that
doesn't quite look right if you ask me
because we should be counting how many
times you've gotten tomato soup right so
this is why maybe it does make sense for
us to rather than just get the item cost
we also want to maybe we let's call this
the unit cost instead and what we'll do
is we'll get the amount from the
shopping cart
and because the shopping cart knows how
many items we've got of or the quantity
of each item it will be in a better
position to tell us how much this
actually costs so i'm going to say get
item cost and i'm going to pass in the
same product ID so this is a little
confusing but basically we've got the
unit cost which is for one item and
we're going to need that for our paypal
shopping cart because paypal wants to
know how much each individual item costs
and it'll do its own math and then we
have the amount that we want to show to
our actual users so let's create a
function here called get item cost pass
in the product ID again my product ID is
really important as you can see because
it basically ties everything together
it's a unique identifier and so this is
going to look a little strange but we're
basically going to take the cost as a
string and we're going to do get item
cost and we're going to pass in the
product ID then we have to convert it
into a float now a float is basically a
decimal point number that we can do math
with and i'm going to say cost float
equals and this is going to look a
little funny but basically we take the
cost as a string law as a string
variable and then we add nothing to it
so now PHP knows that this is a number
that we can do math with as opposed to
just a string and then we're going to
return costs float x we're going to do
int val and now what int valve does is
it basically takes whatever we've got
whatever number or anything and make
sure that it's an integer because we
don't want to have it multiplying a
float with something that isn't even an
integer you know and then we'd get some
funny math there and so will say this
items and then we'll pass in the
tidy and in fact looking at this we can
we can do a little better so I'm going
to say this get item quantity product ID
so what's going on here is actually we
can do a little better than that we can
just say cost float x get item quantity
and over here I'm going to put in the in
Val so whenever I call get item quantity
it's going to return as an integer and
over here and basically saying cost
float x get item quantity and that's the
item cost so if i refresh that now this
is starting to look a little more
logical we've got tomato soup we've got
the quantity and we have got the total
amount</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
