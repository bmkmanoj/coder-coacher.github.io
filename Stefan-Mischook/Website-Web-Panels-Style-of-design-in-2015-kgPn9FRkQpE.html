killer sights calm and a whole bunch of
other sights
so some of you know that I've been
writing a book recently well I just
finished writing it for publisher and
the book should be out in stores in
April 2015 salt Oh anyhow in the process
of writing a book it's a book on HTML
CSS html5 css3 and some JavaScript it's
a beginners book on KO is very cold
centric though I was getting too bit
into bootstrapping jQuery because
they're such important frameworks today
anyway in the process of writing a book
I was forced to really review modern day
web design as you you may know I've been
building websites since 1994 and every
few years things change the technology
advances and so forth and to be totally
honest you honest with you in the mid
2000s I I kept my hands a little bit
into the whole web development arena but
you know after so many years I got a bit
bored birthed out left it I came back a
few years ago but nonetheless I in
writing a book when I discovered that
there was a few things where I was still
a little bit behind on in terms of
especially modern-day web design what I
found interesting was that being away
from it in terms of really not paying
attention to trends and so forth I sort
of lost sight about what was cutting
edge design what was modern design
versus what wasn't it's kind of weird
you know a couple of my assistants would
tell me staff you know we should be
updating killer PHP get with science
because the look is a little dated and I
look at is not so dated but then after I
wrote the book well writing getting
integrated a book where I was really
forced to really look at things closely
it became painfully obvious to me that
we had entered a new cycle in terms of
the design aesthetic of modern websites
so I call it a panel based designed as
and panels on the side of a wall perhaps
so I'm gonna take a look now we're going
to look at a whole bunch of sites or a
compare old-style but you still see a
lot of even in prominent sites versus a
new panel based layouts which much more
open and much easier to navigate in my
opinion and so take a look at that I
think you'll find it interesting
let's do it alright let's take a look at
a bunch of sites one bunch we'll take a
look at a few sites just to get a view
of modern web design so this is the
Android site notice the big panels big
panels this is what I'm talking about
what I'm talking about panel based
design another thing about this design
is that it it's responsive it flexes and
resizes itself for the device that's
sort of device that's viewing it or you
know more precisely the screen size or
the browser window size this is a common
a hamburger stack here this read these
three lines here that's a common menu
style these days you see it in the
browsers right this is Firefox it has it
here if you look at web mentor my
subscription-based service again same
type of thing responsive design it
reflows automatically into a form of
screen size the browser window size our
gaming at the hamburger menu style thing
that's all done with bootstrap by the
way which is a framework for building
websites for building responsive
websites the responsive websites again
and websites that resize automatically
now that being said some very prominent
sites such as the New York Times for
whatever reasons is not responsive look
at it does not resize to fit now this is
less of an issue of ease days especially
when you're using modern smartphones
wellö perfectly fine New York Times will
know perfectly fine in any modern
smartphone
although you know
what mentor will live much more much
more effectively because it actually all
the pictures changing everything so just
to give you a feel this is very modern
design rate 2015 as is the Android site
they got a nice little parallax effect
here going here let's try uh I don't
know what about Apple site Apple that's
yeah so there's no scrolling here let's
just go to the store so they're doing it
again the big panels big panels right
horizontal panels what's interesting I
don't know this is responsive it's
somewhat response to see it's resizing
the images a little bit but then it says
that's it we're not going anymore so
it's it's it's interesting design
decision Apple made to be responsive but
going to shrink a little bit like they
don't even shrink this topic images for
some reason or the menu again they
probably count on the fact that most
smartphones will be able to display this
quite fine so let's compare these panel
styled layouts we see here verse is
old-school web design here it is killer
size calm that killer size calm this
layout was designed i guess about four
years ago maybe 2011 I'm not sure it
could be longer it could be a year
shorter I'm not sure but nonetheless
it's old-school design it was cutting
edge units day and you see it too does
not resize it's not responsive it's kind
of like apples say you know Apple site
does not resize itself as well even at
this this is the max yeah it will shrink
by missile perhaps in here OC even those
images are not shrinking so I don't know
it's Apple is one of the sites that
people look to in terms of design cues
but I still think that a responsive
design like this that resizes the images
and so on so forth is a
style although it's not perfect this car
is not resizing very well anyway so
there you go
old-school design style one killer PHP
same thing we're about to well actually
are now we're maurice revamping
restyling oh the old a killer site so if
we look for in CSS tutorial it was more
it's a little closer perhaps to the
panel based design that we see these
days I got kind of sort of but you could
see hopefully you can start to see the
difference between old-school layout
versus new style this is kind of a
hybrid if you will again it was made a
little bit after the current killer
sites layout for instance so anyway so I
hopefully by you seeing various websites
start to see the difference between
old-school sites and new sites and yeah
there's one thing about all these new
sites is that huge images right web
mentor we have one big huge image that
we use here so there you go I hope
that's informative there's a kind of a
buggy thing so I hope that's informative
I hope you can see the difference
between Gustave sites results old
styled sites and we'll be addressing
this more and more and more with the new
courses that are coming out soon
