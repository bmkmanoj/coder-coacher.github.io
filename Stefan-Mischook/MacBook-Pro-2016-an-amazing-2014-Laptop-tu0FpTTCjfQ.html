old macbook retina 2012 retina display
very good computer an amazing laptop
before its time but it's not so amazing
for today so we have the new max have
been announced where they have their LED
strip here at the top or their old LED
strip at the top touch screen here and
they said you have the touch screen here
at the top of the keyboard because this
is so much more convenient than having a
touchscreen so in 2016 the macbook pros
don't have a touchscreen like so many
modern laptops to do today just about
all of them anyway and so they're saying
the reason that they have the OLED
display here the strip of the top of the
screen because this is convenient but
reaching up here right here to a touch
screen where you might have some
controls that's too inconvenient so
right here is cool because you can you
know press play stop you might be able
to have a little interface it's about
this wide here I don't know how much
space you're going to have here to be
able to do much but this is convenient
you know yeah this i can go boom I can
do this I can do that but to go here
that's whoa whoa that's way way too much
work to be able to lift your fingers
here and to touch a screen or you're
going to go like this yeah that's Apple
Apple is doing what they did in the 90s
they're resting on their laurels if you
look at what Microsoft presented today
before it's no competition the apple
macbook pro is an ice machine it's
pretty good for today it would be
amazing for 34 years ago but the fact
that they don't have touchscreen is very
disappointing to me because when you do
get a computer for touchscreen it's an
amazing thing to have good as you're
doing work you're typing your grab and
boom you touch around like here I know
apple says this is too hard to uh oh I
got here I can I can I can touch the
OLED display here I can't
here oh no no it's just too hard it's
just too hard too bad they didn't make
it a touch screen where you can add
custom interfaces here for for example
where you can add some real room to do
some real stuff but anyway that being
said because they still need to have a
Mac because of the type of work i do I
do Mac on I do work on Mac and on
windows I will be getting it but I have
to say a little touch panel strip thing
I don't think it's going to do much for
me could be wrong but I'm a little
disappointed bye bye hey guys I just
want to make a final quick comments
about the new mac book pro computers of
2016 models now one problem that I have
a fit besides the fact that it should be
touchscreen is the fact that they've
gotten rid of all these ports now a pro
machine suggests you that it's
professional right it's a tool for
professionals now the problem is
everybody I know uses devices that use
the Thunderbolt like I have a
thunderbolt display from apple now I'm
going to have to get some sort of dongle
or something to use my apple thunderbolt
on their pro laptop their flagship
laptop which is very expensive by the
way given the power but you get I don't
have any USB ports now there's no USB
ports in the new mac book pro so again i
got these USB peripherals USB 3 i'm
gonna have to get booed dongles again
it's just it's it's craziness it's
craziness it is a stripped-down neutered
machine yeah it's a nice improvement in
certain respects but man compared to
what you see the other laptop
manufacturers are coming out with in
terms of their capabilities like for
instance the equivalent to the flagship
macbook pro is a surface book from
Microsoft and well the surface book is
not a quad-core it's meant for
flexibility but it's the detached
screen its touch screen in this ultra
portable format they still have USB 3
etc etc etc they have display ports
right in there it'sit's silliness what
Apple is doing and I know I am forced to
certain extent to get an Apple computer
because i use two pieces of software
that it's on mac only and put on tempted
now to look at alternatives so let's see
if i can find alternatives pieces of
software and dump the mac platform you
know i like mac OS quite a bit it's a
great OS in certain many respects very
stable although I have to say Windows 10
is more advanced not a stable more
advanced of Windows if Microsoft could
just work a little bit more to make
their operating system a little bit more
stable now that it's super crashy or
anything then I see not using mac OS in
the future I can see that as a
possibility anyway it's very strange
interprofessional machine they get rid
of many ports no SD card board no USB 3
port no Thunderbolt displayed it's the
port a no Thunderbolt port rather this
is a cool anyway that's my two cents on
that check out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
