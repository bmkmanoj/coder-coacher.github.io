inside a Photoshop what we're going to
have to do now is learn to access that
image by zooming in and out of that
image and there's a couple of handy
shortcuts that you can remember if you
wish and you can find the vast majority
of these under the View menu you'll
notice that by pressing ctrl + a + sign
you can zoom into an object and you can
zoom out by pressing control minus you
can fit the object on the screen control
zero and I'll show you what I mean by
that the amount of visible area that's
available control zero will fit it into
that visible area as you can see here
it's done so another option is ctrl alt
or option zero and that will
automatically put your option or window
as you can see here to a hundred percent
if you remember those shortcut keys from
before for the screen modes f shortcut
key will scroll through the ability of
going fullscreen nevertheless you can
see the differences between those but
remember control- will zoom out and ctrl
+ to zoom in and that's really handy but
as you can see when you do in fact zoom
into something you may not want to work
in this specific area so it's handy to
be able to move around while being
zoomed in and remember this little handy
shortcut if you press the spacebar your
mouse will turn into your cursor excuse
me will turn into a hand and allow you
to zoom and move around the workspace
this in fact is what we see in the
Navigator tool right here so if you open
up the Navigator tool
you can recognize that there's a little
box in the navigator tool and right now
it's showing us where we are in relation
to that also if you zoom in and out
using the Navigator tool this way and
you don't even have to press the
spacebar you just move around the
navigator to land it allow you to move
around and get really tight in close on
certain pixels and when we're
manipulating pixels for use in our
Photoshop images we're going to have to
be able to move these around see how
things work so that's the Navigator tool
and how that particular object works you
can see how it's kind of fun to move it
around however if you don't like to work
with the Navigator tool remember those
other shortcuts there's also another
wonderful tool here it's the zoom tool
as you might imagine and Z on your
keyboard shortcut will convert your
keyboard shortcut cursor into the zoom
tool so remember whenever you mouse over
any of these tools take time to look at
the shortcut that's associated with it
so this is really useful because rather
than control ctrl + zooming in randomly
as you can see here are just zooms in to
the center of the object and control
minus zooms out this tool allows you to
zoom in specifically on an area that you
wish to deal with so the tip of his tail
now if I just press down and then let go
I'm right at the tip of his tail and if
I want to reverse that process by
pressing the Alt key I get the minus
sign and that minus sign will allow me
to zoom out and specifically I'm zooming
out from the area that I want to so you
can zoom in just by clicking or you can
zoom in to a specific area by selecting
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
