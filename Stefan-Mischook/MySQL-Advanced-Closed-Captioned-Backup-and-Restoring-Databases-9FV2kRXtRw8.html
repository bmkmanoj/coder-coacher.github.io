killer PHP calm and this is part 8 of a
nine-part series or looks to be a 9 part
series on advanced MySQL usage and today
what I'm going to be showing you is how
you can do backups and restore your data
with the help of the MySQL dump function
that comes with pretty much every
distribution of MySQL so let's just get
started here if I start by showing you
the tables from our last video you can
very easily see that we've got author
post and then we've got post count post
with authors and published posts which
are all views that we created in the
last two videos so if I want to do any
kind of backups of my data the most
effective way of doing this is actually
from the command line now granted you
can also do this and I'm just going to
show you quickly how if I just create a
new tab here so you can see if you do
have a map configuration then it's
actually very easy for you to just use
the PHP my admin toolset that usually
comes with some kind of lamp stack
whatever it may be and from PHP my admin
if you remember it from the introductory
tutorial that Stefan did you can see
basically your whole database schema and
you can see how many records you have
and everything else but you can also do
an export of your data so if i were to
check all and I said export and at the
bottom here you can actually save it as
a file or you can just hit go and when
you hit go you'll see that MySQL will
actually generate all the necessary
statements for creating the the the
constraints that we looked at in even
the first or the second video to
creating the views that we do
described in the last video and so on
and so forth and even all the tables and
all the rows and everything else so this
is a great way of doing your backups if
you don't have access to this or if
you're for example using ssh to log into
a server and you don't have PHP my admin
at your disposal then fear not there's
actually a very simple way of doing this
too so if I go back to my terminal and I
just quit my SQL you'll notice that in
my my particular mysql binaries are
stored in the the bin folder here so i
have my SQL client test mysql config
mysql find rose install DB and so on and
so forth my SQL admin but there's also
my SQL dump and my SQL dump is a really
simple way of just dumping out all the
information in a particular database and
it's great if you want to do that turn
it into an SQL file similar to the
scripts that we've been creating over
time except that this is going to be
something that is automatically
generated for us so I'm just going to
create a mice I'm just going to run my
SQL dump from here and see what happens
so you're going to notice that it's
going to give me a selection of options
now in this case my first option is
going to be that I want to access my
database using root and my password for
my database is actually going to be root
not very high security and if I just
specify the database name then what's
going to happen is it's just going to
dump everything out straight to my
command line which isn't very helpful I
mean yeah you can copy and paste it but
that's not a very elegant solution with
a bit of shell scripting we can actually
easily move this into a file so if i
wanted to push all of the data that the
mysql dump function is going to return
then it would just be a matter of using
the greater than symbol which will pipe
that output into a file and then i just
need to specify a file so in this case
it's going to be
k PHP SQL and I'm going to call it back
up dot SQL hit enter and nothing should
happen or seem to happen however if I go
to this particular folder using CD and
then using the tilde which takes me home
to my desktop 2k PHP SQL which is the
folder that i have this particular
backup file sitting it and i were to or
even i can just go into my finder here
so it's nice and easy for you to see if
i go to my desktop i'm going to have in
my k PHP SQL folder a backup SQL that
was just created so if I open this in my
editor you can see that it has all the
necessary information for defining the
the website that I or the the database
schema for my web site so it's got you
know the inserts it's got you know a
whole bunch of extra junk which might
not necessarily be super user friendly
but at least we know that it's all it's
all there so with that in place we can
also see that there's the views and
everything else so if i just select all
of this and i were to go back here into
mysql and for the sake of argument i was
going to say okay so databases I've got
a whole bunch of databases here if I
wanted to create a new database called k
PHP back up with a collation of utf-8
underscore general underscore CI and a
encoding of utf-8 I believe that's how
you would do it ah here we go it's
actually not kool aid its character sets
yeah so Kool Aid is fine but it's
actually character set so if I create
this K PHP backup and I decide I want to
use kph be back up
then if I go back here and I take my
backup SQL file select it all and then
paste it in then it's going to say dump
completed everything looks good if I say
show tables I'm going to get all of the
tables from Mike a PHP t a database
including all the views so if I say
define post with underscore authors oops
i mean describe post underscore with
underscore authors i'm going to get a
description of that if i say select star
from published posts I should get a nice
description of that and everything is in
place so with that one simple my SQL
dump command if you wanted to and you
had to log into mysql this would be a
very simple way of doing it another way
of doing it is actually without even
accessing mysql at all so to illustrate
this example what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to drop the database of K PHP
underscore backup show databases and
then I'm going to recreate the create
database k PHP underscore back up and
then Cole late to utf-8 underscore
general underscore CI it's very
important that you make sure that your
defaults are properly set up or else
you'll end up having like a Swedish
character set for some of your columns
and then a utf-8 14 other columns which
if you have any kind of funny characters
or you know if you're trying to store
multiple languages you're going to set
yourself up for a lot of trouble and
we're gonna have the character set set
to utf-8 so I've created this K PHP
backup database except that now if I say
use k PHP underscore backup and I show
tables it's going to be absolutely empty
now if I quit my SQL instead of just
running my regular mysql
query and specifying k PHP underscore
back up as my database I can then pipe
the backup SQL script back into mysql
through the client and that means
instead of using the greater then so i
would put to a file i'm just going to
use the less than and then i'm going to
find that backup SQL file so in this
case it's in k PHP SQL backup SQL if i
hit enter it'll take a moment and then
it'll just pipe all that information
back into the SQL server if i run the
client and I say show tables then
they're going to be back where they
belong so with a couple of very simple
commands at your disposal it's actually
not difficult to do your backups and
your restores and to be able to easily
manage your database if you're moving
from a development environment to a
staging environment if you need to
create a test script to show that
there's certain integrity that is
maintained within your application you
know these little simple queries are
going to save you a ton of time I'm John
leben sold and thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
