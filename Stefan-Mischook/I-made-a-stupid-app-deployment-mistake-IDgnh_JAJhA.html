holding up here in Canada so this is
going to be a quick vlog who want to go
out and enjoy the sunny day outside so
if you look there we go looking pretty
good out there anyway so what I'm going
to talk about very quickly is a bit of a
mistake I made with my with managing my
codebase what I did was well anybody
knows when you're developing an app and
you have a live app that users are using
software as a server a SAS you have to
have a production server and you have to
have a development server now the
development server should mirror a
production ship server they should be
the same ideally on the same physical
server or the same VPS virtual private
server with all the exact same settings
everything should be cloned so it's
identical why so that when you deploy to
your development server to check make
sure everything's working cool you know
that when you push it to the live server
the production server as they say you
know that things will work the same at
least in theory and that usually is the
case so if you've been following a
visible log you know that I am basically
shutting down the development of the 3x
branch of studio web because the 3x
branch is based on a very old
architecture still very solid pretty
much bug free and but to do what I want
to do in the coming year where I'm going
to implemented a I component to see web
or get into details the current
architecture to 3x branch architecture
just it's just too much too much work
too messy seven years old so we have
started production while building from
scratch to 4.0 version of city web which
is utilizing far more advanced MVC
framework more advanced arms and other
libraries that will allow us to better
implement the system that I see in my
mind's eye so back to the three point
one so
we have our development server we have a
production server we push the
development server everything was cool
so then I said okay fine so this drop
the development server this one by
mistake before deploying to the
production server the live server I told
my lead developer said since you know we
have our code in github and it's all
fair and backed up and so on and since
the development server mirror is the
production server I said it was in the
production excuse me it works on the
development server let's just push it to
the production and we'll be done with it
and so I said just just drop the
development server for three point one
because three point one is no longer
going to be developed it's done this was
the last version that's it's over so we
dropped it and because what we were
doing was adding some things behind the
scenes that were not really important
now to only become important September
when the schools get back on and system
it sort of lingered in the background
didn't actually get pushed to the live
server for a couple weeks so we finally
pushed it recently and bing-bang for
some reason one key theme again not
affecting any of the users but one key
thing didn't work on the production
server some reason the exact same
codebase work fine and development for
some reason to work in production that's
a head-scratcher now I'm not ready to
code these days so I don't know what's
going on here but that's a
head-scratcher now here was my mistake I
shouldn't have taken down the dev
droplet or the dev server until I saw
this production server was after running
fine everything was cool because if on
deployment to the production server I
would have seen the problem I was said
wait a second what's different between
the production and the develops dev
server what's going on here and
unfortunately though I destroyed the dev
droplet so I can't I can't contrast and
compare it's not a huge issue it would
have been nice to have the dev server
there for me to analyze we'll have my
lead developers analyze that but
unfortunately we don't have it whatever
we just got to compare to code see
what's going on it should be the exact
same code because we're using
github and so forth I think it's a
database I think something happened with
the database somebody field was not
added or something I don't know anyway I
won't get into details here what is the
point to take away this is a very rare
situation I never destroy dev servers
for this very reason but because of this
situation first time in I think my
career where I decided to basically put
a halt on future development on a
particular code base so I did for the
first time so while we're not developing
more I don't need a dev server site
destroyed it that was a mistake
a little mistake again not major this
first time ever because the first time
ever I'm actually I actually decided to
stop them you know developing a
particular codebase but nonetheless
learn from my lesson even in this
situation where you're stopping
development keep your working dev server
up and running just in case you know
something like what happened to be might
happen to you that's it for the vlog
