calm in this video I'm going to talk
about developing your web developer or
your web designer skills in 2016 2017
what do you need today in this time to
become a web developer now I specify
that in this time because over the years
this has changed a web developer in 2016
and 2017 is different from a web
developer in 2010 even in 2014 you could
say things continuously change and
evolve and so if you're getting into web
design and development for the first
time or you're a beginner this is a type
of thing that you're probably interested
in learning about so what do you need to
learn in 2016 and 17 in terms of web
development the basics are always well
not just web development in any field
study anything that you do technology or
otherwise it's very important that you
concentrate on the basics always the
basics always the basics because the
complex stuff it's just basic concepts
layered on top of each other kind of
like a hamburger right and it's all this
so it's all about layering of the basic
ingredients of an app whether it be a
web app really or an iOS app or what not
so you always want to concentrate on
your basic techniques your basic
subjects if you will in a particular in
a particular field study so I've gone
off on a tangent sorry when we get back
so with web development that means you
should learn HTML that includes html5 of
course if current version of HTML is
html5 so it's html5 css3 and that's just
you know that's the HTML CSS then a
JavaScript these are of three key
languages but you got to learn in terms
of web design web development for sure
you got it no V's very well now it
doesn't mean you have to master every
single aspect of the languages that's
impossible well it's probably it's
possible but it's a waste of time all
you need to do is learn the key
principles and techniques understand the
key aspects of each of these languages
once you've got that then when you're
working on projects and so forth you can
always refer back to Google and search
out whatever specific things you may not
know exactly off the top of your head
and by the way vitality is in
development you're going to forget a lot
of things over time as you become more
and more advanced that's just normal
stuff that I used to know like the back
of my hand ten years ago I don't
remember of course would take me an hour
to get back into it and it would come
back to me I'm sure but nonetheless you
can't expect to know every single thing
because when you look at all the things
you have to learn in the web development
world for instance you know HTML CSS
JavaScript or the beginning the
foundation three languages it could be
very daunting because then on top of
that you can have to you could have to
add SQL in databases SQL as the language
of databases then although that's not
too hard to learn and then you're going
to have to learn how to design proper
databases and so on then you have to
learn a server-side programming language
now server-side language is a language
that operates on the server so which
language should you learn there's a lot
of competitors unlike see HTML CSS and
JavaScript words no competitors
everybody learn seeds when it comes to
server-side languages there are
competitors big ones are PHP the most
widely used server-side language in the
world today this is the language behind
Facebook this is the language behind
WordPress Drupal Joomla and many many
other sites in fact in terms of
server-side programming languages those
are basically that's the code basically
that is sitting on the server and don't
worry if any of this is confusing to you
any decent beginners HTML course will
teach you these things yeah so PHP is
the most popular server-side language in
the world today and it's not going
anywhere
it's maintaining that you have several
others all that compete with PHP you
have c-sharp
yet you have Python to lesser extent of
on typically Python and PHP are used to
to are used to do two different things
although they can they can you know a
lot of these languages can do whatever
the other languages can do can do but
each language has its pros and it's cons
and each language can do something very
well anyway see that a PHP c-sharp net
you've got Java of course that was my
old favorite back in the day you have
Ruby of course and there's there's
there's several others actually but the
big ones these days are PHP Java c-sharp
net Ruby to certain extent although I
think that's fading slowly and what's
rising now is JavaScript on the server
with projects like nodejs and expressed
yes there's a lot of interest there
that's rising quickly because
traditionally JavaScript programming was
solely inside of the web browser when
you would write your JavaScript code
that code would operate in web browsers
whereas now they've taken JavaScript and
put it onto the server and that's
attractive to people but you have one
language for both the web browser and
the server
although advanced programmers will tell
you it's kind of like yeah it's not such
a huge issue because the details about
the language itself in terms of the code
is it's not the hard part harbauer part
about coding is understanding good
coding structures and understanding how
to properly build apps and and structure
apps and how to write code properly and
those principles those techniques if you
will their language agnostic meaning it
doesn't matter whether it's Java Ruby
PHP JavaScript Python if you write good
code you write good code that's why I
rather have an advanced PHP guy who
knows his stuff
really well I rather bring him into a
Python project but a beginner in Python
or a guy who's just done a year or two
of Python because the event PHP guy
within just a couple weeks of becoming a
Python coder because he's an advanced
coder it's like being a racecar driver
whether you can drive really well in a
Porsche or a Ferrari or BMW it matters
not you're a great driver so if you're
amazing driver always wins driving
Porsches if you if I put you behind the
wheel of a BMW if a little bit of
adjustment you're going to do really
well there as well I hope that makes
sense anyway that's it for 2017 it's all
about the core in terms of web
development it's about the core
languages of web development as usual
HTML CSS JavaScript there's a server
side I would lean for most people to PHP
not because that language is necessarily
the best language technically because a
lot of business reasons why I still
think PHP is superior then of course
there's SQL and then on top of that
you're setting called frameworks or
libraries there's many out there and
people go what do I learn there's so
much to learn oh my god there's so much
learn it's getting a little bit silly
now I've seen this before
in the Java world so in terms of
frameworks you should learn after you
learn the core languages is jQuery
number one again you have to be an
expert just understand what it can do on
the set of basics and it's you know
unestablished generally useful so you
have that tool in your toolbox and then
the next one I would learn is bootstrap
boot shop is a CSS framework that is
very popular so that's what I would
learn as well and that's pretty much it
you may have just heard my phone give me
a warning with the powers running out so
that's the end of this video
I hope you make good use of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
