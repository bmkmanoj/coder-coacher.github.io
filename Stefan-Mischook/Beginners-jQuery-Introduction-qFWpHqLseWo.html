killer sites course covering jQuery
basics my name is Ben fall I'm a web
designer in front end developer from
California you'd be working in the web
field since about two thousand seven in
this course I'll be giving you a
foundation in jQuery basics hopefully
giving you enough information so you'll
gain a strong understanding of the basic
principles and syntax enabling you to
continue learning and experimenting on
your own what is jQuery as the jQuery
website explains it's a fast concise
JavaScript library that simplifies
accessing elements in HTML event
handling animation and Ajax interaction
it helps make JavaScript development
significantly faster and easier and an
understanding of jQuery will change the
way you write JavaScript I'll be
covering a wide range of topics
including how to download and access the
jQuery library what the basic syntax
looks like how you would go about
selecting HTML elements in a page adding
effects and animations nip y elating
content and much more near the end of
the course i'll be demonstrating a
couple real world examples showing how
to create common functionality like a
drop-down menu or an accordion script
jquery offers a wide range of
functionality so i won't be covering
absolutely everything but it should be
enough to get you started this course is
aimed at jquery beginners so you
shouldn't need any jquery experience to
follow along with this course however I
do expect that you have at least a basic
understanding of HTML CSS and JavaScript
well I'll do my best to explain things
as I go if you want confident with those
three ads just doing some review before
starting this course what will you need
to follow along really the only thing
you'll need is a basic text editor you
won't need anything fancy notepad on
windows or text edit on Mac will work
just fine personally I like the Mac text
editor called espresso which is what
I'll be using but you don't need that
application understand these videos one
other thing I'll note most of the
examples i'll be demonstrating are built
off a basic HTML and CSS template that i
created i would suggest that you
download the source files and have those
files available when you fall
along thanks for watching and I hope you
find this course enjoyable if you have
any questions or comments please email
me at been at kelly recites calm where
you can post your questions on the
killer sites forums at killer sites calm
/ community now I or someone else from
the community will get back to you
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
