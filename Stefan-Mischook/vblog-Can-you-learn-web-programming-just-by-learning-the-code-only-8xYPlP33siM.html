this V blog I want to answer a question
but may be flowing around out there and
the question is is learning to code
enough to become a good web designer and
web programmer and I bring this up
because which we've seen coming up these
days RVs code testing type of websites
now we have one called killer sites
University and basically watch a video
and then on JavaScript or HTML or PHP
whatnot and then you immediately get a
quiz a code challenge where the system
says okay type in this code so there's a
little bit of JavaScript code in the
case of the JavaScript course a little
bit of PHP code in a PHP course so by
you know learning writing the code out
that's how you actually learn my way you
gotta write code it sort of helps you
helps in the learning process so we have
a system like that again a killer sites
universe and I think it's useful but
it's not the end-all be-all to learning
so you can expect to just become a great
web program or desire just because you
understand the strip out of cold there's
much more to the process than that
learning how to code is important is
most keys it's fundamental but beyond
the coating you have to understand a
whole bunch of other things so let's say
just what's basic web design you have to
understand site usability size structure
if to understand how sites are best put
together based on the particular
requirements out of the particular
website ecommerce based sites are very
different from other types of science
when it comes to programming it gets
even more complex than I have to
understand if most most dynamic websites
they are backed by databases so what
kind of database to use why would you I
go from mysql database at SQL database
versus a flat file system versus an
object database if you're designing a
database what's the best structure of
your data how do you know depending on
the type of application that you use
know if you can have millions of records
few transactions that are searched
orienteering how just maybe 200 about
hundreds of thousands of records instead
wears a lot of it announced it really
depends on the type of project it goes
beyond that turns the architecture how
do you know what kind of architecture
you're going to utilize typically these
days you go MVC which MVC framework
would you use now what's that bc while
i'm going into this toyo but it goes on
and on and on so just because you know
PHP you know how to write you know
function of ph being an automatic class
or or same thing in javascript it
doesn't mean you can sit down and put
together a great website or a great web
application there's much much more to it
than that but of course that's the key
you still need to know this stuff so yes
understanding code is very important
hugely important even for web designers
but it's it's just part of the equation
part of the picture so I hope that
answers that question so there you go so
if you're learning code through Cole
challenges so on that's great has to be
done but understand it's it's it's only
part of the process as part of the
learning but it's a big part and that's
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
