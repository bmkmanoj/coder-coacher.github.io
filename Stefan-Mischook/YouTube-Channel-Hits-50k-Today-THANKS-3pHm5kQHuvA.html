figured I do
just a casual vlog about this YouTube
channel I'm about to hit
I think it's February 4th today I'm
about to hit two major milestones I
think for the YouTube channel she'd been
following me for a while you know I it
was a dead channel this channel I had
sort of left collecting dust for years
in fact I had one of my assistants in
2008 load up a huge amount of videos
gonna occasionally I throw up some
videos but I didn't really care but
about a year and a half ago I said okay
let's do it was let's see what you can
do with this channel so I took it from
ten thousand subs and I think by the end
of the day today I'm gonna have 50,000
subs which is kind of cool and another
milestone is one of my videos a video I
did two and a half months ago on C++ and
it has it's it's just about 400,000
views just as that video so you know
compared to PewDiePie or whatever the
other big names out there ain't much
before a tech video it's pretty good for
two and a half months and it's still
going strong so goes the show where you
put your effort is where you're going to
find yourself so I did the YouTube thing
just as a hobby to practice speaking
gets a little bit of a word out but I
have to tell you I enjoy it and what I
try to do with this channel is bring to
it what you don't see elsewhere my goal
is to basically teach what I've learned
over the last 20 odd years as a
developer in 28 years as a business
entrepreneur a business owner
entrepreneur so I bring that to the mix
I bring that experience that's why I
have my foundation training and all that
kind of stuff which will teach you how
to be a full stack web presenter web
developer at a professional level but
why people ask why don't they do this
package here why don't they do this new
library here a tutorial on this or
tutorial on that well because I don't
need to what was needed in the
marketplace was something that taught
the foundation and the core properly
number one and number two something that
taught good developer skills from the
point of view of a highly experienced
developer most of the
tutorials out there taught by people who
are in juniors and people who are
academics so I bring that real world
coding experience into it I bring that
business experience into this when I
look at languages I look at technologies
I'm always considering the business and
of it as much as I am the technical end
of it whereas the 99% of the people I
see out there when they talk about
technology they're just talking about
you know the technical aspect of it
though they argue about JavaScript
versus Java or JavaScript ehe or what
out whatever just purely on technical
merits and that's fine but I just have
to picture because anybody knows who's
experienced developer any language out
there today any of the modern ones out
there today they're all capable they're
all you can produce great apps great
software with any of them it just
depends on what type of work you want to
do you're not going to use C++ to create
web apps that would be silly
even though C++ is a very powerful
capable language no you would use PHP
you would use Java you would use c-sharp
and ESP garnett you would use Ruby rails
maybe you would use Python with Django
but you wouldn't use C++ to do that you
get the idea so the message I try to
convey in this channel is a when you're
looking at tech consider the business
end consider the technical end be try
not to be a language or technology
zealot be flexible and I'm trying to
teach real-world experience at only 20
odd years of experience can teach you so
yeah you could take 20 years to learn
this stuff on your own or you can watch
my vlogs and gain and benefit from my
experience going back to the 90s anyway
milestone day today nearly 50,000 subs
and a single video events just shy have
400,000 views not bad all right we'll
talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
