name is Stephanie shock with killer
sites calm and in this particular video
I just want to introduce you to the
course itself and give you an idea of
the flavor of the course
because this is a beginners course on
dreamweaver I have two goals in mind
number one to teach you how to build a
website as quickly as possible with
Dreamweaver because I'm of the opinion
that most people out there just want to
get to it right away and you don't want
to lists it through and have to listen
to hours of theoretical blather number
two I want to introduce you to the
basics of web design there are some key
web design principles that even if
you're using a powerful program like
dreamweaver cs3 you're still going to
need to know these principles
fortunately this is a hands-on tutorial
where I imagine that you're sitting
right here beside me and we're actually
going through the process of learning
how to use dreamweaver to build a
website so I'm not the type of guy who
sort of sits there in front of you and
rambles on about theory that just bores
people to death and I think it's not a
good way to teach because it's not a
good way to learn I believe the best way
to learn is to do something so the best
way to learn how to use Dreamweaver is
to actually use the program to build
websites so that's what we're going to
jump into right away and as we're
building I'm a pause a renowned men to
explain some basic web design theory or
some basics cs301 dreamweaver cs3
concepts but that's only going to be a
very small part of the video course
if i were to sum up the flavor of the
course the field of course i could sum
it up in three basic ideas that i carry
through in all my videos and in my web
design web programming work and they are
keep it simple keep it practical and
keep it to the point I think that says
it all and I think that will give you a
good idea of how the course is going to
unroll in front of you
as far as the order of the videos each
video is numbered you know number one
number two number three just follow the
numbers and you will be following the
order which you should be watching the
videos
alright that pretty much covers all i
have to say with regards to introducing
the the whole course i hope you enjoy it
and i'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
