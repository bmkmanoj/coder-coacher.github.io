learn about something called the Dom do
M
DOM is short for document object model
and in a nutshell the Dom is basically a
virtual map of the webpage that's
currently loaded in your browser
I've created this diagram of the DOM and
right beside it here on the right hand
side you have a very simple web page and
here you have a model a diagram of the
Dom now this is nebulous for you now
this is I'm sure very confusing for you
now but give it a few minutes and you
understand what this is all about and
why it's important that you understand
the DOM and why the Dom is the key to
all those dynamic effects that you see
done in JavaScript these days
so as I said the Dom is basically a map
or a model of a webpage so if you look
at our webpage here you see we have HTML
tag at the top the HTML tag right this
sort of encapsulates everything
underneath it so let's look at our map
here our model you see HTML and
everything falls under it same thing so
then you have head and you have had tags
and under the head
you have meta and the title tag so we
have our head meta and title tags I'm
hoping that you're starting to see the
tree like or hierarchy that the model
the Dom model represents let's scroll
down here and highlight it in grey all
this code represents this stuff
highlighted in grey here so we see we
start with the body and a body wraps all
these tags here of course right so we
got the body at the top of this
hierarchy and underneath the body falls
all these tags so you got our paragraph
right here's our paragraph and we have
our h1 here's our h1 and here we have
our ordered list you notice in between
the ordered list tags you have the list
item tags and again it's represented
here in this Dom hierarchy map you see
we have our ordered list and we have our
individual list item tags as well
okay so we have a Dom model here this is
the model is the map map model
interchange it this is our web page that
this model represents so what's the
whole point of this the point of this is
that a map like a map that you use to
get around town you know a city map the
dawn map allows you to get around the
web page using javascript javascript has
built into it a bunch of functions that
allows you to easily jump around this
document object model the Dom to be able
to do things like add new tags change
properties and the tags add text in
between tags remove tags it allows you
the Dom that is combined with JavaScript
it allows you to do all those dynamic
effects that we see in so many webpages
so to go back and break down the meaning
of the word Dom do M Dom stands for
while D is document and document
represents of course the webpage the
page that's actually loaded into the
browser object model I don't like to
separate object loan because basically
the browser looks at a webpage and
conceptualizes it as being a series of
objects and so you have object model
basically object map so essentially the
Dom is the document object map and again
javascript has all these functions allow
you to to walk around this map and to do
things with this map
before we go ahead with the document
object model I want to jump back into
core JavaScript again to help you want
to remind you about objects in
JavaScript now I touched off on this in
a previous video but what I want to wrap
up for you so we have an understanding
is that well in JavaScript we have
objects you know that something I hadn't
mentioned before was what javascript has
three basic types of objects
the first type of object we are not
going to look at in this course but I'm
just going to mention for the sake of
being complete you have what you call
user-defined objects these are objects
that you as a programmer will create
yourself we don't need to do that
because I gets into advanced JavaScript
but if it's a little unclear now if you
remember when objects are right there
they're just a collection of code and
code we can have attributes about the
code right and it can have functions
built into these objects as well so you
could create your own objects and then
use those objects in your scripts but
we're not going to do that in this
course there's no need to but I just
wanted to mention it for the sake of
being complete the second type of object
that you have in gems we are the core
language objects and we seem represented
right up here in this section here
language we got the array boolean date
math number string now we've used the
array object right memory array objects
had the lens property and we're able to
do stuff with it and we actually use the
string object whenever you create a
string of text javascript automatically
wraps it makes it into a string object
but I'm not going to get into that again
just understand that there's this object
in JavaScript this type of object rather
that's called the core language objects
finally you have something called the
host objects and that would be something
that the browser provides well not
something many things because many
objects so we have it represented here
now this is where the action is from
most of what we're going to do so the
Navigator object of course Navigator
represents the browser and then we went
through all these before so you know
what they are so what you want to take
away from this segment of the video is
that there are three categories of
objects in JavaScript again you get the
user-defined objects you have the core
language objects and of course you have
the host objects which basically is a
fancy way of saying the browser specific
objects so if you got like the document
objects and a form object and so on and
so forth
in the next video we're going to jump
deeper and back into the JavaScript DOM
and we're going to learn about something
called
nodes and then after that it's all going
to be practical usable JavaScript thank
you thank the heavens for that sigh I
hate boring people with new theory but
sometimes you just have to step back and
do things if any of this is unclear you
can watch the video again but another
thing you could do is maybe as an
exercise create a simple web page and
then try to diagram on a piece of paper
what the Dom object you know what the
document object model would be for that
particular page so you can use this as a
template for you and you can build up
from that maybe try with different tags
table tags and so on and I think if you
did this once or twice it will really
help you to understand the way the Dom
works and how mapping a web page works
and this will actually help you quite a
bit when you're writing JavaScript code
that uses a Dom which it does on a
regular basis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
