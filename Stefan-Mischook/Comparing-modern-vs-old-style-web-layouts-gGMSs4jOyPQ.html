venerable I think that's the right word
killer sites video store is finally
going to get an update this is the
current store which is a layout that
must be 0 must be four or five years old
I imagine at this time anyhow it's not
terrible but yeah it's in desperate need
of miles not terrible it needs an update
and after many years we're going to be
updating it so yeah just you notice we
have the panel based design here I call
it panels because you got like a panel
here to green bar and this sections of
panel and the sections kind of a panel a
more modern panel based design is kind
of like this one web mentor very parish
yeah that's it so the even idea this is
the old killer sites calm layout now
this goes back several years and this is
kind of an old style and this is going
to be going away as well we're going to
be updating it to a panel based designed
why do we have these modern panel based
designs versus the old fix with design
that we have here look at this as it
resize it's not very flexible so if you
have a guy of a very large
high-resolution like I have here this is
a 2k display and forget about 2k there's
4k displays now it doesn't take
advantage of all this great real estate
it's all agree on the gray background
and if you have a guy coming on your
site with a smartphone well the
smartphone will actually resize it but
it could be better optimized so for
instance you look at what was fine a
transitional so this layout is a
transitional layout something we did
after kilo sites now it takes advantage
of the screen real estate but it doesn't
shrink down at all so somebody on a
tablet
our smartphone would have to pinch and
zoom to get a good view of course what
we have in the cutting-edge our sites
like web mentor where it takes full
advantage of the entire screen so this
is could scale out to 4k displays no
problem but it actually it shrinks all
the images are shrinking everything is
shrinking so it actually look good in
tablet size which is about here it will
look good in foams which is about here
so that's see the way of modern web
design and I think that this responsive
style of layout this is called
responsive because it responds to the
screen size he is going to be the
standard for many years because of the
fact that people are going to be hitting
your website with so many different
devices with so many different screen
resolutions that you need something that
can adapt on the fly accordingly so next
couple years perhaps 4k displays will
become commonplace you never know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
