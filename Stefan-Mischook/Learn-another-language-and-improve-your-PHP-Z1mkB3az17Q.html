learning another programming language
can help you develop and deepen your PHP
skills to jump into this discussion
let's mention a couple of the languages
that are out there that have a similar
route to PHP so we're looking at Java
JavaScript ActionScript Python I'm not
saying they're the same but they do have
a common base and they do have a lot of
common functionality and constructs so
for instance all these languages are
pretty much object oriented obviously
all these languages have the concept of
a class and all these languages do air
trapping and all these languages have
functions or methods so the point to
take away is that though these languages
share similar route and they deal with
similar programmatic constructs like
classes functions arrays etc each one
does approaches these things in their
own unique way so when you look at for
instance a class and ActionScript and
you see how they handle it and you look
at a class of PHP and he looks you see
how PHP handles it you're basically
looking at the same construct from a
different angle and by looking at this
contract from different angles it will
give you a much deeper insight into the
basic constructs of a class I found over
the years by learning different
languages that approach the same
constructs from different angles I found
that it gave me a deeper knowledge much
more quickly than I would have gotten
otherwise I think if I had just stuck to
one programming language so am I
suggesting that you should pull away
from PHP and maybe jump into something
like a Java or C sharp dotnet not at all
and unless you of course your project
demands that I think
and know and believe that PHP is the
predominant web programming language
today and if you're doing web
application development you probably
want to be doing PHP when it comes to
your server side stuff what I suggest
that instead of looking at a c-sharp or
a Java which will give you that insider
I spoke about before what I would do
instead would be to choose a
complimentary language to PHP so I would
look at something like JavaScript why
because with JavaScript you have Ajax
and you have Dom scripting so you can
have all this interactive widget stuff
on your web sites and you have Jason
which is a way of moving data to and
from the server in a way that it's in a
JavaScript format but well leave that to
another video so you see that with
JavaScript it works well with PHP so if
you learn JavaScript not only will you
give yourself more insight into PHP but
you also will be learning a very useable
skill that will complement your PHP work
another example of a complementary
language to PHP is ActionScript
ActionScript of course is the language
of Flash and flashes will used a lot
today for rich Internet application
development RIAA as they call it and on
top of the basic flash structure if you
will you also have something called flex
which is really something for
programmers who want to really integrate
flash based you eyes and flash based
engines with back-end stuff like PHP
today the marriage of Flash technology
and PHP is even deepening more with zan
partnering with Adobe to create a better
integration of flex with PHP in fact the
Zen framework I believe is now ship
with the Flex framework so you got a
real nice marriage between PHP and Flash
something deeper than we've ever seen
before
so by learning ActionScript you will be
again complementing your PHP skills so
I'm just gonna wrap this up by saying
whatever complementary language you do
choose to learn well if you like if you
prefer just a jump in the Java because
it's your taste that's fine
you'll find that learning this language
will give you a much deeper
understanding of programming in general
and thus PHP and it will give you
insight into PHP much more quickly than
you would otherwise gotten this again
this is based on my personal experience
and the reason this is the case it's
just because you'd be looking at similar
constructs from different angles so
you'd be looking at classes from
different angles and so on so I hope you
found this video useful
my name is Stephanie shucks with killer
PHP calm and killer sites calm I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
