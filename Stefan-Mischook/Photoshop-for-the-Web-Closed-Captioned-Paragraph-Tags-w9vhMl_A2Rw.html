doing is moving away from those
headlines and actually starting to
address what's going on with these
paragraphs so as you can see when I
select any of these pieces of text
they're all paragraphs so similarly to
what we did with the h1s why don't we do
the same thing with paragraphs will
create a universal tag that will address
all p all paragraph tags we did that
with the body did that with the
universal selector here that says
address every single tag these are all
ids right hence with the pound symbol
but the image in the h1 are saying look
any image any h1 make them all look like
this we're going to do the same thing
but before we do let's just go back to
photoshop for a second and i'm going to
just double check make sure and as you
can see here another fairly common font
on the pc colibri what i'm going to do
is to work in here will create a new CSS
rule and this one is going to be a tag
and there we go paragraph tag perfectly
so first of all you can see that i don't
really have any of the fonts called
colibri on this list but remember we can
come here and if we do we can say c 4
colibri do we happen to have that let's
try this see colibri perfect so I'm
going to add that while colibri is kind
of a saucer if so with that as well I'll
say look if you don't have colibri why
don't you just grab another classic
called verdana perfect if you don't have
verdana grab ariel so i can even say a
are there it is arial and I don't want
bold italic or italic or anything like
that right so you can just choose your
regular ariel's will be fine there's
other ones as well you could even say
look I want the Helvetica or something
like it all of these things are great
and you know you can choose any of those
saucer ifs any one that you would like
and as I also
mentioned I want to talk to you about
here as well is you know you can choose
any one of these from your list but also
take note up here right the very ending
of these for example verdana Geneva saw
Sara right that's actually not a bad
thing for you to add as well so now I
can come in here and I could say look
there's colibri verdana and I could even
come in here and say song dash serif
whoops make sure you spell it properly
or else that's not going to do you any
good so if I were to apply that let's
take a look a very nice but 11 pixels
should be a little bit more
appropriately at least smaller in size
now you might be looking at that say you
know I kind of would like something to
be a little bit bigger or something
along those lines that's perfectly fine
there's nothing wrong with you know
making your text a little larger however
you should never really go beyond 12
pixels I mean some people might you know
skirt with 14 pixels and I and I think
it really depends on what font you're
using but you don't want your paragraphs
to necessarily turn into headlines or
anything like that you want to create
that contrast right and we're going to
have more of an effective contrast if
our paragraphs and our headlines look
decidedly different but we can let
things increase a little bit more for
example if I were to increase the line
height and press apply you can see how
things breathe a little bit easier when
we do that colibri could probably work
well at 12 points as well and as you can
see here it kind of does but personally
I think 11 points would be you know a
little bit smaller but actually probably
work a lot better now a couple of other
things I wanted to do and that's deal
with the color schemes so you'll notice
i'm back in photoshop and I probably
want to be using the darkest color here
so I chose it from my color picker and
here's the hexadecimal number which i
will copy command C or ctrl c if you're
on a pc and we'll go back to Dreamweaver
and here we're going to add the pound
symbol but then paste in our caller
and you can see that you know just calms
it down a bit it's still dark so we can
still read it and it's not too light so
that it gets lost on the background so
everything's looking pretty good with
that and I don't really have any
problems with it in terms of variation
font weight or anything like that I'm
pretty happy so we'll just say okay
these are all just single paragraphs
right now so when we go about creating
our second and third and fourth pages
which we'll do in the next videos what
we'll be doing is turning this three
column design let's preview it in the
browser to see what it looks like first
of all well save everything we need to
save so great here it is in Firefox
looks pretty good got our headlines
pretty much the way we want them to be
all of our alignment is matching up
really nicely and looks pretty good one
or two other things maybe I'd make a
change to and we can probably do that
I'll explain a little bit about
background images and background color
perhaps what we could do is add a little
something to this as well nevertheless
we've got all of our elements in place
our typographic elements are looking
good my headlines I'm happy with and we
also have these images here which are
linking to other pages now right now
they're not linking to other pages but
we will make them linked to the other
pages which will be creating in the next
video tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
