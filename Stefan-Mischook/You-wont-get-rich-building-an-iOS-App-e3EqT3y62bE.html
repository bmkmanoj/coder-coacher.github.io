killer sites com so you won't get rich
building and iOS app that's the title of
the V blog so like everything else but
you here you should look for some data
you should look for some evidence to
back any statement that you hear on or
off of the interwebs so here's an
article from gawker com and this just
supports my my assertion as the Nerds
would say this supports what I'm saying
essentially there are so many apps I
want to give you the Reader's Digest
version the shortened version of what's
going on here there are so many apps now
in the App Store well over a million and
there's so many apps being submitted new
apps being submitted to the app store
every month and that's just the iOS App
Store that's just the apple app store
that the chances of you making any money
with your app is highly unlikely for a
few reasons number one there's so many
apps out there like what are the chances
that your app is going to be seen by
other people you know let's be realistic
there's a million-plus out there and
there's eleven thousand new ones coming
in more than 11,000 every month number
two a lot of these apps are free the
companies were right on for free and
you're hoping to get you later on which
you know in-app upgrades and so on so
you have to expect that even if your app
gets a little traction meaning people
start looking at it you have to expect
that it may take time for it to be any
monetization so if you're building apps
you have 240 iOS store and I'm sure it's
even worse for the Android store you're
going to have to expect that you're
going to need to have a lot of money in
the bank or have time to devote to
promoting your app before you make any
money so this is a long-term thing the
days of putting an app out there and
making sales click and so on if it was
ever there it's not there anymore so
keep that in mind this is really
interesting now i'm on windows right now
recording this screencast
and you see among statista if I want to
view the data on this chart I have to
become a premium member on windows which
is interesting now before I get to this
now well actually we'll just get to it
but on my Mac I took a screenshot of the
exact same site with my Mac so for
whatever reasons statista does not block
the charts on the Mac but it blocks it
on windows I have no clue why as just a
little interesting thing I've never seen
before but here's some statistics ops
until 2014 in black is a number of games
and in blue is the total as the
applications so you see there's a lot
like this is the 40k mark so it says
right here in jun 2014 a total number of
a total number of eleven thousand seven
hundred and fifty two new games and
applications were submitted to the apple
itunes store i'm not sure what the
percentage of acceptances but I imagine
it's relatively high since people are
spending their time writing these apps
and so on I haven't bothered trying to
look at the acceptance rates the main
thing though is that there's a lot of
apps being submitted all the time and
you got already a million-plus on the
store to contend with so this is uh this
is a market that's very difficult to get
into it I called a chicken's market what
do we invite chickens well a chicken's
are a commodity that means that you know
you got you know Joe down the butcher
down the street selling chickens the
other store selling chickens this guy
selling chickens unless you got some
really special chickens the chances of
you selling your chickens is going to be
difficult unless you're you know real
good salesman or again you got real good
chickens so the same thing with apps now
in the iOS store there's so many apps
and so many free apps first of all they
got to find your app second of all they
got to be willing to pay for it given
there so many free apps to count on the
freemium model later on the freemium
model is the models that you buy to free
you get the free one and eventually you
might pay to get some upgrades or so on
anyway I just a word of warning to you
budding developers out there
just because you can write an iOS app it
doesn't mean you're going to make any
money with the app and the chances are
you won't it's a lottery ticket these
days that's pretty clear to people who
have sober minds that all said it's not
too depressing in terms of iOS
development in general because there are
still a lot of people out there who may
need well I don't know if it's a lot but
there are certain amount of businesses
and people out there who may need an iOS
app for some app they're developing for
their own internal purposes so you may
have a restaurant who wants to develop
an iOS app for water taking or who knows
so learning to develop in iOS could have
some benefits in terms of you developing
apps for other people and still to this
day they're still buzzed last time I
check on recording this in mid 2015
they're still buzzed there's probably
good work for iOS developers high paid
jobs for iOS and developers that said
I'm still a big advocate of people
providing turnkey web development
services and what I'm talking about web
development services I'm talking about
getting into beyond just basic site
building and coding anyway I'll have to
leave that to another video it's already
six minutes in here so that's too long
already so we'll talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
