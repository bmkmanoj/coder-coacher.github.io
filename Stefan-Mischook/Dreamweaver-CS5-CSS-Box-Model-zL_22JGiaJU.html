bit about working with the tag selectors
and even working with custom class
selectors but there's one element one
category of the CSS properties that i
didn't really explore up to this point
and that is the CSS box model so let's
look at both of our custom classes first
we'll start with the image and then
we'll start with the simple quotation
custom class that we created over here
before and we'll start with the image
discussing the box model because it
shows us a little bit about what we're
doing for example everything in CSS is a
box or in other words every HTML tag or
anything that we're assigning
information to can be seen as a box so
what does that mean well here we have an
image which is rather boxy in its shape
so I think that should be a good way to
describe this and if we attempt to
adjust the image information we can
double click on the float left and that
will bring up the CSS rule over here or
remember you could always click on the
Edit rule pencil icon right here to this
time I'm going to ask you to go to the
category called box well in the box
model what we can define for this
particular object or image in this case
is padding and margin so how does that
work in the box model well when you're
defining in the box model anything on
the inside of that object will be
defined as padding anything on the
outside of that particular box is
defined with margin so for example if i
did say same for all and i said a margin
of 10 and i applied that you'll notice
hey great it's giving me some space over
here on the side remember we wanted that
extra space but it's also done some
other things given me too much space
down here at the bottom which I didn't
need it's also given me an extra 10 on
this side which I didn't want either
because I would liked the way my box and
my text lined up nicely here it's really
only on this side that I wanted extra
space so
it won't be same for all actually rather
than easier ways to just set these all
20 then take this off and say hey zero
everywhere except on the right hand side
which has 10 now if we apply that notice
nice even here no extra space here
that's just normal it's giving us
because of the paragraph here but as you
can see we've got this nice amount of
space on the right hand side over here
and that's just great notice this you
see how the picture doesn't quite line
up with the L over here well let's see
if i wanted to i could say how about
like just a little bit of margin on the
top like let's try two pixels see what
that looks like still maybe a little
more how about four pixels and see what
that looks like see that now I've got
these things lined up quite nicely maybe
even five pixels again that might change
depending on what browser you're in but
if I like that and if i wanted to
preview that and see what it looks like
let's preview it in safari and see what
it looks like and you can see yes you
know it's a little bit smaller than i
wanted for probably would have been
better see it's always good to preview
it in your browser and remember if you
don't preview in the browser you can
always preview in Live View not live
code just yet but live view as you can
see live view it's giving you a brief
rundown of what it looks like if you
don't like the fact that it is set to
margin-top at five we could say four
instead and that just brings it up a
little bit looks a little bit better I'm
going to switch out of live view alright
so back to our code view and a regular
view and if we preview this in the
browser will see that yeah things are
pretty much lined up exactly the way I
want space over here space on the bottom
was there by default so that's great but
notice here right nice and easy it's all
lined up just perfectly there that's
great so that's wonderful it's given me
exactly what I want it to look like and
it's done so by adding space on the
outside of the box which is margin well
let's take a look at some things like
padding and see what that's all about I
told you that we would revisit this
quotation custom class
this one right here you'll notice when I
selected that's an area which is defined
as the box in order to see that better
let's double click click quotation and
we'll give it a background color look
I'll just say white background color and
if i press apply we can see the area
which is being defined as my box
background color' defines the box all
right now we can also see that my text
is really squished up against the edge
here which I don't like it all so let's
do a couple of things go to the box
model and if I wanted to move the text
off of the edge of that box that's
inside the box not outside the box like
we did with the picture but rather
what's in the box so what's in the box
is defined by padding so here I'll
define same for all I'll say give me 10
pixels all the way around and I'll play
a supply and you can see now that this
looks decidedly better than it did just
a second ago because we got the text
right off the edge but notice I'm still
keeping these edges the same and that
should you know look pretty good so
whether or not you have a border around
that or anything like this just by
putting the Box in this fashion and
keeping things aligned but indenting
them the way I'm doing here can really
make things look a whole lot nicer for
you it really all depends on what you
want it to do and how it's supposed to
look if we quick that and we want to
change the padding you could change it
here or you could double-click the
quotation icon yet again go to box and
you could say maybe even more generous
about 20 pixels well if you apply that I
got to be honest it's probably going to
be a little too generous but whatever
let's keep it like this and we'll see so
I'll preview that in my browser click OK
and check it out 20 on the top 20 on the
sides bottom and the right-hand side as
well so that shows you a little bit
about the box model margin controls the
outside of the box padding controls the
inside of the box you can apply it
uniformly on all sides or you can apply
it only on one side or two sides depend
what you want to happen inside of your
view so that's a little bit about the
box model the box model will also be
something that we're going to be
addressing a little bit more in detail
when we start talking about laying out
your pages using CSS so we'll come back
to box model little later on but in the
next example what we're going to be
doing is looking at these links and
starting to style our links</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
