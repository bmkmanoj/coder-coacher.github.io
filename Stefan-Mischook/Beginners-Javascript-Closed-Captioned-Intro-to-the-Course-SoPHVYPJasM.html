killer sites calm and killer PHP calm
and welcome to killer JavaScript one
this is a beginners video tutorial
course on JavaScript
as I said this course is designed for
total beginners so I'm assuming that
you've never seen JavaScript before and
more importantly I'm assuming that
you've never actually programmed in any
programming language before so when we
come across one of these concepts that
may trip up a few people will step aside
and we'll take a closer look at it just
to be sure that your you're pretty clear
about it so we can move forward
for this course you don't need to have a
terrible amount of web design knowledge
but what you do need to know is number
one basic HTML you should be comfortable
writing HTML code and you should also
know some CSS although in either case
you don't need to be a guru maniac nerd
master and each of them you just need to
have basic working knowledge of HTML and
CSS so that when we do our javascript
work you feel comfortable manipulating
the HTML and so on what the JavaScript
that's a little sneak peak there that's
a big part of what javascript does it
allows you to go in there and
dynamically on-the-fly change things in
your HTML and it's pretty cool
one thing about all my videos tutorials
and cured JavaScript one is no exception
is that I tend to really focus on
practical work as opposed to theoretical
so what does that mean well in the case
of JavaScript one my goal is to get into
your hands if you will an understanding
of JavaScript so that you can actually
use it in practical ways in your own
websites as quickly as possible I'm not
trying to make you in killer JavaScript
1 into some sort of JavaScript guru some
maniac understands the finer points and
the nuances of the language because
really to have practical working
knowledge of JavaScript you don't need
to really get that deep into it and for
most of us out there we will never need
to get that deep into it again the goal
of this course is to emphasize a
practical so what I try to do as much as
possible is to get you going with
practical usable JavaScript and Java
Script theory as quickly as possible
in terms of a software you don't need
anything special to write JavaScript
code all you need is a your simple text
editor and you need the web browser of
course to run the code any web browser
will do because all the modern web
browsers support javascript right out of
the box so what does that mean by
support it means it runs it so whether
you're using IE firefox safari opera
they all work and use javascript pretty
much pretty much the same so it does
really matter although in the long run I
recommend using Firefox especially on
the pc for your web designing because
when it comes to web browsers firefox
has a lot of friendly features built
into it and has a lot of external
plugins that are free but make it very
useful for web designers and it does
have of course some extra JavaScript
tools which I may look at in this course
that will help you when you're writing
your JavaScript code that all said it's
not essential if you prefer to use IE 7
or Safari or whatever it's up to you
personally in these tutorials are
probably going to be running everything
in Firefox
if you are
Dreamweaver or an expression web user
you can use that to to write your
JavaScript code it really doesn't matter
even if you're one of these bare-bones
guys in terms of your HTML and CSS you
can use bbedit on the Mac or wordpad or
notepad on Windows turn it again in
terms of a software you don't need
anything complex you just needed
something to edit your code what you use
for HTML and CSS is fine and a your web
browser of course
too close
traduction I want to talk about the
style of my presentation and style is
something that's consistent throughout
my videos I won't give you the long
version i'm going to give you the short
version here essentially everything that
i do is based on three principles be
simple be practical and be concise so
what I'm talking about being simple when
I teach JavaScript one or Petrie or
whatever when I teach JavaScript one
you'll find that I use a very easygoing
language I do my best to avoid complex
near terms on the occasion that i do
have to introduce some sort of new
technical term to you related to
javascript and/or a couple i take my
time and I make sure that you understand
these things before we move ahead so
don't worry about that but my by
tendency though is in all my videos is
to use a simpler language to try to make
this stuff as approachable as possible
the other principle is to be practical
and again I address this earlier on
where my go again is to as quickly as
possible get practical usable JavaScript
skills in your hands so that you can
apply them in your websites right away I
stay away from the stuff that's not
really used too often in day-to-day
javascript programming
and finally I try to be concise I am NOT
here to fill up hours of video my point
is to get the stuff in your hands as
quickly as possible because we all got
things to do and I'm going to play video
games or go have a beer or something so
we don't want to be sitting in front of
video tutorials listening to me for
hours unnecessarily so you'll find that
I try to as quickly as possible without
being confusing of course to get this
JavaScript knowledge in your head
so what can we do with JavaScript well
let's look at a couple of things
javascript is one of the common things
that you see JavaScript use for is a
form validation let's go back on the
Strand remember where I put some form
validation routines here we go here's an
old page and killer side so here's a
form now it says it's looking for an
email address now when I click this I'll
click the join button you see this
little pop-up window this is called a
javascript alert box and there's a
message please be sure to enter a
property email address so that's
JavaScript doing this javascript is be
able to i wrote the javascript us to
study this to make sure it was a
property email address to make sure it
matched and then when somebody clicks on
this the JavaScript farms off and we get
this error because I didn't put anything
in there that's a simple example so
we're going to look at that how we can
use JavaScript to verify for information
another thing you can do with javascript
is dynamically reposition elements on
your page so you get these these nifty
dropdowns here this is all done with
JavaScript of course so we're going to
look at stuff like this now this is very
simple stuff for instance this video
actually is actually embedded using
javascript and that's just a another
example rhymes well this is flash of
course but this flash was embedded using
javascript routines and finally i'm
going to show you javascript is is as
universal standard and so there's lots
of free javascript libraries out there
that you can use in your websites and
you can add a lot of power to your
websites without doing very much work
one of these free libraries something
called spectacular now watch what
happens when I load this page what
you're going to see here is just pure
JavaScript let me just Center this so we
see it here
miss effect was done using javascript
which is kind of cool and so we can look
at different functionality that
frameworks like script actives provides
for us for free so it's either the demo
down here now here's a demo so I was
like see this is javascript is allowing
us to do this drag-and-drop type of
thing or watch this is going to bounce
back i think see this is all JavaScript
so it's kind of cool stacking cedar
transparency when I click on it so this
is just some of the things that you can
do with javascript in script oculus it's
just one of these JavaScript packages
that are free that you can use to add
all kinds of dynamic cool functionality
or site without too much work
