acecomm I wanted to spend some time
today discussing JavaScript and PHP
based form validation specifically I'd
like to cover what it is why you might
want to consider using it and go over an
example that we're going to build
showing both JavaScript in our case
we're going to use jQuery and PHP based
form validation first of all what is
form validation for validation is the
process of double checking any user
input into your form you make sure that
the data that has been entered is valid
and in the expected format form
validation can involve something simple
for example just making sure that any
required fields are filled in or
something potentially more complicated
like checking that the email or phone
number is in the correct format proper
form validation is helpful everyone
involved it's helpful to you the
programmer because you can double check
your data and make sure that anything
being entered into the form is valid and
doesn't pose any security risks it's
helpful for the visitor because they can
be assured that any data that they're
entering into the form is mistake-free
it caches basic mistakes missing forms
incorrectly formatted fields it's also
helpful for the client because they're
the one receiving this data from the
form and they can be assured that any
data they're receiving is valid and
should be again in the correct format
I'm going to be talking about both
JavaScript and PHP based form validation
today javascript exists on the client
side on the visitors local computer it's
helpful because it allows them immediate
feedback to help them catch errors
however it can be easily bypassed a user
could easily disable JavaScript and then
the form validation would immediately
fail so it is important to have some
sort of server-side validation in place
as well in our case we're going to be
using PHP to handle that because PHP is
handled on the server side it's out of
the control of the visitor and you can
make sure that the visitor can
with it in anyway let me get started by
showing you what we're gonna be building
today so we're going to open up Kota and
in this demo I'm going to be discussing
as I said before both PHP and JavaScript
based form validation and to do the
JavaScript validation I'm going to be
using a plugin for a jQuery called
validate and it's probably the simplest
and easiest way I know to add JavaScript
validation this demo will include both
JavaScript and PHP based validation the
JavaScript will do most of the heavy
lifting if the JavaScript validation
passes the PHP validation should pass
too however it is important to remember
that you cannot always rely on
JavaScript validation to be in place the
user may disable JavaScript either
purposely or accidentally so you can't
always guarantee that it's going to be
in place so let me give you a demo here
let's go ahead and enter in name let me
enter in a phone number but let's say
for some reason or another I enter in an
extra digit you know this is I skip to
the next line it generates an error
message telling the user exactly what's
going on so I can go ahead fix that and
in this case it's asking for area code
as well so let me fill that in there we
go and we can also do the same thing
with email if we enter in a incorrect
email it'll give us an alert or if we
for example leave it blank
it'll also say this field is required so
it catches any required fields and make
sure that in our case the phone number
and the email field are formatted
correctly let's get started building
this form first of all I have coda open
which is my text editor of choice and
you also need to have something like
MAMP or way of running to see you can
make sure you can have access to the PHP
server
so the first thing I'm going to do is
let's get all the various files that
we're going to need set up so I'm going
to start with a new file I'm going to
start with the first one and we call it
form dot PHP and this is going to hold
our main form I'm also going to include
a couple other files we're gonna include
jQuery j/s which I'm going to go ahead
and download from the jQuery site so
jQuery comm I'm going to grab the
production version download and simply a
copy and paste the JavaScript code into
my file ok so that's the first thing I'm
gonna also create holiday tas and this
is going to be the JavaScript plug-in
this can be found either at Doc's jQuery
calm slash pug plugins slash validation
or on the home page of the developer in
this case it's bass bass assistance dot
de slash jQuery plugins slash jQuery
plug-in validation and I'm gonna go
ahead and grab the I'll just grab the
minified version of this and again this
copy and paste
that's all set let's also create a
success dot PHP and this is going to be
very simple I'm just gonna display
success message this will be the page
that'll appear if our form has been able
to be submitted correctly so we have for
success jQuery and a validate and I
believe that's all that we need to get
started so the last thing I'm going to
do for this video is an open up form dot
PHP and I'm going to insert a block of
code which I'll quickly discuss here we
go and I'm just inserting this as a big
block rather than typing it out
individually because it'll save us a
little bit of time but you may want to
pause the video and type everything out
or you can download the source files and
have direct access to them so to briefly
go over what we just pasted in it's a
pretty basic HTML document we have our
title we are including the jQuery JS
file and the validate J's file that we
just created we have a JavaScript block
doesn't have any code in it just yet we
have a style block which just includes
some basic form styling so minor things
styling the body the fieldset in our
form form labels text areas etc and then
finally down at the bottom within the
body tags we have the actual form it's
made up of labels and inputs in our case
we have name phone fax email comment a
required fields message and then finally
the submit button so let me make sure we
save this make close untitled here
and let's preview our forum and see what
we have so there we go
this will use as the basis for the rest
