so now I'm recording this nighttime vlog
to answer a quick question do I think
HTML and CSS and JavaScript are more
important than PHP and MySQL depends on
the context the language that you choose
the language that you're gonna program
in and how important it is it depends on
a few factors which I've discussed
another blogs we're gonna put it here
succinctly though I'm gonna put it here
succinctly number one depends on where
you live certain regions of the world
even certain regions within a country
will have different priorities different
languages will be more popular than
others number one number two depends on
the type of development work you want to
do if you want to be a freelancer I'm a
big advocate of PHP MySQL but you could
be doing a lot of WordPress work when
you're doing any web app development you
have to know your nation oh I have to
know your CSS you have to know some J s
and you know but what I mean by some GS
it typically means knowing a little bit
of jQuery if you want to get in the
startup world working for startups
chances are you have to do J s
JavaScript and node pH not PHP Python
and Django perhaps although I'm sure
there's startups that work with all the
other languages whether it be PHP Ruby
java.net whatnot if you want to go work
for large organizations that's Java and
that is well Java j2ee or Java spring
the spring Java spring is the
server-side framework or asp.net c-sharp
you know that's for large organizations
but when you're going to work for large
organizations typically you're going to
need some sort of higher level of
education HR departments human resources
departments are going to demand that
regardless of how good you are as a
coder but of course there's always
exceptions if you want to do Android
development you better learn Java if you
want to do i OS development you've got
to learn Swift so the best language
really depends on what you want to do
where you live the type of work you want
to do and what kind of education you
have it's very simple at this point in
time the larger point I'm trying to make
it's not
if it's not already obvious each
language
each framework each environment has its
pros and it's cons a lot of times the
pros and the cons are dependent on the
type of work that you are doing and of
course all the other factors but I
discussed that's why I don't get into
the language Wars anymore Ruby vs Python
versus pH P versus Java versus c-sharp
it's irrelevant today because the
language is now are very very powerful
regardless regardless it all depends on
what you want to do that's pretty much
