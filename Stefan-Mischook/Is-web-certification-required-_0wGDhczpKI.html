killer sites web bent or org and all the
other sites in this quick little video
blog I want to talk about web
certification more specifically how
important is certification in terms of
getting a web development or web design
job you see it out there it's pretty
common nowadays where a lot of web
training sites my competitors have
certifications you finish the course and
you get a nice certificate you get
certified and the reason you have this
now is because there's a demand for
certification from the people taking the
courses not from the employers so let me
qualify that so I've been developing
websites since 1994 and I've been hiring
web designers and web developers since
the 90s I've worked on projects from
small mom-and-pop type of websites all
the way up to web web apps for publicly
traded companies major banks cell cell
companies pharmaceutical and everything
in between and in that time I have never
never ever been asked if I was certified
by you know by a major institution let
alone some website that's been up for a
few years some you know some service
that teaches web design programming so
on certification in the WebSphere is is
almost next to useless in terms of
getting a job now for a system that we
have studio web which is used by schools
we provide a proof of passing a
certification for the school to prove
that the students actually have done the
material properly but that's about it
that's not for getting a job so I can
guarantee you that if you're looking to
get a certificate because you feel that
you're gonna walk in and show an
employer a certificate and they're gonna
care they're not gonna give a damn ooh
sorry they're not gonna care what
they're gonna care about is your track
record so you got to be able to show
what you've done and of course that's a
catch-22 before you can get the job you
got to show that you've done jobs well
I'll give you the short version how to
do that when you have certain amount of
skills build your first site you have to
have a site for yourself so build your
first site right to show your skills and
then from there you find a friend or
friends friend or a relative who needs a
site for their small business or
business of thinking about building
whatever bills their site for free and
the process of doing this with every new
site that you start and complete is
gonna give you the demo reel if you will
to borrow from the film industry it's
going to give you that demo it's going
to be able to show to prospective people
who would hire you whether as a
subcontractor or as a full-time position
they're gonna look at that they're going
to look at your ability to produce
product to produce in this case web
sites and web apps so I see that a bit
and I get people emailing me call me you
know how about certification this is
again the whole certification business
and a lot of times when people offer
them is simply because the people
looking to get the training wrongly
assume that certification is going to
get them a job it won't it won't the
only time where some sort of credential
in that regard plays a role in the in
the development world and web world is
if you're going to try to get a job
working for a huge organization like
Google or an apple or Pricewaterhouse or
something like that massive organization
but they're not going to be looking for
a certificate from X Y Z's website
online what they're gonna be looking for
it's called side degrees they're gonna
be looking for a computer engineering
degrees they're gonna looking for people
who have
degrees from these these big accredited
universities but that's the exception
and even even in that situation I've
I've gotten jobs and work in the past
with no comps I'd agree and I just
showed him my portfolio and they said we
don't care what your degree is you're
you know how to code and that was all
that mattered so that's my advice to you
don't be so concerned about the
certification be much more concerned
about building up a track record which
is the portfolio site now in the
portfolio sites and how do you do it you
do your own you do freebies for friends
and family and slowly slowly slowly with
every new safe that you complete or
webapp your credentials will increase
and your price will increase so you're
gonna have to start off being a little
bit cheaper or free is pretty cheap and
then when you start charging you're
gonna start be able to charge a little
bit more a little bit more a little bit
more a little bit more I'm not giving
you a dollar amount because it depends
on where you live in the world right
because the cost of living in Thailand
for instance is much less than it is in
San Francisco or where I am in Montreal
so as as such you know you can work for
much less per hour locally and live a
great middle-class lifestyle are much
higher depending on how good you get and
over time as you become more skilled you
will become much more productive so
let's I'll use round numbers and this
point numbers out of out of the air so
let's say you start off at $20 an hour
once you start doing you've done your
freebie accord your freebie sites and
you've gained some skill you're worth
$20 an hour at that point that's what
you're worth because you work at a
certain speed and there's a level of
sophistication in the work that you do
but let's say four or five sites later
or apps later then you can you know you
bump it up slowly twenty to twenty-five
thirty an hour now the $30 an hour guy
is probably much more productive than
the 20 that's why he's worth thirty
because you get a lot more done in less
time and the results of your work is far
more as far better same thing with the
forty fifty hundred dollar an hour ago
and so on so it is your per hour rate
has a lot to do with how productive you
are and that's the great thing about
coding and web development
it's a merit it's a true meritocracy
meaning you your pay is really dictated
by how how skilled you are rather than
how many years experience who you know
this kind of thing no experience plays a
major role you know because it it
suggests a certain level of skill but
like in other professions where you can
have people with tons of experience but
they're not really that good whereas
with the web and with development in
general you can see how good they are
based on the apps they produce and how
viable those apps are when I say when I
mean viable apps I mean that the code is
clean it's modular it's it's very
Photoshop anyway that's my two cents
