project by heading on over to our text
editor so whatever text editor you're
using we're in the index.html file which
if you are following along can be found
in the html5 version 3 progress so here
we are with the simple index page there
is a CSS folder and unlike the previous
you'll see that there's two CSS files
here one is going to be dealing with the
jquery CSS that we will need as soon as
we implement it and you'll notice that
there is no j/s or javascript folder
which if i did download the minimized
version of the jquery tools i would
created folder for it and we'd have
linked to it but as is i'll show you how
we can just download it from their
server and that'll still allow us to
work with that code so let's begin by
going to that index HTML page the one
I've just told you to open and you'll
see in here it's got some very simple
information and I think what we're going
to tackle first is working with the HTML
and we'll prepare that before we go into
working with the jQuery so first thing I
want you to do is to look at this
section here called header and him and
there's a header and there's an image
inside of it and as we've been working
with up to this point it's just that
simple static graphic that's there well
we're going to change a few things first
of all the NM ID I'm going to actually
convert that to a class just something
that if we wanted to use over and over
again we could just by making it a class
and that's something I think would be
useful for us also the word and nim I
want you to change that to images
alright so at this point we've got one
image inside of this header container
but what we're going to be doing is
creating a number of slides in this sort
of slide show that we're going to
implement so let me just come up to the
top first and foremost and I'm just
going to add a little HTML comment in
here and i'll just say container for the
slides so along with that i'm going to
copy this information and right after
that opening header let's just put in
first slide all right so what are we
doing with that first slide well first
and foremost I want you to wrap it
inside of a div container we don't have
to worry about giving them any kind of
names because our javascript is going to
work to our advantage in just a second
you'll kind of see the real power of
working with in this kind of environment
what about this information here yeah
you can just leave it as it is it's not
really a problem now let's come in here
and we will copy all this information
from first slide on because we're going
to add a little comment in here and
we'll call this one second slide and
will continue in this fashion the only
other thing I want to do is to provide
multiple images we don't want to just
sliding through the same one of course
so I've provided you with in your images
folder a image called killer frog 2.jpg
and as you might imagine since we're
working with three of these I'll copy
this information and here now I'll be
able to say third slide and at this
point we can reference killer frog 3 the
alt information you don't really have to
change this is just for testing purposes
but you know later on that might be
something that you want to adjust as
well here I'll just come in and say two
and three there you go so we've pretty
much got a very simple setup here
and the container for the slides is sort
of being referenced with three images
inside of it now if we were to just
preview this see it's not really what we
intended to look like well first of all
you can see that my three images
supposed to be here there's the alt tag
and it's missing and that's more than
likely because I've just got to move the
images in there this shouldn't be a
problem for you when you're working so
i'll just make sure that in the images
folder for the finished files i'm going
to copy this and bring it into the
images folder here alright so that
shouldn't be a problem for you but just
to show you what you will be seeing is
something that looks like this so we've
got three images now how do we start
implementing these three images for them
to be number one sort of placed on top
of each other and sort of cross fading
within them to do that let's move over
to our HTML once again so we've got the
basic setup here in place for our images
and their div containers and we notice
that there is a very important class
here called images of course you can
call it whatever you want but for the
example that i'm using we're going to
call it images along with this however i
also want to give some information that
we're going to be using for those little
buttons at the very bottom of the images
if you remember and i'll actually show
them to you just go back to our work
here and this is the earlier finished
one if you remember and it's these three
elements right here these small little
buttons and those ones are also going to
be implemented in our design so how do
we go about doing that well first of all
i'm just going to insert a HTML comment
and then the next thing we're going to
do is to just come in here and say the
tabs these are the tabs that are going
to be moving our elements around so
these tabs we're going to place them
within a container and you know just a
simple div is fine it could be in
anything but a simple div in this case I
think we'll be fine now much like we
were doing before we're going to
implement a class it's a class that we
will call slide tabs all right so we're
going to close this div and in fact I'm
going to do that as well and within here
we're going to just put in simple a tags
simple anchor tag and each of these is
going to have just a simple href that's
not really going to do anything at the
moment although if you wanted them to
actually go somewhere you could just put
in a URL right here but I just need a
little dummy reference and there's
really nothing inside of these so we're
just going to make one and copy it and
then introduce two more because if you
remember we have three of these little
buttons three buttons three images if
you had more images you just include
another div with an image inside of it
and you also would include another a
right here underneath this and you'll
see it's very flexible and you can put
in as many as you want in fact however
after a certain point there might be
some loading issues that you should be
aware of so we can save this and if we
were to preview this in our browser
let's see that nothing really much has
changed you don't really see any of
those little links wherever they're
supposed to be there supposed to be
right underneath here so we're going to
have to do little something with CSS to
make these things visible and I'm going
to provide you with an image that you
can use as well we're also going to have
to now address getting the links to that
so
ss folder as well as the links to our
jquery tools file the jas file and we'll
implement a little bit of JavaScript as
well so come back in the next video and
we'll take care of all of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
