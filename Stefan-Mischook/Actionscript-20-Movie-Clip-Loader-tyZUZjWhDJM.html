make this website work is something
called the movie clip loader object and
what it does is control how all of the
SWFs are going to be loaded on top of
this master movie you'll notice that the
movie clip loader object is going to be
written on the master and because of
that level zero will control the loading
of all movies so even if we press a
button on another level when we want to
load a movie we just refer to level zero
and we say hey get the movie clip loader
object on level zero load another movie
for me so this is effectively going to
control everything that has to do with
loading in our entire flash website in
the past when we want it to confess we
often would use something called load
movie or load movie num I'll explain
that a little bit more to you when we're
looking at the differences between
ActionScript 2.0 and 1.0 now if anybody
ever needs to do something in 1.0
ActionScript you should use the load
movie num in place of the movie clip
loader unfortunately though it doesn't
really give us all of the capabilities
that the movie clip loader object does
so what we're going to be doing is
looking at the movie clip loader object
creating something called a listener and
that listener is also going to help us
to work with percentage freeloaders
among other things so in order to get
started let's go to the master file
which you'll find in your starter folder
and select the a ActionScript layer open
up the ActionScript window and type this
in
var gonna declare a variable just as we
normally do and when we do we're going
to save our my MCL which is going to be
short for movie clip loader and you can
see if we scroll down here you'll notice
a movie clip loader incidentally if you
were to just write this out with a
capital mo the ie clip loader and you'll
notice it turns blue indicating that
this is in fact something that's built
into flash so a new variable called my
MCL
we're strict data typing it to call it a
movie clip loader object but effectively
we're going to have to tell flash that
this is in fact a new movie clip loader
object
and you put in your brackets and a
semicolon that is all you really need to
do to to initialize and create that new
movie clip loader object and now
whenever we will need to load something
all we really need to do is to call my
MCL or the movie clip loader object for
example I could say my MCL let's make
sure that that's all in capitals the way
I wrote it dot check out what happens
even though it's something that we
created ourselves it knows that my MCL
is a movie clip loader object and it
gives us all of the elements that we can
add to the movie clip loader object most
importantly load clip notice the code
hinting here tells me the URL well what
clip do you really want to load and
second element that we have to add here
is target what's the target in our case
we're going to be loading our movie
clips onto a level you will also be well
aware that you can load movie clips into
SWFs into empty movie clips and in that
case we wouldn't be referring to
anything on a level however I'm going to
be putting this on a level so if for
example the killer sights dot SWF file
was the first one that you wanted to
have loaded you could do this
just open your quotations write the name
of your SWF
put a comma after that and then just
indicate what level you want this to
load on so I'm going to indicate loaded
on level five so notice what we've done
here variable my MCL movie clip loader
we told flash it's a new movie clip
loader object then any time we call it
we say hey my MCL load this clip killer
sites not SWF onto level five let's test
it out and see what happens
so as you can see although there's no
text in place or anything like that done
yet what it does show you is that just
by simply stating my MCL and telling it
to load a clip you've done this
effectively now for those of you who are
working with ActionScript 1.0 or
anything below a version seven of flash
the older way of doing this was to work
with something called load movie num I'm
gonna comment this out temporarily and
it will be temporary because we're gonna
be doing this again and what I am going
to introduce to you here is load movie
num load movie or load movie num there
are two different ones load movie was
specifically used to load into empty
movie clips load movie num as the num
implies a numbered layer or level so
here exactly the same thing that I did
before I'll copy/paste it
soloed movie num and we're loading this
movie onto level 5 effectively does the
same thing right so why do we bother
doing the movie clip loader object well
the real reason to use this is simply
because it's gonna afford us a whole
bunch of other advantages that we don't
get with the load movie num or load
movie statement so by doing it this way
as you'll see soon enough we're going to
be able to also access percentage pre
loading among other things so let's
stick with this for now and that will
explain to you the basics of setting up
your movie clip loader</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
