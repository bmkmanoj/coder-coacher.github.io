Flash content to our web page I'm gonna
ask you to close the index and remember
we're working from this template simply
because we can update all of our pages
all at once now here we are back in that
template and what I want to show you in
this particular video is how we can
insert some JavaScript inside of our
sections as you can see right here so
there's a couple of things that I want
to do perhaps what we can do is right
underneath these links we can add a
little bit of content down at the bottom
here so we're kind of cluttering up our
page I know but hypothetically speaking
let's imagine we did have this
information or perhaps we could have
even inserted something else right under
here if we wish so let's say perhaps we
can do it on this side so here I'm just
going to insert a new paragraph and once
we have that paragraph in place what
we're going to be doing with that is to
have our cursor embedded right over here
on this section and you'll notice that
at this point I'm going to come up to
the top and you can see that here we
have images like a rollover image is one
thing normally by default it just says
image and it looks like this the icon
but if you click down on the little
arrow you'll see rollover image and one
of the most common things that are often
times associated with JavaScript on
webpages is a rollover image so I'm
gonna have an advertisement here but
this one's going to be a rollover image
so let's try this I'm going to click on
rollover image right here and what I'm
gonna do is to give it an image name and
I'm just going to call this let's say
killer sites ad 2 and the original image
if we browse for it you'll notice that
in the stitching time start folder I
happen to have placed in here the images
folder something called add up and
something called add over so the add up
file is the first one in other words
what's the what's the advertisement look
like
when we have an advertisement on the up
in other words we haven't touched down
on this we haven't done anything along
those lines or anything like that so
when we roll over this that's when the
ad over should appear alternate text I'm
just gonna say ad for now you can add
whatever you want and let's say when
clicked go to URL now which URL do we
want to go to well if this is an
advertisement for killer site so I'm
gonna say HTTP colon slash slash wwq
sites com
so with that in place you'll notice that
when we click on this particular object
we'll also be able to go to a particular
website now because it was inside of a
paragraph if you remember I made it in a
paragraph and because of that it's off
the edges and of course I've made it the
same size as the other one so let's
preview this in our browser and let's
see what that looks like okay so now I
have another advertisement here and if I
roll over it it says killer sites video
tutorials right underneath the other one
and if I were in fact to click on it
aah-ha takes us to killer sites com
great so here what I'm gonna do at this
point is to just quit my browser we can
do that that's not a problem and we'll
go back to Dreamweaver for a second now
everything looks great and there's
really no problems with that but
whenever you have Dreamweaver add
information like it's done here in other
words ad in this case our JavaScript
information if I go to the code view
there's something that's been added well
certainly we can look at what's been
added here and you'll notice that in
that div there's a new paragraph and it
has some you know strong information in
there with regards to mouse over and
stuff like that and that I don't really
mind but what I don't really like is the
addition of all of this javascript in
the head section of my document remember
to make this document be much more you
know search engine-friendly the better
thing for us
is to externalize a lot of this code and
they've done such a good job doing that
when we added the flash object and as
you can see it it had an external JS
file that was in this scripts folder so
what I want to be doing with this is
certainly externalizing all of the code
that I'm using right here so let me walk
you through how we can do that first of
all what I want you to do is to take all
of the code that's inside of this script
tag as you can see here and when you
have all of that code in here I want you
to then select it all and press can
command X or ctrl X on a PC and notice
we've removed everything from those
script tags but we left the script tags
themselves and notice I left the closing
tag as well just as we had to do in this
one also so at this point means
certainly you can refresh that that's
not a problem but what I want you to now
do is to create a new folder or a new
file I should say rather and we'll go to
blank page and this time we're going to
say JavaScript make me a blank
JavaScript file well really that's just
a blank document but I'm going to select
everything that's in here and press
command V to paste in all of those
JavaScript code that we take took from
the template so now we're going to save
this we're gonna say file save and we're
gonna put it in the scripts folder
because well we have scripts there so
might as well put another J's script in
there and I'm just gonna call this roll
over dot J s I'll save that there so we
can close that we don't need that
anymore
now this page our index page remember or
our template in this case it has not
been updated well what that means is
here I have you know the scripts for
JavaScript but it doesn't know where to
find it and you'll notice we need the
source attribute so just do this put
your cursor right before the closing of
that opening tag put a space there and
you'll see the little drop down and
we'll say double-click on source so when
you do that it's going to
prompt you to go searching or browsing
for the source so it'll point right to
your scripts folder and there it is
rollover J is the one that we just
created perfect so now it's got it in
there we're gonna hit refresh we're
going to hit save and notice because
it's a template it's gonna update all of
these pages perfect that's exactly what
we want press close and now we can open
up our index page if you wish and here's
the design view right and as you can see
there's our little object and if we
preview this in the browser we'll see
that every page has been updated every
page has this little rollover effect for
example here's the portfolio page it's
got the flash and it's got the working
rollover and the beautiful part of it is
that if we look at our code view in here
the head section does not have you know
an inordinate amount of JavaScript in
there we've reduced that to this one
simple line instead of like 20 lines of
code all of that code has been
externalized in this new rollover
jeaious file isn't that great so that's
how we insert JavaScript using
Dreamweaver and when we come back we'll
start talking about some other things
