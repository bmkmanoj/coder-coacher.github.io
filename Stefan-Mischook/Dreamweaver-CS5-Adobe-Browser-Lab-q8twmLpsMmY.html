been integrated inside of Dreamweaver
cs5 and as you can see up at the top
here you can learn more about this
feature by going to the CS live services
and in order to use any of the CS Live
features what you have to do is to
actually setup yourself with an Adobe ID
and you can actually opt in to the CS
Live services and there's a number of
great services available although the
one that I'm talking to you about right
now it's something called browser lab
which is really kind of cool and
basically what these you'll have a full
year's worth of the CS Live service as
soon as you sign in and get yourself all
set up and when you do notice this right
above your CS styles you should have my
default the Adobe browser lab window if
you double click it you can open and
close it just like that if you don't see
it you got always go to window and then
go to your browser lab as well and when
you are looking for your Adobe browser
lab just remember here you can always go
to the Adobe browser lab help about the
browser lab different things like this
so once you've you got yourself set up
you can just hit the preview button and
as you can see here what I'm attempting
to do is to preview my particular page
that we've been working on whether it's
a fixed pixel or a liquid based design
whatever the case may be and what
browser lab will do is really quite
amazing notice here if you were to go to
the home section on browser lab you'd
have some information some news and
updates tips and tricks which are really
good great ways to sort of see what
you're doing and understand it browser
sets well here's the idea of browser lab
basically what it's attempting to do is
to determine and to preview what your
browser what your website will look like
in Firefox 3.0 as you can see I've got
that checked off for Mac and for Windows
I've got Internet Explorer 7 for Windows
you could get 8 as well safari 3.0 for
mac you know so there's all kinds of
different things that you can do in here
and these are the browser orders and you
can check off which ones you want now if
we do go to the test area it'll take a
little while but it should load for all
of your browsers and what do you mean by
all of the browsers well check it out
you can go to the views you can say show
me one up and one up is showing you
Firefox 3.0 for the Mac and that's what
your website looks like if we did the
two up version check it out look this is
Firefox for OSX on the Mac Safari for OS
X on the Mac well what if I wanted to
see what the Windows version of Firefox
looks like ah look at that you see the
difference in the text there's no
anti-alias being applied to the text as
there is here with the outlines on a Mac
as it is in Firefox on Windows so see by
previewing in this fashion you know you
kind of look at things and you say you
know maybe I don't like the way my text
looks here let's look at it in Internet
Explorer 7 well you can see the text
does look a little bit better the
default text than it did in the other
browser Firefox on Windows so
nevertheless you see all of these things
are really great and are necessary for
you to understand now check out this one
it's really cool called onion skin
notice right now it's saying Firefox OS
X and here is Firefox for Windows and
look right now fifty/fifty just showing
you what things are looking like and
remember how we were talking about
margin issues inside of different
browsers right and for example if I were
to choose the internet 7 Internet
Explorer 7 look at that big spacing
difference here and there and as you can
see this is just OS X this is just
Internet 7 or IE 7 and you can see how
the positioning sort of does change so
you've really got to be flexible when
you're building out your pages and it's
so important to test out your work now
if this was actually uploaded to a
server if I had that information and by
the way look you can even set up rulers
in here and you can sort of see exactly
how many pixels things are and where
they're looking and what they look like
and you can even move this
let's imagine that I wanted this to be
you know zero zero right here and if you
did want that to happen you know you
could just take that and reposition it
as I'm doing right there and we could
really get a sense look it's almost like
50 pixels off between what well that's
what it is on Firefox and OSX and look
at the difference inside of Internet
Explorer 7 right so there's barely any
pixel amount of any pixel space that's
been given there but you can see it here
against the edge and again if you don't
want to have that you can move now your
elements back to where we had it before
so you just have to click here and just
come in there and let go now you've got
your zero zero positioning back again so
as you can see it's just sort of showing
you the differences between those two
really kind of cool thing now if this
was on a server you could just come in
here and you know ww-whatever
Apple comm for example and as you can
see you can request it to happen over
here in Firefox 3.0 or in Windows this
seems to failed anyways we'll see what's
what's the reason for that we can retry
and you see it's showing me what the
Windows version is wasn't able to reload
it anyways I must have made a mistake or
something nevertheless right as you can
see there's a lot of different things
that you can do and you can work with
the different browser sets also there's
different languages here and hotkeys you
can see your different shortcuts for
example if you want to go through the
left and the right browser visibility
you can use your arrow keys you can use
your number keys for one - up up and
down arrows for next and previous right
so if we were to go to the test
and here we are at windows 7 let's see
did it actually load yeah see so now if
I go down it'll go to Safari OSX or
Firefox 4 window Internet Explorer 4
window or up arrow we can go previous
see so it's all different ways of
showing that
again if you wanted to show the onion
skin effect you can really get to see
the difference between your your what
your website looks in different browsers
so adobe browser lab is a really cool
addition inside of the new cs5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
