little bit more about creating your own
little custom shapes and working with
the path tools as well here's a great
way that you can take something that is
based on photograph and turn it into a
great little illustration vector drawing
that you can use with the vector tools
and the custom shapes so again you don't
have to be a great illustrator nowadays
simply because you've got a lot of
potential to work with just dealing with
imagery and you can find imagery all
over the web there's a lot of free
images that you can use through Creative
Commons or any of the other websites
that allow for that type of licensing or
you could even find some images in the
Browse menu of photo shops own stock
photos so nevertheless as I mentioned
here we have a very simple image of a
bear tree but what I want to be doing is
converting this into a black and white
illustration and really I'm just
concerned with the tree itself although
maybe we could even grab a little bit of
the grass so let me walk you through the
steps on how to do just that so the
first thing that we're going to do is to
try and convert this into something
that's a little bit more easily
selectable in other words what I really
want to try and do is just convert this
thing into more of a black and white
image that we can sort of play around
with there's an any number of different
ways that we can manage this inside of
Photoshop one of the first things that
you can try and do is to just work with
brightness and contrast you can use
legacy if you're used to working with
older versions of Photoshop or as you
can see here I can just try and increase
some of the brightness increase some of
that contrast maybe bring down some of
that brightness and look for more of
that contrast right I really want to see
some of these leafy greens in there well
actually there's no greens but sort of
the branches a little bit better so
that's just the start of things we can
then go to image adjustments you can
even play with levels right as you can
see here I can sort of blow out these
levels so that the mid points the bright
points in here are sort of brought in a
little
closer and by doing that you control a
little bit more about the contrast of
the images and how they're sort of being
perceived inside a Photoshop as you can
see here I'm just trying to get a little
bit more detail in these areas well now
that that's done we can then try to go
into our adjustments and we can try
something called threshold and threshold
we'll convert this into our black and
white image that we're looking for I can
even come in here and clean up a couple
of areas but notice with that threshold
you can also control a little bit more
about how dark or bright these things
are going to become so notice I'm just
sliding this along and I'm sort of
bringing it to about this point well at
this stage we can crop out the section
that we want to keep notice and I'm
gonna go in there and I'm gonna clean up
some of these areas that we're gonna be
playing with in just a second so notice
here there's a good portion of this you
could certainly mask it out but in this
case it's going to be rather permanent
I'm just going to use a simple eraser
tool not always my tool of choice but in
this case I think it'll work just fine
for us notice I'm just going in there
and if you ever make a mistake just ctrl
Z to get out of that notice here I'm
just coming in and eliminating all of
this extra space by the way the square
bracket is the shortcut to increase the
size of your brush and as you can see
here I'm just going in and cleaning up a
little bit of the elements left square
bracket to reduce the size of your brush
you can also like come in here and take
out some of these little dots if you
don't really want them so what you're
going to end up with this sort of like
this black and white imagery that you
have here at this point it's really easy
to go in there and make a selection with
the magic wand tool now as you can see
I've got a selection of all of this
black area let's say for example you
just wanted the tree I could have you
know made sure that the selection did
not include the bottom portion here
about a month at so I'm not sure so I'm
leaving it in place at this point check
it out we're going to go to our paths
and what I want to do as you can see
here is to make a work path from the
selection so I've got that selection
marching ants going around there and now
I make a work path based on that
selection so as you can see here we've
got a work path with this work path now
selected I can come in here and say edit
define custom shape so now these trees
are going to be part of my custom shape
so I'll call this the bear tree custom
shape
well at this point we don't even need to
save this stuff and I can come to a
blank new canvas and using the vector
tools and look this is the custom shape
tool which if I press down on my victim
vector tools here the rectangle tool is
a default but I want the custom shape
tool sorry about that so here's another
way to access it and look at the very
bottom of your list what do you have
that new tree that you just created and
check it out you can sorry let me just
try that again at this point you can
create that object as many of them as
you wish
notice you've got in your layer palette
I'll get rid of this small one you've
got that shape it can be whatever color
you want notice how nice it looks as a
vector file it's really worked out quite
well for us and you can change this to
whatever you color you want remember how
we did that with our basic shapes right
so these can be really easily adapted
into any kind of design inside Photoshop
and as I said need not have to require a
good amount of skill as an illustrator
just take any kind of image and you can
turn it into a vector shape for yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
