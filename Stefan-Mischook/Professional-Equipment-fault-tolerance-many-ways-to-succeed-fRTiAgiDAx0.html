camera yet and I should be out of focus
and why am i doing this now I'm just
trying to spice up the videos a little
bit so this vlog is going to be a little
bit about coding a little bit about
business and stuff related so why did I
walk off or come off camera view and
then come into camera view and where I
should be in focus now or when I first
walked in I should have been in focus
two things number one I went out after
about a year and a half of doing YouTube
videos every day as a hobby and
experiment and as a way to do little a
be testing as they would say in
psychology I wanted to test out
different ideas as well so I had a
figure YouTube was a good place to
explore that with the audience and I got
to meet some people as well so it's kind
of cool this YouTube thing it's still as
much as it as it is a hobby
well when we've back up here when I
first got into it was more or less a
hobby and experiment also wanting to
improve my ability to speak on camera
now you wouldn't think that given how I
was just stuttering two seconds ago but
it's really helped quite a bit
alright but now after your year and four
months or something I've done 400 blogs
like this and so I'm much more
comfortable in front of the camera it's
it's very relaxing now for me and it's
still a hobby and I really enjoy it I
can't think I can't wait to come in
front of the camera and the only thing
that keeps me from doing three videos a
day is that I have you know I have to do
other work but it's also become a way a
tool for me it's a baby I've been able
to expose my work to a bunch of people
out there I've been able to refine my
skill sets of course and I've been able
to test out different ideas
and get feedback from people so if you
participate in that I appreciate it
because it's just kind of useful people
who don't remember the web free web this
type of information was extremely
extremely extremely expensive to get at
sort of market sampling and so on when I
started my first business I was eighteen
years old so I was like eight hundred
thousand years ago about eight hundred
thousand years ago a breaking news staff
lies about when he started his business
he said it was eight hundred thousand
years ago and that's factually incorrect
anyway that was a joke no so I started I
was eighteen so that's a long time ago
give them an giving that I'm in my late
40s anyhow this is pre web in fact I
started my first business pre web and I
had to do research back in those days
using traditional means I had to go to
libraries and and buy reports and stuff
I wasn't in the tech business I was an
import-export business and then it had
water purification products and so on
all right went off on the tangent so
let's talk about this huge camera I
bought very expensive camera and if you
were to ask me two years ago if I would
have bought this kind of pro camera I
would have said no chance now what I do
but now that studio web which is my core
business which is an educational app
it's a sass that schools used over
different parts well bunch of places in
US Canada South Africa and Asia is used
quite a bit South America it's used and
it's used all over place and it's
growing and so now that the core app and
its functionality and the core
curriculum is in place I'm ready for the
next stage the next stage is of course
marketing and marketing is so important
some famous some famous marketer and
whose name I forget said that the last
stage in the manufacturing process is
actually the marketing if you have a
great product it doesn't matter if it's
great if you don't market it properly
and one of the examples our stands out
for me is David Bowie David Bowie one of
the most famous
artists of our time he does back a year
or so ago but about five six years ago
he released an album and he decided not
to promote it and marketers tore it in
the record business or excuse me in the
music business you tour to promote your
albums and he decided not to and even
though he's one of the most important
artists in the last 50 60 years he his
album went nowhere because he didn't
promote him and I don't know if it was
good or bad I didn't even listen to it
you know and I'm a huge David Bowie fan
and nonetheless by not marketing it he
doomed the product to failure
so whatever things you have to do when
you get out there if you be decide to
become an entrepreneur and no matter
what type of business you get into it
you're gonna have to go out there and
promote and market it these days that
means a website that means social media
first and foremost so there are two most
important things traditional media
whether it be radio TV or newspapers
that's for the most part yeah you know
it also paid paid click advertising on
Google or I guess Bing for to people who
use Bing anyway so because of that
because I was getting into the marketing
phase of my business and I used the ATD
let me get that for all my YouTube
videos I use this thing up into the
recent ones this is a Canon a TD I don't
know if it's in focus or not this is a
great camera it's like a mid-level it's
a mid-level consumer camera and shoots
video and it's pretty good cameras got
got everybody else BP at two for two
reasons a the skin tones and B the
autofocus system on the Canon is the
best Tony is catching up at canons the
best and so that's why if you're a
youtuber or your solo video shooter this
is the camera for you if you're starting
out so I use this camera for a year and
a half shot four hundred videos with
this at least for YouTube and I shot
other videos for off of YouTube so very
good I'm still keeping it for Stills and
for other things but I decided it was
time to
great so I upgraded to this camera here
another camera but a canon cinema line
and it's Mutual's buck-buck are-- nose
compared to this it's not even close a
lot of people might say it's overkill
but I decided since this was going to be
key to my work every day I wanted all
the capabilities but this pro camera was
gonna give me and it give me many
capabilities beyond video quality now
you may not see the video quality now
because I have it basically on its
lowest setting at this point for
vlogging it's it's you know fine but
it's got all kinds of other capabilities
that this camera doesn't have so I don't
have to worry about shooting video it's
much more fault tolerant it's kind of
like investing in a hardcore better
servers where you know the servers are
not going to go down you know they're
gonna be automatic redundancies
automatic backups so you don't have to
worry about things messing up on you
it's mission-critical so I'm doing over
the year I'm gonna do hundreds of videos
and I don't want to mess around with
autofocus seeing with lighting I don't
want to mess around with color I don't
wanna mess around with sound I know that
this camera nothing's perfect but this
camera is far more capable than this
camera and most other cameras I use it
and I paid a premium for it another
thing I got and they can walk off walk
off camera has I got this wireless
lavalier mic and it it's a pro mic cost
a lot of money to but you know what it
does
again its fault tolerance meaning it
tolerates faults much more effectively
than your entry-level mic your
middle-of-the-road mic first of all it
sounds better I think a lot of people
might not hear two sound difference but
what it does do is that it has
rock-solid connectivity so I know that
you know I'm in my kitchen now and I'm
preparing
quick tea here you can still hear me
clearly another thing that I know is
that it hasn't caught he has caught an
attenuator it's basically a tool or
system built into it that it will deal
with the variations and loudness in my
voice so I can talk really loud or I can
talk at a very low voice and you'll
still hear me pretty clearly so it
manages that automatically which is
amazing you don't hear it
fluctuating which is very cool and
another thing that it does it takes care
of de-essing the piercing essing sounds
but I would get from my other mic why do
I want this because I don't have to deal
with it in post
I don't have to edit this and manage the
sound and so on I don't have to do any
of that Cheers so that's a big reason
why you buy pro equipment whether it be
cameras wireless mics or IDE s software
code editors you pay a little bit more
money you pay low money for the
professional tools so you get the
professional workflow and the one thing
that is most important as a professional
entrepreneur software developer is to
have a smooth workflow so that you're
calm and relax mentally you're not doing
headaches of configurations and so forth
so that you can get out the best work
possible in the least amount of time as
you develop your skills and as you
develop in your career whether you're
again entrepreneur or coder time is the
most precious thing which you have
that's what you're going to discover so
I rather spend two three times more for
a professional tool to save me a lot of
time yeah that's a that's an important
rule the important rule and I'm going to
talk about that at length in my business
battle plan course something I've
learned the hard way in different
industries right whenever whenever
here's the rule whenever I try to cheap
out on something it always ends up
costing me a much more in the end
so anyway keep that in mind of course
when you're first starting out or you're
broke so you get what you can but it's
something to just keep it back here in
mind
don't try to cheap out you know in your
student yeah you got to go
but when you get parole having these
tools that make it easy for you they're
worth their weight you know so another
thing I want to talk about is having
always having dual outcomes or dual
potential outs in whatever you do this
is something I always try to do so let
me give you a quick example when I build
a course for Studio Webb the Python
course the JavaScript course many of the
courses in the IWD package the
development package the key courses the
foundation courses and there's a huge
amount of work in those courses they
were designed specifically for studio
web which is my interactive app and it's
in my opinion it's the best one out
there in the market by far that's why I
got more and more schools adopting it
and so I built those courses the Python
JavaScript html5 css3 the PHP I built
those specific courses forced to do web
but I also leveraged them for the retail
market totally different markets so once
institutional schools and one is for
retail in I had WD for instance so
there's an example of dual purpose if
you will though the target market really
is Studio web I leverage that for retail
as well so it's kind of a dual purpose
there with this camera here for example
because it's a high-end cinema camera
and most people don't need to film
videos every day like me they they would
rip these things now the cost of rental
of these cameras basically I see in the
market is a proxy is more significantly
more as 50% more than my monthly cost
for this thing so if you divide up the
payments on this now I could have bought
a cache not a problem but then Canon
said to me we'll give it to you no
interest no interest free money right so
why put down the money when you can just
pay canon a monthly fee on no interest
that's the best way to go about doing it
never least something but you can't
afford to buy with cash never buy it
never
never have credit card debt credit cards
debt is the stupidest debt you could
possibly have why because you're paying
huge interest rates so for me I use
credit cards all the time one credit
card but I pay off the balance every
month I never pay interest on my credit
card debt I never pay interest on my
credit card credit cards are
transactional tools they're there to
facilitate the process of acquiring
goods or services and I got this great
credit card where triples my warranties
on anything that I do buy any help so I
bought this camera and I could have paid
it outright but it you know because it
was 0% interest why not so I buy it and
my monthly cost to buy this I could
cover the total cost plus an extra 50%
if I just rent it out this camera once a
month one day a month now I don't know
if I'm gonna do that because I use a
quite a bit but if somebody I could do
to to cover all my costs and again if I
would have got a middle-of-the-road
camera there wouldn't been no rental
market for it because people just by the
middle of the road but this camera a lot
of people won't buy it but they'll rent
it so it creates a market opportunity
for me it creates a second out for Less
camera another reason I bought a
high-end camera and bought a high-end
device it gives me the second out where
I've discovered in my life and if you
buy a designer furniture designer
products top-of-the-line is stuff it
holds its value so I it has to be the
cream of the crop so I bought like
high-end designer furniture but the name
brands not known so much the
italian-built and etc really nice stuff
but I'm having I have a difficult time
trying to sell if I want to sell it
I've tried experiments and put on Kijiji
Craigslist and see what happens on the
other hand with my Eames furniture which
is a super high-end like that walls
Brown thing as aims as chairs Eames this
is like world-class furniture it doesn't
get any higher end and if I want to sell
it I can sell it for just about what I
paid for it
like this and I've done it a few times
and it's because it's the high-end so
when you're looking at anything that you
do I don't know if you understand this
tangent or not but when you're looking
at anything that you do you
he's try to figure out how can i benefit
in this activity in more than one way
are there two outs so with my video
courses I created for City web but I
know I can market them sell them to the
public as well for his camera I could I
need the camera and all the advantages I
talked about but I could also rent it
out because it's super high and and if I
want to sell it because it's super
high-end unless something happens in the
market I could probably get at least
three-quarters of my money back so
people are so you have to look at that
and judge the price of the camera
because if you if it retains a lot of
its value because it's super high-end
did you really pay that huge price tag
for it not really because if you could
sell it two years later and get 75
percent of your money you didn't really
spend that whole you know what I mean
you only spent a small fraction and of
course because I have because I have a
business of a corporation it's bought by
the corporation it's a write-off on the
taxes so it's it's not nearly as
expensive as you think here's the thing
though you need either to cash or you
need to credit and that's why and you
get the credit when you have the cash
that's the irony about life if you have
a lot of cash you can get credit pretty
easily and keep it good and credit
history but I'm not an advocate of debt
by the way I'm going off as a Sunday
afternoon so I'm going off on a tangent
here I have no debt I don't carry that I
have no debt the only debt you should
have is investment debt and very secure
assets like you know rental property
users or something like that you know
but don't are or assets that are really
core to your business expensive
computers or whatnot but again I'll get
into all the details of my business
course one of the things I'm going to
talk about in my business battle plan
that course it's coming out very soon
I'm gonna start releasing videos this
week in fact money manager money
management and financial skills are a
big part of it something that I see out
there in the people talk about being an
entrepreneur and running a business
starting a business they sort of from
what I've seen they gloss over the
financials the money management aspect
and that's such a crucial thing I from
my observations over the last 28 years
of being in business plus observing my
parents businesses it's all about money
management because if you got cash in
the bank and you had your money as
well-managed even if you have some
troubles in your business things are
going we're not sewing these are what
the drives of company bankrupt is a
little running out of cash so if you
learn to manage your expenses manage
your money that kid almost insure both
with others tactics and strategies of
course but that would having good money
management will almost ensure success of
your business because it'll give you
that runway will give you that time to
get it off the ground another thing that
people don't talk about enough in the
business world and in the
entrepreneurial world if you will is
you've got to have the right psychology
I discover a long time ago in my 20s
that entrepreneurs had a very different
mindset than people were not
entrepreneurs it's almost like a whole
different world view a whole different
reality and you have to harness this and
develop this over time now it happens as
you get into business you start
realizing things you start seeing things
from a different perspective but if you
could if you could speed up that process
if you can get to that psychological
state you can get to that point of view
or that the state of awareness a
psychological awareness there we go in
business as an entrepreneur quicker it
will help you to see succeed more
quickly because you'll be able to see
opportunities more easily you'll be able
to avoid see risk more easily so you can
avoid them Yetta Yetta Yetta Yetta so
that's it for this vlog I like I've been
talking here anyway that's pretty much
it what you're going to achieve this
week is me launching the business battle
plan I decided to release it as a
premium forum subscription if you will
and I will be building up two chapters
over the next several weeks I suppose
and
it's going to be 17 chapters I'm not
sure how many lessons a few lessons per
chapter I would imagine if not more and
the contents gonna be video and audio
based so that you have many different
ways to consume the information and of
course within the premium form they'll
be summaries and QA and write-ups and so
forth and then once the 17 chapters are
built I'm going to continue to put out
premium content in that area
specifically related to becoming an
entrepreneur being an entrepreneur
building a business etc etc etc and it
should be a lot of fun because I'm going
to bring in a lot of stuff that I don't
discuss here on YouTube so Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
