killer sites calm and in this video blog
I'm going to teach you about something
called cart spoofing now what is cart
spoofing I'm talking about shopping
carts ecommerce sites and scarred
spoofing is the process where somebody
will basically will basically create a
copy of your submit page to send bad
information to your credit card
processor and the reasoning for this is
to is to basically try to buy digital
product for cheaper than it's actually
selling for this will not work of course
if you saw a physical product because if
somebody tries to buy something that's
450 bucks for two bucks you're not going
to ship it but for digital products like
videos and so on templates and other
things like that you're definitely going
to see this card spoofing occur from
time to time so let's give you a quick
example so let's say we got our complete
web designer package we're going to add
the download version to the cart and you
see of course we have our shopping cart
here and it's in an HTML form all this
information is hidden in a teach-in and
HTML form so let me show you what I mean
well first of all if you go to check out
the paypal checkout my we use paypal we
have have our own credit card accounts
as well but i'll show you a paypal our
card sends paypal this information but
you see here is the name in a package
and a price and some other stuff as well
so if we just go back to our card we
have a form here so let's take a look at
it fun scene so in firefox you go to
tools web developer page source and what
we want to do is find a form so I'm just
going to know I'm just going to do a
quick fly edit find
and it will form next okay let's go
previous periods here we go here's the
form farm action equals this is the form
that sends the information to paypal we
have multiple forms on this page by the
way so let's go to the back to the farm
and you notice there's a whole bunch of
hidden information that is not shown to
the person in the actual web page and
some of this information who is the
product name and we also show the price
because paypal does not have in their
databases a list of our products and
prices we have to send that to paypal so
what somebody will do is they will just
create a copy of this form and for
instance they'll just change the price
in the form element we find that again
where they go here let's do that again
and yeah yeah here we go so you see we
have a price here and put type hidden'
that means it's not Sean to the person
and it has a price of ninety nine
dollars so some people will go in there
and try to be smart and enter another
price and then buy it assume that they
can buy an eye on our package for nine
bucks or something so for instance
here's a notification i got from paypal
a little while ago you see that this guy
sent a payment four unsent and he tried
to buy our wordpress from theme scratch
tutorial and i can assure you that that
particular course does not go for one
sent it actually goes for 2999 now again
if you bought the DVD it wouldn't make
much of a difference as clothes because
I wouldn't ship a DVD that's 39 bucks if
you paid only one cent but for download
instant download then we do provide this
could be a problem so how you solve this
problem well the way you solve it is you
have to use
on your end you're going to have to
basically program the card to not allow
to checked rather the price of things
once a payment is made so when we got
this notification from paypal we check
to see whether or not that particular
item is actually worth one set if it's
not worth you know if they don't
actually have the right dollar mounted
and pay the right amount we just don't
let them have access to the videos so
there you go that's cart spoofing it's
just one of many ways that nefarious
people evil people will try to hack your
site and your servers and it's very
annoying but there's ways to protect
against it and i just gave you one idea
I'm sure there's others out there and
that's about it for this video blog you
know we have been incognito for a little
while been busy with things big server
move doubled our server capacity and
actually for me personally a big move
myself so it's I've been sort of out of
the picture in terms of putting out
these type of videos but this is all
going to be starting up again and we're
doing a huge major revamp of our video
store it's going from A to C your
typical store in a simple store shopping
cart and so on but we're going to be
producing we're working on now and
actually a much smarter store which
should be even for people who are not
interested in buying any product they
will find the store I think very very
useful in terms of information tons of
free videos audio and a whole bunch of
more things so I can't wait to show that
to you guys that's it I hope you found
this video useful stuff again and we
shall talk very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
