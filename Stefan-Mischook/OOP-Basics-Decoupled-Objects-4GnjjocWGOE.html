extremely nerdy video about
object-oriented programming so one of
the big big principles one of the Holy
Grails if you will of object-oriented
programming is having decoupled code
decoupled code that is reusable so what
does that mean decoupled meaning
uncoupled meaning autonomous meaning
code that exists without being dependent
on other code if you can create an
object in object-oriented programming
required regardless of the language if
you can create an object that's
independent from all your the code in
the system that is the ultimate object
that is the object everybody's got
that's an amazing piece of code the
reusable object that is independent of
all the code around it decoupled
decoupled from the system decoupled from
any dependencies and other code around
that so when emphasizing this and I'm
trying to give you examples from a
different point of view so if you've
heard of micro-services which is a way
of structuring apps structuring programs
it works on that principle the idea
behind a micro-service is that it's a
piece of code it's a little mini app if
you will that just does one thing so a
micro surface might be an app that just
checks the validity of email addresses
so you may have a system where people
have to log in and you need their email
address and you may put an email address
you want to make sure that these know
this email address is accurate it's a
real email address so you could build it
into the core system or you might have a
micro service that takes care of all
that for you and what you would do is
you have those micro service over here
it's all loans independent but it just
does the email stuff the email
validation and what you do your main app
here will send the micro service a
request will say can you check to see if
this email address is good
and the micro service will go Bing Bing
boom bang bang boom and it'll come back
yes it's good no it's not good and then
your main app could just continue and
work from there now the cool thing about
this micro service that checks to see if
an email address is valid it can be used
in any app you can reuse it over and
over and over again it is independent of
your main app and it's totally reusable
that is the ultimate goal of object
oriented programming now it's not the
only ultimate goal there's other
ultimate goals but decouple systems
decouple code rather and reusable code
is a huge thing that's because you don't
want to write code over and over again
that's the DRI principle don't repeat
yourself and that comes down to objects
as well so if you can create a series of
micro services and companies are doing
that now like IBM for instance big
companies where you will pay every time
you use one of their micro services that
is a model that I think that's going to
get more and more more popular now I was
doing that we back in the day I had not
quite a micro services architecture but
I had that kind
I was rude being that half-dry principle
was really big in creating what I would
just call dumb dumb objects dumb dumb
objects were objects that just have no
awareness of any other objects any other
code around it and it just did its job
and so this brings me to a very
controversial subject which I've talked
about before and I'm not going to go
into details here in another video we're
going to drop some pictures and stuff
and grouse inheritance is one of the
core mechanisms in object to hunted
programming it's one of the core
mechanisms of sharing code and I assert
it's one of the core mechanisms that's
way overused and it defeats one of the
primary or it goes against rather one of
the primary goals of object-oriented
coding decoupled code because when you
use inheritance that you're basically
borrowing code
from another chunk of code from another
object the problem is when you do that
when you basically borrow code from that
other object and this is very rough
rough rough rough because I know nerds
are gonna get picky in terms of my
choice of words anyway this is a very
rough explanation when you were
borrowing code inheriting code from a
what they call a parent class or a
parent object you're you're tying them
together
you're coupling them and that's bad so
it can cause all kinds of problems yes
there's things you can do work around it
but generally speaking the very
experienced developers will tell you you
don't want to use inheritance much at
all very rare circumstances so because
it tends to create more fragile code
more brittle code because it's more
tightly coupled it's there you're
creating dependencies you're better to
use other mechanisms to reuse your code
how create micro-services that's one way
now object-oriented programming does
more vengers allow you to reuse code it
creates what they call a contract
between the objects between in fact the
developers in the system is you're gonna
have multi many times you might have
multiple developers working on a
particular codebase so by having a
series of base classes that you base all
your other objects on you're creating a
contract you're creating a structure
you're creating a set of policies if you
will our objects have to be based on
these classes here which means we can
expect a certain way that our software
ultimately will be developed in terms of
the internal structure now the problem
with that again it's very brittle so how
do you create this contract how do you
create this consistency in the codebase
amongst your developers without that
brittle tightly coupled failing that you
get with inheritance a lot of times you
do that through interface design through
interfaces all right I've gone off on
the tangent I know this is super nerdy
and it's not meant for a wide audience I
tend to refrain on YouTube from
getting into highly detailed newer
details like this because it can put you
all asleep but if you are an
object-oriented programmer this
particular vlog will give you some food
food for thought if you're beginner just
remember the holy group what are the
Holy Grails
of programming not just object-oriented
programming is to create reusable chunks
of code that are independent of any
other code so that you can plug you can
pick them up and drop them in all kinds
of different software and different apps
and big advantage saves you time you'll
have to write that code again and be
when you have a micro service or an
object that's independent like I just
described for instance that email
validating object then that will be
highly refined highly vetted and it will
be super clean code so the more you can
leverage components microservices and
code that has been designed to be usable
in a whole bunch of situations you're
gonna have less bugs in your code right
because it's refined and cleaned often
by many developers anyway I'll stop
there once in a while you gotta give it
to me I'll let you I get into some nerd
details for those who might find it
interesting all right we'll talk soon
