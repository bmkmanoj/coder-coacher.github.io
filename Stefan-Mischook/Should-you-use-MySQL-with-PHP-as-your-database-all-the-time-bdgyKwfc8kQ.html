sites calm and killer PHP calm in this
quick little video I want to answer a
question that was recently put to me and
the question is do you need to use MySQL
whenever you want to use PHP do you need
it do you need to use it all the time as
your database first thing I want to say
is but my skill is just one of the
choices you have for a relational
database that you can use with PHP
there's my SQL Lite which is I think
it's called MySQL Lite it comes with PHP
it's a tiny little database it doesn't
have all the capabilities of PHP but
it's very capable and some people may
use that and of course you can use any
relational database that you want
because PHP allows you to connect with
Oracle and SQL server and Firebird and
there's many others so the question that
in my mind that the real question is do
you need to use a relational database to
store your data with every PHP
application in which you have data
storage requirements and that really
comes down to the amount of data but
you're going to need to store and hold
because you know well let me back up and
say the first instinct of most PHP
programmers if they need to hold data is
to just use MySQL and that makes perfect
sense because it's my skills provider
even the most basic of hosting account
programs my school interaction is very
simple you know it's it's not much
overhead it works fine so why not use it
I would argue on sums in some
circumstances it makes sense to maybe
look at different types of databases to
store information for example if you
have a situation well I'll use my
example we recently rebuilt a whole
shopping cart system it used to be Java
based and we moved over to PHP
because I want to add extra
functionality and I wanted to free
myself of the the overhead and the
hassles that Java provides and that's
another story you know I used to be a
hardcore Java guy so trust me I know
point is we moved it over to PHP so the
question came up do we want to store the
products that were selling which is the
video products in a relational database
since we only have you know we have less
than 50 SKUs we only have at this time
you know 10 or so videos 15 videos it
made no sense to me to go through the
hassle of creating a table storing all
this stuff in database especially
considering that I would want to make
changes to the database and I wouldn't
want to have to always connect to MySQL
to update records again it's not a big
deal but even easier is to use an XML
file as a database so in this
circumstance when you have less than you
know 50 items it's a lot easier to just
store your record of items you know in
an in an XML file or a series of XML
files since it was only it was less than
50 I said we're just gonna have one XML
file and each product will have will be
a different node an XML node if you
don't know about XML you know go to
killer PHP and there'll be material
there for you or Google is your friend
any help
so some circumstance in this
circumstance because we had very few
skills we had a you know less than 50
items to sell and because I wanted to
have make it easier for me to change my
database of products I can just pop open
the XML file and make changes I would
have to connect to MySQL and all of his
headaches and also having it stored in
XML who's actually makes the code just a
touch more portable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
