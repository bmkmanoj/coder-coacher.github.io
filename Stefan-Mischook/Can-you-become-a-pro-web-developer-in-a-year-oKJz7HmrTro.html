year to become a coder so somebody's
having an email
apparently some code camps out there or
code
training services if you will I'm not
going to be means claim they have
programs where within one year you can
become a coder you can become a coder
making money within a few months if
you're taught properly if you learn the
right things see a big thing about being
a coder is actually writing real code
and that means getting out there in the
real world and building projects for
actual clients that this it has a huge
impact in terms of the learning curve
because when you are in a situation
we're actually working with real clients
it forces you to really get in there and
to develop your skills to develop your
chops this is an opinion based on my own
personal experience so let me go way
back into 90s where I was learning to
code so I learned how to build websites
in 1994 and I learned my first
programming language I think in 96 or 95
forget now anyway a long time ago and so
how did I become a real developer I
didn't sit there for a year in my
apartment at my home and wrote projects
I sort of tailored around and so forth
no no no no what I did actually and I
guess this is partly because I'm an
entrepreneur by nature so what I did was
actually get a job not a job working for
somebody full-time but a job in terms
like a gig doing some projects so the
first world web project so when I was
doing the first paid coding job was was
designed for a legal firm and I was
fortunate though where they approached
me because in those days if you knew
HTML you're like a
i trainer's 94 but to be able to do that
I had to have a certain base level of
skill that's the trick to it all by the
way and that's how and why I design my
systems to do web to be in a certain way
so was fast forward when I got my first
programming job or was actually writing
code that you know was programming my
nap Kiwi here was I think I got paid to
do a first one in 97 and it was a web
app and again it was the same type of
situation where I hadn't really done
much web app building I just knew the
basics of the languages had done a few
things here and there and then I went
out and I got a gig I got a project
which forced me to really dive deep in
to the code to finalize this video
you don't need a year of schooling to
become a profession of Elcor in fact you
can and I encourage you to learn the
basic languages so let me give you an
idea let's say you're doing web
development you have to learn HTML CSS
for sure some JavaScript and some jQuery
from there and that little straight
there you can get this done in about a
couple months where your company you're
not great I'm not seeing integrator just
like just the ability to actually
execute on some stuff and then at this
point you have to decide which branch
you want to get into in terms of the
type of cool you want to do and what's
in the web app framework if you want to
get it to Ruby then you got to go route
you got a little Ruby any other basic
rails and then you could jump into it I
would recommend that I would recommend
especially if you want to do it this
hyper accelerated rate of getting
professional level skills
I recommend PHP none of it is I think
PHP is necessarily the best language out
there just because there's so many
opportunities for entry-level coders in
the PHP world because demand is massive
another option maybe would be to do some
Python work early
to do some light scripting or light
coding within WordPress perhaps but the
point is you can get into coding and
development and programming within a few
months if you first take the time just
to learn the key languages so if you're
doing the web stack I will do it you
have to do HTML your CSS bit of
JavaScript bit of jQuery
then you have to choose what server-side
programming language you want to do
server side meaning code that runs on
the server that could be Ruby little bit
rails could be PHP it could be a flare
bellyful framework or it could be just
installing configuring WordPress with
the male WordPress professional I'm
standing your basics of PHP it could be
Python it could be Python then you get
into a Python framework like Django you
get the idea or maybe you don't want to
do the web maybe you want to go into iOS
development maybe you want to get into
agile development then again those are
type of things where you you learn the
basics of the language so iOS I would
recommend Swift and then you jump in
there and you look to get yourself a
basic Swift job or Swift gig entry level
you're not going to make nearly as much
as you will once you get experience but
that really gets you into the game so
you could be paid as if you learned
so there's a whole idea that you have to
spend a year in training is not a
silliness I think that something I
learned from my actual martial arts and
my boxing days once you have the basics
down let's say boxing for instance watch
you have just the basics down and you're
far from knowing everything you're far
from being very good at anything in
boxing but once you've done the first
like I would say a week maybe two weeks
personally max get in the ring and start
sparring it's going to be painful at
first with boxing but you find that you
you develop your skill sets so much
quickly so now you don't need a year of
training to be able to get a job in the
web development I say it's the opposite
it's more like coding and programming
more like a trade where you spend
a few months getting your basics on
doing a little mini projects in a basic
course and then you you jump right into
the real world doing basic projects
getting paid little and you gotta learn
ten times faster than somebody who spent
a whole year to learning to be a
developer in a school situation I hope
that helps bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
