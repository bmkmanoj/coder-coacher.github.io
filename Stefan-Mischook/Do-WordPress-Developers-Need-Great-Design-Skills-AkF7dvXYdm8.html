the question I have a question for you I
am a beginner I want to be a wordpress
developer is it necessary to be good in
design what I mean I can do back and
front end and a little HTML CSS PHP but
I am terrible in designing the site for
Photoshop for example I have a design
from a desire it is not a problem could
you please tell me what I really need if
I want to be well paid WordPress
developer freelancer thanks in advance
so here's the thing I said this for
years if you want to do design if you're
just a web designer if we're going to
use that term if you're just a designer
you have to be really good to be able to
make a great living these days design is
been commoditized meaning there's tons
of templates and theme collections out
there but you can buy a great theme for
50 bucks 40 bucks and then from there
the smart developers will then tweak
those themes now you as a WordPress
developer need to only know a little bit
about design theory negative space
whitespace alignment font use those type
of things color combinations you don't
want to combine colors that don't work
well together but anyway there are tools
out there that you can do this just
Google for Adobe color picker or color
Combinator forget the exact terms but it
will come up so I wouldn't be too
concerned about that so the short answer
is no you don't need to be very good at
design because of all the templates and
themes that are out there
combine that with just a basic knowledge
of basic design principle so you don't
mess up a perfectly good looking theme
that you start with the key to being
successful in freelance is really to
understand the core languages so with
regards to WordPress that would be HTML
CSS PHP you should really understand of
course what how WordPress works how the
theming works and you should have good
communication skills you build
to communicate well and be organized in
terms of your presentation I've
discussed this in other vlogs I believe
so there you go to answer the question
you don't need to be a great designer in
fact I think that if you or somebody has
a good workflow and you have knowledge
in HTML CSS PHP and you're comfortable
working WordPress and themes it's much
more important and be a good designer
going from Photoshop and having great
Photoshop skills and so on to create
layouts whether it be for WordPress or
for standard websites or web apps that
has faded quite a bit in terms of its
importance because of things I just
mentioned in fact in my own courses I
removed the Photoshop courses because in
terms of the web stack the use of
Photoshop is it's not not even close to
being as important as important as it
was before and in fact many many
projects when we work on we never even
touch Photoshop because of the nature of
modern-day web design or web UI layout
whether it be for websites or WordPress
sites etc etc I hope that helps bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
