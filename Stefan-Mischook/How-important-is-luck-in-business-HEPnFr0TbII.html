killer science into the side so in this
V block I want to address an issue that
came up recently in a previous vlog and
it is all about luck and business luck
in business now this goes back to being
a coder and a freelancer let me just get
to the point so one thing that you have
to understand about business that there
is always an element of luck to it no
question I've been in business since
I've been 18 years old so that means
I've been in business for about four
hundred and fifty six years so I have a
decent amount of knowledge with regards
to starting little businesses building
them up my experience in business has
taught me one thing for sure luck does
play a role this is this is something
you have to embrace and accept now in a
previous video I talked about how there
are two basic ways to approach a new
business you can either come up with an
idea in your head and throw it out there
and see if you can find a client and you
see this a lot in vc-backed businesses
and they sometimes work but it's very
very very high risk and in fact many VCS
know this well they all know this so
they expect 80% or more of the
businesses that they find to fail they
make their money on the one or two home
runs out of ten right so keep that in
mind if you're building a business most
businesses fail the first was 80% of
businesses fail in the first place in
the first two three years so the other
approach as opposed to coming up with an
idea and outer blue or out of your head
in implementing and see if you can find
clients the other approach the approach
that I advocate the approach that I've
taken over the years is to become
involved in particular sector particular
industry where you're able to identify a
need you're able to identify a problem
and then you come up with a solution to
that problem it could be a piece of
technology B could be a service
supported by a technology who knows very
simple example in my first business when
I was started when I was 18 slowly
I got going with it when I was 19 or so
we had a problem of a certain certain
type of chemical buildup in water for a
high end I cursed people who kept high
in rare fish for public aquariums
aquaculture so we were trying to address
this problem I'm trying to avoid details
cause most of you gonna be put to sleep
so we scoured about and we were able by
fluke I was able by fluke to find a
product used in another industry to
bring it into this aquaculture industry
and it was so much more effective
there's literally ten times more
effective anything else out there we
didn't invent anything we just took a
product from another industry actually
in the apple cider industry and we
brought it in to the our industry so
there's an example we saw a problem in
the industry we knew people were dealing
with this problem and we figured out a
way to solve it and we were able to
solve it because we were lucky enough to
find something that could solve the
problem so that's a big part of coming
back to it is luck so that all said I'm
gonna wrap this up now if luck if you
can accept that luck plays a significant
role in business then and I tell you it
does I tell you it does then that begs a
particular business strategy regardless
of the business and what's the strategy
you don't really know what's gonna work
it's like the hit songs like a lot of
times these big artists out there you
know music artists you you do interviews
with them they always you know more
often but they're not they thought you
know when we put out this album we
thought track number two was going to be
the big hit it turned out to be track
number seven which we just decided to
throw on on the last in the last minute
you hear this all the time and anyway so
that bakes the strategy and the strategy
is getting a product out a service out
an app out a website up as quickly and
as cheaply as possible to gauge the user
response that is the strategy because
you never know what's going to work
because luck plays a role its timing
luck
it's competition luck I can go on and on
and on and on and on and on take it or
leave it that's my experience for last
460 2.5 years
luck has a major role so that begs the
strategy get out as many products as
possible as cheaply as possible so you
can gauge the audience reaction to it
and try to understand the industry
before you jump into a business I'm just
trying to save you guys a lot of money
and wasted time even if you follow these
steps it doesn't guarantee success but
it will definitely improve your odds
