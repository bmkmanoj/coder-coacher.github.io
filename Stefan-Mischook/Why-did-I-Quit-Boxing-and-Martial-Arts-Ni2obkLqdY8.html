night Friday night vlog I felt inspired
to talk about two things football and
martial arts boxing why I quit martial
arts and boxing is related to football
just reading an article where Bob Costas
Bob Costas was talking about the end of
football because all the science is
showing that if your kids are playing
football they station play football at
least contact football until at least
past eighteen because you're gonna be
doing serious brain damage to your kids
so I think that the the wiser parents
are probably not going to let their kids
do brain damage to themselves because
you know that can lead to all kinds of
problems and depression and mental
problems and emotional problems and all
kinds of crazy stuff and hear about all
these professional football players
having all kinds of issues brain
problems quite young kind of like the
professional wrestlers besides all the
other physical problems as well
now you may love football and you may be
a great game for you but you have to ask
yourself is it worth the brain damage I
don't know I think we should have like
robot football players you get little
robots sock them you know it control
them off you know or do touch football
but touch footballs I knew is fun yeah
anyway so how's this relate to my
martial arts background I did martial
arts since I was 10 years old up until
about 40 or so as something like that
but I stopped doing hardcore martial
arts in my late 30s meaning sparring and
why so why did I stop stop sparring
because I got my nose fixed in terms it
was all broken three times and I
couldn't breathe so I got my nose face
got the deviated septum fixed nothing
it's perfect but let me tell you he was
a mess before my doctor said you know I
know more boxing for you your nose did
shattered it leave it alone so I had to
make a choice whether to go get a
beating
to break my nose again for something
that didn't have really long-term
effects on me in terms of positive
impacts also
become a professional fighter at this
point I had to make that choice between
becoming a professional a business owner
developer tech entrepreneur or to get
into deeper into boxing because I had
reached a level where to continue in the
development of myself as a fighter I
would have to go really hardcore so that
was like that point that fork in the
road where I decided you know what I'm
up as it is forget about it I'm not
gonna go there
braum was I love the spar I love this
bar as sparring so much fun but I
couldn't do that because you know after
you get your nose fixed and he shot
break it again and it's just like you
can only do so many surgeries right so I
had to stop there are other reasons
though I stopped is because I was
thinking the long-term implications
about my health right I looked at a lot
of like boxers like 80% of boxers will
have permanent brain damage a lot of
professional athletes oh all right sorry
it got interrupted so I forget where I
was anyway so I had to think about the
futures that forget it and then shortly
thereafter I so stopped sparring I love
this bar but I stopped sparring because
I want to cut my nose broke again you
never know right
unlikely because I got my nose broken
early on when I wasn't good I was making
fundamental mistakes and I was quite an
elusive guys I didn't get hit too much
but you never know I talked about I
decided I don't know what was a year
later two years later training I'm not
sure what it was I decided to even stop
hitting heavy bags in punching pads and
you say why would you stop doing that
because I was getting very sore hands
after that so we're looking my late 30s
at this point I'm getting very sore
hands it's for like a dare to even
though I was wearing pads and they're
thought to myself boy I'm getting sore
hands now and I'm in my late 30s mid
thirties late 30s imagine well how how
my hands will be if I continue to smash
them in 15 years from now
and I thought about all those wrestlers
and continent chronic pain those
professional fighters and chronic pain
and professional football players and
chronic pain etc etc and I talked to
some people my family who had been
pretty high level athletes but they were
now when they were taking their late
teens early 20s but now they were
permanent damage and their chronic pain
with their hands or their back and I
asked him if you had to do it over again
you know would you you know in terms of
going for the glory when you're young
versus what you've learned since and
they out they both told me said there's
no way if I could do it over again I
would not have done the sport because
it's a very short fleeting period of
time of glory for a lifetime of pain and
the irony is that most people will never
get the real glory they'll never become
professional football players have never
become professional fighters have never
become professional athletes it's it's
it's such a rare thing so the risk
reward is just silly bad it's just not
worth getting into in my humble opinion
the irony
the irony is nothing I already if you
had to make a choice if you have kids do
you send them to football camp
or do you send them to a coldie camp now
I'm biased but they're gonna chances are
99 percent more likely they're gonna
make much more money if you send them to
a cold camp and become technology
experts at some forum then if you send
them to football camp or soccer camp or
something and the great thing about
sending them to code camp no chance of
brain injury no chance of blent brain
injury which is pretty good thing if you
ask me so that's my two cents this is a
non techie vlog as opposed not very
often that I talk about things that are
not related to tech as you know anyhow
but I think it's still a very important
lesson it's good to get perspective from
somebody who's done a lot of sports in
the past and
so maybe you can avoid getting your nose
broken three times that might be useful
to you
geez very busy night tonight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
