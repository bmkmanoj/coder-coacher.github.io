so I've been incognito the last couple
days because again I've been having a
bit of an issue of my app in terms of
server load not on a consistent basis
just in peak periods of a time
well peak period time excuse me and so
as a developer the first thing you look
at I've talked about this in a previous
vlog you're saying okay we've got a we
got an old arm we got a database design
could be better the app code could be
better so you're looking at these big
issues and the first thing I did to
solve the problems is I just amped up
the server power quite a bit of power in
fact and then as more and more people
started getting on board
during the peak periods it wasn't
helping so I said to myself how could
you know we got it we got to deal with
this problem fortunately I had a clone
of the app on another virtual private
server and the thing that confused me is
that though the clone of the app was
literally a clone Lyon for Lyon same
code same database schema same database
structure despite that I was having
performance issues on the big powerful
live server and on the the development
the secondary server which was a far far
wimpier server like two CPU vs. 8 4 Giga
RAM well 8 gig around versus 32 and the
only difference between the one on the
weak wimpy server and the one on the
production server is that we had a lot
less we had a lot less users less
records but it was dramatic difference
so I started digging a little bit deeper
and instead of going into the more
complex issues I decided to sort of dig
into the simple stuff and so what I
discovered is that the previous lead
developer he had not properly indexed
the key table in the app database table
and an index is basically a
of optimizing your database tables for
speed so if you have a database table
with hundreds of thousands of records or
millions of records
if you don't index the table then a lot
of times when your app is utilizing the
database it's going to have to read all
of these records it's a big pile of
processing that's going to be required
so with an index when you apply an index
it literally indexes the table meaning
it's kind of summarizes it into a more
compact form so it makes it so much
faster when it's trying to interact with
this big table of data and I won't get
into it beyond that because it's just
this is just a simple blog and I'll just
say this when you are creating your
database tables and you have any row
columns rather any fields columns are
filled so-called fields in database
lingo when you have any fields you have
to you have to index fields that are
used in where clauses so if you have a
select statement and you should know a
little SQL if you have a select select
first name last name from blah blah
table where whatever is in that where
clause whatever is in that where Clause
should be indexed and the index is
literally going to the database and you
apply index it takes two seconds to do
it's easy thing and what you'll see if
it's done properly you're gonna have a
huge speed increase so back to what
happened to me last few days I went in
there and I realized that they hadn't
applied indexes properly on this crucial
table so I applied the indexes took me
all five minutes and now to give you an
idea with the same number of users on
the peak periods instead of the CPUs
running up to 50 percent
you know well between 40 and 50 percent
on the peaks it's now down to two three
percent on the peaks again I've taken it
from 50% CPU utilization down to three
on the piece this is a crazy huge
performance increase so what does this
mean this means that you have a super
fast running application and this means
I can reduce my server power by like 80
90 percent and get a good performance so
there you go now some people may say you
should have performance tracking built
into the app but like somebody posted on
in one of the comments on the vlog you
know when you're building an app and
you're working out the business model
you're working at the literal literally
the functionality of the app you don't
have time to put in all kinds of
built-in tools if you will that will
monitor the performance of your
application simply because you're gonna
be changing all of these you're going to
be changing the guts of your app on a
need-to-know basis and so it's gonna if
you start writing in all this rock solid
performance tracking code in there your
cost development is going to skyrocket
so the way it goes when you first
release an app into the marketplace and
you're not sure how it works
you're gonna write quicker code not so
robust code in the sense that you won't
have all these monitoring services built
into it now though with the new version
of the app that we are building because
we know exactly what needs to be done we
understand the use case perfectly now we
will be able to put in these types of
tools in there to monitor performance
and so forth so there you go so the
thing to take away from this vlog is
that sometimes it's the simple things
that really make a huge difference in
terms of your apps performance and as it
was 15 20 years ago it is still today
many a times the bottleneck in your app
can be a simple
the database something in the database
whether it be the database structure or
somebody putting in a proper index into
the database so keep that in mind so
when you're learning web development
regardless of the platform you should
learn at least basics of database design
you should understand indexes properly
and when to apply them how to apply them
because they can have as in this
situation a massive impact in terms of
the impact on your performance of your
app right and the cost so I'm gonna be
able to reduce my hosting costs by many
thousands of dollars a year now simply
because you know all things being equal
simply because of a five minute job of
adding an index to a couple of fields
inside of a crucial table in the App
five minutes saves you thousands of
dollars and no more calls from clients
complaining that the app is running slow
on peak peak times alright that's it for
now bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
