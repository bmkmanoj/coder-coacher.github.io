Wing Chun and learn to defend yourself
in a fight so the big question or a real
question is not style as i said in i
think the other videos I've seen English
fighters in almost every system of
martial art although certain types of
martial arts basically the sport
fighting arts will much more often put
out good fighters simply because they're
training people to actually fight
whereas informant unfortunately in a lot
of the traditional martial arts they're
not teaching people how to fight their
teaching people with the art and in fact
that was the intention if you look at
Japan where a lot of the Crawleys came
out judo judo is not cry but jus Doh Doh
and stand 0 critique dole whenever you
have a candle whenever have a dough in
the Styles name that was a basically
indicated that the style was not really
developed at that point for fighting it
was there for spiritual mental training
now they were derived from fighting arts
but for instance would you know if you
read about the guys who founded you know
he did a lot of Jitsu and he took out
the more dangerous the deadlier aspects
of the jujitsu to create judo so that
people wouldn't get hurt he turned it
into a dough a practice for the sake of
physical and mental training now when it
comes to things that come fool somebody
asked you specifically specifically does
Wing Chun produce good fighters can you
learn Wing Chun learn defend yourself
well comes down to a few things it comes
down to the type of Wing Chun school you
are in many of the wing chun schools out
there are theoretical they do a lot of
drills sticky hands and so on and then
but they don't actually a lot of them do
much safari or they do kind of a limited
spine where you don't hit the face or
you don't do this that's not real
fighting you know it's when you get into
street fight people going to be hitting
you in the face or going for your
they're going to be you know there's no
restrictions especially headhunting you
know I was a bouncer in nightclubs for
about two years and I could tell you
that night I've said it's time the
instinctive would go right for the head
you know swinging punches and stuff
that's what happens most of the time
yeah the other factor is your natural
talents for the school is number one how
does the school train the people how you
know regardless of the cell number two
is your natural talent if you're a very
talented physical guy very talented in
terms of fighting its natural then
you're going to do well no matter what
style you do I've seen people come off
the street who are just naturally gifted
they have to tell us to fight just like
some people have the talent for football
or basketball or music and if you're
talented you can excel real quickly so
you can get a guy off the street who are
a girl who is talented and Clyde to
fighting and they jump in and within
nine months a year they're there they're
kicking butt all over the gym people
much more experience with them just
because they have talent natural talent
is a big part of it on the other hand
you can get some people come in and they
may love it they may love the training
they may be really into it but they just
don't have it in them they don't have
the instinct they don't have the
physicality or right mental
predisposition if you're well towards
fighting I seen that too I see people
come in and it's just it's not there and
you know make a train with Bruce Lee and
Muhammad Ali Mike Tyson there Anderson
silver silver throw any other top notch
fighter trainer will never be any good
because they just don't have the talent
that's a big part of it as well and then
then there's the of course the style
itself you know the style itself can
influence it in the sense that if you
are inclined to being a striker so
what're your hits then if you're doing
grappling styles you may not be inclined
to that so you may never really find
your ability and vice versa so I see
nice seeing good friends of mine who
weren't very good at striking because
they're kind
slow and you know they couldn't react
didn't have good fast reflexes but and
they could never be very good at
striking but when it came to grappling
it was really good because they had that
kinesthetic feel they had the physical
and mental makeup to be good grapplers
so coming back again okay Wing Chun make
you too good fighter he had a final
option of course is who you fighting you
know if you're fighting somebody who's
not really trained it's not very
talented and you have moderate talent
and you have the training yeah you could
do very well against the wing chun it
all the thing in terms of whether styles
good or bad whether style turn you into
a good fighter is not there's all these
variables and there's a lot of gray area
depends who you're fighting and i just
went over so i'm going over to go over
it again so the answer is it depends it
depends it depends but if you want to
maximize your chances and learn how to
fight very quickly and you're going to
you know it's harder you should go into
the sporting ours you should go into
judo wrestling jujitsu you should go
into boxing Thai boxing kickboxing that
kind of stuff in these arts these
sporting styles it's all about the
sports so you're going to do a lot of
sparring and that's huge sparring it's
huge because sparring is the only way
you can really develop the fighting
timing the mental toughness that you
need the tactical awareness in terms of
fighting so I would look at schools that
really emphasize sparring you know
really emphasize sparring that's very
important regardless of the style I hope
that helps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
