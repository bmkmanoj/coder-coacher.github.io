wasn't clear which pages which so now
we're gonna use the heading tags to do
that we're gonna go here we're going to
type in H and sublime text once again is
guessing what we want to put in so
heading Talia's go from one through six
one is the most important six is the
least important in a logical way so if
you had a real important text like the
Red Sox won the World Series you would
put her in h1 but if you had another
headline like you bake the pie today or
something I don't know you would put H
for something because you know it's good
but whatever it's not super boring so
I'm just I'm gonna go h2 I'm gonna
select h2 because it's kind of a it's
pretty important but not super important
and you'll see what I'm what I mean in a
second okay don't worry you'll see what
I mean so we're on the homepage here so
I'm going to say homepage that's pretty
cool so let's view this here we go
homepage
see how it's nice and big that's the
browser doing that for us
right h2 because it's a headline of text
it's a headline text it's more important
than just a simple paragraph so it's
made a little bit bigger if I wanted to
make it even seem more important I would
say to the browser know this is actually
really important they'll call it h1
number one's better than or two and it's
even bigger you see that already know on
the other end I can say well it's not
really super boring so
h4 it's pretty small so what we're gonna
do because this is a home page we're
gonna say yeah we'll say it's an h1 save
it boom so it's pretty clear we're on
the home page a lot of my friends it's
not so clear we have to look at the
title here in the tab we've got a home
page boom we're on the home page much
better through the power of video I went
ahead and made the same changes we did
to the home page adding a horizontal
rule tag and a heading so that we could
see what it looks like so just to
confirm here's our index page index.html
then we got Mar my - friends page again
notice we had
here save me with my - plans my work and
so on let's take a look in the web
browser here we go my friends my plans
might work it's all pretty much done so
you can see just with the simple
addition of a couple more tags we've
made the page as much easier to navigate
and that's a big part of web development
it's a big part of actually coding in
general you want to make sure you keep
everything as simple as possible and not
only in your code but also in the pages
that you create so we've done that here
okay yes I said we're gonna talk more
about links I got caught up with these
headers and horizontal rules in the next
lesson we're gonna learn the last couple
things I want to teach you about links</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
