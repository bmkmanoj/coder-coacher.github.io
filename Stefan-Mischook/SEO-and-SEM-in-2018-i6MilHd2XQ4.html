in the world to actually implement good
old-fashioned SEM and SEO that search
engine marketing search engine
optimization and the proof is just check
out killer sites com you can check out
the traffic data their check out how to
build websites calm killer PHP calm CSS
tutorial done that so I was able to
build up several sites to this day and
get a couple million pageviews every
month and it's all through organic
traffic I don't use paid traffic never
use paid traffic never use paid search
never use social and well in the context
of building up those sites so people
always ask me over and over again how do
you do what do you do what's the secret
what's the key to SEO SEM well first let
me deal with SEO SEO was developed in
the late 90s because websites were built
in such a way a lot of times they were
not search engine friendly meaning the
search engines had a hard time digging
out information out of the sites and
that was really because of a couple of
reasons a the sites weren't built
properly and or they were built in the
old-school way which I'll get into a
second and be the search engines weren't
very sophisticated so let's talk about
the way the site used to be built it
used to be built with lots of images and
lots of code that did not describe what
was going on in the page modern day what
does I have you taught in any good
course like my HTML CSS my web developer
course it teaches you modern day web
development of course on web design so
essentially your sites if they're built
using modern standards they are
automatically search engine optimized
they're automatically ready to go in the
old days back in the 90s a lot of sites
weren't so they needed people to go in
there to clean the code up to make it
readable to the search engine so make it
so that the search engines couldn't
understand what was going on in the web
sites in the web pages
another thing that's happened since
those times is that the search engines
themselves have become much more
sophisticated
they're much better at discerning what
is actually going on in the site than
they used to be now once upon a time
people used to be into meta tags and
other gimmickry to fool the engines but
that's all been worked out now and my
only advice to you is when you're
building sites a build using modern
techniques which everybody should do
these days and be you should write
honestly in your pages don't try to
write to trick the search engines or to
fool the bots that's a mistake but a lot
of people make because eventually the
boss will figure you out and nail your
nail you for you trying to cheat them
the reason that I have these evergreen
sites that have been popular for well
over a decade now in that it's because
the content it is written for humans so
you write for humans and that will go a
long way to keeping your site's search
engine optimized in terms of SEM search
engine marketing now there's all kinds
of strategies that can go into that but
again it comes down to writing really
good content so that people will want to
link to that content in the last several
years the major search engines while
Google's we need to care about is start
really paying attention to what's going
on in social so the the focus had
changed at that time and it still
changed where the search engines are
paying attention to what's abuzz at a
particular moment in terms of a
particular subject so if you had a site
that was selling shoes and there was a
lot of buzz about your shoe site on
Facebook and on Instagram and on Twitter
and I don't I guess Google+ I don't know
many people use Google+ but anyway
Google now gives that a lot of weight
pays attention to that so modern-day SEM
search engine marketing also includes a
need to address the social your social
presence on the web it's very important
so yeah there's so much more of it can
be talked about in terms of this subject
that's putting it out here to see
what people think see if they really
care about this and if you do I might do
more vlogs on it anyway cheers guys you
know I'm gonna give you guys a sneak
peek into the holiday season</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
