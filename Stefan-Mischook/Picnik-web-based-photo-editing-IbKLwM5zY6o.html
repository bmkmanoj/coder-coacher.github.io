heard that Google just bought a online
photo editing website called picnic this
is at picnik.com and I decided to take a
look at it because if Google touches
something it's usually well there's
usually a good reason for it and the
other reason I want to take a look at us
because I'm looking for alternative ways
to edit images for web pages as opposed
to having to buy very expensive photo
editing software like Photoshop of
course you can never expect you know an
online editing suite well at least not
for now to be as powerful as Photoshop
but fortunately for us web designers
really you don't typically need to do
much to prepare images a for of a web so
we're going to take a look at this and
we'll try it out
well before I click on the getting
starter if you look it says you can crop
resize rotate special effects awesome
fonts works on mac long que no download
nothing to install this is the key here
so let's try it out and see how well it
works
now I am running this particular site on
an older browser another older browser
and older computer while recording video
so it's it seems to be running pretty
well so let's upload a photo so I'm
going to go on to my desktop I got that
ok that's pretty fast so we got our
photo here those edit let's drop it
click the drag ok so here's our cropping
tool and it's like photoshop so I'm just
gonna get these these ebc dice here so
I'm going ok and then I'll you can set
the dimensions here scale that was going
to go ok here's our image that's pretty
cool so let's what else can we do we can
affect the color so there are sliders
here interesting so I'll just cancel
that and well you know for a lot of web
work you really just need to crop things
maybe work on some color sharpen some
stuff so what I'm going to do is get
overlay text here oh wow see touch-up
stickers over latex at effects and more
stuff but what I'm just going to save
this image for now I'm going to choose
an image type of PNG and leave
everything same hun percent I'll just
save the photo and it prompts us to
select where we want to download it I go
no we're going to call your sites to
save that's the that's pretty cool right
so let's look at our desktop and killer
sites too and there you go we've edited
the photo very quickly produced a PNG
ready for insertion into your web pages
without having to
of course without having to buy any web
design software this is of course is for
simple quick operations but modern web
design today really you know a lot of
times you just need simple image editing
to achieve your common goals it's
something worth exploring there's picnic
or something called aviary and I'll see
that's it there there we go here's
another one it allows you to edit images
and do all kinds of stuff actually it
looks like they got more advanced stuff
in audio editing screen capture
capabilities again a web-based solution
that allows you to do all kinds of
things this is a alternative to perhaps
using installed software like Photoshop
and again I'm not claiming that things
like aviary or picnic are going to
replace Photoshop but for certain simple
media image sound screen capturing
applications things that you may want to
do this could be an interesting solution
for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
