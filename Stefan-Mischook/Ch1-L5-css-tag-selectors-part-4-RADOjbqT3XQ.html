with our tag selector so I'm gonna teach
you another CSS property first of all
though I want to clean this up there's
no point having the 2h ones here now
that you understand how tag selectors
work let's say that refresh okay so
we're cool
of course blue and green clash so let's
make this orange i just prefer orange
okay that's better
so what we're going to do now is we're
going to learn about a new CSS property
let me just apply it to this second
headline here
that's the h2 which is right here and
we're gonna say text-align:center so
we're gonna Center this text now because
it says text - align center so again
this is your this is a CSS property this
is the value remember between the CSS
property and the value you have to have
this colon Ram and in between property
value pairs property value and a pair
you have to have the semicolon separates
them otherwise the web browser will get
confused about your CSS this semicolon
the separator that separates your
property value pairs it's kind of like a
period at an end of a sentence just
think of it that way anyway so now we're
saying this text-align:center
I'll hits save refresh it aligns the
text in the center we could also align
it to the right boom there it is right
and we could lie align it left but guess
what left is the default value right
remember default values it's the
automatic setting of that the web
browser will apply to the h2 tags while
all the H tags all the text tags the H
tags headers once forsakes the P tags
everything's aligned - laughs that's
just the default finally let's learn
another CSS property so we'll do it down
here so it's gonna be font
let's do font weight so let's set it to
bold
so let's see what happens so this is
applied to the paragraphs in our page so
we have two paragraphs this one here
this one down here so let's see what
happens boom
you see our text goes bold not bad let's
see if you go bolder even even more boat
and it doesn't do anything in the
browser
see sometimes CSS will work in one
browser and it won't work in another
you're gonna learn about this later on
in the course most of the time you're
okay but once in a while you get this
kind of thing where it goes will you go
what
why isn't going Boulder bang so there's
another way you can set font weight in
numbers so let's say at 200 right let's
set it to 600
it's even bolder instead of 10900 see if
that makes the difference now does it so
in the CSS specification if you remember
I talked about the w3c in the beginners
HTML course this is the organization a
bunch of nerds who get together who set
the rules for CSS and HTML and
JavaScript anyway for font weight you
can set it to bold bolder you can set it
from 100 to 900 but the browsers don't
necessarily fall of it perfectly
just enter 200 100 font weight 600 and
then it didn't do too much so was it
said 200 say that it makes it not bold
say you're getting the idea a lot of
times when you're working with CSS
you're gonna have to tinker around with
it a little bit because different
browsers will do things slightly
differently but we'll learn all about
that later on in a course so we've
learned a little bit more you guys are
now becoming experts at CSS tag
selectors you understand CSS properties
and values and how to create a proper
CSS block or to say properly a CSS
declaration block</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
