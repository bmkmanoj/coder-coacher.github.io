go freelance what do you need to do well
if you're going to go freelance the best
route of course is the web stack that's
why I teach that so once you're
comfortable building a responsive
website
you understand SQL you understand
databases you can do basic crud
operations if you don't know what that
is then you're not ready yet once you
have that then I say you put up a quick
little website demonstrating your skill
sets and then what you do is you go
online and you find some jobs to do now
you do may do one or two little freebie
jobs just to start building a portfolio
and practice so that you could practice
working with clients or better yet you
find a local business small business or
a friend who wants to start a business
and set up some basic websites the key
thing that you need to do when you want
to start freelancing after ever your
foundation skills is to get some
projects done so many projects then the
first one or two are going to be
freebies that's cool that's normal you
just got to get your feet wet you got to
get some experience and what you find is
when you do a couple of freebie projects
for some small business local small
business or whatnot or online maybe and
one of these online platforms depending
on where you live
one option may be better than the other
the key is you get some experience
working with clients and you start
getting some reputation all this of
course has to be showcased on your own
site so you better have a decent looking
site if you're not a designer you're
more of a developer back-end coder type
then just use the template there's no
harm in using a template because if
you're selling yourself as a coder
back-end designer inter-process somebody
would deliver this process then it
doesn't matter if that you use a
template on the other hand if you are
doing front-end development then well if
you're doing front-end development you
don't need to know crud although if you
do some back-end development talking PHP
or JavaScript back end type of work with
node
example you could have many more
opportunities if you do full stack
development of course you can specialize
in one or the other but for example if
you know a little bit of PHP so you can
for example maybe the stall WordPress
where people do WordPress installations
some seeming forum that's a great way
again one of the things you got to learn
and understand that when you are a
freelancer it's about being very
flexible in terms of your skill set you
can't think of yourself there's somebody
who just does this you have to think of
your some you've got to think of
yourself as a professional who can adapt
and learn and utilize whatever
technologies you need for a particular
job but what you're gonna find typically
as a freelancer you're going to be doing
a lot of web stack you're going to be
doing a lot of PHP work and there's a
lot of WordPress work as a freelancer
now again depends where you are in the
world but for instance people tell me
time and time again they may love Python
and may want to do Python web problem is
there's not too many Python web jobs up
there when you're doing Python work
that's typically AI and robotics machine
learning that kind of stuff
data sciences I'm not sure I'm not sure
how much freelance work there is in that
although there might be again you got a
look at the local markets anyway to
summarize you want to cover freelancer
once you have your foundation coding
skills no matter what type of work you
want to do you have to set up a site is
your portfolio and you've got to make
sure it looks good and then you got to
reach out and start doing one or two
free jobs stashes if you will that's
normal a lot of people think they got to
go to a boot camp because they can get
the stash work well you don't need a
boot camp you don't spend 5 10 20 grand
to go to a boot camp so you can do stash
work trust me why don't you have your
basics down you have that site up where
you can do your basic stuff then you can
go reach out to different small
businesses here and there and there'll
be plenty of opportunity for you in
terms of finding work you got to
consider your first two or three gigs as
part of the training free training right
I hope that helps quick tip of course a
lot more to getting up and running as a
freelancer but this is just a quick
little tip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
