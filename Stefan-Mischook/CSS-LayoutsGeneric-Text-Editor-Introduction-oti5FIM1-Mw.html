of Earth welcome to another killer sites
training tutorial in this tutorial we're
going to be looking at CSS layout and
what we're going to be attempting to
reproduce is exactly what you see in
front of you a very simple fix pixel
layout with HTML navigation system which
is created through CSS and we're going
to be learning how to create multiple
column layouts much as you see here in a
two column scenario we're also going to
be learning how to nest a couple of divs
inside that column so that we can divide
an existing column into multiple columns
as we see here and of course as you see
down here in the footer area I'll also
show you how we can introduce more than
one div into a nested area and this
nested div situation is something that
you can use in any different
configuration infinite amount of
possibilities so once you know the
basics you'll be able to go nuts with
whatever you would like to do in terms
of your layout now I'm going to be
working within a dream weaver
environment but I don't want you to
think that we're going to be doing this
all in the WYSIWYG environment I'll be
working strictly in the code view so
that means that anybody who's following
along and does not have dreamweaver not
to worry you can use any HTML editor to
work with CSS and basic HTML all the
stuff we're going to be talking about in
this particular video so for those of
you who are wondering i don't have
dreamweaver and i'd like to get myself
an HTML editor what can I work with well
quite literally as you more than likely
already know coming to this video this
is not a beginner video for CSS so you
should be looking at any of the earlier
CSS basics from killer sites and if you
have all of that information in place
you'll be much more ready for what we
have in store for you in this particular
video now having said that you probably
are
know that any text editor will work for
you when trying to create HTML and CSS
but at the same time let me draw your
attention to a number of different HTML
editors that can work for you and do a
pretty good job and these are all free
editors so that's why I want to bring
them to your attention at this point
traditionally a lot of people have been
working with netbeans NetBeans is a
really great program and it's free as
you can see here on their website
directly something that you could use as
it says here to develop desktop mobile
web applications with Java PHP c or c
sharp c++ and more runs on Windows Linux
Mac OS as well so if you do not want to
work with netbeans there's also another
one here called HTML kit which is for
more than just HTML but will suit you
just fine when it works with HTML and
CSS as well simply also javascript PHP
any other type of scripting language you
want to work with HTML kit is another
good choice for you there's also another
one here called aptana app tennis studio
3 is a very simple editor that works
just fine for HTML html5 CSS CSS 3 all
of these things so you can take a look
at any one of those if you don't happen
to have dreamweaver but again like i
said i'll be working in dreamweaver but
not to worry simply because anything
that I'm doing in Dreamweaver you can do
in any of the HTML CSS editors that I've
brought to your attention so if you
don't have that program just go ahead
download one of the other free programs
that I've pointed you to and we'll be
ready to start in our second video
