only $9.99 of course coms young dot-com
studio webcomics indirect setup shredder
so let's do a search let's say we wanted
to do a website on on shark vacation so
we go shark vacation and we hit enter so
now what's gonna happen is we're gonna
search to see what domain names are
available but have a name sharp vocation
vacation excuse me so here you go it
says right here good news this domain is
available sharp vacation calm so there
is a dot-com now if you scroll down you
see this a lot of domain name sellers
registrar's they have different options
for you you have CA org dot Co net info
and then they give you variations here
sharp vacations with a NASSCOM so you
see with domain names you have different
extensions again the extension is
anything past the period here so what
they do what we do on this site is we
just show you the extensions after name
so we were lucky here short vacation
calm was actually available so if I want
to buy it I would just hit select and it
would be selected so now this is my
shopping cart so and you would just
checkout continue to cart you would just
check out as you would if you were
buying a book on Amazon or something and
here it is now they're gonna give you
all kinds of extra options privacy and
so on most of these options to be
totally honest with you most people
don't need one thing though you could
use is hosting right because though you
buy a domain name as you know next step
step two is to get your hosting so as I
said before many registrar's these
bridges charter just companies that sell
domain names they also sell hosting so
you could select hosting as well so you
got deluxe hosting economy hosting
you've got all these different options
for hosting so let me scroll down so
what what are these options these
options are just
server options so economy is this one
website hundred gigs of space on their
on their servers so remember when you're
hosting you're just renting space on a
company's web server so you're renting
one hundred gigs of space unlimited
bandwidth what's that mean
bandwidth has to do with how often your
site is visited by people and every time
somebody loads your site if all the
images and the files in site and the
video adds up to hundred Meg's they have
to download a hundred make so that's
called the bandwidth all that
information moving from the server to
people visiting your site to the web
browsers remember the request response
cycle I talked about early on in the
HTML course anyhow
unlimited bandwidth which is common
today just basically means you could
have basically unlimited traffic 100
email addresses right let's say we got
this domain name which was what was it
called again it was shark vacation com
let's say you wanted your you know but
say your name was Nick you wanted you
know Nick at shark application com you
wanted that that email address this is
where this comes in they give you a
hundred email addresses which is a lot
and you got databases what's a database
a database is just an app used to hold
lots of information data the word data
is just a nerd word for information
anyway if you want to build a shopping
cart systems maybe some games on your
website or something
you'll get our membership system on your
site you would have to get a database so
even economy basic economy hosting at
seven dollars a month
comes with ten databases which is a lot
and then you of course you got deluxe
hosting and you've got all kinds of you
know more email just 500 email addresses
unlimited disk space so you get the idea
so as your your hosting package
increases in cost and so much $6.99 a
month to you know on the upper limit is
fourteen you're getting a lot of
capabilities now this is just the basics
of hosting by the way you can get super
super expensive hosting at thousands a
month and if you're a huge site like
Facebook they're probably spending
million a month
thing but for most sites 99% of sites
you're probably gonna be great with
economy hosting and he would just buy it
you so he'd go click you continue to
cart we're gonna skip these other
options let's load it up so here we go
so $9.99 so short vacation calm here it
is for three years it's going to cost me
$9.99 a year to to to buy this domain
that's the last thing I'm going to talk
about with regards to buying domain
names you have to pay per year so for
this one is $9.99 per year if you buy
three years but if you buy one year
what's the price well it's still 99
$9.99 per year and this is normal for
all domains so Google pays their $9.99
per year for their site for a very
domain rather and so on different
domains name extensions like dot-com is
$9.99 but dot TV could be $15.99 so
you'll see when you're registering a
domain what the price will be but
typically you're there in this price
range there's more about registering
domains I won't get into it now but this
is just the basics now why is it all 94
bucks well that's because they're adding
the hosting right hosting economy
hosting and 12 months $6.99 a month so
the ayat it all up so if I go to one
month $6.99 so they can only it would
only charge you for one bucks old $9.99
$6.99 17 anywhere there you go so anyway
so you would proceed to checkout and
then you would buy the domain and it
would be all set up so that's cool so
the next step is you would get an email
from the registrar in this case is the
killer sites registrar and they will
send you all the information you need in
terms of getting getting your files on
to your new domain sharp vacation com
see the server company the registrar
company's going to take care of all
kinds of details about setting all this
up they do it for you automatically so
you don't have to so all you after you
pay all you have to do is wait for your
email your username and password so that
you can log in to a hosting control
panel which I'm going to show you in the
next video and then with the hosting
control panel you
upload your site</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
