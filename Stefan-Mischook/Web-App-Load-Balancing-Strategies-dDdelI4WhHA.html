I could go over some load balancing
ideas with regards to deploying your app
on the cloud now I'm no expert in
cloud-based load balancing but I'll tell
you what I seen out there and what we've
considered and what we're going to be
doing with studio web or what we've done
so limber one you can look at load
balancing on a server level and you can
also look at it edit how it can be
implemented within your app itself in
terms of how you distribute the load so
what I'm talking about a load I'm
talking about traffic load how many
people how many users hitting your app
and in this context I'm talking about of
course web-based applications whether it
be PHP Python Java C sharp Ruby based
whatever and the different load
balancing strategies are dependent on
your particular circumstances so for
instance you may have an app that's very
database intensive meaning all the cpu
load will be actually executed for lack
of better terms will be executed on the
database level rather on your app model
or your object level so depending on
where the load is you might wanna change
your load balancing strategy so the
simple strategy will call it the round
robin strategy in turns over again web
apps so you have one web server that
sits there and waits for requests to
come in now on discussing things here
with the assumption that you've written
some code you know some of the basics
request response server client database
that kind of thing I'm not going to get
into that here so you got one web server
that sort of sitting there and it's
taking in requests and this is a very
lightweight server it doesn't take much
memory doesn't take much CPU because all
it does is it's just routing requests
it's robbing request to different
installs of your main app so you have
your router up here and then you got
your main app so let's say you have your
main router and you have three instance
is of your app 123 run independent of
each other they're all on each door each
evening on their own virtual machine so
they have their own CPU they have their
own Ram so what this is this kind of
dumb dumb round-robin distribution style
on the request so as a request comes
into your load balancer at the topping
of a pyramid you got this top one at the
peak of the pyramid and you've got three
apps on the base this thing takes
requests that routes it to you to server
number one that aroused it's a virtual
server number two then routes up to
virtual server number three and it does
again boom boom boom boom boom this is
kind of a dumb dumb system so I call
this a dumb dumb system because the
router at the peak of the pyramid does
not check to see the load on each
instance of the app so this might get
overloaded instance number one and you
know any instance number two may not
have too many people on it even though
it's round robin you know maybe a lot of
people users are on instance number two
maybe they locked off or is a lot of
people just keep on sticking on instead
of instance number one now this is kind
of a very basic way of load balancing
now one thing I should mention about
this the style blow bouncing where you
have the the router and the three
instances they would typically share one
database so you think of its icon it's
like a top so you have the road balance
at the bottom end you have the database
at the bottom see we have the low
balance at the top database at the
bottom in between you got your instances
of the app in that situation they're
also sharing the same database this is
just one style you would lose this style
of load balancing if the load the
processing was really heavy duty on the
App level right because you're sharing
one database so this one database with
course would be on another virtual
server with its own around its own
memory its own CPU and so forth ram cpu
ram and memory same thing so its own
memory its own cpu
and yeah so these the three instance
apps would share that that's just one
strategy maybe you have another
situation where the heavy load is going
to be on the database so next situation
you may want to distribute your database
now that it's a whole different way of
approaching that now I know that AWS has
a this ingenious way which I've just
read about talked about a bit where you
have to design your database from the
get-go in a certain way but then they
will be able to take care of the load
balancing of your database access so
take care of replication and all kinds
of other things like that it's very very
sophisticated very powerful and it's
super cool from a nerds point of view so
that's another way a dum-dum way of
doing dealing with database load is to
maybe have different tables in your
database held on different servers so
you might have your user table on
database and then have a sales table
another database and so that you know
the processing of all this kind of stuff
could be done on separate virtual
machines another thing you could do is
maybe have long-term records in that you
hold in your database periodically
stored on a third database or a fourth
database separate from the active
database so when you're generating heavy
duty reports that take a lot of
number-crunching your number crunch on a
another app serve another server sees me
so you don't affect the performance of
your main your main active server so you
may have a reporting database it just
deals with the reporting and of things
see I'm just just a couple of strategies
I mentioned on top of my head now what
we're doing we're doing something I
called I just called the dum-dum
strategy and I'm able to do that because
without our app we can segment the app
by region by even by client if they're
big enough so I can have a version of my
I haven't installed rather of my app for
just Texas another installed my app for
just California
never install for whatever you get the
idea and what we're doing is we're
having for smaller areas will have just
a nap database sitting in the same
virtual space or same virtual server and
so if we have like New York State they
have their own right and California
though they're bigger we may divide that
into different sections so have
California self central North you know
each one with their own installed the
install include both database and the ND
app itself no load balancing requirement
now if you want to step that up you can
set it up within a region where you have
load balancing built in like the first
strategy one two three database shared
by the three insistence with a load
balancer at the peak I hope this make
sense you might use that so California
would say it's a big state you might do
that there so it depends how you load
balance is a bit of a tricky issue but
let me tell you because as I said in the
cloud server vlog it's so much easier
than it used to be it's unbelievable all
right somebody just ping me on my phone
so that's the end of this blog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
