quick little vlog of an answer question
I get put to me on occasion what
computers do I use to do my work I am
today an architect of code I don't
actively write code on a daily basis I
just don't have the time that said when
it comes to coding all computers are
pretty much equal these days although
you got the Linux guys who argue
otherwise and the Mac guys will argue
otherwise the windows guys will argue
otherwise otherwise and there are merits
to everybody's arguments but I can tell
you from my years of being a developer I
worked with Linux and ball a long time
ago I worked a lot of windows different
flavors of Windows and I worked with Mac
and a lot of it is personal tastes which
you prefer to do with your broader
computer requirements are so I'll give
you a quick run-through of what I do
very quick what I have so I have the
surface pro which is the hybrid Windows
tablet Windows 10 it when I got this two
years ago there's the windows pro 4 when
I got this two years ago it was an
amazing computer it works so well you
got this little flip screen a little
flip stand so you can hold it any angle
you got the keyboard which comes off of
course great device boy with all the
bloody updates that Windows 10 gives you
it's almost like every three minutes
they update the thing and sometimes
would work really well with the
windowing what were fantastic you drag
and drop and bing-bang-boom is fantastic
other times not so good this I don't
know if it's a function the problem I've
been having with this and terms of the
window lis windowing features I don't
know if it's a problem so much of
Windows 10 or more the firmware on this
device I don't know I haven't heard
otherwise but I have to say Windows 10
is the best version of Windows I ever
use I've been using it since 3.1 Windows
3.1 and this is has a lot of merits has
a great webcam and it's very fast so I
bought this because
I needed to produce content on Windows
10 because most people still use Windows
so I produce my courses a lot of courses
on Windows 10 just to make people feel
comfortable that said and as you know if
you've done my programming courses you
know that whether you're using Windows
Mac or Linux doesn't matter if you're
programming and you know html5 uses not
programming but if you're writing html5
css3 programming JavaScript Python PHP
SQL it doesn't matter what computer you
use it's personal taste they all work
fine but I bought this to do demos on
Windows and because there's as one
design app that I use a piece of
software for graphics creations that I
use on occasion something very few
people use but it's the best one I've
ever seen
much better than Adobe products in my
opinion and but only runs on Windows so
that's one of the reasons why I got this
computer but this is a two-year-old
machine and it's plenty fine Windows Pro
this is the surface pro 4 it works
fantastic you could use this to program
the next Facebook so the other computer
that I use of course is the MacBook Pro
this is the pro the 2016 with this
useless touch bar on the top here which
nobody ever uses that's a total failure
and yeah I use this this is my general
computer because it's super fast quad
core because I like Mac OS because it's
I feel as the Sun it's a more stable
operating system I never have crashes I
can keep this running for four years
without having to restart and it's fine
and it works really good
I edit 4k video on this without a
problem and so this is my daily driver I
would say but you know as I said these
days computers yourself so capable it's
it's up to you which one you want to use
and you could use a five year old
computer and you could be writing
amazing code because remember face book
was written ten what ten years ago using
ten-year-old computers worked fine right
the days of
to upgrade your computer every two years
like we used to
not important unless you're doing maybe
some high high-end 3d work or something
you know other than that yeah so yeah I
use both Windows and Mac most of the
time 90% of the time I'm using my Mac
simply because of the type of work what
I do but I also use this one for some
specialized app and occasionally what I
want to do when I want to do a demo on
Windows and that's about it so that's
what I use in 2018 to run my business
well I use the personal part of my
business my developers their windows
people no excuse me and their Mac people
generally speaking a lot of developers
prefer Mac finally because it's kind of
a sexy-looking computer but so are a lot
of the Windows machines very nice you
know and this is not exactly it's not
the nicest one out there but a lot of
them like using Apple Mac computers
because Mac is actually freebsd linux
unix rather under the hood so you have
all the command lines all the linux and
unix command capabilities built right
into the core of Mac OS you don't have
to install anything but being said it's
super easy to put unix command lines i
think is wind seep CP or something like
that I forget the name of the app but
it's super easy to set up your windows
takes about five minutes then it can
interface with a UNIX based server no
problemo
so yeah but anyway a lot of people just
like the Apple developers like the Apple
but it's not necessary a lot of
developers like Windows
everybody's doing dotnet c-sharp dotnet
it's all Windows amongst others anyway
