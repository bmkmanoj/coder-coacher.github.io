talk about technology fads and how to
identify them and what are the
implications of it all
etc etc etc okay so what exactly our
technology fads these are things that
are hyped up and then they fade there's
a fanatical draw to them and then also
and they just disappear so technology
fact could be I'm going to go back way
back to the old days domain name
speculation domain names selling once
upon a time was pretty big I don't how
big a business it was but you used to
see all these guys running around buying
up domain names and then trying to sell
them for huge amounts of money and in
fact you would see people who would get
ridiculous amounts of money for domain
names so the big examples from you 90s
the early well now early 90s mid to late
90s were V coms like business comm and
so on there sold for million I think it
was a million or two million dollars you
gotta said these are domain names with
no sight they're just domain names so
back in those days the gamblers and
speculators speculators a wall street
term for gambling listen say it's a
clean term for gambling when you're
buying and selling stocks on a daily
basis or weekly basis this is not
investing this is just pure gambling
it's a whole different thing anyway so
domain name speculation slash gambling
was a big thing back in the 90s early
2000s because people didn't quite
understand search as well as they should
and so they assumed that the domain name
had a huge impact in terms of your
site's traffic so example business comm
which traded a few times I think few
hands bought it and for big big money
because people assumed wrongly that
business comm has some major cash a it
had some cachet had some value
but not major but that's the nature of
early technology adoption there's a lot
of speculation and people don't really
know though at the end of the day
whether or not something is going to
shake out in the way that they feel
typically from my experience everything
is greatly exaggerated so for example
with dot column specially with dot-com
speculation scuse me
Weatherby comma or whatever with domain
name speculation there is some value to
certain domain names that have better
she remembers or short their memorable
always remember but not nearly as much
as people would believe a big business
calm I think the last sale for it was
like three million or 3.2 million again
this is not a site just a debt domain
that's a funny story I remember back in
I don't I was 93 and 94 sitting in the
back of my friend's business he had a
server room and we were involved with
the web a little bit I had built my
first website it was 94 and I say I
think it was 94 cause I always forget is
even 94 or very early 95 I built my site
but we were aware of the web prior to
that and well around that time and if I
recall it's been a long time a lot of
domain names like primary domain using
business comm in restaurants common
these type of things there were so many
available I remember sitting in the back
room with my buddy go you know one day
this Web thing could be pretty big and
yeah I think so too
now you have to understand at that time
most of the web was just academic
university sites basically pages of text
that's it
when I put up my web site in late 94
early 95 whatever data was I had one of
the very first websites in the world
that had photos and Colour photos back
in those days if you could put up a very
colorful photo that downloaded in a
reasonable amount of time you are like a
superstar web
designer in those days just to give you
an idea of where it was and so we
thought about it you know and maybe a
good thing to get into
and of course typical step fashion I was
involved in my own business that didn't
have anything to do attack I was in the
tech I was in the pet product business
and rare fish I support rare tropical
fish from different parts of the world
from all over Africa and South America
sometimes Asia and then we would sell
these to shoot these things to pet
stores public zoos aquariums and
collectors of course and these were
necessary cheap fish a lot of our stuff
was very expensive high-end you see the
whole pet industry back in those days
was very saturated an older business so
as the market matures in a particular
sector pet products technology
development whatever whatnot you have to
become more and more specialized more
and more niche to be able to succeed so
in that very well-established business
the way we succeeded was by getting into
very rare fish a week I've been on
expeditions down into the jungles and
South America and we go into these
tributary rivers in the Amazon spending
like two three weeks in the Amazon in
three weeks to a month of the Amazon and
looking for rare finish and we pick them
up and we sell for a big premium and
people buy from us because they couldn't
get them elsewhere that business now
over I got out of it in I see if I sold
out my position in 96 yeah 96 and that's
what I flipped from writing code just
for myself and doing little things here
and there for others to become a
full-time web designer contractor
amongst other things anyhow so put in
perspective back then the the web was
something that Bill Gates didn't believe
it's not this web thing is scooby minor
that's why I didn't put too much work
into the web browser at the time they
didn't take it was going to be a real
thing
so I went on this huge tangent anyway
dot-com selling comms was a fad big fad
and it kind of died out people still try
to do it of course but it's just really
website templates a big one as well
used to be a lot of big website template
sites and people was people were
involved with a lot of web type website
template resellers were out there now
they still exist of course that there
was a search as fad it grows and editors
Peters out and it's there but it's not
nearly as prevalent it's not nearly as
visible as it was eight ten years ago
I'll talk about a more recent one mobile
app development mobile app development
creating a game or app for the iPhone or
to lesser extent the Android device
that's going to make you a fortune in
the flappy birds or something and now
this was a huge fad and this is somebody
getting to when iPhone just came out but
now I would not do it in terms of trying
to develop your own app unless it's an
app to support some other business that
you have and the reason I say that is
because well a lot of time I checked
there's something like 40,000 new apps
hitting the iOS App Store I think it's
every day every day or every month or
any other so not only that you got to
compete against the 40,000 or so app
store being developed let's just say
every month only 40,000 plug you have to
develop all the other apps there on the
App Store now so an article I read a few
years ago they were talking about how at
the time most app developers were making
you know three four hundred dollars a
month or something u.s. yeah I guess if
you're living in the third world or
something that maybe that's cool but you
know for a lot of people it's not cool
and in fact it matters you can make a
lot more money doing PHP WordPress
development much more money but you know
we talked about PHP WordPress in the
passengers and how people perceive it
but again even though ironically PHP and
WordPress have been around for a long
long time
predating I have mobile app development
so forth it's it's a niche now it's a
niche that people can profit from
because a lot of people don't want to do
it they think they got to get into node
J S or something to make a lot of money
or a I of oais there's something to be
said there but yeah you know fads come
and go another fad that was big in I
don't know early 2000s I guess was the
flash games i one point a lot of people
thought that flash online games in your
web browser were going to be very very
big and it was a community growing out
of that and of course that that died of
course that never went anywhere what we
have going on now is something called
crypto currencies crypto currencies are
Bitcoin litecoin ethic oeid and there
are several others many others and
people are jumping into this thing
saying it's going to be you is very big
now yeah it's already big and I'm
dabbling in some stuff in terms of
cryptocurrencies and when I absolutely
use all I'll mention that but my feeling
is that it's going to do what a lot of
other technologies do it is going to be
a rise big rise and then it's just going
to fade and fall away now it's not going
to disappear
I think cryptocurrency technologies
blockchain is something very very
relevant but how it plays out in the
real world is going to be interesting to
see because the way I look at it a
Bitcoin litecoin at the coin you know
will probably hold some value for a
little while or maybe longer but as soon
as a major player comes out with their
own cryptocurrency whether it be a
country whether it be a major bank or
some you know I don't know what it is
but soon as of a big institution comes
out with some sort of cryptocurrency
it's going to have a negative impact I
think on what's out there now the
argument against what I just said is
that people like the anonymity of things
I gather and litecoin and bitcoin who
knows but all the say is the
cryptocurrency run has it still has a
lot of legs to it there's no question
the thing is
was going to work out it's going to be
very interesting like I don't know I
don't know where the money is going to
be made
I think the mining of bitcoins made over
the last seven years I'm not sure how
much money you can do that with that now
say I don't know about that they're like
coin maybe but it's an interesting again
another technology fad that we see out
there now how it will settle it's hard
to say who knows but understand what it
is I seen this pattern of before just
like calm speculation domain name
speculation where people would buy up
tons of domain names and then try to
sell and some made money but I don't
like most did so just keep that in mind
some thoughts from a wizened old nerd
such as myself you might be interested
in that so there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
