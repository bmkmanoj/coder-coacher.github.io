killer sights calm in this video blog
going to answer a question that was
recently put to me and it's a common
question how do you get your first web
programming or web design gigs so the
first thing you have to do of course is
you have to build your skill sets and
the best way to build your skill sets is
to build projects once you have your
preliminary your basic understanding of
you know you know HTML CSS PHP der or
whatever language you choose to learn
that said so to get your first projects
you might want to do well first thing I
would do is your own personal website
right you gotta have a website so that's
a good way to to start you have to you
have to have that now if you're a
designer and you're selling your skills
mainly as a web designer well you better
have a pretty good looking website slick
doesn't necessarily mean fancy but
should look really really nice right
there's best your salary your design
skills if your web programmer doesn't
mean you can have a crappy looking site
but you can have more of a minimal site
stylistically and because you're
emphasizing your ability to build web
applications web programming as opposed
to a design right so you got a little
more you got a little bit more leeway as
a programmer in that regard so the big
question is how you get your first
clients well when you're first starting
out you have to pay your dues and what
does pay your dues me you means you
might have to do one or two smallish
freebie projects just to get your feet
wet and the fact of the matter when
you're new to the game even though you
study this stuff you really develop your
skills in building actual systems
building sites for people that's a
really and so you're worth a lot less in
the beginning and you will be a year two
three down the line so it depends all
quick you are you may you may get theirs
you may get develop your skills much
more quickly and which means you'd be
much more productive which means you're
much more valuable as a web professional
whether you're a designer programmer so
you may have to do one or two freebies
and
you know how do you get your freebies
maybe local butcher or tailor or some
friend of yours what's the siRNA small
business etc etc so you start building
these sites and when you have a couple
under your belt and you can show that
you're competent then you should be able
to start scoring some small little jobs
here and there again at first you're
going to have to suck on rocks a little
bit and not get paid as you will later
as you would later on but then again it
makes sense because you're a beginner
you're going to be much more prone to
mistakes and things are going to take
you much more time than a highly
experienced web professional so that's
why you got to charge less it's just
fair makes sense but in time and you'll
know this I should develop your skills
will prove your ability to produce work
little crease quite quickly so your time
is going to be more valuable right from
the start you know how you value
somebody's time should be it's not
always the case but it should be
regardless of profession based on your
ability to be productive to do and how
difficult to work that you're doing it
shouldn't be based on you know how old
you are or how how many years you was
sitting around on the job you're that's
you know that's just my opinion about
things you know so when it comes to web
design web programming this is it's not
an opinion this is just the way it works
fortunately you know I believe in the
meritocracy meaning if you merit the
higher pay you should get the higher pay
you shouldn't get the higher pay because
you're related to somebody or because
you've been in the office doing the same
thing for 20 years and you haven't
improved your skill sets no it's a
meritocracy especially as a freelance
web designer web programmer you will be
rewarded the money if you can prove that
you have the skills so make sense in in
this in this field in the web
programming and the web design field to
actually develop your skills that
continuously improve because you will
see this translate into more jobs and
higher paying jobs
quickly enough more so than so many
other professions that have been
corrupted or infected by by things like
goodbye by government involvement and so
on you know
I again I don't want to get political
but I don't know it doesn't make sense
but a janitor who's wiping floors makes
you know 20 percent or 50 percent more
than a junior janitor but just because
they've been around for 20 years I know
it sounds good but how is that fair to
everybody else it's not fair you know if
you could mop floors you can mop floors
nothing wrong with mopping floors I did
that by the way but the patient be based
on how old are you or you are how you
know how long you've been doing
something the page should be based on
your ability to produce quality work and
on the skill sets that you've
accumulated if you're a very
sophisticated web programmer or designer
and you can do really good work and you
can get senior highly productive because
you're highly trained and capable then
you deserve to make the big money but if
you're stumble if you're Stumbler and it
takes you time to build a basic page
because you're just a beginner then you
should make less that's just fair and
anyway so there you go you got to do
freebie projects to get your first gigs
you got to expect to make a little less
at first and as your skills develop your
the number of projects your it again
it's going to increase quite a bit and
the amount of money you can charge per
hour is going to cruise quite a bit
again I'm talking more or less sort of
perspective of freelancing and dealing
with small business although this
loosely applies if you're going to go
work for somebody if you're a junior
coming to work for a firm you got to
make less fun than the senior guys who
are really competent and capable as it
should be but you know in good firms and
progressive firms if you work hard and
you develop high level skills you will
get paid accordingly from what I've seen
in the field so that's it all right
we'll talk soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
