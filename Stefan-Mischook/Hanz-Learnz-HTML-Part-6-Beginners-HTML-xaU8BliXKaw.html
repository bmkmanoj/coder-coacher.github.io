images so let's actually learn how to
insert images into our webpages I like
that so we're going to put one at the
top of page here and instead of typing
out the code we've seen your time I just
going to cut and paste code but I have
and I'm explain to you what's going on
there's a lot of details there so first
of all let's just take a look at this
site this is the image tank IMG is short
for image village all right so what's
this first rendus a naive little flower
so we got our flower going on so what
was the flower initially let's take a
look at that we go into our Hans learns
folder right and if you see we're
working on the harms dash web dash
design dashboard dash to talk to HTML
that's a file and it's our Father we're
working on right now and if you look
here there's a folder called images
right I'll pop that open oh there's the
flower there's a flower and the flower
file is called flower P&amp;amp;G you have Reb
cited another image file called killer
size jpg now jpg is a different type of
image file that PNG where was the
difference basically jpg is better at
compressing photographs event PNG now
what do I mean by compressing I mean
squishing it down so it's not so big so
downloads faster from the internet oh so
the size of the file exactly we'll get
into this now but I just want you to
take away from this part is that there
are a couple of different file types of
actually three that are often seen on
the web that's PNG jpg some people call
this just leaping jpg yes and then
there's no one called gift but it's not
being used nearly as much now great and
you won't get into the reasons why it's
part of this legal actually so this is
go back just understand that so if you
look at her page again right and it
would know
you notice in our image tag I have this
attribute here called SR see what does
it mean this is short for source as in
the source of the image and because this
image happens to be in the images folder
I write it down here oh and then when I
have the slash that tells the web
browser that were going into a directory
and we're going into the images
directory and then we're going to get
the flower dot PNG image file now if
understood this correctly what this
means is you're telling the code go to
the images folder then inside the images
folder go to the flower dot PNG file
exactly okay see if the if the if the
folder was called pictures bread this
would be written down as pictures
instead of images okay this source
information this images / flower PNG a
lot of people call this the path to the
image think of a path like you're
walking through woods in this case it's
a path through the file system and
you're going into this folder that make
sense yes that's telling me us it's
telling us the directions in the path
exactly where to find the image exactly
so this is important for you to
understand because understanding paths
is one of those basic concepts in web
design that can trip people up all right
more than later the next attribute of
the image tag is the alt tag alt is
short for alternative and all this does
it allows you to put in a little bit of
information about this image information
liquid well you can use it to describe
the image so right now I just put in
flower image and this basically is a way
to give more information to the web
browser about your page search engines
will use this in sequim a searcher you
page and try to classify things so look
at the alt attributes on your image
so we just put in the description of
damage yes generally speaking that's
what you would do and of course you have
the width and the height attribute you
just put the actual width and height of
the image I'll deal with it is though
well when you're out putting your image
from the program that you use to create
the image like Photoshop or illustrator
you can set that but also in Windows you
should be able to set it and you can
look in properties when you scroll down
here so I select my image and since
dimensions right here oh yeah well I
think you could right click to ax t from
them as they try a very good up right
let's sing this before and I'll give you
sighs and kilobytes spoiling details
there it is in details details so 128
pixels so you have to put that in your
coat yeah you just put 128 and you'll
have to put just a number just put the
number on exactly so there you go we've
inserted an image into our web page the
wait a minute was the closing tag is
this is one of the few tags in HTML that
does not have a closing tag really
there's a few yeah image is one of them
there's a few others but this is the one
you're probably going to use the most
often okay so it's a self-contained tank
exactly I like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
