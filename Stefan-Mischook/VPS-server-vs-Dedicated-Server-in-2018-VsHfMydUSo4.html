and cons of a virtual private server a
VPS versus dedicated hosting now I use
both and I used both rather and I use
dedicated hosting for many years and now
I've moved over everything to VPS so let
me give you a quick run-through
dedicated hosting is you get your own
physical box it's not shared with
anybody your own hardware your own hard
drive etc etc the cost for that could be
as low as a hundred bucks a month and
much much higher much much higher the
advantage of that is that you have full
control you don't have to worry about
somebody running up you know slowing
down the web server because their
website gets attacked by some DOAs or
something it gives you a lot of control
total control the problem with the
traditional dedicated server is that you
have a single point of failure meaning
if the hard drive fails you're down if
the CPU fails you're down the power
supply is down it goes down your site is
down because you got to go in there fix
it now the modern hosting companies who
provide physical servers for you they'll
have a team they'll come in to fix
things so it could be that that could be
fine but you may have a situation when
you have a physical server physical
dedicated server where your site will be
down because a hardware failure now I
had dedicated servers for 10 years or so
or longer maybe like 15 and AD hardly
hardware failures maybe twice that was
down for 20 minutes so it's not like a
huge issue unless you've got some site
where you cannot afford to ever be down
keep that in mind also in terms of hard
drive failure I'm going to mention it
because some people could imagine if you
get a physical server you want to get
yourself a physical hardware RAID with
at least two disk so if one hard drive
fails the other one just takes over and
they hot-swap put another one in and
everything's good Bob's your uncle
fantastic the other downside with a
physical dedicated server is that when
you need to upgrade let's say your site
starts
building up your app starts building up
something happened to me recently where
it's getting in a lot of lot more users
and everything was starting to really
slow down now if you're on a physical
dedicated server to upgrade it is a real
pain there's gonna be downside whether
you try to add RAM or add CPU or
increase the disk size or speed or maybe
you're just gonna have to switch to a
whole brand-new physical data physical
dedicated server you gotta keep that in
mind as well because that you know
that's that's some downtime their major
hassles and I can tell you from the
point of view as an app developer even
if you would see of your app you know
some complex app likes to do web and you
move and you have one physical dedicated
server with this OS this Apache this
hardware and you move to another
physical dedicated server to upgrade
because you need the power and you have
the same operating system and the same
software I can tell you from my
experience there's always almost always
going to be problems of configuration
always going to be problems of kind of
configuration because they're not the
same machine so you got to keep that in
mind that could delay you hours if not a
dare to trying to configure things on a
new server so if you're in a physical
dedicated server what you got to do is
you got a plan on some overlay if you
will where your retiring server one to
go to server two cause you need the
power be sure that you have server two
all configured running and tested for a
few days at least a few days before you
transfer from the old server to new so
just that you can account for any
downtime you're gonna have in
configuration issues you're gonna have
Virtual Private servers are basically
cloud-based hosting where you basically
get a virtualized server but it's on
depending on the student depending on
the host hosting company it could be
even on one big box that's shared by
many people or it could be on distribute
across many physical boxes that's the
ideal situation any advantage of
the VPS is that your whole servers
virtualized within a box so if the piece
of hardware fails though the other
hardware to take up its slack so there
should be no downtime that's huge that's
huge right because you know you don't
want downtime the other big advantage of
VPS because it's a virtualized server it
can be upgraded super easily so let's
say you start off you got two CPUs and
four gig of ram and a 40 gig hard drive
and all sudden you're starting a popular
then you can within just a minute
double speed quadruples be quintal to
speed that's what I did recently where I
was getting influx of users and it's
like the software is getting really slow
so I could just go click click and
within a minute I double the speed and
then 2 weeks later at even much more
users I went click click I double the
speed again not something you cannot do
with a dedicated physical server that
ability to just go and upgrade also with
Virtual Private servers you can easily
easily move it and clone it to different
virtual private servers I guess it's
like the same as the upgrade so when you
get a virtual private server you are
basically exchanging maybe ultimate like
power versus dollar like you probably
get more bang for your buck in terms of
raw power with the physical server but
you're replacing that raw power with
flexibility and infinite scalability
meaning your app can adapt you can add
more horsepower to your app with very
little effort and depending on the
service provider to hosting company you
don't take care of all the backups and
auto auto restores and all kinds of
other stuff so what are they host so
amusing now they do all that they could
take care of the backups they take care
of the patching of the server they take
care of all the updates to the
underlying hardware and software that's
another thing I forgot to mention with
the physical servers physical dedicated
servers you are oftentimes responsible
to
maintain the underlined the underlying
software the server software whether it
be or MySQL installation or Apache
installation so on whereas with the VPS
the good ones they take care of I for
you you don't have to worry about that
so you can spend your time being an app
developer or marketing your app rather
than having to deal with managing
servers and being a network
administrator or server administrator
rather that's crucial like I know server
administration I used to run my own
Windows servers in-house actually but
it's just like you have to make a choice
at some point are you going to be a
somebody who runs a server somebody
who's running your business for me I
rather run my business alright I hope
