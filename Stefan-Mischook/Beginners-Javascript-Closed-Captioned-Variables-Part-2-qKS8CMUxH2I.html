JavaScript variables let's start off by
part 2 by reviewing a couple of things
now I wrote this out in my summary here
and I'm just going to read and comment
on a few things and then we'll get back
into coke quickly so we know that
variables are virtual containers to hold
information and you know that we need to
create variables to hold information
because for anything to happen on a
computer really it has to be placed into
memory and you remember memory is RAM
that's why when you buy more memory for
your computer the computer runs faster
because it's able to stick stuff and
memory and more stuff and memory faster
it goes you see in the old days with
more primitive programming languages a
programmer had to manually stick the
information the data into specific spots
in memory this is a long and tedious
process that brings a whole new meaning
to hyper a nooner okay that was badly
different delivered but you have to
understand programming was really a much
more geeky thing in the past when you
didn't have the ability to create
variables on the fly as you can with
JavaScript so we can understand when you
use the VAR keyword in Java Script
basically you're automating the process
variables automate the process for you
you just create a variable and stick
information JavaScript takes care of all
the dirty details and of course the
create a variable in JavaScript you need
to use the keyword var followed by the
name you want to give it so let's jump
back into some code so we've seen this
before so let's look at a few things now
you notice here in my examples let me
just organize this code a little bit
better i created a variables first and
then down here i assign them now this is
like a very old school way well it's not
an old school way this is kind of in
covering way of doing it you could
actually just do this
you can declare variable and when use
the VAR keyword and you give it a name
lets you create a variable near its call
that declaring a variable so when you
declare variable you can do it at the
same time as you give it a value so
let's go our first name and last name of
course so see I've minimize the amount
of code we needed and just to make sure
everything works fine we reload when we
see it out of that alert pop up as we
did here we know our codes working
pretty good another reason why we know
our code is working pretty good let me
just remove that then right bang boom
internet explorer displays or error for
us okay and we get no alert box because
the code screwed up along the way right
so put that back in everything should
work a fine there we go so to get back
to it as you can see you can declare
variable and declaring a variable just
basically means use the far keyword and
add a name for the variable and you can
give it a value on one line you don't
have to do it on two lines as it did
before let's look at variable names now
you notice when I create a variable I
didn't have a space like this I can't
have varam first name because as far as
Java scripts concerned this space makes
it well screws it up lentils we hope
this we got our error again right and
well let's just look at that ever a
little bit more closely see line 14
character 11 air expected semicolon so
let me look at that again you see when
you have a space line 14 it's expecting
a semicolon here because we know space
that tell josh would figures you're
starting something new to be declaring
it of a variable or whatnot so it's
expecting this but in fact it matters
which is take away from this is that you
don't want to space
variable names it has to be either
touching little space or you can use
something like an underscore that works
two variables can have a lowercase and
uppercase this all works but what I
would suggest you keep it all lowercase
you can start there you can serve
variables with text and you can start it
out with no numbers see that's not going
to work javascript doesn't want numbers
for the gang of a variable so we'll just
refresh that again Bing cy14 character 5
x 14 character 12345 see it doesn't like
that no numbers the beginning of
variables probably can do this so you
can put a number in after the first
letter but your first letter of your
variable names have to be text okay it
can't be numbers can't be special simple
I guess it could be a dollar sign it
can't be that symbol can't be the symbol
just to be safe when you create a
variable just make sure it starts with a
letter make sure there's no spaces in
between them and all special weird
characters get out cause problems as
well so yeah if you want to create
spaces between your variable names like
first names what's clear you can put an
underscore in a way to go yes these are
nerdy details I know but I'm trying to
make your life easier another thing you
can do you can also put them on separate
lines you can put them all on one line
if you want to a little harder to read
see what this relaunch this oh we got a
problem first name on the flowers go
okay ah it's because the alert sealer is
looking for first name without our
underscore right and because I put in an
underscore this is now a different
variable name than this so to solve that
error we're having before is go first
name but see makes your last name last
name
okay let's save that load rock and roll
all right so you notice how i was able
to declare the variables all in one line
that's important that I have the
semicolon after each variable creation
or declaration makes no difference now
they don't need to have space they can
have it all squished up because when
javascript sees the semicolon that's
like a period so it knows that we're
starting a new statement when after the
period remember each of these things
geez lines is considered statement so
that's where these semicolons come in
now this is cool having it all in one
line because it's a space but it can get
hard to read so i recommend that i need
to create your variables you put them on
separate lines like this it's much
cleaner easier to read there's a a lot
about variables i'm not going to cover
in this first video because my goal is
to get moving along as quickly as
possible so one last thing that we can
do is we can actually add variables
together you know so we did it down here
in the alert but we can actually do it
up here so we can go number that was
cool yupz we go we'll say the last name
is equal to first name plus number what
happened to their their work
see Nick and Nick six how did that
happen so you go the alert is basically
printing out whatever value we have
stored in these variables we have the
variable first name we added a space so
it's nice and clear and we have the
variable last name so we know the last
name is Miss Chuck and we know the first
name is well we know the last name was
Miss chipped and but when we loaded our
script here it says Nick and Nick 6e
that's the fruit that's the second
variable mix six right second variable
last name so why is we declared the
variable last name to have the value to
hold the value of Miss Chuck but for
some reason it came out Nick six why
because we changed it here we said now
let's take the last name variable and
what's actually put in the values the
first name first name is Nick plus the
whatever value is being held in the
variable number which was six right
that's what we had Nick six well so
let's see if we change this to 22 and
let's refresh that Nick Nick 22 or we
could change it to some text again if
you recall to make a text in JavaScript
we need to put the text in between
quotes like this so let's preview that
Nick and Nick Jimmy fish so we learned
something new now we just learned that
we can actually replace information
about in variables with other
information this type of stuff comes in
really handy when we're getting deeper
into JavaScript there's a lot more about
JavaScript variables that we could get
into but we have enough now more than
enough now to be able to proceed with
our other practical JavaScript lessons
so we'll get back to variables at a
later time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
