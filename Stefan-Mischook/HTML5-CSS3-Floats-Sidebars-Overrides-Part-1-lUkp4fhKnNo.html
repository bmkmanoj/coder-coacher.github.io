PHP and today what I'm going to be doing
is building on the last video where
we've essentially built out the
beginning is of an html5 template and
we've essentially got this left hand
area we've done a pull quote over here
we've got sort of a two column layout
over here we've added a footer you'll
notice there's some gradients there's
absolutely zero images in this design
which is pretty cool and what we're
going to do is we're going to work on
getting the sidebar in place and maybe
do some more polishing and then also
look at a couple of tags that we've
introduced in html5 or that have been
introduced in html5 most specifically
the time tag so let's get to it right
now this is what our page looks like
it's pretty small it's less than 100
lines we've got basically and we've got
to article sections I'm just going to
collapse them here and they are
currently sitting inside of a section
inside of another section so with html5
you want to use as much as possible the
semantic markup that's made available
for you so in this case I'm trying to
limit instead of turning section into
another div I want to limit the amount
of use of extraneous tags but because in
this design i've got to have something
that wraps our design i have to have
some kind of section i suppose i could
also use div as well i mean div is just
as much a generic term as section so
this is the kind of decision that you of
course could be making as a designer
when you're building your html5 site so
now what I want to do is I want to build
out the right hand navigation now in my
aside tag I'm going to create an
unordered list with essentially a series
of boxes so I'm going to have a list
item
and inside that list item I want to have
a I guess in this case I'm going to use
div just to shake things up a bit and if
type this will be a summary and I'm
going to make it in this an elevator
pitch an elevator pitch is when you're
on an elevator if you wanted to convey
your idea in the time it takes to go
from one floor to another that would be
an elevator pitch and then just a
paragraph here now I am going to grab
some lorem ipsum text for my elevator
pitch maybe a little more than that
doesn't really matter what the text is
for our example that looks pretty good
and let's see what it looks like so far
so we've got this elevator pitch doesn't
look particularly interesting right now
and it's inside of this box this gray
box now I also want to have a navigation
here and this is where we're going to
start looking at some advanced CSS
selectors because i'm going to use
because this is going to be navigation
even though let's say this is sub
navigation i'm still going to use the
nav tag because after all it is I it is
navigation right so I'm going to create
the section and it'll be sub navigation
and it'll be lets say
let's say category let's say food this
is going to be just a regular blog so
personal politics entertainment and I
don't know let's say games this is the
sub navigation of this particular
homepage now if you look at this all of
a sudden my sub navigation is looking
very strange it seems to have adopted
some of the navigational traits or some
of the design traits of my top
navigation but obviously I want this to
be designed differently in this context
now before you decide that you want to
change the markup simply because you've
already styled something else this is
where CSS overrides really come in handy
and where they can help you build
something that you know over here it
looks pretty semantically nice it looks
semantically correct there's no reason
why we should have to change our markup
in order for it to look the way that we
want it to look so in my style dot CSS
file here I'm going to just use a little
comment here and say this is the sidebar
and we're going to have a side nav and
then a side nav is going to look a
little different so aside now first of
all we need to get rid of that
background so it's going to have a
background of none there we go border
none
okay already we're better off now I also
want to fix up the layout of these boxes
so just in general I've got an unordered
list in my aside nav or in my side
section and it's going to have a margin
left of I don't know let's say 10 pixels
it's already there's a bit of space
that's better and there's a list item
for each list item I'm going to have
maybe no top margin but I want a left
and right margin of 5 pixels make sure
there's no padding maybe we'll add a
position relative because we are we're
dealing with some floating issues here
so there's some floating so do that also
we want to make sure that the list style
for the unordered list is none this will
get rid of those little bullets that's a
little better already we I don't think
we need a background here all right and
we're going to have to make sure that
these list items have a fixed width of
something so in order to make that
happen i can say with auto nope that's
not going to work well it's going to
work for this guy but it's not going to
work for our navigation because our
navigation has to be overridden so the
nav is going to be a little trickier but
let's get this working first so I'm
going to add in my aside on or unordered
list i want to add some more design
choices here i'm going to add a border
first of all one pixels one pixel let's
make it a like a like a gray so now
we've got this great order and you'll
notice that we've got a sub nav and now
these guys have a border as well i'm
going to show you how you can take care
of that in just a second a lot of border
radius
whoops Moe's border radius of say 12
pixels now we're getting a rounded
border these guys look kind of cool but
they're not fitting the bill and I also
want to set a background of white</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
