create some very simple point type and
if you remember it allows us to create
type on separate lines of information
that's gonna be great for us in due time
however as you will see there are
different things that we'll need to do
with this type in order to make it look
the way we want it to look now talking
about type and the way it looks and how
it works it's one thing for me to show
you how the type tool works but you
should always keep in mind that's like
me showing you how to swing an axe it's
not necessarily gonna make you a
lumberjack or a fireman right you're
gonna have to go through some training
to be able to work with type very
effectively and that's why I'm going to
refer you to a series of articles
available at killer sites comm on
typography that I've offered authored
myself so look at those type articles
and the different ways that you can work
with type to get some good insight into
how to work successfully with your
typography however let's look at the
type tool a little bit closer if I
wanted to I could also affect a number
of things about this type and that would
be to work with it with regards to
whether it's a point type or whether we
set up a paragraph of text so for
example as we saw before if I just take
the type tool click and let go and then
start typing something actually let me
just write something here
so typing something notice to escape
that particular confines command return
if you remember now here's the
difference when we were typing with the
point type and just you know all the way
along there was no wrapping nothing was
really happening however what if we
wanted to create a paragraph of type
well one of the ways we can do that is
to use the type tool and then click and
drag out an area and now as you can see
there is this box around the area and
our blinking cursor is right over here
now I'm not going to type out a bunch of
garbage texts or anything like that for
you
so I'm just going to ask you to open up
a browser I'm just going to open up
Safari here and you can grab some Latin
text I'm going to go to Li P
s um just do a google search on Lipson
and it'll take you to a place called lip
simcom which stands for the lorem ipsum
text and lorem ipsum is something that
graphic designers have been using as
placeholder text for many men number of
years so for example if I were to take
this first paragraph of Latin text and
then all command tab or alt tab on a PC
go back to photoshop inside this text
area I can now paste in my text and the
shortcut for that under the Edit command
again is command V so I've pasted in my
text so let's look a little bit closer
at this in comparison to what we did
over here well unlike the point type
this has now created a number of
different options we see that the text
is not only wrapping it's also got
hyphenation
inside of that text as well and there's
a lot of other possibilities that we can
work with also notice this you'll see
that there is a little square at each of
these corners and the one at the very
bottom has a little cross inside of it
but that's visually indicating to you is
that there is actually more text inside
of this box that we can't see there's an
overlap
sorts so if I were to come over here and
select right on this point you'll notice
that when you move this text box what it
actually ends up doing is allowing you
to increase the size of the box itself
it does not increase the size of the
text as you can see and what it does is
it just allows for all the text that's
inside to wrap itself around now notice
this I would need to really stretch this
out to get all of that type to be
visible and the reason being is because
the type inside this box is set to 25
points which is actually quite large for
a paragraph of text so if I wanted to
select all of this text well let's see
if I were to just select this excuse me
let's try that again if I were to select
just what I see and say hey you know I
really want this text to be at 12 points
well look what happens everything after
that selected area is still large so the
way to select everything inside of this
box whether its visible or whether it's
being hidden is to come to the selection
and say select all control a or command
a on a Mac and as you can see now it's
all selected and if I put it all at 12
points great now you can see that
everything is inside of this area and
you'll notice that that little square
here is just an empty white square it
doesn't have the cross in there anymore
and we can still work with this by
making this a smaller paragraph of
information you can make it larger
whatever you really need to do notice
that the hyphenation is still in place
but I'm going to show you how we can
remove that hyphenation if that is in
fact something you wanted to do or any
other number of things so let's take a
look we've got this layer here layer 1
see as soon as I select out of it it
starts with the name lorem ipsum and
there it is lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
so at this point we could select you
know one of these like the typing and I
can make that larger
by working with the sizing as I did
there and Here I am typing something and
there's a small paragraph of information
right here so working with the type tool
clicking inside there is how you can
access the information that you want to
have and if you want to make it smaller
or if you want to make it larger
something that you can do quite simply
by working with your type in this
fashion
so come back and I'm going to show you
how we can really start augmenting this
type so that it starts looking a whole
lot better than it does right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
