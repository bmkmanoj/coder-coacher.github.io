and a whole bunch of the sites so if
you've been following my blog for a
while when the swift programming
language was first announced by Apple I
got into it I started learning it and
actually produce some videos and then I
realized that due to the NDA de
non-disclosure agreement it was illegal
for me to actually to actually release
any of the videos with showing the Xcode
beta software so perhaps I was being a
little bit over zealous in that regard
so I decided to just hold back
everything with regards to Swift
tutorials and Swift training and so on
now have a drop Swift I just have to I
put it aside because I had so many other
things had to contend with anyway that
being said i will be getting to it at
some point over the next few months i'm
not sure when i'm recording this in
october mid-october 2014 so what i will
be doing now is releasing the first two
introductions to Swift the two Swift
video blogs where I just got to kind of
just give you a quick overview of Xcode
they'll be coming up on the YouTube
channel I haven't looked over what I
originally did because I know that
between the beta and the in the final
release there was some changes to the
language itself I'm not sure if I
covered anything that was antiquated I
apologize if I did nonetheless I think
those videos if you're interested in
looking at the basics of the language
and seeing how the whole Xcode and the
playground app works within the Swift
environment while the Xcode environment
with regards to Swift and may be
interesting for you and that's pretty
much it and with that I figure I put it
out alright that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
