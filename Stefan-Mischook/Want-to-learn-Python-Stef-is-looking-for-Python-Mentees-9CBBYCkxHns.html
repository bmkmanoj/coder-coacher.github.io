on Python mentees if you will people who
are new to Python and we want to learn
the Python programming language this is
something new for me to do in this
particular way so what's going on is I'm
building my course now I'm actively
building it and I want to work with a
handful of Python noobs and we will be
working together as I train you
in Python and I'll be good I'm going to
be implementing an Asian style of
teaching that I learned in my martial
art days and I want to apply this to
building the course so what the exchange
is is basically you will be learning
Python from me for free and in exchange
you're going to be helping me to make
the final course product hopefully
better than it would be otherwise so I'm
looking for a handful of people I'm not
sure how many can handle 5 to 10 max so
if you're interested message me through
the YouTube messaging or you can email
me and well I'm not gonna put my email
here but so you message me and in the
message put your email address and then
I'll email you directly with the details
again this is something that won't cost
you anything this is free it's only for
a few people so if you're interested you
know send me a message and and basically
you're going to be learning Python with
me with direct contact with me one of
the things you'll be doing but as you
learn Python is giving me feedback in
terms of the lessons and the structure
of the lessons of so forth if any of you
have done my other studio web-based
courses you know that studio web-based
courses are far more robust far more
involved than your typical video course
there's much more to them than just a
video course and so as a result it's a
lot more work to put them together and
I'm thinking you know
with every iteration of what you do in
life you want to always try to improve
interns what you did last week if you
will so with this Python course I want
to try to take what's really good from
my previous courses and add this extra
layer if you will add an extra level to
make it that much better and part of
that process will be to be working with
a handful of mentees who are going to
give me that feedback as I progress and
build a course material material out so
that's it if you're interested message
me and I'll give you the details and we
can take it from there thanks for
watching bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
