we're gonna talk about graphic designers
and what my suggestion is in terms of
the best approach of jumping into the
whole app development space the web
design space the web app space so I'll
just get to the point if you are a
graphic designer and you're starting to
look at that area and you're looking at
what's the best way to jump in well let
me point out a few things building just
basic branding websites from scratch is
a more difficult business than it was 10
years ago I'm not trying to say don't
get into it but you have to be really
talented as a designer to be able to
make headway there because of the the
fact that the market is now saturated
with templates so a lot of small
businesses or will just lean to
templates so higher web designers to
configure and stuff there's also the
issue of you know they click click click
the point-and-click website building
apps that are out there and then they
pay 9 bucks a month that's an issue
might have to contend with as well so
getting into pure web design for the
aesthetic design branding sites is a
more difficult proposition so what are
your options your options or either to
get into specialization specializations
like WordPress design which is requires
you have to learn web press all these
things by the way you're not going to
get away with just using Dreamweaver
anymore you have to learn your html5 you
have to learn some CSS your CSS and you
have to learn sort of basic frameworks
like bootstrap and perhaps a little bit
of jQuery as well and this is for web
designers we just want to sort of do
branding sites you need these basic
skills it isn't what it was just 810
years ago that said if you are reluctant
to get into code there is an angle for
you that could be very lucrative and
that is UX development now you actually
show four user experiences spoke about
this in a previous vlog and with UX you
are basically working on making the site
or the web app or the app
more usable more user-friendly and
there's all kinds of issues you have to
look at it's as much a science as it as
it is an art and a feel and there's a
big demand for that because especially
medium and larger organizations
recognize how important good UX is these
days and in fact I believe I've talked
about this in previous vlogs that UX is
more important than anything else when
it comes to the success or a failure of
the app you have to have amazing UX UX
is basically how usable it is how
user-friendly it is let me give you a
couple of examples as I mentioned in
previous video
you've got reddit Craigslist's you have
Google these are all wildly successful
sites and they aren't exactly the most
beautiful but what they are is super
easy to use and of course you have to
have a great content you can I'm not
gonna take away content is still King
but you access Queen perhaps and so that
might be an easier transition for
graphic designer types to jump into UX
since it's much less has really not much
dual coding as everything to do with us
which is its own specialization but you
can look into so there you go graphic
designer you want to get into the whole
web space or maybe the app space think
about UX that is something that might be
much more approachable to you and they
blends itself well with graphic design
well user interface design so in the
nerd world we call that UI user
interface design that's the aesthetics
to make it look good and then you got UX
and that's the usable functionality or
how functionally usable your web app or
your website is or your app is so check
it out UX alright so I'm going to bring
this back vinyl albums suggestion of
this vlog so here it is a classic album
it's called Asia
Asia Asia depending how you want to
pronounce it
anyway it's a very famous album by
Steely Dan there's only one hit song on
here called Paik so if you go to youtube
you type in Steely Dan peg
you'll hear the song and you're probably
gonna go yeah I've heard the song before
now these guys are very jazzy and so the
rest of the album is it's very good it's
one of the classic albums but you have
to be into jazz so this is an album I
would imagine Amy Winehouse probably
liked a lot knowing her taste so here's
the vinyl anyhow so the advantage of
vinyl is that if you have good speakers
it sounds much better than CD and it
sounds much better than mp3 I've seen
some articles online where they did they
did some tests and they said no no no no
they don't vinyl or 24-bit music does
not sound better than mp3 or CD CD 16
bit 24-bit is high-res or HD music it's
24-bit more bits more sound information
better sounding now back to the article
and articles I seen where they said wow
you know you don't really hear it's
psychological the reason they didn't
hear a difference in those articles
because they were using lousy or just
running a male speakers or headphones to
be able to hear the quality that you can
get in vinyl or 24-bit music you need
speakers that can reproduce our review
of that quality if you were to film
something in 4k and play it on a TV that
only plays 720p you're not going to see
the 4k right because your TV Justin just
doesn't have the capacity to display the
4k properly so if you have 4k video you
need a 4k TV to see it and it's much
nicer than standard HD which is only
1080p for x so 4k yes is much better
quality but you only see it with a 4k TV
and vinyl
or 24-bit music does sound better than
16-bit or essentially mp3 but you need
the speakers be able to hear it so there
you go just to let you know I will be
probably slowing down on my vlogging a
little bit over the next few weeks or so
because of work I'm just very busy with
work working on a pretty big project now
and so I'm still gonna do vlogs but I
might have to cut them down to once
every two days or so we'll see how it
goes you never know but that's about it
we'll talk some about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
