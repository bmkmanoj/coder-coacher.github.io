series on creating a tag cloud with PHP
and MySQL I in the last video we created
our index dot PHP we set up the
structure and we worked on our open and
closed database files so to get started
today let's open up the view and let's
add some basic HTML in place so I have a
little shortcut that does this but just
pause the video if you need to so I have
tagcloud
as the title and within the body it
stays pretty simple we have an h1 tag
which I put tag cloud again we have two
h2s
one that says the list and another one
that says cloud and then just below each
of those h2s we have a PHP statement
which echoes out a variable that we'll
be creating in a minute or two called
data the one under cloud is data tag
cloud like so
I'm just gonna copy and paste this above
and instead of tagcloud we're gonna use
tag list that's the basic HTML one other
thing that I want to do is add in some
basic CSS styling and you'll see the
results of the styling in a couple
minutes but this is just some basic
stuff to style our content in a
semi-attractive way so we have table and
I'm gonna give it a width of 340 pixels
and the border-collapse:collapse and
then we're also gonna do some styling of
a tag cloud and we're gonna use a tag
cloud class for that I'm gonna give it a
margin 0 padding of 20 pixels all around
a width of 300 pixels and a border 1
pixel solid black and finally a little
bit of text styling we're gonna give it
text align of Center and a fixed line
height of 2.8 m/s
now within this tagcloud class we have a
couple other things that we want to
style we want to style any list items
within it do you display inline like so
and we're gonna give it a margin right
of 10 pixels any links within this we're
gonna make sure the padding it see the
padding is reset to zero and finally
we're gonna do a little bit of styling
to enable different sizing of links in
this tag cloud so we're gonna have a
couple different CSS classes and they
were all gonna have a different font
size in case the first one will be 0.7 m
the font weight of 100 and we're gonna
have ten of these tags from tag one to
tag ten and let me quickly rename this
ten
and each of these different classes will
have a slightly different font size and
font weight so 0.7 m point eight point
nine one M 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.2 and
finally two point five and then a couple
other changes two hundred three hundred
four five six seven eight the last two
eight nine hundred so this will give us
different font sizes different font
weights for the tags within our tag
cloud without have you finished let's go
back to tag cloud model yeah
and let's get to work on this so I'm
gonna start off just with the standard
PHP tags and for this model I'm going to
be using a little bit of object-oriented
PHP and I've chosen this particular
method because it allows me an easy way
to encapsulate my code makes my code
clean it makes it much easier to reuse
in the future so for the model I'm gonna
actually have I'm gonna create an object
for this it's gonna be class tag cloud
model
like so and gonna have a couple
variables in this model that we want all
of these model functions to be able to
access so I'm gonna have a VAR MySQL I
so I'm gonna have of our tags which is
going to be an array of arrays so I'll
explain a little bit but it's gonna
contain multiple arrays with an ID a
name and a total and excuse me this
should be in comment like so I just
leave a comment so it makes it easy for
me to remember what this will contain
and finally we have a bar that we're
gonna call largest and it's going to
contain the number of times that the
most popular tag has been used so okay
we have the start of our object we have
a class let's include the initializing
function and it's construct with two
underscores underneath it and I'm gonna
pass in a con variable which is gonna
stand for a connection and I'm gonna set
the MySQL I variable that we just
created here and I said that and I
access it using this and the arrow
operator to indicate it's within this
object and gonna set that equal to the
connection variable that we passed in
okay so that's what we have so far now
every time we load this model and we
create an object called you know with a
tag cloud model we're going to assume
that we want to use tags in some way so
I'm going to create a get tags function
that we're going to be able to use in
multiple functions within this object so
what I'm going to start by is when this
object is constructed
we're going to get the tags and the
largest value largest value being we're
gonna set this largest variable here so
this and we're gonna call it get tags
function like so okay and then of the
following functions we're gonna have two
different types so I'm gonna split them
up with a comment just so it's easy for
me to read this and include utility
functions and I just break it up like
this it's just what I do to make it a
little bit visually easier for me to
read my code so I'm gonna have utility
functions and then I'm gonna have what I
call display functions maybe you'll call
it something slightly different but
utility functions our functions such as
get tags which we're going to use
multiple times in other functions within
this object so I'm going to do function
get tags so and then I'm also going to
create two functions here within display
functions one we're gonna call
function get tagged list and the other
one we're going to call get tagged cloud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
