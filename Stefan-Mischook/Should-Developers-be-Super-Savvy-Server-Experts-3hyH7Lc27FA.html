need to become server administrators
this is an interesting question because
we've seen a move in the last several
years where DevOps has become more
complex than it used to be and having
good DevOps is very important don't get
me wrong don't get me wrong but it's
gotten to the point where you're seeing
web developers having to really get a
pretty good understanding of how servers
operate so they're gonna have to learn
their Linux commands they're gonna learn
how to patch things etcetera etc etc
even per server provisioning comes into
play now I'm an old school nerd and I
used to do that back in the day in fact
when I started writing web apps for
clients and for myself I actually had
servers in my own place I had literal
servers and I would stick them in
closets and I had in at the time one our
very first one of the very first ISDN
lines
it was it no a DSLR excuse me and I had
32 static eyepiece this is crazy if you
know anything about static IPS are very
rare pulse these days have a limited a
finite number of IPs they don't want to
assign them to people you have to pay
money for each of them so back in the
day when those whole web thing was just
starting out I guess this is in 95 knows
about 96
I got an ADSL line had one of the first
in Canada I had 32 static IPS because
the web was transitioning from HTTP 100
where you needed one IP per site and
then with one point one allowed you to
hold some multiple IPS excuse me
multiple web sites on one IP anyway I'm
going to nerd details
point being is that back in the day yes
I not only manage my own servers I set
them up I configured them I had them in
my place I had the battery backups I was
patching them I was keeping them up to
date and then after a couple years of
doing
I got rid of that and I got a
co-location co-host location basically I
rented a server from a company and they
took care of all that they took care of
the patching and the updates and so on
and so forth it was very good decision
to do that so that I could concentrate
on what I was doing and that was
developing web apps and websites for
clients well mostly webmasters at that
point so fast forward to today and what
we see is that for modern-day web
developers they have to get pretty good
skill sets in terms of server
administration and so forth so now I
have two types of dedicated servers I
have a VPS with digitalocean and it's
pretty much hands-off you have to know
your server administration you have to
patch and update your own servers you
have to if you better be installing and
configuring apps in fact we use a
third-party provisioner to make that
easier so it's almost like a step
backwards when you use that kind of
service I have a cloud service where you
have to become pretty knowledgeable
about server administration and as a
developer I have problems with that I
had tremendous problems with that
because all a sudden the range of skills
are expanded and we have to worry about
things that the industry had fixed for
us with private server hosting solutions
or turnkey solutions if you will now
what I did is I found another company
and they provide but the best of both
worlds they provide hosting with a
dedicated server
well VPS virtual private server cloud
hosting but they also provide the
turnkey management for you including a
control panel so some of you may be
going Waka my staff you got to learn
your linux commands you should do this
and maybe if you want to but I think
it's a waste of time that a developer
should have to worry about all the
patches
the backups and a rule and rollbacks and
all this kind of stuff but really a
system in a system administrator should
be handling so I have both now I have
the dum dum solution the solution where
you have to do everything yourself and
house out the turnkey solution where
they handle everything for you and I
have both going right now managing the
websites and the web apps that I manage
and I have to tell you the VPS the
turnkey solution though I don't have the
control or the power that the total
control and the power and flexibility
have with the the the dub-dub solution
if you want a solution where we have to
do everything ourselves internally I
have total freedom with the VPS in the
sense that I don't have to worry about
patches I don't have to worry about
updates
I don't war house I don't have to worry
about outages and row backs they take
care of the whole thing for me they
provide a nice control panel that makes
it easy so we don't have to necessarily
go in there with SSH and this is kind of
a cool setup because it's an extra level
of protection just in case someone some
junior dev working for me messes
something up they can't it's not easy to
do in fact it's very difficult to do
because they put all these barriers in
place so there are certain operations
that you can do stuff at you might want
to do day to day you can do for the
control panel but the stuff that could
really have serious impact on the server
they manage that so you have to put in a
request and they're glad you get the
request done in the same day and they
will tell you I might be a problem you
know this is cool blah blah blah blah
blah because all they do is manage
servers all day all day they're experts
at server administration they're on top
of it they know the latest news they
know what patches have to be applied
whereas with the dum-dum server solution
where I have total control ulsan I have
to understand that or somebody under me
have to understand that and if you are a
company but doesn't have 50 employees or
100 employees and you just want to
concentrate on what you do which is
develop a web app or develop websites
you don't want to necessarily have to
devote resources to guys have to worry
about that in the back your mind so for
me even though there is this big
moves as you with DevOps that web
developers should really know their Unix
commands well so forth I think it's gone
a little bit too far in my opinion I
think that I would rather be working
with a company that provides those
services for me so I can concentrate on
what I do and that is delivering a great
web app for my clients and they can take
care of the all the server stuff what
are the smart moves but business people
the smartest business people make is
that they surround themselves with
support and people that could take care
of jobs may not may not be best at yes I
used to manage servers but my server and
min skills are not great as these days
that's for sure and they don't need to
be why because I got a company who
charges pretty much the same as the
dum-dum server they take care of that
for me I don't have to worry about it I
shouldn't have to worry about it so I
can concentrate in the core of my
business when you get into development
when you get into business you don't
want to be spreading yourself too thin
trying to learn every single thing out
there you learn your core you
concentrated on what you're good at
so I'm gonna answer another question
that came up in one of the the YouTube
comments oh he said
I'm comfortable with the back handle of
it that my design skills suck I feel a
little secure about that he said what
should I do
well you shouldn't worry about it
because what you do is you either
subcontract a great designer and you
implement their designs in your back
with your back-end work or you use a
nice-looking template whatever suggest
you learn as a developer at least learn
the basics of design and that means
learning about white space font use
alignment layout just the basics
it's almost mechanical it's almost
mechanical it's almost logical one is
logical and if you understand that at
least you can lay out something that
looks pleasing to the eye if you follow
the basic rules of you know color
matching you don't want to mix cold
colors with hot colors typically
alignment so things are aligned
consistent use of fonts you don't wanna
have 10,000 fonts on the same page - max
- font faces I'm talking
stuff like that now if you get those
basic design principles then you can put
up something a skeleton get your site
going good and then you can implement a
nice template or just hire top and
desire to come in and do stuff so I was
in my career I did both I did everything
because I came from a design background
actually I got a certification
certification and photolithography is a
big part of that was a graphic design
layout so I could do that at a
reasonable reasonable level if you look
at the studio web course backdrops with
the animals and the maps and this is all
me I did that and I spent a long time
sort of sitting through that and I have
again I'm training in design that being
said I would still use better designers
in me to actually do the hardcore layout
work and the tweaking and so forth so I
would be like the art director I would
choose the color schemes the basic
layout structure the UI the UX
especially I spend a lot of time on you
actually I think is so important
in modern day app develop more there be
web apps or mobile apps and whatnot but
that I would hand that off to a
dedicated designer who was really good
at what they do and the same thing with
the backend I written lots of software
back in but now because I'm busy I hand
that off to people and I try to find
people who are superior in certain areas
than me I'm good with architecture high
level
I'm good with laying out the codebase so
it's clean simple it's modular it's
updatable terms of getting into highly
detailed optimizations and algorithms
besides basic database normalization and
and you know top-level things I was
never keen on that I've done it but it's
been such a long time since I've done
that kind of stuff I use people who do
it on a daily basis it's it's like
anything else if you're a fighter you
know after three four months of no
training you know that your timing goes
down so since I haven't sparred in many
years now my timing is not what it used
to be I could get back in the ring after
a month or two it would come back but
you don't have the same time anybody
who's experienced in real fighting arts
will tell you that same thing with
programming by the way if I will point
in your career maybe six seven years
into it you decide you might want to go
on to management or architecture you're
gonna have to make that decision I did
that is I don't forget what year seventh
year into I said okay I had to decide am
I gonna be a coder rest of my life or am
I gonna get into architecture and
management so forth I went the latter
route and I recognized now like a
fighter hasn't rained in few months even
though you can be a great fighter like
Mike Tyson for example he went when he
would come back to training camp to get
ready for fight even when at his prime
it took him like a month or two before
he was up to his level like he would
sink really hard he gained a lot of
weight and he would get back in the ring
and tomato cans guys who weren't very
good they're able to give a really hard
time until he got back up to his normal
level in a couple months and then he was
you know beating the crap on her
everybody see if he would coding so if
you step away for months or a couple
years your ability to write highly
optimized algorithms and so forth will
be you know it will be rusty like
anything else and you get back into it
anyway so I went off in a tangent as I
do sometimes if you are cold centric
backhand side trip you're a little
worried about your front-end skills in
terms of the look and feel don't worry I
gave you the route I gave you the game
plan to handle that and the reverse is
true as well
right you could if you're good at
front-end and you're good at make it
look good and you're good at UX user
experience you derive you can
concentrate on that and then hard people
to work on the backend stuff or partner
with people to work on the backend and
of things as well so and don't consider
about a weakness that's normal
one of the things I stress to people and
I used to stress in fighting I said
don't try to be a jack-of-all-trades
because you will be master of none what
you want to do is you want to figure out
where you're strong and then work on
that improve
on that and then bring in surround
yourself with people who will complement
your skill sets where they will be
better at you on the design and if they
or maybe they're better at you in the
backend and endo thing etc etc etc you
do what you do best partner with other
people and that's the way to go so it's
a super sunny day today it's gonna be
eight degrees I'm already sweating I got
my my Snoopy shirt on and because I'm
able to I'm going to take the rest of
the day off I'm playing hooky so I
decided to record this video before I
head out and that's about it
that's one of the advantages of working
hard now developing your based about
being here a few stats stash developing
a nice base of clients etc etc it allows
you freedom and flexibility that's
always been my number one goal is
freedom and flexibility in my lifestyle
and development freelancing starting a
business owning a business this allows
you to do all this all right I gotta go
