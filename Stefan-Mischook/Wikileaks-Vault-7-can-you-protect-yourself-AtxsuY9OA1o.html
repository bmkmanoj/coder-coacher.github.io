let's talk about the news of the day
just came out that WikiLeaks revealed
that the CIA is basically bugging every
single device ever created okay maybe
not every device ever created but your
cell phones I'm iOS devices Android
devices windows devices I'm sure Mac OS
TV sets modern TVs they can turn on your
microphone listen in on what you're
doing everything everything so I think
nerds and in the know I think there's
into no new that you have to assume that
every communication you are having on
digital devices is being monitored now
if you have a smart TV with modern
technology it's being used potentially
to monitor you it's very disturbing
according to the WikiLeaks dumped and i
just gave skimmed over some summaries
the CIA and produced probably other
intelligence agencies i produce a whole
bunch of bots and malware to basically
be able to monitor everybody and they
lost control of this stuff it's all over
the place and so people are using it so
again you have to assume that you're you
are being monitored at every given
moment so for me for instance i don't
want people to know that I listened to
disco on occasion so I listened to it on
vinyl right it's very protected now
nobody will know if I'm listening to
disco or if I'm listening to classic 80s
as well I don't want people to know that
so I don't listen to that digitally I
listen to it on vinyl protects me keeps
me anonymous that way it's very
important so as a matter of protocol if
I were you if you want your privacy well
actually it's pretty much impossible
if you're going to do anything but you
want you don't want people to hear
you're gonna have to do analog right
you're going to have to do with analog
you know so speak to people not over the
following in person in addition to that
you have to assume that you're being
monitored so you should just always
operate on that premise you should
always operate that people that'll be
watching what you say and read and so
forth this is how I operate and I just
assume all the information is out there
so in terms of security what I've done
in studio web for instance where student
identities in grades and marks and all
this kind of stuff this is all the
things to do what generates
automatically these are protected
through just basics of database
structure so what we do to protect the
identity of students is that we don't
actually hold any personal information
about the students in our databases so
even if our databases were ever hacked
they will not find any relevant
information because we do not keep
school information we do not keep
students personal information in our
databases yes they may at the right
moment find a student name but they
won't know from where in the world Steph
Johnson lives as an example so in your
data structures you should also assume
that everything is hackable so for
instance I never in my entire career
going back to the 90s I never stored
credit card information I never wanted
that responsibility and so we've been
hacked remember an old system of ours
was hack years back it was very old
system and they hacked but they didn't
get any real information because we
don't store any good information on our
case basis so if you're designing apps
iowa suggests strongly that you try to
design in such a way so that they're
functional without having to store
personal information sensitive
information so i remember a few years
ago when all these
stars and actresses and so forth got
their iCloud account hacked and other
naughty pictures were circulated on the
web again you always have to assume that
everything that you do online can and
will be hacked that's just the way it is
in closing with this vlogs what I
mentioned the Python course sorry so
slow work is pulling me in all these
different directions and as you may or
may not know reason for my course
building these days it's primarily for
institutions schools and whatnot and
there are cycles to that so I'm not
rationing out the courses and the
courses I do so in general public it's
it's a sideline of the sideline so it's
important because they're a great
feedback and so forth I'm happy to teach
everybody but and not pressure to get
them out quick because because you know
i don't need the python course for tsuji
webs institutional clients were that's
the by far as bulk of the business until
like spring fall summer fall summer fall
excuse me so sorry that it's been a
little slowly trickle out and i got sick
not slow things down as well but they
are coming i took care of a bunch of
work and i'm going to resume recording
some new material and python as well and
that's pretty much it so have yourself a
great day and we shall talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
