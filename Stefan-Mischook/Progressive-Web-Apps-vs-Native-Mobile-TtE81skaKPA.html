trying with another camera actually try
of a DSLR so that I can look at my phone
I used to shoot these on my phone but
then I couldn't look at my phone so the
car vlogs are going to discuss bunch of
subjects that are related to questions
put to me so let me put that in a
clearer way I'm gonna answer questions
that are put to me always within the
context of web design with programming
coding in general and business and
careers because I think that 95% of us
are into coding and programming because
we even want to get a great job it's
highly paid you want to even become a
freelancer or you want to maybe set up
your own business that's the vast
majority there are also people who are
hobbyist and they're also people who are
in business have businesses and realize
that learning how to code is such an
important tool set to to have not
necessarily because as a business owner
it's not necessarily your gonna be a
full-time coder you can be writing your
own code but as business owners who know
how to code know they know that knowing
how to code is gonna make them better
business owners because they'll have a
much better understanding of technology
coding programming web application
development they'll understand all this
stuff which will make them better
managers better decision makers when
dealing with developers you may hire to
do your jobs all right so I'm gonna
answer a question that was put to me hi
Steph I started my journey with coding
and your web dev course HTML CSS J's PHP
I have also been trying to immerse
myself into web dev coding topics mostly
through listening to vlogs yours and
others or lectures on youtubes I'm soon
to be 40 and a mother too and I feel I
need to be more selective on what I put
my time into so whatever I learn I can
put into practice as soon as possible
and invest my time into learning things
that can bring mostly long-term
results recently I've listened to your
vlog on why html5 based mobile apps is
better than native and how should we
approach and how should we approach it
from a freelancer perspective yesterday
I was listening to a YouTube video
sponsored by Google Chrome developers on
progressive web apps pw8 a why they are
a better investment than a mobile app
especially native apps what is your view
on the topic and what do you think about
PWA in relation to html5 based mobile
apps if future belongs to PWA how a
freelancer should approach it what you
should know tool skills to build an
effective PWA okay sometimes my english
is bad when i read these emails because
i'm not reading it properly and
sometimes the emails written to me and
that's cool i make mistakes when i might
write my email so don't worry about that
good question so if you look back at my
vlogs i've been talking about this for
years in fact in articles I felt that
native app development was going to
shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink
and shrink and the reasons I think
native app will be discussed native app
development is building mobile apps in
the native languages so for iOS that
would be Swift and to a lesser extent
these days objective-c and for Android
that would be of course Java and now
people are looking at Kotlin call men is
programming language a new new language
fellows put together by a company called
JetBrains accepted by Google so now you
can develop native apps with Kaufmann in
well you can build native apps for
Android and cotton now why would you
want to do that over Java because cotton
is like an lighter nimbler language you
get a lot more stuff done quickly when
you're looking at programming languages
in general there's there's a move in
last many years now towards lighter
nimbler languages that allow you to
write code much more quickly to get a
lot more done the trade-off usually a
speed usually with later nimbler
languages like python
they run much slower than if you wrote
the same type of app in Java
now the trade-off though it takes much
longer to write it in Java versus Python
all right let's get back to native
versus non native apps so law native
apps are apps written in the web stack
so yeah so why is that advantageous
because native app development iOS Java
Kotlin object to C etc the problem of
writing in apps natively is that then
you would have to write them again for
the other platform so let's say you
wrote your app first one for iOS for
Apple iPhones etc then you would have to
write them all over again from scratch
for Android and vice versa so that means
you have to maintain two code bases
which is a you're gonna have to have
people who are experts in iOS experts in
Android which is a lot more work a lot
more cost and what are the big things
and I've talked about this for a long
time but one of the things I don't know
if I mention it before I hope I did but
if I didn't here it is a lot of people
don't want to install apps they don't
want to install your app so I put out a
killer sites or a studio web app a lot
of people are not going to want to
install that app and guess what for most
mobile applications you don't need to
write a native app the only advantage
writing to a native app is that it's
going to be a bit more performant in
that the code is gonna run more
efficiently some things are gonna run
faster but smartphones are so fast these
days and the non native apps which are
going to get into a second or so per
format these days there's only rare
exceptions where you're going to need
the performance of a native app and
let's get into freelancing just for a
second since people here or here about
the business end of coding guess what
the number of native app jobs is
I can tell you from friends of mine who
work for very large organizations and
they tell me that they have dropped
native app development and this is like
a billion our business they've dropped
native app development for the reasons I
just cited and they found that just
developing web-based apps using PhoneGap
as an example using react native as
another example are using progressive
web apps as this person is questioning
me about using progressive web apps
another option now let's talk about that
a little bit more so in terms of the
productivity and we're talking about the
nerd aspects of looking at software
development of development you're much
more productive writing it with web
technologies whether it be phone yeah
PhoneGap react native or progressive web
apps because you just have to write it
once and then it works on both platforms
right in terms of job opportunities
again always comes back to me for job
opportunities if you learn the web stack
that's why I teach the web stack you can
do the progressive web apps you can jump
into PhoneGap which means you can do
jump into react what this all means
react native rather what this all means
is that with this one skillset but I
teach you don't have to learn for me for
wherever wherever you learn the web
stack it opens up the possibility of
being able to develop mobile apps for
any platform you have this you have the
foundation to be able to do that on the
other hand with the web stack you also
be able to develop websites and
traditional desktop web apps so this
technology this google technology the
progressive web app takes a typical
responsive website which is just a
website what reforms itself to look good
on any device so if I look at I'll just
go to
stewey web.com sister d web.com you see
it it reforms itself so looks very good
looks really good on mobile right now if
I flip it teeth it shifts it resizes
itself looks really good videos Ryan
everything runs you know and this is
just your standard responsive website
now P progressive web apps they take it
to an extra level so what they do is
using javascript they allow you to
preload assets into the devices that's
pre loading images maybe pre loading
videos etc and other things won't get it
it's not a vlog about PW a progressive
web apps but it just takes it to an an
extra level so when you learn the web
stack you're opening yourself up to a
much broader set of business and
employment opportunities right you could
get into the web you can get into Web
Apps you can get into progressive
progressive web apps you can get into
mobile application development you see
what I'm saying there's a whole range of
opportunities business-wise but the web
stack gives you that learning swift
learning object to see which is iOS
state of development or learning Java
Android development doesn't give you
it's a wider range of options
business-wise job wise freelancing wise
that's why I have been for a while now a
big advocate of the web stack and the
market is showing that I am correct in
this regard
the market is showing that I'm correct
when I told people years ago to not
invest in learning Swift so much because
there's many more opportunities in the
web stack again I'm not talking about
the technical merits of the language
Swift has amazing qualities to it as a
programming language as as as as does
Python as this job it depends on what
you're doing
right
I always look at technologies as tools
in my tool belt I don't identify as a
Java programmer when I was younger and
less experienced in the 90s it's the
Asus Ava I'm a Java programmer I learned
after several years of experience that I
looked at myself as a developer I didn't
care what the language was I didn't care
what the framework was etc I just was
able to go in look at the job that was
required and then choose a language in
the framework that made sense for that
particular job sometimes I would just
use what I knew and sometimes I would
just learned something that's why my
courses are designed to teach that core
that foundation because real-world web
developers real-world developers are
constantly having to learn something new
you may have to learn what a little
library you may have to learn a whole
new language doesn't matter if you're
professional developer you just go you
learn I can be productive in any
programming language with just a few
hours I'm talking a language I don't
know I never touched before give me a
few hours and I'm writing pro level code
that's because I've been trained and I
am very knowledgeable in the cell and
the foundations do I know everything no
in fact I have now forgotten at this
particular moment in time I have now
forgotten much more than I still
remember it up about programming in
terms of specific languages ask me about
the details about the Java libraries I
forget most of them off the top of my
head this is stuff I used to know like I
could go deep into it I could tell you I
am a bubble boom and there it is I don't
remember but you know what give me two
three hours back in it it'll come back
to me like this
same thing with swished I've only
written some basic Swift just played
around with it I don't consider myself a
swift programmers are only played with
it a few years ago when it came out and
I said good language but I'm not a swift
programmer but if I ever had to do a job
and Swit give me a few hours I'm getting
I'm starting to ripe for a productive
production code because I'm just a
experienced professional developer so
yes
the quickest route to becoming a
professional coder or a programmer and
the most flexible route is the route of
the web developer html5 css3 javascript
from there you have a whole range of
possibilities if you want to go
freelance people who know me they know I
say peach Pete why because there's so
many opportunities there for freelancers
to make a lot of money if you want to
get into robotics and AI Python you get
the indie justice we can just take it
from there another option for
freelancing is JavaScript with node.js
you want to do app mobile app
development you can go to PhoneGap as an
HTML CSS javascript PhoneGap or you
could go into react native perhaps or
you might want to try PWA
that's another option I hope that
answers that email one of my rambling
vlogs sorry about that
new format here I hope you like this
style and using the onboard mics and
just let me know if the sound sucks to
you guys I think it's fine for a blog
all right we'll talk soon ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
