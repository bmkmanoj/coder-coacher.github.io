haven't been doing blogs for last couple
days yeah I've been really busy a lot of
schools new schools deploying to studio
web when you got new schools you always
got a little issues here and there with
firewall issues and other things like
that I just normal with the deployment
of any new app in any new environment so
as we're taking up a lot of my time also
I had a bit of accident I was was on my
hanging tree non the hanging tree and
when you're hanging off the hanging tree
at least for me it pinches my neck
sometimes and then I have to really work
on my breathing and I didn't do it
enough and actually fainted out of the
tree fell right out of the tree and
fortunately as I was hitting the ground
I regained consciousness but right
beside the tree right behind me was this
big tall obvious right this big tall
cement thing marble thing hit the back
my head but surprising it just a light
touch my hat flew off but yeah no big
deal nothing really happened to me I was
a little well nothing really happened to
me there was maybe messed up my back for
a David I'm okay anyhow so in this video
we're going to talk about proper naming
conventions in your files proper naming
conventions now I've talked about this a
little bit in other videos but let's get
straight to the point there's a few
things just got to consider number one
you should have a consistency in your
naming so when you first start working
on any project any coding project you
should first look at and decide upon
rather what you're naming convention is
going to be so that means are you going
to use cattle case are you going to use
dashes between your words and your
variable function class names are you
going to use underscores you have to
sort of come up with your protocol
with your naming scheme and stick to it
this may seem like a small little issue
but trust me when you're doing more and
more writing more and more code having a
very consistent naming structure it's
just going to make your code easier to
manage and and right another thing that
you should do is that when you once
you've decided what your daily sugar is
going to be make sure that it's
consistent on all levels of the apps so
in your object level when you're writing
an actual code whether it be your PHP or
ruby your JavaScript whatever just make
sure that you carry your consistent with
this but also in your database so most
of the time you're doing apps you're
going to be using databases so make sure
that your database field names table
names and so forth utilize and adhere to
the same naming convention again you'll
see when you start writing your SQL code
you start interacting with your object
layer and your database layer it's just
going to make it a little bit easier and
what happens if you have a consistent
consistent naming convention it it just
it just everything moves much more
smoothly the next tip is that you should
use verbose need for both names in your
code for both names so have variable
names that are self described them
talked about soft describing code but
let me give you a quick a quick concrete
example so let's say you are you bet an
app where people are logging in so you
have users that are logging in could be
students and another user type that
could be a teacher so what I would do is
I would have user teacher password with
underscores between dashes in between or
camel case between the words so and that
would be consistent so you have another
user type of student you would have user
student password very self-describing
and then when you have functions or
methods that do something then I would
have very explicit long-winded verbose
function names so might be get student
get teacher password that kind of thing
the less you have to have comments in
your code and the more verbose your code
is variable names function names method
leaves or methods functions etc etc etc
class names the easier your code is
going to be is going to be to maintain
final tip I like to go from the macro to
the micro from the general to specific
with regards to variable names function
names and so forth so what do I mean by
that so let's say i had to user types i
want to interact with teacher and
student would you name your variables
teacher user and student user or would
you name it user student user teacher or
even better yet user type student user
type teacher of course i would use that
last one because i go from the very
general to the specific to very general
as a user and the very specific is
teacher and that you know think about
that if you put that in terms rather in
object-oriented programming it would be
you start with your when you're naming
your variables or function names your
method names your database tables will
not think of it as starting always with
your base class so your base class in
this case would be the user class and
the subclass of the base Club user would
be of course in the case of student
would be student in the case of teacher
would be teacher so there you go those
are my little variable tips is going to
go a long way in helping you have much
cleaner code verbals names
self-describing names
have a code base with doesn't require
hardly any comments if you find you're
writing a lot of comments that means you
have overly complex code and you don't
have good self describing code so keep
that in mind we'll talk some chow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
