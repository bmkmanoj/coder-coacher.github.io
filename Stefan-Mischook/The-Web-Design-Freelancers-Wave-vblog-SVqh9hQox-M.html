with killer sites University calm killer
PHP calm and others in this V blog I
want to talk about web design web
programming freelancing something that
one thing about freelancing that you're
going to encounter and I just want you
to be aware of it basically when you
first start off it's probably slow
you're gonna have to do a bunch of free
be free gigs just to establish some
connections and so on but quickly once
you've developed a bit of a portfolio
you got your programming chops you know
sharp you start getting gigs now here's
the thing what you're going to find as a
freelance web designer web programmer is
that the gigs the jobs will come in
waves there will be periods where you
will get no jobs and then there will be
periods where you get all kinds of work
you don't know what to do with it now
the thing you're going to be careful
about is that is that you don't fool
yourself into thinking that it's always
going to be gravy but you're always
going to get plenty of jobs when the
jobs come in you take them you do them
and you may have to work like a fool for
a month two months three bouts five
months six months and do that because
you may find the games will disappear
for two or three months at a time it's
the way it works it tends to be as a
freelancer a boom or bust cycle
especially in early first couple years
but you're in the game as a freelancer
just the way it is the nature of the
game so with that in mind you always
have to have a big pile of fu stash
money that protects you against those
downsize
a few money is basically just emergency
money that you keep aside and you should
have you know ultimately at least a
year's worth of this cash for
emergencies was an emergency emergency
is not needing to go to taco bell or you
get an emergency new laptop you need to
buy the emergency is when you're going
to pay your rent or you're going to pay
for your food or maybe maybe you know
you lose your laptop and a fire gets
stolen you need something right away
fine but not to buy furniture that
you're hoping to get maybe go on a trip
or trade show no mercy my is it's really
for dire straits situations so I has a
freelancer you have all the advantages
of being free working when you want when
you you know what getting up but when
you want you know working at the cafe or
at home you know you have all these
options but with that freedom comes and
added importance of managing your
finances managing your cash and the
number one thing you can do is to have
that emergency fu stash ready to go so
when you do go through one of those bus
cycles you know where you're not getting
very many jobs you'll be fine you won't
worry about money I spoke at length
about the fu stash there's a lot of
dynamics which have in terms of having a
whole bunch of money sitting around in
some safe account or a couple safe
accounts that are not untouchable and
this its emergency but I may want to
wait to another video to do to do that
or you can just go to Keller sites calm
and look it up I've talked about it
before anyway that's it I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
