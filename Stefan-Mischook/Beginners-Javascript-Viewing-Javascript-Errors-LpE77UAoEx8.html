learn how to take a look at the
javascript errors that are generated
when we create little errors in our
JavaScript if you recall in a previous
video we had written some errors and all
that happened was nothing you remember
we tried to do some alerts and we wrote
the code incorrectly in the page just
didn't display anything so what we're
going to do in this video is first of
all learn why it's important to see the
error messages that are generated when
we write bad JavaScript and we're going
to look at a couple ways we can have
these error messages displayed to us as
we're writing our JavaScript code
so basic question of course is why do we
want to see JavaScript errors that are
being generated well first of all when
you're programming it's normal to create
errors actually it's it's common and you
can expect to be making errors all the
time why because you can have typos
that's most of the errors be honest
refuse typically typos and the
occasional logic error and sometimes
just the system fails and certain errors
occur
so having the error messages in front of
you are a very important tool because
the error message is basically tell you
pretty much what's going on and if you
get a good error console the console is
basically just a window that displays
all the text errors if you have a good
error console not only will you know
what may have caused the error most the
time especially with simpler scription
all exactly what what caused the error
but more importantly good arrow consoles
will actually point out where the error
has occurred
so besides making your life as a
JavaScript programmer easier good error
messages will also help you to learn
JavaScript because as you write your
code as you generate errors over time
you will find that certain types of
mistakes will generate the same types of
errors and the same types of error
messages so when you start getting
familiar with the error messages it's
going to speed up the whole process of
writing your JavaScript because you'll
be able to you'll know right away what
the error was
there are a couple ways to display
errors as you're running a JavaScript
code one way is to use the text editor
if you're using a fancy text editor or
fancy program that will allow you to see
errors like we did for instance with
Dreamweaver I'm just popping this open
Dreamweaver has some basic JavaScript
capabilities where if you do write in
error other i'm going to write an error
here javascript there we go so you see
it tells us right here now as you can
see it doesn't actually highlight the
right line for some reason here so if I
just back that up what if I do this plus
there we go so now tells us now if you
look here there's the syntax error in
line 12 code hinting may not work so it
doesn't give you any information about
the error but at least you know that
this is a probable error so if we just
put a semicolon you see the error
disappears now Dreamweaver cs4 does have
that basic capability where it shows you
if an obvious error has occurred and it
will highlight the line but as you just
saw before it's not always perfect but
at least it tells you as your retinue
code that you have at least an error
occurring somewhere so it's kind of
useful other programs are more
specialized in JavaScript other text
editors like NetBeans for an example and
there are many others they will give you
much better error information that said
you don't have to use a fancy program
like dreamweaver or netbeans to see
error messages you can actually do this
in the web browser itself so let's take
a look so here's our error page I'm
going to refresh this and we see the
alert box popping open as we're used to
so let's let's generate an error now
let's do what we did before double colon
now I see luxury you know what was
you sure generate something there we go
so should we get an error Jim
Dreamweaver gives us this default you
know you have an error that doesn't give
us any information about the error so
let's load this page up in the web
browser see what happens so nothing
happens we all have the alert box as we
saw before so how do you display errors
in web browser in firefox I'm using this
now and in internet explorer it's two
different ways
extra now so let's just reminds all of
this now here we go here we go so I'm
going to refresh page nothing happens we
don't see anything but if you go into
two O's error console I'm just going to
look clear this I'm just going to
refresh the page again as you can see we
have a pretty decent error here tells us
what line is on line 12 and it even
points out wherever likely error is
right which is kind of cool so what we
can do and even shows you if you click
on that link it even displays it appear
so we can go back correct this if we
reload our page always clear because
error console reload our page and our
pop-up should work here we go and as you
can see no errors have appeared</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
