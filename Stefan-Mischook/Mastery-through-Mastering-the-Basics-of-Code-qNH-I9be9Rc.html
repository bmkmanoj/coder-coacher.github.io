remind you guys of something I've been
talking about throughout many of my
vlogs over the last year at least some
of them if you want to become a master
programmer a master developer actually
if you want to master anything business
software development whatever work on
your basics the mastery of the basics
means the mastery of the craft I learned
this principle initially in martial arts
once again martial arts one of my best
instructors and I had many over the
years he gave me that great piece of
advice he said Stef if you want to
become an expert fighter you want to
become a master fighter
my master fight he didn't say that he
said you wanted to come an expert you
want to become the black belt you have
to concentrate on the basics you have to
master those fundamental principles
those fundamental techniques you got to
get the fundamentals into place if you
don't get the fundamentals in the place
you're never going to be any good that's
just about it
same thing with software development
being a great developer has little to do
with knowing a whole bunch of different
frameworks are knowing five different
languages really what makes a master
developer a master developer if somebody
who has a deep understanding of software
development of programming so starts
with the languages and then it moves out
from there into things like app design
workflows in your software development
process this is what's going to make you
very successful and very productive
whether you end up getting a job working
for somebody or whether you decide to do
your own independent freelance work set
up a studio we have people working for
you or maybe create your own software
create your own app this opinion that
I'm giving you here is not based on
vlogs and I read or books that are read
or videos I've seen this is based on my
experience of being involved in software
since the 1990s and having developed
several apps this is something I've seen
over and over and over again with my own
development where whenever I would run
into problems was a jet over said shut
up
whenever I would run into problems
sounds like it's crashing whenever I run
into problems with software ultimately
it would come down to the factor as a
whole there is a gap in some basic
knowledge that's why in my courses
whether it be my recently
soon-to-be-released Python course or
whether it be on JavaScript or PHP
whatever I always concentrate on the
basics even something as simple as HTML
in my beginners HTML course where I
teach html5 I teach the request response
cycle I help the students understand how
the server and the client model works
how the web browser renders the code
these sorts of things you don't ever see
in other courses which is silly because
when you understand HTTP as an example
when you understand how that really
operates the whole cycle it's going to
improve your abilities as a web
developer tremendously tremendously and
that's just one example same thing with
the Python course recently now when
you're developing a course you have so
many different tangents you can go down
you have so many different tangents
you're going to introduce different
modules that are built into Python which
are basically just packages of code you
can jump down into different
specializations would be machine
learning or or animation or web app
development or data processing
what I do though is I concentrate on the
basics because again it's so important
that's why I teach the basics and to be
honest with you it's a lot easier to
develop a course where you're just
walking through the steps of a value
division and you see that all the time
that's easy to produce as a course maker
the hard part about building a course is
building a course where you will go over
these key fundamentals and they have to
be presented in the right order
otherwise it's not going to work this is
something you can learn if you're ever
pitching a product as an entrepreneur
whether you're presenting an app or a
website that you're developing for a
client you have to be careful to present
the elements of your app the elements of
the site in the proper order so that
your client could understand exactly
what it is that you are doing anyway if
you've been watching my vlogs you can
see there's a common thread and
everything I do I'm always looking for
these universal principles that are
consistent across any discipline with
their entrepreneurial type of activities
whether it be my phone sticking here
sorry my phone was about to fall down so
whether you're doing entrepreneur where
you're running your business or setting
up your business you go she ate a deal
whether you're presenting a project as a
freelancer whether you're bidding on a
project whether you're learning software
whether you're deepening your skills
whether you're doing martial arts a lot
of these fundamental principles that I
keep coming back to really really do
help a lot and if you learn to embrace
them and really understand them on a
deep level you're going to see it's
going to help you so much in your career
in your life and so on it even applies
to dating and you know what I'll have to
address that in another video blog
another principle is you never let
anything control you now the closes I
have to something controlling me is
coffee but if you find yourself in a
situation where
you need something before you can
operate then you got a problem you got a
pullback and you got to break that so
whether it's coffee relationships or
whether its food or anything else if
something is controlling you compelling
you and it's very hard to deal with you
have to take steps to mitigate that even
if you don't want to have your primal
impulses you don't want addictions of
any type to control you because that
could lead to all kinds of problems all
right that's it Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
