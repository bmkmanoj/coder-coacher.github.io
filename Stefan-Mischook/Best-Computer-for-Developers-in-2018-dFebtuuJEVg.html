let's get into in this vlog I'm going to
cover two things number one best
computer to program with in 2018
now you wouldn't figure it's changed
much since 2017 but this is a question I
get asked not all the time but are
fairly often
I figure I'm going to address it here
and the second thing I'm going to talk
about is Rails for startups Ruby and
rails for startups the question was put
to me is whether or not it would have an
impact in terms of whether VCS were more
likely to invest in your business if
your web app was based on Ruby on Rails
and the other question is would Ruby on
Rails be a good choice in terms of
achieving MVP MVP a show for Minimum
Viable Product this is an old concept
that any entrepreneur should know and
I've talked about that in other vlogs
basically the idea is you want to get a
product out as quickly as possible
Minimum Viable Product so that you can
see what whether or not the market likes
your product and then you can start
iterating start making the changes that
are necessary anyway let's get into
number one so the first thing best
computer in 2018 well that comes down to
a few things number one it comes down to
the type of programming you want to do
so generally speaking computers these
days would be windows-based Mac Linux
and that's so much Chromebooks
Chromebooks are nothing this way the
best thing to program with I'm sure you
can hack something out I would have use
Chromebooks but yeah in terms of Windows
Mac or Linux they're all neck-and-neck
of course everybody's got the
preferences people will argue that Linux
and Mac are better for developers
because they've got the built-in
command-line tools this is true and
their Linux base of course and a lot of
the servers you can be interacting with
most of us will be our Linux base so
there is an argument that having a Linux
computer talking to a Linux server might
have certain advantages the
very limited in my opinion when it comes
down to it just go with whatever type of
computer that you're comfortable with
that said I do use Macs
most of the time although I do have a
Windows machine there's one thing you
have to consider though when you are
writing software for dotnet if you could
be writing dotnet which is Windows based
Microsoft framework for building apps
then it would be silly to do it in
anything but Windows so if you're doing
dotnet c-sharp you want to do that kind
of stuff probably best to use Windows I
don't even know if you could do it on
Mac you might be able to using the mono
project I haven't looked into it that
said if you're doing dotnet programming
whether it be asp.net and whatnot you're
gonna be using Windows make sense if
you're gonna be doing iOS or watch OS or
Mac OS programming of course you
couldn't have a Mac and yeah so Linux
again for general-purpose programming
but beyond that I don't see any
advantage a disadvantage or advantage
over all whether you go for Windows
machine or you go with a Mac or a Linux
machine in terms of the actual hardware
you don't need powerful computers number
one I would be using a laptop so you
have that flexibility get a laptop and
maybe an external monitor no more
desktops not one of those all in ones
this way you can program depending where
you want to go what are the advantages
of being a software developers that you
could go on a vacation you could be in
Florida you could be in California could
be in some island somewhere as long as
you have an internet connection you can
write code so if you have a laptop it'll
allow you to take your work with you if
you wanted to travel so I always use
laptops I haven't had a desktop in many
years now because laptops could be that
flexibility and laptops are so powerful
these days that you don't really need a
desktop specially for coding these days
computers are so powerful you could use
a five six year old laptop it'll be
plenty powerful to do just about any
type of coding but you want to do so as
you're given so many people program in
in dynamic languages things like Python
and PHP and JavaScript languages that
are not compiled so you don't have to
wait around for a compiler to do the
compiling for you but even then if you
were using a compiled language like a C
or C++ or Java or something computers
are so fast so it turns a hardware you
don't have to get the super fast if
you're gonna get a brand new machine I
would always recommend get
middle-of-the-road that's the best bang
for your buck so there you go 2018 all
operating systems are good depending on
the type of work computers are so fast
but get a laptop alright let's talk
about rails and Ruby on Rails in terms
of building a an app there will be a web
app of course you want to get funding by
some VCS in a question that was put to
me at least as far as I can interpret is
whether or not having it written in Ruby
on Rails is gonna make it more
interesting to the M to the VC companies
or venture capital business I don't
think so I think that it's a lost thing
they look at as long as your codebase is
clean and you got a good team behind the
codebase they're not gonna really care
what you write it in generally speaking
will be rubies or JavaScript or PHP or
Java as long as your app works they're
much more concerned about the viability
in the app the viability of the team how
level-headed you are how realistic you
are how the pendant will you are and
whether or not your product has traction
in the marketplace so in terms of what
VCS will think I really doubt they're
gonna care too much except for what I
told you they don't want clean codebase
they want you to be able to use modern
architectures they don't want you to be
leveraging some really old stuff and
that's pretty much as far as I've seen
and heard in terms of MVP Minimum Viable
Product what's gonna get there what's
going to get you there quick well any of
the modern development platforms will do
that for you whether it be rails Ruby
PHP laravel dotnet
and asp.net I guess although it might be
heavy meaning might be slower to develop
in because just it's just a chunkier
platform Python Django example nodejs
and JavaScript all these all these
frameworks and languages will get you
there pretty quickly although I'm not a
huge advocate of using JavaScript on the
server yet wouldn't know it because I
think that those that hold environments
a little immature still libraries are
changing quickly you might have to mess
around a lot configurations where you
wouldn't with mature platforms like a
PHP lab our Ruby rails Python Django in
terms of those three or four which ones
are superior inferior depends on your
particular skill set depends on what
you're looking to do for startups for
small business I'm always a big advocate
to PHP because it's the fastest at
runtime for those languages that I've
talked about and it's really easy to get
up and running with a PHP level based
system and it's very it's very advanced
in terms of what it can do its feature
set I haven't mentioned Java because
Java is heavy-duty meaning that though
it's very capable you're gonna have to
write a lot more Java code to get
something done versus Ruby rails or PHP
laravel excetera
so I'm not a big advocate of using Java
in the startup space Java should be
something that you only do Android with
and that's going to be fading I think in
time with I've used this new language
built on top of Java I think it's called
Kotlin I forget all seven and it's like
kind of like this caught late in the
Kotler if you can look it up it is it is
Java's version of swift swift replaces
Objective C for iOS app creation and
can't land or Kotler I think it's common
is is the same thing it's a lighter
language from Java and you're able to
get the job done and Google just said
leave the thumbs up to that particular
language haven't looked at it so I don't
know but of course when you're doing a
lot of these mobile apps I'm a big
advocate of looking at the web
first because most mobile apps mobile
apps can be built with a web tech with a
translation layer rather than having to
go native which is going to save you a
lot of time in terms of your programming
if you don't understand this don't worry
about it
you get it just check out my other vlog
to talk about this in detail so yeah in
terms of getting out a Minimum Viable
Product any of the modern scripting
languages that's what we used to call
them Python JavaScript PHP they'll get
you there super fast because they're all
very mature of these days and in terms
of whether or not a VC venture capital
firm will allow you your app more
because it's written in rails vs. Python
Django I don't think so
I think they're just going to be
concerned about whether or not the code
base is clean and and well-written and
you're probably gonna get some coded
inspections at some point but what
they're much more concerned about is how
your team functions how you functions if
you have traction which your app and if
you're a reasonable a realistic founder
keep that in mind anyway that's pretty
much it for this vlog bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
