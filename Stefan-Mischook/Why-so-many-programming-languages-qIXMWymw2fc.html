so many different programming languages
out there so you may be wondering why
are there so many programming languages
there's Python there's JavaScript
there's Swift
there's Java there's c-sharp there's
really there's PHP and there's many many
others why so many wow there's a few
reasons number one different languages
were invented or created to solve
different problems so Python was created
to create an intuitive easy to learn and
easy to write language and it's got
easier syntax got easier of code so
that's why Python was created Java was
created at init day to create a language
that could run at any type of computer
this was something unique for it today
in the old days you would have a
programming language would only write
would only work on Windows and another
program or programming language but it
only work on Mac for instance so Java
was invented to be able to run anywhere
there was the the catch phrase for
Jasmine today was write once run
anywhere JavaScript different from Java
JavaScript invented around same time was
designed to be the programming language
for web browsers so since that time has
expanded quite a bit PHP the dirty
redheaded stepchild of the programming
world super popular by the way but for
some reason it's like disco disco music
was super popular in the 70s and then
they hit the 80's hit and if you even
admitted you like disco you were
attacked by the PHP is kind of like that
these days even though it's used like
all over the place Facebook was created
with PHP now PHP was designed originally
for building web apps PHP is not nearly
as flexible in terms of where it can be
used as Python Python is you know is
using robotics and gaming web apps and
computational and scientism PHP is only
used in web apps and PHP actually its
original name was personal homepage PHP
personal home page they change that now
because we wanted to make it
sound fancier but when PHP was invented
it was a vet to to create webpages
dynamic websites web apps I'm not going
to go on any more about PHP but all you
need to take away from this video is
that different programming languages
were invented because some nerd and I
say that when Altima was most respect
nerds they they have such an impact of
very important people in our world nerds
some nerd will invent a programming
language because they want to do they
want to create a language that that
works better to solve a certain problem
a problem could be creating database
driven dynamic web apps a problem could
be to create you know mobile apps more
easily etc etc etc for instance Apple
created Swift to make it easier to write
iOS apps as an example so each language
has its particular here's a nerd word
use case it's a situation where it's
best used of course a lot of these
languages are flexible and a lot of
these languages overlap so for instance
Java and Python are two languages that
could be used to do many of the same
things etc etc etc so then the other
reason is that people invent languages
is because they prefer that coding be
done in a certain way so even though
Python can do a lot of what Java does
and vice versa the Python was written so
that you could code in a more simple
easier to read syntax simpler to read
code syntax is another word for code
than Java so you can have the Java guys
saying Python stinks of a blonde and a
Python guy is saying that about the Java
guys ruby guys jump it in so you could
have all these coding language Wars
these programming language Wars a lot of
it comes down to taste so those are the
reasons the main reasons why we have
multiple coding languages one of the
other reasons is because just because
technology changes python is a language
that requires powerful computers and so
it
have been workable 25 years ago Python
it was just be too slow for the
computers of computers not have been
fast enough today though computers are
so powerful that Python is very very
viable now so yeah those are the reasons
to solve different problems there's no
one reason why we have different
programming languages number two reason
is because different programmers have
different point of view about how
programming languages should work and
how the code should look and number
three is because as computer hardware as
it gets faster and more powerful you can
you have more freedom in terms of the
type of programming languages you can
introduce and that's it for this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
