PHP comm uh yeah as you can tell I'm
wearing the same shirt again I'm doing V
blog after V blog I just have all these
ideas all these things I'm gonna talk
about so since I am on a roll with
regards to PHP and coding and frameworks
I wanted to discuss something a little
bit more philosophical and practical
about being a web developer so with all
these different languages out there PHP
Ruby Java Python etc and all these
different frameworks laravel Zen coding
that etc now we've got all these
different frameworks and languages and
so on and yet each house each language
each framework will say well ours is
better than the others we do it properly
they don't do it so good
but despite all these disagreements and
these different points of views they all
seem to be able to produce good apps
anyway or at least successful house so
for instance instant message so I'm
gonna pause this for a second okay I'm
back so with all these successful apps
being created by all these different
languages and frameworks like you know
PHP or Facebook and you have WordPress
well I'm not sure how good the code is
in Facebook it used to be really sucky
back in the day but it's still a highly
successful site obviously and it's
written in PHP and then you look on the
ruby cap you have twitter you know ruby
is twitter is written Ruby and the Ruby
gotta say space Ruby guys will say
Facebook sucks and the PHP guy has to
say screw Ruby and in Python 2 there's
another language I'm sure Python has
very successful projects that are out
there
so and there's many others of course so
the big question is if you got all these
different languages and all these
different frameworks you know PHP ago
laravel codeigniter Zend CakePHP under a
few other Symphony and they all produce
good apps there you can all you can
produce good apps of all these different
frameworks always different languages so
the big question is how important really
is the programming language and how
important is the framework so before I
answer that question it relates back I'm
gonna relate this back to martial arts
and I do this a lot because I did
martial arts for the majority of my life
I did I practice for thirty years many
different styles many different schools
and some hardcore stuff I used to be a
bouncer so I put a lot of stuff to the
test in Riya in reality and so like in
programming in the martial art community
you have all these different styles and
you can think of each style of martial
art like being it's a new it's another
they're fighting technology's martial
arts are fighting technologies some are
simple some are complex and they
contradict each other as well just like
programming languages one style of
martial art will say I don't know it's
how you got to do it another style say
how I got to do it this way and I can
tell you from my experience over four
decades that regardless of the style
there's always pretty decent well not
always but most of the time there's
pretty good fighters will come out of
any style in any school it doesn't
matter what the Stars and and you have
us you have I could say somebody in
Brazilian Jujitsu could fight really
well and then you fight a guy in
wrestling will fight very well as well
and even though the different styles I
do still produce good fighters and a lot
of times in these Styles will contradict
each other one style say I had a
like this and the other style said no no
no that sucks you gotta push like that
you get the idea and when I was like 18
years old or 17 18 I forget now I I was
having done Cyril systems at this point
I was perplexed by how said well if if
this style says this sucks and this
style says no that sucks but they still
produce good fighters so to me that told
me that the techniques and the style of
martial art was irrelevant didn't matter
there was something else going on that
made people good fighters or not and the
techniques and the nuance and those
details really didn't have much of an
impact so what I did is I decided to try
to figure out what it was what was that
fundamental those fundamental things
principles ideas that made good fighters
regardless of system regardless of the
style so let's go back to programming
application development as we discussed
regardless of the language Ruby PHP Java
c-sharp Objective C you can always
produce good apps now I should have
mentioned Objective C because that's
kind of very very specific to creating
apps for Apple computers for Macs and
for creating iOS apps so they don't it
doesn't really compete with PHP Ruby
Python but so forget about Objective C
for now but so just look at PHP Ruby and
Python Java dotnet these are all
competing technologies they're all
server-side programming languages and
you know and they contradict each other
like Java is a strongly typed language
you don't know what that means check out
my videos whereas Ruby and PHP are
loosely typed dynamic languages and
there's probably pros and cons to each
and
you know the Java guys will say no no
it's better to do it this way and the pH
guy PHP guys say uh accessory etc and
this goes to the frameworks as well
right
the same framework versus Lara valve vs.
code igniter and first is Ruby on Rails
versus you know but they all produce
good stuff so what this tells me is that
though all these frameworks are
important though good languages are
important they're not the final answer
in terms of what makes a good app so
what makes a good app I've been building
apps since 1996 building websites since
1994 I've programmed things in many
different languages it's basic coding
principles properly executed that makes
a difference between a successful app
and a crappy app and one of the things
I'll give you one tip for this video
blog because I don't want to get into it
now one of the most important things you
can do when you're creating apps is that
you keep your code simple you keep it
very simple and you keep it very modular
okay that's two things simple call it I
think that's pretty obvious
modular meaning you don't want big
bloated code it's only if you're
developing object-oriented based PHP
I've been a novice excuse me if you are
developing an object-oriented based
PHP app whether you're using zendo or
larva or whatever what have you try to
keep your objects as small as possible
and as focused as possible in terms of
what they do don't have big monster
objects with monster capabilities you
shouldn't have an object we can do 20
things your object should be we do one
maybe two things that are related that's
it so keep your code simple same thing
with your functions well you know
functions inside objects or methods save
me what your methods keep them simple
fine-grained as they used to say in the
Java community so that's my tip for
today I say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
