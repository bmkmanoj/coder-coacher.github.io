discussed MVC opie and talked a little
bit about the coding style guide let's
move on and start working on our first
actual coding working on the template
object the template object is very
important to my implementation of the
MVC pattern if you've done any of my
other MVC style courses either the CMS
or the PHP login with opie and MVC you
should recognize this object it's copied
and pasted directly from there with just
a couple of weeks with a specific course
if you take a look at the chart you saw
about two videos ago this demonstrates
the MVC pattern the user provides the
input the controller decides what to do
you may get data from the model passes
it off to the view and the view gets
displayed out to the user well the
template object sits somewhere in the
middle here the controller uses the
template object to display views and it
uses the template object to store data
that gets then displayed in the views so
it's pretty important to the way I
handle things in this particular video
we're going to be covering a couple key
methods that this object offers we will
be covering load which loads our views
we're going to be covering redirect
which sends the user to a different page
entirely we're going to covering set
data which allows us to store data
that's going to be used and displayed in
the views and we're going to be talking
about get data which retrieves that
information and displays it within our
view in the next video we'll be talking
about additional functionality that this
object offers including getting and
setting alerts let's dive into the code
so I'm going to open up a Melinda Square
template type HP and I'm going to start
out with an opening PHP tag
I'm going to add a comment which is
going to indicate what this file is and
roughly what it does so it's the
template class and it's going to handle
all templating tasks so displaying views
displaying views alert tours and view
data and underneath that we're going to
add class template and we're going to
start this file out with a constructor
like so and I'm just going to leave it
blank and we don't actually need to do
anything within the constructor but I
have made sure to include it in the file
just in case you or maybe even me at
some point in the future comes back to
this and actually needs to do something
within the constructor the first thing
we're going to do with in this file is
we're going to talk about the load
function so public function load it's
going to load a URL that we specify and
basically this function is just a
wrapper for the include function so it's
going to include whatever URL that we
tell us that we tell it to and right
above the load function I can add a
little bit of documentation so I have a
shortcut on my computer basically I type
in a couple letters hit tab
automatically expands out to a full
snippet and i highly suggest you find
something like that if you can just
makes it easier and faster for me to
type in documentation so i would highly
suggest you add comments as you go
rather than coming back to them and
trying to do it later because it's quite
possible you'll never make it back and
you won't actually ever end up
commenting so I'm simply going to
describe what this does in this case it
loads a specified URL and the parameter
is a string and it returns null doesn't
actually return anything let me save
this we're going to need to modify two
other files take advantage of this
template object the first one we need to
modify is in it dot PHP and down here at
the bottom of the file we need to create
any objects that we're going to be using
so the first step in that is include
we're going to include app models I'm
template so that'll include the class
and then we actually need to create an
instance of that class so template
equals new template like so so when the
unit that PHP page is loaded it's going
to create our template object now we
need to actually use it so within index
PHP wrapping them doing include I'm
going to do template load so let's do a
quick preview and make sure everything's
working properly there we go so you
notice when we refresh we get exactly
the same page back and well the view
itself hasn't changed the functionality
behind it has we're now using a template
object to load whatever view we specify
let's go back to M template and let's
add in another your method in this case
it's going to be public function
redirect URL
and similar to the above function is
going to do basically the same thing
this is simply a wrapper for the header
function so we're going to redirect to
whatever URL we specify and then i'm
going to put exit to make sure that the
code execution stops there just in case
it would continue after the header
function let's add our documentation and
this redirects to specified URL and it's
a string and returns null so let's test
this out let's go back to our index PHP
let's comment out this line and we're
going to redirect to calais sites like
so
you'll notice now we're automatically
redirected to the killer sites website
one quick comment before I continue at
this point you might be asking so why
even bother creating load and redirect
methods within this object why not just
use include and header directly within
the controller well I'm trying to make
the template class the central location
for all templating related activities so
it's going to display all the views it's
going to store all the data thats
related to views anything that's view
related goes here so it's a way that I
can consolidate all that functionality
into one object I also feel like it
improves my code quality a little bit
rather than doing and include I use
template load which is a little bit
clearer it says exactly what it does
we're dealing with a template object
which handles all of our views and all
that information we're loading whatever
URL we specify so from that perspective
I think the code is a little bit cleaner
since I try to keep each of my videos
roughly around ten minutes each looks
like I'm running out of time to talk
about the get data and set data
functions so join me in the next video
and I'll talk about that in more detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
