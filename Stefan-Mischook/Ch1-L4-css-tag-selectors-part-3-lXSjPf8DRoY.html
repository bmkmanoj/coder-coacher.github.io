about the tag selectors so here we go
I've made a little change off camera
when I wasn't videotaping while not
taping but screen capturing my screen
anyway so you look I set the font size
to 24 pics now look at the size of our
h1 tags let me just take this away watch
this say that and you see this is the
default size so you notice what do I
mean by that well you notice that in the
code the style code this declaration
does not specify I don't tell the web
browser what size to make my h1 tags
right I just say just make it orange
that's always set to do you know I'm
tired of looking at orange will make it
red instead their egos red so I just
taught it to make it red but I didn't
tell it what size to make it right so
it's nowhere in our code here do i
specify do i tell the web browser what
size to make the h1 tags so we see here
is the automatic size or as the nerds
like to say the default size that the
browser makes the h1 text now what size
is this we can figure that out actually
it's not 24 the default size i believe
is 32 we'll see what happens now because
I set it to 32 in our CSS this should
you know well this this text here unless
h1 will turn 32 pics hit refresh doesn't
change size when we put it to 42 just to
make sure that we see what we're talking
about seat 40 too much bigger back to 32
you see there it is 32 okay i'm tired of
red now let's make it green all right
green now when i'm doing this and if you
can you should be writing this code in
your code editor and trying out these
things as well so you see I said up to
32 I refresh refresh doesn't change
let's take out the code now there's no
CSS telling the web browser what's I
to make the h1 so that means that this
is going to be the default or the
automatic size but the browser makes h1
tags there we go it's 32 I press refresh
nothing happened that means that's the
default size so what do you want to take
away from this lesson first of all that
the browser's have a default setting for
everything in the page so for instance
the default size for h1 we just found
out is 32 pics right now everything in
the web browser has a default setting so
for instance the color of your h1 also
have a default so let me just take out
all the CSS here bumble so now this CSS
declaration block is empty right there's
no CSS rules in here see this is a
declaration block this is a CSS
declaration block this is but there's no
rules so all I'm telling the browser to
do now is when it comes to each one's
don't do anything so what we're going to
see here now in the browser is the
automatic settings the default settings
as a nurse like to say for the aged one
so let's refresh as you can see for
vh1's the default color for h1 text is
black and we know that the default size
is 32 I'll put this back in boom we just
change the color green let's make this
bigger 48 boom now it's bigger so you're
getting the idea one last rule for this
particular lesson remember I told you
between CSS properties and their values
at the end of a property value pair prop
no property value pair you have to have
a semicolon so let the CSS some excuse
me so what the web browser knows this is
the end of this CSS property value pair
this is another property value pair etc
so you can inside of your CSS
declaration block the last
rule here you can put a semicolon that
works great but you don't have to why
because there's no other CSS after this
right but if you had more of these we
had other CSS property values like I
just have here now we're just line
breaking here right and we're just wine
wrapping you would still need this
semicolon between it by the way you
could have font size 48 font size 48
that will work too that's fine but
that's kind of weird but let me just go
back here so there you go I just want
you to understand that and yeah this
video's long enough on to the next
lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
