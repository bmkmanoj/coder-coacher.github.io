killer PHP comm and today what I'm gonna
be doing is a very short introduction a
seven part so maybe it's not so a short
introduction to jQuery we're gonna be
looking at how you can get jQuery set up
on your own local website how to use
Google's content delivery network to
speed things up then we're going to be
looking at events in jQuery making some
really cool animations and buttons and
menus and then we're gonna look at the
server side so we're gonna try and
incorporate PHP into our jQuery project
finally looking at something called
Jason not the person it's actually a
interchange format like XML but far
cooler and then we're gonna finish this
by creating some objects in PHP and then
passing them along to jQuery and seeing
what we can make of that so this is the
first part we're gonna look at how you
can actually get jQuery installed on or
included in part of a project so I've
got this this domain right here called
static this is my own local machine and
for the first couple of videos you won't
actually need to have a web server we're
gonna be doing this primarily from our
disk locally and then as we start using
PHP then we're gonna have to move away
from simply using HTML to also using PHP
but since this is killer PHP I'm sure
you're already familiar with that stuff
so you might have also noticed there's a
toolbar up here that doesn't come with
Firefox it's called the web developer
toolbar it's handy but we're not going
to be using it for this tutorial set
however I do want to touch on this
little icon down here which is a little
bug and this is Firebug and you can get
Firebug at the add ons website for for
Firefox so if you just do a search for
fire
into the mighty Google search engine and
go to get Firebug calm you can grab
yourself a copy of Firebug and it's
really handy for doing JavaScript
debugging and also development because
you can stop at any point and profile or
figure out what variable content is
actually appearing on your website so
we'll look at that as well so let's
start by just getting jQuery obviously
the first place you would probably look
is jQuery calm and this is the jQuery
website on the right over here you'll
see that there is a download link for
jQuery you'll notice that there are two
different versions that they talked
about here they've got a production
version and a development version and
for our purposes we're going to be using
the production version and minified in
gzipped basically what that means is
that the the jQuery library has been
compressed down to its smallest possible
form so that it's nice and light for
your users to download it so we're just
going to click on the download link for
jQuery and we're gonna be taken to a
Google code page click on that link and
you can see that it's already
downloading it
so you'll see jQuery appear on my
desktop and what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to take it and drag it to for me
it's my sites folder into the static
folder now this is the folder that I'm
using for my particular project and if I
go back to static here you'll see that I
don't have anything except for the
jQuery file in order to use the jQuery
minified version we need to create some
HTML and the HTML is going to make
reference to the jQuery file that we've
just downloaded from jQuery comm so if I
click on this let's just get a sense of
what it looks like you'll see that
there's a whole bunch of what looks like
a lot of garbage and this is the
compressed version of jQuery so you're
not going to be able to make heads or
tails of it
but luckily the documentation exists on
Doc's jquery.com
and we're gonna be looking a bit at how
we can actually use this wonderful
library so to start off with I'm going
to be using a text editor and my text
editor of choice is BBEdit and you can
of course use notepad or anything else
textmate TextWrangler notepad plus plus
they're all fantastic and I'm going to
start by creating a new file so I'm just
going to say file new text document and
we're going to start by just creating a
very simple HTML structure it's a head
and a body and I'm gonna put in the
necessary doctype information which I
have a hard time remembering so you'll
have to forgive me I'm just going to
I'm just going to grab it from here
we're gonna be using the XHTML
transitional doctype I'm just gonna copy
that and paste that into here and that
should be it so now I'm just gonna hit
save and we're gonna put this file into
my static folder so I'm just gonna call
this getting jQuery dot HTML we're gonna
go back to Firefox if i refresh this
you'll see that now there's a file that
shows up called getting jQuery dot HTML
I click on it I don't see anything
however if I put a header one in the
body tag under or within the body tag
saying getting jQuery its save then
we're actually going to see some text
which is great now now we need to
actually reference the jQuery library
and in order to do that we just need to
use the script tag so I'm just going to
write script type equals text slash
JavaScript SRC and here we're going to
be referencing this file and I'm just
gonna paste that in and we'll just close
that script tag actually we're gonna do
it this way it's just another way of
closing a tag hit save refresh it again
and we shouldn't see any changes but
jQuery should have been loaded not very
exciting yet but we're going to be using
this a lot in the tutorials to come so
because this tutorial is really quite
short I'm going to take this opportunity
to show you some of the logging features
of the Firebug that you might find me
using later on so in order to use jQuery
all you need to do is have some
JavaScript on the page and then you're
good to go so I'm gonna say a script tag
with new type text slash JavaScript
and open this up and ideally when you're
creating your JavaScript you don't want
to put it in the middle of your website
you want to keep it in a separate file
ID or at least at the very least at the
top of the page so let's say I wanted to
get the header one here and I wanted to
somehow do something with it using
jQuery well if I was using this with
traditional JavaScript I would have to
make sure that my JavaScript runs after
the h1 has been read by the browser let
me give you a quick example of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
