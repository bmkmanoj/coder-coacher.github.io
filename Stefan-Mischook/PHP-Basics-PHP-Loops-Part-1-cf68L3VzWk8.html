chuck and in this video tutorial we're
going to cover one of the fundamental
constructs in the PHP language something
called a loop
loop's are basically tools in PHP that
allows you to loop through things allows
you to do repetitive task typically you
will use loops to do things like process
records in a database or maybe loop to
loop through an array for instance like
so many other things in PHP I believe
that once you see the code and you
actually write the code you're going to
find using loops pretty easy
so I've launched Dreamweaver my PHP text
editor for this series of videos and I
started off by creating a very bill and
you're going to see why I've done this
so let's actually create our first loop
this of course is the while loop and use
the keyword while and I assume that
you've done the the conditional video
tutorial where we looked at if
statements because it's the wild loop is
very similar to the a statement in one
way where the while loop works by
checking to see whether or not the value
held in between the brackets here is
true and if it is true this gets run and
as long as this value here turns out to
be true in between the brackets we're
going to put a value in there in a
second this gets run over and over and
over and over again plus the loop so
let's let's create a little counter and
we'll do that by using this variable so
i gave the variable an initial value of
one while this is equal to and less than
say 10 we're going to tell it to let's
say echo out now here's a new operator I
want to introduce you to the double plus
plus sign and that operator is called
the increment operator and I'll explain
to you what it does in about two seconds
here so let me just start from the top
so this while loop basically works like
an if statement where this code here
anything in between the the while loop
opening closing curly brackets will get
processed if whatever is in between
these two brackets is true so as law as
long as the variable count is greater
than excuse me is less than or equal to
10 this will get run so what we're doing
and so what we're doing we're just
echoing out to the text hello to the
page and we're doing something very
interesting here
haven't shown you guys before this
double plus symbol is the increment
operator so what basically this does
this is a shortcut way of saying
increase the value of the variable count
by one that's what this does so so the
theory is should get rid of this may be
the theory is that every time this loop
runs this variable value will be
increased by one so we'll start off
being equal to one and two and three and
four and once it hits a ten the loop
will stop because of how to reach this
condition what have become false after
ten right so long as it's equal to or
less than 10 so actually when it hits 11
rather it will stop processing so let's
run this code and see what happens so I
popped open Firefox and as you can see
the word hello has been printed to the
page ten times so let's go back to our
code and make a couple little changes
and we'll look at some interesting
behavior so for instance so we had low
so let's change that like so your space
and then we're going to use a
concatenation operator the little plus
sign and what we're going to do is we're
going to actually print the value of
count as we loop through so we should
see the loop increment as we go along we
should actually see a number increase
and what I'm going to actually do as
well we're going to put in a HTML break
so that's a little bit cleaner so let's
take a look at this in the browser again
and there we go so you see we've created
10 hellos and you see it's printed out
the numbers and a reason sprinted out
the numbers it because we've actually
told PHP to print out the count variable
value to the page so vague oh this is a
basic loop this is the while loop
there's a couple other loop types
that you can find in PHP and essentially
what you want to get out of this is it
works like an if statement a conditional
statement where as long as this value is
true this gets processed once this value
is no longer true it just skips that
block in PHP will continue to process
the code from the top down as it always
does</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
