answer two questions that are related I
got one question from somebody who is
asking about whether or not there was a
need for verbal communications with
people when you are a freelance
developer whether it be Skype calls or
what not and his concern was that his
English spoken English wasn't very good
although his written English was
actually pretty good and I had another
person from I believe it was closer foe
who asked about how to get jobs outside
of Kosovo somebody can make more money
said that in the country it's hard to
make good money as a developer but when
he had job a job outside of the country
he made good money she wants to know how
do you get more jobs outside of your
country of origin and I guess his first
language is not English either the quick
answers you got to become a better
speaker in English you have to be able
to read and write and of course speak in
English that is such an important thing
so if you have your foundations down in
programming and development in terms of
what type of work what you want to do
the first thing you gotta do now well
the next thing you got to do now rather
is you got to learn English Wow
now what should you do should read read
more English start speaking in English
maybe do some online English courses
that is the biggest problem that foreign
program grows for for and to
english-speaking countries if your
spoken language or your language is your
secondary language is English or you
don't know English especially if you
want to get work abroad meaning outside
of your country in english-speaking
countries you have to learn that
language it's so poor it's much more
important learning some framework it's
much more important than learning a new
language learning English and that's
huge so one way to learn English is to
watch English based courses and speak
along with the speaker as
they're teaching you how to code or
watch TV etc etc etc it's important that
you improve your language skills so
important so this brings me back to a
broader subject I've noticed over the
last year and a half that I've been back
active on YouTube that most of the
people are here to learn how to code to
get a job they're learning how to code
to become a freelancer they're learning
how to code to start a business and that
kind of makes sense and I'm right there
with you because that's the reason I
learned how to code I learned how to
code so that I could use the power of
coding to express my ideas and I was as
you may or may not know my first
business had nothing to do with
technology so it was a tool set for me
and it's a great tool set today just as
it was back then and I think actually
every business student everybody in
business should learn to code in fact I
was talking to a professor just last
week most earlier this week excuse me
and he teaches business entrepreneurship
is accelerating a college down in New
York I believe it is and he was saying
the same thing he said everybody should
learn at least the basics of coding HTML
CSS the little programming maybe
JavaScript maybe a little
PHP maybe server-side just a little bit
because it opens up your mind to how
software's put together how these
systems are put them together and
especially if your arch manorial this is
like a golden age if you will to be an
entrepreneur in the sense that you have
unlimited access to information
unlimited access to markets it's so easy
to get information now compared to what
it was free web it's unbelievable or
pre-google really and with social media
with sites like YouTube with Facebook
etc it's so easy to get access to a
large number of people this is
unprecedented in history hasn't happened
before so it's a great opportunity for
entrepreneurs
entrepreneurship to be able to fully
leverage all these tools all these great
things you really should know at least a
little bit about coding so that's why
this channel is about coding is about
business and to a certain extent it's
about the psychology all these things
because it all works together so whether
you want to be a professional developer
working for somebody you got a no code
you got no communication skills and
knowing a little bit of business would
help you as well because being able to
understand what the client's how the
clients think are gonna make you a more
effective developer you're gonna be able
to speak the clients language you can
understand their concerns which will
will allow you to build your apps and
your websites more effectively so there
you go I hope that answers that question
I had done a couple other vlogs on it
separately in terms of the English
language issue but I decided would be
better just to wrap it up in this
package here there you know cheers boys
