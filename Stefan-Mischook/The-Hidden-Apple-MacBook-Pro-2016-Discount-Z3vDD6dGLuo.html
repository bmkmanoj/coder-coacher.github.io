tech related but it can inform you in
tombs you in terms of your tech
decisions your tech line decisions I've
always favored quality over price and
what do I mean by that well what I've
discovered over the years no matter what
you're doing by attack you by a computer
to buy furniture buying cars or buying
clothes you're better to spend good
money on a high quality piece than to
buy three or four crappy versions of
whatever you just bought so let's talk
about a suit I remember years and years
ago I bought a very expensive suit for
me and it was a thousand bucks and
there's a lot of money for be at the
time and i bought it for business and
about it forward and i bought the suit
because a very wealthy mentor my told me
is that you if you buy a really high-end
suit you're going to have a high-end
suit from day one and because of high
end suit is made with superior materials
it will last a lot longer and two years
from now four years from now even five
years from now if you get a classic cut
it will look like a high-end suit
whereas you get a garbage suit and about
it will always look like a cheap suit
and within a year or so it's going to be
warned it's going to look like crap and
you can have to get a new suit so if you
can't afford it and when you can afford
it it's better to buy a higher and
quality suit that will last a long time
but always look really good right it
will always look like a hi im sue same
thing with cars when you could afford
saving with computers max get criticized
by a lot of people because they're
expensive and they are expensive you do
pay that Mac tax but there's a few
things well there's one major thing that
people don't consider is the high resale
value of an old Mac you don't have that
in the windows world it's very difficult
to get decent money for your secondhand
Windows machine but your secondhand Mac
you get a lot of money and in fact I've
done more
both times over the years I've been able
to easily resell my second hand Mac for
significant money typically about thirty
percent what originally paid for us if
you have a I have I just sold my old
macbook pro and I got it's a tool it's
2012 so it's four and a half year old
Mac and I keep getting my things it's
not a good shape and I got about thirty
five percent of a little more about
thirty five percent of what i paid for
it in 2012 so whatever you pay for and
I've done this consistently over a few
max about three or four of em five and I
can remember and some of my friends do
it it you know same thing with iphones
before I never had an iphone but save me
with iphones you get a lot of your money
back so when you're buying a mac
computer and you're looking at in your
you're going crazy about the price
because they do charge a premium keep it
in mind there's a long history with mac
computers that you will be able to sell
it back for a significant portion which
you paid for it so to be safe subtract
thirty percent off your buying price so
if you're looking at a mac or three
thousand dollars you go three thousand
dollars understand that you can probably
reduce that price because when you sell
it thirty percent less so it was thirty
percent of 3,000 its 900 bucks right
you're actually going to be really
paying for that mac 2,100 2,200 dollars
once you sell back your the mac that you
just bought so you get the idea so keep
that in mind that high resale value
actually reduces the actual purchase
price of your mac in the end and it's
not something i've done just once i've
done it multiple times so my friends do
it all the time same thing with the
iphones you buy an iphone very expensive
but there is an extremely high resale
value in these devices you got to factor
that in when you're looking at the price
if you're considering the price alright
that's about it i know this is going to
be controversy this
going to cause people to get angry I
don't know why these are tools like a
friend of mine is a plumber he's got
wrenches and screwdrivers and stuff and
he did the plumbers don't get into
fights over which wrench they use they
just this guy uses this wrench and I guy
uses that brand of wrenching so why are
you doing this with computers I don't
understand it's been going on forever
mac vs windows now Android versus iOS
now it's mac book pro 2015 vs macbook
pro 2016 people go I rating and get nuts
over it they're just machines man it's
just machines tools if you like max buy
it if you like Windows buy it I think
both are good i have both devices i have
my surface pro 4 which i think is a
fantastic computer and i also have a
macbook pro which i think is a very good
computer as well i have both because of
my particular needs you may not have
those needs most people don't but don't
you know whatever why would I why people
care about what might you know what I
use I don't know why makes people angry
it's weird anyway that's it but actually
I was lying before I know why people get
angry about mac vs windows and stuff
like that because people need to feel
justified in their choice especially
when they're buying I ticket items yeah
I saw that you know people by BMW Audi
or portion you know you get that same
type of behavior to a certain extent as
well in terms of all I think dowdy
suncor iving POWs are terrible whatever
that's what it is people just feel a
need to justify their purchases so they
get emotional you feel they have to
defend it and as a result if you have to
attack other people's choices at the end
of the day remember that everybody's got
their own particular needs right just
because somebody prefers hamburgers the
chicken doesn't make your choice of of
chicken this is a terrible analogy so
I'm going to stop there i hope you
the point though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
