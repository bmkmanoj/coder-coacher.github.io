looking at instant payment notification
using PayPal and the PayPal sandbox and
of course you can just pour it all of
this stuff over to your production
system when you're done your development
and I'd also like to remind you that
this is for a very simple PayPal Sanna
PayPal shopping cart and there are more
complex shopping carts and solutions
available to you however if you're gonna
be doing that I would suggest that you
look at something like OS commerce or
Zen cart which is free and it's much
more feature-rich than what we developed
today however what we developed today is
nice because it's simple and we got to
do some object oriented programming and
we got to explore sort of some of the
PayPal API at with relative simplicity
so here's the PayPal sandbox again the
instant payment notification simulator
or the ipn is basically a tool that is
used to simulate what happens when a
transaction goes through so you can
enable this as a merchant by logging in
to the merchants I as a merchant now I'm
just gonna go there so let's go to test
accounts and will enter the sandbox site
as a seller same password and kind of
buried in the cellar page under your
edit profile if you click here you'll
see that you've got instant payment
notification preferences so I've set
this up to hit a page call Jonathan so
let's see a forward slash PayPal /ip and
PHP and you can set this up to any URL
and what this means is that as soon as
the transaction goes through it's going
to hit this page and it's going to post
back a whole bunch of variables and this
is really helpful if you want to store
your own data or for example if you want
to check for
fraud and you want to compare the data
that you're getting on one side which is
in your shopping cart to the data that
you're receiving on the other before
actually shipping the item or before
actually accepting the payment from the
buyer so let's set that up what we're
gonna do is we're going to use the test
tools in the sandbox and there's an
instant payment notification simulator
here
so what we're going to do is we're just
gonna say a cart checkout is the
transaction type and you'll notice that
we have all these different variables
that start popping up here and we can
actually access all of this as part of
what the ipn what the instant payment
notification that PayPal does will be
sending this all this information will
get sent from PayPal to whatever URL
that we want it to post to so what I'm
gonna do is I've logged in to my FTP and
I'm just gonna go to my John Lebanon so
let's say now you can do this with any
text editor I'm just using BBEdit
but you can also use text wrangler on
the Mac or cyberduck with just the basic
text edit program that comes with your
Mac and we're gonna go to PayPal and
I've already started working on this
I'll just quickly show you what I've got
here and you can of course take this a
step further so I've got a file called
payments dot log we basically pick up a
file handler which opens the file and
you'll notice here that I've got I'm
basically just creating a line an entry
in my log so I've got request payment
status request payment date request pay
your email shipping MC shipping and
subtotal and see gross and then I write
that to my file and then I close it and
so what I can do here is I can tell
PayPal to PayPal IPM dot PHP
and then if I hit send ipn what'll
happen is that it just pings this
particular URL and this is what it does
every single time as long as you set it
up you a transaction occurs and you
could have it send an email from here or
you could just have it write to a file
or you could do any kind of logging that
you feel is needed for your accounting
purposes so the end result of that is
that it's written to this payment log
file so I'm gonna open that very quickly
and you'll see that PayPal has completed
at the time buyer at PayPal sandbox com
shipping $3 and 2 cents and subtotal is
$15 and 34 cents and before that you saw
that I have one from one of the buyers
that I already said setup so this is
just something for you to take a look at
and play with and hopefully you can
extend this and build whatever kind of
shopping cart you need for your purposes
thanks a lot for listening I'm John
Levin sold and I hope this series was
helpful you can email me at John at

questions thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
