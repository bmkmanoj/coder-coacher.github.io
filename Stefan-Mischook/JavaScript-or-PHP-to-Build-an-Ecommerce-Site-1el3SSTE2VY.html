answer some Instagram questions that
were put to me fairly recently alright
let's get to it
hi Stefan if I were to build a platform
like Amazon in 2018 ecommerce website
and a mobile application for it which
language have a better future
which language has a better future I
think he meant to say do I go with
JavaScript angular and react or react
do I go cross platform for mobile and
desktop so many questions as
possibilities right now thanks in
advance so there's a bunch of things
here first of all you want to create an
e-commerce site which has a better
future I think that you're gonna see
that the two platforms if you will over
the two languages that are going to be
here for a long time socially for small
and medium-sized businesses it's gonna
be the JavaScript stack whether you go
react angular and node or the PHP stack
whether you know PHP laravel is probably
your best choice which one you choose
that's is up to you I think JavaScript
server-side deployments if you will
server-side the tools are becoming
better and better and better over time
more and more refined but it's still a
little messy compared to PHP simply
because PHP is far more mature
javascript is here to stay because it's
so popular and so is PHP it's here to
stay because it's so popular
PHP by far by the way it's still the
most widely used server-side programming
language and that ensures its longevity
for many years to come now in terms of
creating mobile applications especially
for a store I would not be creating
native apps really you could do it with
responsive websites this is not like
you're building a game it requires heavy
duty processing and I would just create
a responsive website if you wanted to do
native apps for mobile then I would
probably look to PhoneGap or Wii
act native in that situation this way
you don't have to create a version for
iOS and a version for Android you don't
want to have to mean to maintain two
code bases but since it's a brand-new
project this is where my business mind
comes into play I would build it as a
responsive website for now and see if
you get any traction with your
e-commerce site and then if you do get a
lot of traction then you may want to go
to react now here's the thing people are
loath to download they don't want to
download some random app especially
carvers app onto their phone I don't I
rather just have a responsive website
this is not the same thing if you had
some sort of game that required the
horsepower of a native app then and if
the game is compelling enough then they
might download it but to download a
mobile application for just for an
e-commerce site I'm not sure if that
would make any sense
so very avid that's to answer a question
number one actually you know what
there's a little question number two
just so I can keep these videos more
subject specific just like when you're
writing code you don't want to have huge
objects that do 20 different things you
want to keep your objects fine-grained
very specific to a particular task it
had just like this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
