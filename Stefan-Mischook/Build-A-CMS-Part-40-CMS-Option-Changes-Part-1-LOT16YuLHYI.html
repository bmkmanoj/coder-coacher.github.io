couple videos I'd like to talk about
extending the content management system
a bit one of the things that I think is
pretty important for all content
management systems is that they usually
have some sort of interface for setting
various options within the system so the
main task that I'm going to focus on in
the next couple videos is building out a
basic framework that will allow you to
easily add pages to this application and
i'm not talking about content pages like
this website here but various settings
within the content management system
itself and secondly i'm in addition to
that i'd like to also build out some
sort of basic change password form that
allows the administrative user to easily
change their own password before I dive
into those changes however I wanted to
make two quick comments the first is in
ie8 fix I've uploaded the files from
videos one through 39 up on my server
and I was doing a little bit of cross
browser checking just to make sure
everything's working properly and I
noticed that if you log into the admin
and open up with what you see is what
you get filled with in ie8 you're going
to get this vertical scrollbar here it's
very minor only seems like there are a
couple pixels that are the issue and I
believe I've tracked it the issue down
to the fact that there are borders on
this editable area that aren't for some
reason taken into account so the way I
can fix this is I go open up coda here
and I need you to edit FP n 2 square
style.css which is within app resources
CSS and if you go down to the bottom
here and change the text area with the
class of what you see is what you get to
height of 30 to add an additional 2
pixels there and save this file that IE
8 issue should go away
so let me just refresh the page make
sure everything is good and there you go
you notice the school by disappeared so
I just like keeping track of minor
cross-browser issues as I go so i
thought i'd point that out and the
second thing I go to Firefox here is
that color box was recently updated to
1.3 point 17 and the new version of
color box has a couple additional
features that we're going to be using in
the next few videos and it's added some
additional properties that I'd like to
use so I need you to go to color
powercom / color box and make sure you
download the most recent version of the
files so if i open up coda here the file
that you're going to have to replace it
with in-app resources javascript color
box and you'll need to replace color box
j/s with the most recent version of that
file now that I've updated my local copy
of color box is with the file downloaded
from the color box website let me move
forward and start actually demonstrating
functionality I wanted to build out
today so what you see here is the
current content management system and up
here in the top corner we have a
settings link which currently links out
to a separate page and I had originally
built this page out the demonstration of
how to password protect pages within the
content management system so that
outside users users who own login to the
system can't access them but I'd like to
do something a little bit different here
I talked about in previous videos how I
wanted to build content management
system that felt like it was embedded
within the actual website I don't want
it to feel like a separate standalone
application so to that end I want our
setting this link to actually pop up in
a large modal window here and because
obviously a content management system
may have multiple settings pages and we
obviously want to keep the back end of
the website nicely organized
I want to have a navigation element on
our settings pages that allows the user
to navigate easily and to that end I
can't use our Ajax powered pop-up window
here if you remember from previous
videos this content here is actually
grabbed using Ajax displays directly in
the page but what we need to do for our
settings section is we actually need to
use an iPhone because I want users to be
able to navigate within this window and
basically this can only represent one
page and for example if I hit submit or
I try to change the page it's going to
change the entire page not just the
modal window so an iframe will allow me
to navigate within the content
management system settings section and
not change the main page at the user is
on so probably the first step in what we
need to do is I want to update these
links so I'm going to open up which once
an app for templates and I open up t
under square root toolbar PHP and let's
edit this so this is fine rather than
linking out to settings dot PHP I'm
going to link out to dashboard folder
and specifically index dot PHP and I'm
going to name settings to CMS dashboard
because basically the dashboard is going
to be the homepage of the content
management systems settings section I'm
not going to build out any fancy
functionality into it I'll leave that up
to you but obviously you could use this
page to indicate you know recent changes
to the content management system may be
quick links to get to certain sections
at the website or to do certain tasks
so what we have here is we have a link
to the content management system
dashboard and I'm going to copy these
dividers here and i want to add an
additional link and in this case i'm
going to make this a change password
link and then i'll paste in our divider
and let's update this link so i'm going
echo out the site path whoopsie and app
I'm going to link out to a settings
folder and password dot PHP so let's
save this file join a quick test there
we go and next thing we need to do is we
actually need to have these links when
clicked pop up in a modal window and to
do that I'm going to edit t under square
head without PHP and I can add a bit of
additional JavaScript here i'm going to
copy this section paste it down below
and we are going to target elements that
have a class of fpm to square dashboard
and FP underscore password and we
actually need to set those within our
toolbar so on our linked the CMS
dashboard I can add a class and that
class is going to be FP into square
dashboard and same things with the
change password link except this time
we're going to do FP and your square
password okay so go back to TN just go
ahead most of this stuff is good i think
i'm going to remove or i'll set these
two true the escape key and the overlay
close options and I've set these two
false on our edit modal pop-ups because
i've had issues in the past working with
similar content management systems if
you accidentally click outside of the
Edit window maybe just a stray click you
don't even think about it and it closes
the window and you lose all your edits
so I want to make sure that you can't
easily close these boxes without
specifically clicking on a link and
saying you know cancel or save my
changes or whatever but it's less of an
issue here so I'm going to allow the
user to close this popup window by
either hitting the Escape key or by
clicking outside that modal window and I
want to add a couple additional options
first one is going to be iframe and
that's going to be too true and this
allows the pop-up window to display
using an iframe rather than Ajax and now
i'm going to use the top setting which
is something new with the most recent
version of color box and i'm going to
set that to 28 pixels and that's going
to display the color box rather than at
the immediate top of the page just
slightly excuse me the default will
display in the center of the page but I
want to have it display
I near the top just below a content
management system toolbar so that's why
I've chosen 28 pixels there i'm going to
set a width and that's going to be 940
pixels i'm going to set a height and i
think i'm going to set it to eighty
percent just so it spans most of the
page and what should work well for all
sorts of screen resolutions and i think
that'll be it for now so that's that so
let me save that let's go to our test
page here refresh obviously doesn't work
yet you haven't set these pages up but
we'll get to that in the next video and
you do notice that at least for the
moment both of these pages do try to
load a pop-up window so we know that
javascript functionality is working
correctly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
