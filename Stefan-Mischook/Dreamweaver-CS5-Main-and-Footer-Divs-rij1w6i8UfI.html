navigation div in here and what we want
to do is to create another dip that goes
right next to it and this div will call
main so you could put your cursor right
here or notice I'm going to put it right
in my code and I'm just going to tell my
code where I want to insert it right
here so i will now come and insert a new
div tag just by coming up here to the
common inserts and will create a new CSS
rule by going to not tag excuse me but
rather ID and we'll start with the pound
symbol once again and we'll call this
one main so style dot CSS the external
click OK what are we going to do with
main well let's go to box since the nav
section is 200 we could say i want the
main section to actually be whatever is
left over so that's why i said ok we got
the wrapper at 902 over there that
leaves us 700 pixels on the right-hand
side now no height values ever defined
here and we're going to float this one
on the right hand side just as we
floated the other one on the left other
thing I want to do is to just wow let's
give it a different background color or
something that will contrast with the
blue and I'll just click ok and as you
can see now content for ID main goes
here and if you just preview this in
your browser we can see that we now have
two columns of information doesn't that
look great well at this point what we're
going to be doing is adding a little bit
of content in here and then finally
adding a footer to the bottom of our
website notice one other thing I had
given my background my wrapper a
background color and when I did give it
that background color we saw it
initially but then when we put in the
headline while we didn't see anything
there and as soon as I put in the nav
here and the content here we should be
expecting to see that background color
for the wrapper in other words you know
if the wrapper contains everything in
here then this should be the box which
is about this big
and this one's shorter so I should be
able to see the rapper right here I
don't however and remember you will not
be able to see that rappers background
color or background image for that
matter until you actually enter in the
information for your footer once the
footers in place then we'll see the
background color and you'll see it
because I made it different from my nav
so we'll really get a sense of what it
looks like in the meantime however let's
grab some Latin texts so I'm just going
to go to Li p.s um calm in my browser
lip some calm and we will generate lorem
ipsum text and now i'm going to select
you know three paragraphs of text here
i'll quit the browser i don't need it
and check it out i'm going to ask you to
do this inside of your design view so
here's my design view i'm going to
select the text that's here and command
V or you can right-click and paste it in
and notice why did I do it in the design
view specifically so that when you paste
it in if you pasted it inside of your
area here your code view then it would
not have been formatted with paragraph
so you see that every paragraph is still
there formatted nicely so that's great
however let's do a couple of other
things for example i'm going to
introduce a little bit of headline here
so let's say exciting headline and we'll
turn this into a h1 all right now what
I'm going to do is just to enter in
another space and remember when you
enter the way I've done here creates a
new paragraph right so I'm going to
select this paragraph and we'll turn a
couple lines into h2 tags right so for
example I could come here I could just
press Enter which makes this be on a
separate line and that's a paragraph
which I will turn into a h2 great now
we've also got some text in here we're
not going to style that text just yet
we'll come back and do that in another
video but as you can see when you ever
you add
content in here stretches out the area
here that we've defined as our main text
don't worry if the text and that is
touching the edges of the boxes we're
going to deal with that at another time
but notice even though this box
stretched out and this one is smaller I
still can't see that background image
why is it because now we're going to
introduce the element that we will allow
us to see this and that's a footer
something that will be at the bottom of
this website if this was my header will
have something down at the bottom acting
as our footer so I'll quit this and
let's clean up our code first of all so
that we can work with this I'm going to
switch to the split-screen code view and
notice this here is the closing div see
how they get confusing div div which one
belongs to Maine which one belongs to
rapper well that's why I put in this
point here so at the closing give I'm
going to add a HTML comment that says
ends main and also another thing that we
can do to make our text a little easier
to navigate the last paragraph all the
way up to the h1 inside of main i'm
going to select all of that and then
I'll collapse it the reason I'm
collapsing it is so that now I can go
into my code view and we can just
separate things like this making it a
lot easier for me to read as splash alee
when I'm in my split screen view so look
I've got this little section here for
the header this little section here for
nav this little section here for Maine
and there's the closing do for the
rapper now we're going to just position
our cursor right here in our code and we
will introduce our final div which is
our footer div so let's create a new CSS
rule the ID will be pound symbol footer
and we'll click ok and what are we going
to do with the footer well it's the same
thing like the header you don't really
even need to specify the width I'm just
going to specify a height value will
make it like 50 less than the top header
was do we need to float it no but I
could leave it like this and you'll see
what's happening if I just click ok you
don't have to do this but I'm just doing
it quickly and notice things are really
kind of messed up
and that's purposely done so that you
could see what's happening here well
notice what happened my footer which I
wanted underneath both of these sort of
gets pushed up into the space under the
nav that's really kind of bad not at all
what I wanted so how do we sort of fix
that well we could double-click on
footer or you could also click on the
little edit our pencil icon right here
and here's the difference we need it to
not float but we need it to clear both
which means always be at the bottom of
both of those two dibs on top of you so
that's what's happening here we're
clearing both and now if we take a look
at this and preview it in Safari among
other things we could see that up
there's an area down here however I'm
going to ask you let's go back we'll do
another edit and we will just add a
background color so try to get the same
background color as your header and
that's going to add some level of
consistency I imagine and let me just
see ya 0 69 for my header 0 69 for my
footer so let's preview this now and
we'll look a little bit better so
there's your header there's your footer
as you can see we've split up the page
into four different areas of content and
notice as soon as I put in the header
now we see that background color from
the specific wrapper so that's showing
us how we can put together the very
simple navigational area that we see
here in a design perspective with a two
column layout header and footer however
when we come back we're going to start
styling the text that's in here it is a
little bit different from what we saw in
the previous examples but not too
different so it shouldn't be very
difficult for you to grasp so come back
and we'll start styling this text making
it look a lot better and we will also be
creating some vertical navigation as
opposed to the horizontal navigation we
had last time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
