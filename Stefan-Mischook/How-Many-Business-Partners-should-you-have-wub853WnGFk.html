vlog this is not about code is about
business so if you're not into business
or starting a small business or starting
a business then you probably want to
skip to the next video
all right so what I'm going to discuss
here is the advantages of having through
two partners or having a business with
three partners total versus having a
business which is one one partner where
you have one partner or if you're on
your own there are pros and cons to
everything but I think if you're going
to have partners your optimum partner
count in a business is 3 why is the
optimum 3 because 3 can break a
tie-break so if you have two partners
and you make right into an argument a
dispute over something who knows what it
is but you could run into that so you
have two partners you could run into
this dispute and you can basically hit a
brick wall because you reach have 5050
typically and so nothing gets done so
you can have huge matches and problems
and so what a third partner can do is
that they could break that tie break
they can go in there and sigh with one
guy or group or the other so things can
move on there are pros and cons to that
but you know there's something we said
about that another aspect about the
third partner is that if you have a
third silent partner who is there to
oversee operations of things and maybe
somebody who can make sure that water
partners doesn't get a little too how
shall we say it wet and wild with the
cash you see that sometimes I've
actually seen a firsthand where you have
partners who decide that they're going
to start spending money here and
spending money there and on this and on
that and sometimes would be very
difficult to block it but if you have
three partners involved in the business
what two partners have to sign off on
any major purchases like over a major
anything over X amount of dollars you
have to set that dollar amount
that could be very good as well again
having that third partner can be a check
if you will in the company check to a
partner who may be causing trouble etc
etc etc and that's that's pretty much my
take on that over you know from my
experience over the last 28 years I used
to not think that way when I was younger
and less mature I figured I all you want
is one partner you don't want to make
sure you want to make sure that you know
people can't do anything unless you
agree to it and you know meaning if you
own 50% and you know the ones the other
50% they can't do anything unless you
agree and as it could be good in certain
circumstances I suppose at the end of
the day for my experience you know
practicality yeah actually business you
have two partners three partners in a
company you're in a good position
another good thing about that is that
you can spread out the work and the cost
over across three people so that really
lessens the financial and the time or
burden in terms of business and also
with that third partner you're bringing
in even more skill sets so ideally with
your partners they should have
complementary skills skills that you
don't have so that you can bring more to
the to business in terms of skills the
more skills that the partners have the
less likely to even have to hire early
on in the game you see when you first
starting a business you know unless
you're backed by big money you're going
to have tight tight cash not too much
cash so if you have a lot of skills and
yet extra partner can bring in those
skills that could save you a lot of
money and expense and give you more
runtime because reality is of building a
brand new business you rarely ever know
what's going to really work until you
actually get into it so you need that
long runway if you will to be able to
figure out what the exact business model
is going to be that's going to earn you
money so a third partner again can help
in that respect because of cash because
the skills that can maybe
tribute and time to the endeavor in
question so there you go my choice
ideally is to have three partners within
a business and of course if you do have
a business I can't speak for the entire
world but generally speaking if you have
three partners you want to have a
corporation of some sort so that you're
not liable for the activities of your
partners
you know only you know the business
itself is self-contained it protects
your own personal assets I'm not going
to get into here because it's not
appropriate for blog to get into details
at the end of the day you want to make
sure that the business activities do not
impact your own personal assets your
house your savings etc in a negative way
meaning if the company gets sued you
don't want to be sued for the company
goes bankrupt you don't want to go
bankrupt personally and a corporation
will protect you from that and a
corporation else will protect you from
your partner's activities because
sometimes partners can go off and do
some silly things and spend all kinds of
money and get themselves in trouble
and if you're in a partnership at legal
partnership at least in Canada I imagine
many other parts of world when you're in
a partnership as opposed to a
corporation you are fully liable for the
activities of your partner so if they go
out and run up a huge debt on the
company's name and your partner with
them and heat in the company has to come
up with a huge amount of money even
though he ran up the bill doesn't matter
because your partner's you're fully
liable for whatever heals and I
experienced that firsthand
so partnerships are evil in the legal
terms but having three partners in a
business is the ideal partner mix in my
opinion you have more than three you
have too many too many chefs in the
kitchen nothing gets done free will do
it though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
