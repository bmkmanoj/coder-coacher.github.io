bit about working with radio buttons and
what we saw in that last video was the
fact that you really only had one option
to choose from in a radio box scenario
however there are other things that we
can do so for example I switch back to
where we are right here inside of our
text editor one more time let's look at
some of the other options and what if
you had more than one choice we would be
using something like a checkbox so
remember checkboxes are used when you
want the user to select one or more
options of a limited number of choices
so again we have our form let's write in
something a little bit more indicative
of some of the choices right so you
could say something like I like let's
say oranges we're asking our end user
exactly what kind of fruit they like
let's say for example and in the type
area here we're going to define not a
radio box this time but rather a
checkbox once we've got the check box in
place we're going to say well what's the
name here well all of these things are
going to be related to well let's say
fruit and what kind of fruit people like
so the value of this particular one that
I'm going to say here is oranges now
once we've indicated that we have our
oranges in place I don't really need
this mail from the last one notice I do
still have a br tag I just want to you
know separate these logically with a
simple line break well what about
somebody who doesn't like orange is
perhaps they like something else so I'll
say I like kiwi and in here we will
again here I'll just double click this
and we'll copy that command or ctrl C
command ctrl V to paste that in and
again
we're going to say that the name of this
entire check box area here is defined as
fruit and the value will be key we all
right and this thing probably needs
since i'm going to introduce three of
these i'm also going to say BR and we'll
separate this in this fashion and then i
will just come in here with my for my
last one and i'll say i like apples now
since we don't have the input that we
had at the last point i'm just going to
copy this put it in here control C or
command C depending on your platform and
command V or commit our control V if
you're on a Mac or a PC and as you can
see we've got the check box again the
name has been defined as fruit and the
value here will be apples or just apple
should be fine i guess we don't really
need a br at the end here but you know
eventually we'll introduce some things
when we need them as we go along so as
you can see it's time for us to file
save our file and we're just going to
switch on over to firefox as we saw
before and check it out now we have some
simple messages i like oranges I like
kiwi I like apples and what you'll be
able to see is that the person on the
other end of your HTML page when they're
online can choose one or none of these
as they go along so it's a great little
form element that we've introduced here
to our particular form it allows us for
multiple or varied choices and will
oftentimes be a great way for you to
gain insightful information about your
end users so that's a little bit more
about working with checkboxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
