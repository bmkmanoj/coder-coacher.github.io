since been our chance to do a vlog and
I've just been really busy with work the
day jobs taking up all my time it's now
September and this is really my favorite
time of the year I just like the
temperature is great climate is going
great for me up here in my shell not too
hot not too cold it's a good day to get
out take some Sun relax
elbows go for it and yeah so if you
haven't get up stretch a little bit do
five push-ups do some stretches do both
splits you do that every day and maybe a
couple of chin-ups you be in tip-top
shape because sitting all day as a nerd
not good for your body not good for your
body at all so it's good to get up do a
little bit of exercise so yeah it was
getting a little noisy out there decided
to bring it back inside so I was doing
some reading recently and apparently
python has like shot up the charts in
terms of its popularity on Stack
Overflow if you don't know what that is
it's the biggest site in terms of
answering your code questions and I'm
not surprised because Python is such a
flexible language in terms of its use
case so I'll translate that into non
nerd that means that pythons use in many
different areas so let's compare that to
let's say the once upon a time language
oh darling language of the hipster nerds
and that was Ruby combined with the Ruby
framework called Rails web a framework
once upon a time this was like so cool
and hipster and cool and everybody but
the thing is is that Ruby never took off
in any other directions for a little
while it had some mojo with regards to
web app creation and but it's now fading
quite fast because all the new hipsters
new hipster nerds have moved into
JavaScript and know that's what they
love and rails kind of olds
and the problem that ruby has is that
that's all it does you know it could be
used to do all kinds of different things
I'm sure but really in the marketplace
if you're writing a ruby you're writing
rails apps web apps but Python on the
other hand you can do web apps you can
do server processes and automation you
can do data sciences you can do ml and
AI machine learning AI you can do web
apps it's very very flexible and so I'm
not surprised at all that you see Python
growing and growing in popularity also
pythons use quite a bit in schools
because the interesting thing about the
Python program programming language
though it has a very simple to
understand syntax it's really sin taxes
a new word Florida code that you
actually write it's it looks simpler and
it reads simpler than other languages
like JavaScript or Java or C sharp or
PHP so it's a good first language to
learn in that regard also Python does
not skimp on its capabilities or its
sophistication though it has a very
simple to recode it has very
sophisticated concepts it expressed in
the language itself and as I keep saying
to people the difference between a
professional developer and the amateur
is that the professional developer has a
really good understanding of the core
concepts of programming regardless of
the language and once you have that
solid foundation at core then for you to
be able to learn this framework or bad
framework or this type of Python
programming that that type of Python
programming will become super super easy
so you know to address that whole to
address that situation rather I created
my Python course to really teach the
foundation to teach the core then all
those YouTube walkthrough videos that
you can understand now on Python all
those online articles you see about
Python how to do this how to do that
although all some of those things become
super easy to understand and to do
because you have that foundation that's
something I discovered years and years
ago in the 90s when I was try
to learn I forget what the language I
think was like what I was getting into
JavaScript in fact and I was having
trouble writing some of the code and I
found that my problem was not
understanding a framework or not
understanding a library the problem was
not understanding some fundamental
concept in which library was based upon
and because they didn't understand that
concept clearly that library was very
difficult to get my head wrapped around
so when I went back and worked on the
foundation the core concepts the core
aspects of the language then also that
framework that library was very
understandable and that's the key to
everything it's kind of funny because
it's the same thing with drumming it's
the same thing with martial arts etc etc
I'll give you an example in martial arts
when I was younger I remember was there
was something magical martial arts I
started almost 10 and it was almost like
voodoo the way some people the way that
people would kick or take people down to
flippin the throwing rocks etc etc
submissions this was all voodoo to me it
was kind of magical but as they became
more and more advanced it became less
magical because I started understanding
what actually was going on and then I
was able to reduce it down to its very
basic form so also 20 different locks
actually only became one lakh twenty
different takedowns or he became really
two takedowns now if you've done
advanced martial arts you know exactly
what I mean what I'm trying to say is
that we had like 20 different types of
submissions for instance but at the end
of the day it only came down to one or
two moves that are just executed in a
slightly different way and you see that
with programming as well you see a bunch
of different frameworks and you see
basic concepts executed in a slightly
different way that may expedite a
certain type of project expedite means
get to the end if you will to get it
done faster anyhow I'm going off on a
tangent so python is really
growing and will continue to grow
because AI and machine learning is just
starting and it's funny a lot of the
JavaScript people are going into
JavaScript because they want to do
JavaScript on a client meaning in the
web browser and you want to do
JavaScript on the server knows it they
argue wow you just need to learn one
language well that's cool but with with
Python you could do web apps you could
do AI you can do machine learning you
can do software or server automation and
processing you could do data science you
could do easy web scraping it's all
kinds of stuff you could do with it
the downside to Python because every
nothing's perfect there's always a
downside everything is going to up and
down the downside to Python is that it
it's kind of slow at runtime it isn't
the fastest that's for sure like in
terms of server operations if you
developed an app a web app in Python
versus PHP PHP will run circles around
it but PHP oh it's pretty much good for
you know in terms of commercial purposes
is you know web app creation but to me
it's the King to me and it's much much
faster at runtime meaning when you run
the code it's much much faster it takes
much much less memory much less ram
memory ram same thing much less CPU to
get the same job done but PHP is very
specialized what it does so pythons
slowness is made up for its flexibility
and it's and it's easy to read syntax
these days computers and servers are so
fast though this speed issue is really
99% of time not an issue that's why more
and more companies are adopting Python
and it's a great Avenue it's a great
language to learn that's why I just put
out a course on Python and it teaches
that solid core but I talked about but
what I'm going to do because of popular
demand I'm actually I had two modules to
the course and I'm going to hopefully
when I get it done this week assuming
that my day job doesn't take up
all my time as it sometimes does my day
job by the way is helping schools teach
code but anyway yes with the Python I'm
going to add a module on careers in
Python I'm going to look at the three
career paths that you can pursue in
Python the pros and cons of each and how
you would prepare yourself and map
yourself and excuse me I would point
away to each of these paths and I think
that will be very valuable to people and
finally what I'm going to do is I'm
going to point out some really
interesting resources extended learning
if you will from pipe in Python but
you'll find out there that's free some
not free and in books and again because
just like I learned from my martial arts
it's it's you know it's good to learn
from multiple sources to get different
points of view get different takes in
terms of other technology to me martial
arts were just different fighting
technologies so even in boxing I saw a
couple different people in different
types of cooked food different people
different types of Judo even though judo
judo judo but different teachers have
different takes on things so having been
taught judo by a few different teachers
was beneficial because I was able to get
everybody's point of view etc etc etc so
you may think I have the best Python
course ever created but I still say
after you've done it and you've got that
foundation even the lousy Python courses
where they walk you through stuff which
most of the pipe of courses are just
walk through is really they don't they
leave a lot of holes and what they're
teaching because most of these people
are not teachers yeah even those courses
will become valuable to you or useful to
you because once you have that
foundation where you understand the core
principles then to learn anything else
as I said is a it's super fast super
easy anyway that's it and that business
stuff I talked about previously I am
going to address it my apologies like I
said we have a bunch of new schools that
we had to unboard over the last couple
weeks I took up all my time so I wasn't
able to well I was able to do a couple
but I wasn't able to really interest
that particular thing I will soon ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
