Chuck with killer sights calm killer PHP
calm CSS tutorial Wow bunch of sites in
this quick little video I'm going to
answer a question that was recently put
to me and the question is what is the
difference between a graphic designer
and a web designer and what profession
should I choose I can see why people
would get confused between graphic
designers and web designers because on
the surface and in in certain respects
they do do similar work both
professionals have to create nice
looking designs nice-looking layouts the
fundamental difference though it comes
down to that graphic designers are
typically designing for print things
that will be printed newspapers
magazines cd-rom covers brochures that
sort of thing whereas web designers of
course are designing for the web where
these professions diverge in an even
bigger way is in that web designers have
much more to do besides making the page
look good graphic designers essentially
they make the page look good pleasing to
the eye and they have to prepare the
layouts that they produce so that their
printer ready or printer-friendly
printers you know those machines that
print you know print those brochures etc
they need you know they they have have
files sent to them in a particular way I
actually have a certificate and graphic
design and printed all the type of stuff
I can run presses so I have a pretty
good idea of what this is all about what
designers don't have to concern
themselves with print but they have a
whole slew of other things that they
have to concern yourselves with for
instance not only do web designers have
to make the pages look good the pages
actually have to be they have to work
well as well in
they have to load into the browsers
properly quickly also the pages have to
be designed so that they're very usable
user friendly actually there's a whole
specialization in web design called
usability and there are web
professionals that just do that they
look at websites and they make sure that
their design is structured so that
they're very user friendly and this is
very very important in terms of the
success or failure of a website
another thing that web designers have to
understand is proper site structure
things have to be and not just site
structure actually but page structure
things have to be set up and structured
properly in the code and in the way the
website and is in the way that the
website is structured so that the
website is easy to update and easy to
maintain there's a whole bunch of other
things that web designers have to
understand and know that has nothing to
do with graphic design and I kid
depending on the site I can argue that
in web design the graphic design aspect
of it may be depending on the site maybe
25% 30% of the job or less so what you
see in terms of web design looking at it
from a layman's perspective you know
from from the perspective of somebody
hasn't done him you just see the design
aspect of a visual aspect there's a lot
of stuff going on behind the scenes that
are very very important to the game so
the second part of this little video was
the question on what profession should
you choose what's the better one it
comes down to two things in my opinion
number one where do your strange lie are
you inclined to be a really good
designer do you have the designers eye
if you will you see
design like a lot of other skill sets
like you know
natural athletic talent natural musical
talent design is something that you have
you you would have had it at a very
young age and if you're gifted you have
that designer's eye that ability to know
when a when a a page or a brochure or
any type of you know layout looks good
you you know you you'll know this
instinctively if you don't have this
skill set then you definitely don't want
to get into graphic design because in
graphic design it's pretty much all
about how well you can make it you know
how well you can land a page or how long
how well you can layout something well
you can design something whereas in web
design it's such a broad profession that
you even if you are not a great designer
you could find yourself doing very well
as a web designer or web programmer you
can become a usability expert you can
become what I call a web monkey a
mechanic somebody who goes in there make
sure that the structure on the site and
pages are properly done you can become a
search engine optimization expert I
didn't get into that before but it's
against another web design
specialization all these things where
programmer all these things have nothing
to do with actual design the aesthetic
aspect of it so number one when you're
considering whether it become a graphic
designer web designer besides which you
know what you might like to do you have
to look at your skill sets if your
design talented then you can look at
graphic design if you're not don't even
look at it
it's time to go to web design now let me
just say just because you design
talented it doesn't mean you should
become a graphic designer
I would actually argue that you should
go into web design let me explain why
number reason number two but I think
that web design is probably a better
choice is because web design is a
growing business is a growing industry I
don't have any specific data points the
site but I just look out there
and I see what's going on and it's
pretty clear to me look at magazines
major magazines are folding meaning
going bankrupt or they're shrinking in
size newspapers are going bankrupt all
the time
CD music sales are dropping off the face
of the earth they they've dropped 50% in
the last decade these are all things
that graphic designers would be involved
with and since their song hell there's
less and less of these things you would
imagine this would be less and less
demand for graphic designers don't get
me wrong there's always going to be a
demand for graphic designers but it's
diminishing and where this traditional
media print media you know magazine etc
where this stuff is diminishing it's
diminishing because it's going to the
web so that sort of makes sense there if
you go into graphic design as a
profession you will at some point or
another find yourself getting into web
design that I can guarantee the problem
is is that Web Design today as I
mentioned before is much more
sophisticated than it used to be and
when graphic designers drove it to web
design they're gonna have problems
designing actually good good sites they
could design probably good looking sites
but most of time they won't be usable
they will be functional it won't be
search engine friendly and fact that
matter is graphic designers of Germans
of web design unless they train
themselves and all these other skill
sets they usually turn out crappy
looking websites so for me although I'm
pretty biased I saw the writing on the
wall back in nineteen you know mid 90s
and I concentrated my efforts on the web
as opposed to the print business because
that's where I think it's going it's
accelerating so if you're making that
choice between a graphic designer web
designer and personally I would advise
web design whether or not you have
talent that said if you're really good
designer you will get work in graphic
design and it could be a great career as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
