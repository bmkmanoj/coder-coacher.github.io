creating a brand new file inside
Photoshop and we also talked about what
was going on inside of our Photoshop
environment however what I want to talk
to you now is is how to open up some
files and as you can see there's a
number of different ways that we can
actually do that for example we can just
come to file open if you're following
along with me you can take the source
files that I've provided for you and
they contain a number of images inside
of an images folder and as you can see
here they're very simple number of
images these are all images which belong
in the public domain and hence you'll
see some of them that are older some of
them that are a little bit newer but
they're all public domain images so
they're free to use and as you can see
we can certainly click on these images
and have a little preview here that's
working inside of the Macintosh
environment however even if you were on
a PC environment you'll be able to see
that but notice these are just for
images they don't really say anything
about the files themselves for example
this is a JPEG if I had an AI file an
adobe illustrator file or if I had a PSD
file a Photoshop document we wouldn't be
able to see the preview until we
actually open up the file so there's a
couple of things that we can do to open
up images this is one way but certainly
if I wanted to I could also explore some
other ways of doing this for example I
could open up Adobe bridge and as you
can see here it says browse in bridge
notice also that if you're working
inside a Photoshop there's a little
button here that says launch bridge and
there's also another one here that says
launch mini bridge as well as over here
there's a little mini bridge button also
and if we were to access any of these I
could click on browse for files just
like this you'll notice what it's doing
its opening up Adobe bridge and if I
were to look at the open files that I
have
here you'll see that Adobe bridge is one
of the open files so whether you open up
Adobe bridge as a separate file or
whether you're working inside of bridge
itself the mini bridge these are all
different ways that you can view an open
up files for example i'm just going to
launch bridge and here is Adobe bridge
cs5 and it's a really nice application
that allows you to work with different
documents and work with different files
for example if we went to our desktop
you would see our source files inside of
the images folder and what you may
notice here is the simple fact that we
have a number of these images available
as you can also see I can scroll down at
the bottom here to make these images be
larger or smaller depending on what I
want to be looking at you'll also notice
that there's a thumbnail grid that you
can click on there's also this area here
where you're viewing things as
thumbnails that's default you can view
content details if you wish and notice I
can make this a lot smaller so that we
can see what that looks like and you can
scroll through all of your images
there's also information here which is
just viewing it as a list and that's all
great but i think the thumbnail view is
probably going to be the easiest one for
us to see at the moment and you'll
notice that you know all of these areas
are easily scaled as you can see here
you may or may not notice that you can
also take the content that you do happen
to have available and one of the things
you can do is to select any of these
images do you wanted to open up one of
these images what you could do in that
case is to just briefly be able to take
the entire folder and you'll be able to
double click it and that would open up
any of these files so for example if I
were to double click this petri dish
file here you would see that it opens up
inside Photoshop with no difficulty
whatsoever you go back to
this particular area let's say there's a
bunch of these files that we want to
sort of collapse a little bit and what I
mean by that is to sort of separate them
into a a separate group for example I'll
select one I'll shift click to select
all of these sort of older World War One
World War two photographs if I right
click on it you'll notice that one of
the things that we can do is to stack
this you can group this as a stack when
I say that what you'll notice is now
I've got five images that are all
grouped up here what that does is it
allows you to open and collapse it just
by clicking on the number 5 if i right
clicked on this and said stack ungroup
from stack we could do that if you
enable the onion skin you can sort of
see you know a number of images on top
of each other but i don't really like it
that way but nevertheless you could do
that if I wanted to I could also drag
more images into that stack right so all
of these are me pictures that i have
here whether you right click on them
originally or whether you just drag them
into an existing stack right now as you
can see so I've got 11 images that I've
got open and if I wanted to I could
double click this and open up all 11 at
once inside of Photoshop for example
I'll click OK and bang as you can see
here you've got a number of different
images that are now all available if you
want to scroll through those images you
can see here there's this little arrow
on the side and that allow you to you
know jump through the different images
as you can see and among another number
of things that you can do is to actually
roll through those as you will notice
here what you can do is to close one of
these files or you can close all of
these files in one shot just by pressing
command w and this is the Alt key and if
you do that just as quickly as those
ones were opened and there now closed
and what
you can also see here is that you'll be
able to select any of these you'll be
able to collapse them into the elements
that you have here if these were
photoshopped documents PSD's in fact
let's let's also take note that if we're
working with PSD or AI files and instead
of just seeing the icon for illustrator
or Photoshop you'd actually see what the
files look like so it's a really nice
tool to work with and there's a lot that
you can do with it although all I'm
really showing you are some of the
basics that you have here so you can
work with it inside of bridge or as I
mentioned if you're inside a photoshop
you can also work with this little mini
bridge right here and what you'll notice
is depending on where you are located
and as I'm pointing to that file on the
desktop you can look at the preview on
any one of these which you can make big
larger or smaller of course and you can
just double click it open up that file
so salt and pepper is opened up here and
you can see that we've got a number of
different works that we can easily
access and work with if I were to press
my F key we'd notice that you know we
don't have that floating window we're in
that screen now again where we only see
the image so all of these things are
really useful and really helpful when
you're thinking about opening up images
for work inside of Illustrator well now
that we know to open up the images let's
continue with those images and see about
working with some other tools and
shortcuts and those are going to be
zooming and moving in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
