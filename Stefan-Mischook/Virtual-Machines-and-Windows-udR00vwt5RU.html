Studio web com and killer sites com so
in this video I'm going to talk about
using virtual machines with windows to
protect yourself from viruses now what's
a virtual machine let me just pop up a
very popular one so vmware is one of
these virtual machine products it's
basically a piece of software that
allows you to install different versions
of windows in these virtual sandboxes
and then you could launch these versions
of windows like you would launch
Microsoft Word or Photoshop or something
like that and what it basically does is
well you bite the software and then you
take Windows you install into these
little sand boxes these containers that
VMware Workstation the software provides
so what happens is that you you can now
for instance on your Windows 8 machine
you could run windows 7 you can run
windows XP could run all these different
windows and these versions of Windows
would basically start up like you would
start up any other piece of software
like Photoshop in a word so why would
you want to do this well traditionally
people would use this to do testing of
software if they were software
development developers they could test
different versions of the shooting they
could test their software on different
versions of Windows and etc Mac people
would use vmware fusion I believe it's
called so that they could run windows on
their Mac without having to restart the
mac I used to do it for these these two
reasons but one of the main reasons i
used to use vmware when I use my Windows
machine a lot I knew I used mac a lot
more now is because of all the bloody
viruses that are on the internet all the
trojans and so on for windows so what I
would do is I would have a version of
windows installed in the one of these
virtual containers at VMware provides
for you and when I want to surf the web
I would just launched that version of
Windows so for instance i'm running
windows
seven I would have another version of
windows seven another install like
having a separate computer almost and I
would launch it and then I would surf
the web with that virtual version of
Windows and it's pretty much computers
are so powerful it's just as fast as
responsive as your normal version of
windows and the reason you do this well
first of all you install it fresh it's
all configured then you take something
called snaps right press a button and it
basically takes a snapshot out of your
windows nice and clean no bugs no
software installed just how you want
fresh like a brand new computer and then
you surf the web affair you do your
stuff and let's say you ran into a virus
and what you can do is you can just just
one or two clicks of a button you can
revert back to that original clean
version of Windows without having to
reinstall your whole computer so if you
surf the web you're going to virus it
won't it cannot spread outside of that
virtual machine at virtual version of
windows because it's literally in a box
and and and then you can just press a
button and go back to that version of
Windows pre virus and that's just the
very beginning of what you can do with
virtual machines so it's not too
expensive to get these things are free
versions you don't have to get vmware
there's other free virtual machines out
there I haven't used them I just use
vmware myself and i hear the other ones
pretty good this to search for it and
it's very useful special if your windows
user so that you can not have to worry
about surfing the web so I would just if
I was a Windows user are you i will get
vmware workstation i will install it and
i will install version of windows in
this workstation so this way you'll
never have to worry about as long as you
don't you surf the web with these
virtual version of windows you never
have to worry about viruses and all this
kind of stuff again so it's pretty
pretty powerful stuff like i said
there's a whole bunch of the things you
can do with virtual machines but let's
just scratches the surface but that's
that that in of itself is huge i hope
you found this useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
