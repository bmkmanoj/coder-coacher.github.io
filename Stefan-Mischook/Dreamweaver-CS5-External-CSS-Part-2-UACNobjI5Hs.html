define by clicking and choosing one of
the colors that you might have here so
for example if I wanted it this dark
blue I've got that dark blue right there
what if I wanted to make some variation
to this blue or choose something that
wasn't on this list well you could just
come here to the system color picker and
on a Mac this looks a little bit
different than it does on a PC but it's
really not that more difficult here on
the Mac you've got something that looks
like the color wheel on a PC you've got
something that looks a little bit
different but as you can see here it's
more like the spectrum except it be
vertical instead of horizontal here
nevertheless you can choose from any
number of different ways of doing this
but on my Mac you know I could come in
here I could choose different colors by
doing that or if I liked the color that
I had and I just wanted it to make it
brighter or darker I could have done
that as well or I can just cancel it so
if I like all these things it's great
however notice that you can play with
text decoration as well I really don't
play with text decoration much except
for when i'm working with links why is
that because here i can decide whether
or not i want to underline or over line
or put a line through this these are all
standard things that you can do
certainly but listen I really don't want
you to ever underline headlines why is
that because anything that's underlined
on the web is meant to be a link and
people will assume that it is a link so
if you have something underlined in a
headline and people are going to come
start clicking on this and sow what a
crappy site this just doesn't work man
the links are busted what a piece of
garbage right so don't underline your
headlines right headlines are made to be
headlines not by underlining them but by
drawing attention to them by using
thicker perhaps fonts by using larger by
changing color all right so all of these
things will make that much more
noticeable underlining it is not going
to help you so use these tech decoration
ones only when you're dealing with links
however there's one here called blink
my least favorite of all of these texts
decorations why is that because unless
you want a busted neon sign on your
website saying eat at Joe's eat at Joe's
I would really recommend that you not
use blank it's really gross none is not
needed right here because we don't have
any text decoration anyways all right so
at this point we'll get into categories
a little bit later on a step-by-step
basis but right now we're just dealing
with the text and click OK and you can
see that there's no code that's been
added anywhere in the inline situation
there's nothing in the body as you can
see here but there is something in the
head section a lot less than what we saw
when we put internal text what is in
this head section is a link and this
link is pointing to CSS folder and
inside that folder is style dot CSS so
that's how my index page is being
affected by this external style dot CSS
page sounds great now the last thing i
want to show you before we leave here in
the CSS Styles window we're looking at
all if you looked at current I mean
nothing is selected here but look if we
go to the all section and if you click
on the h1 here well I'm going to just
double click on files to collapse it
notice that you can get information
about that for example font family font
size so I don't necessarily have to work
in that same window I could just make
changes directly from here I could
change the size for example let's say I
did in fact chose maybe 50 to write and
as soon as I just click out bang it
changes what it looks like and then if I
deseo well you know I really want that
to be 42 bang goes right back you don't
like the color no problem you can come
in here you can choose something you can
change it make it brighter or darker I
could click OK and Wow everything has
worked out very nicely inside of this
design pretty easy and also if you
wanted to add other properties you can
just click here and look at this every
single property
in CSS which brings me to the next point
that I want to talk to you about and
that is looking at your code that you've
just created as you can see here this is
all Dreamweaver driven information but
how is this actually written in code
view well check it out here I've got my
split screen view that's great right and
it's showing me the HTML code for this
particular page okay sounds good but
what if I want to see the CSS code for
this particular page well notice here
there is a little window called
style.css I press that little button
here is my window for the external style
sheet so what it's showing me is this h1
is my selector and when you're writing
CSS this is how it works you've got a
selector defined what am I styling in
this case every single h1 on these pages
ok then you have an area here called the
property what are you affecting what
what are you attempting to change in
this case the font family and this
information here is for the value of
that property so in other words font
family Verdana font size is the property
42 is the value font style is the
property italic is the value and so on
so the h1 is the selector this area is
the property this area after the colon
is the value of that property also
notice this when you're writing code by
hand for CSS if you have more than one
value and property then just separate
them with the semicolon and as you can
see here there is the semicolon and
every time I introduce a new property a
semicolon is introduced as well so let's
go back to the source code and notice
here we have style dot CSS with the
asterisk next to it that's just a little
visual indicator as I've mentioned
before letting you know that that page
has not been saved so check this out
when we preview our work for example in
sorry it's going to ask me to save the
index page great but then there's now a
new little warning message that comes up
that says some files need to be
accurately preview need to accurately
preview this page have been modified by
not saved save them now well what that's
referring to is that external CSS
stylesheet if we say yes you'll see that
the asterisks will disappear so when we
do that that page is saved here in
Safari now I have a headline which is
nice and tasty blue and if we return I'm
going to quit safari if we return back
to our code we can see that that h1
looks exactly as it did before only
thing that's different is this one link
tag line and that's linking to my
external CSS stylesheet the one that's
right here inside of my CSS folder so
that's it that's how we style a tag
using CSS when we come back what we're
going to do is style the rest of this
page and then I'll introduce you to
other selector types not just the tag
selector but we'll learn about things
like custom classes and ID's all coming
up in later episodes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
