Studio web and killer sites so in this
quick little view on I talked about the
order of courses to learn so I'm here on
the studio web list and we're actually
going to reverse this because it gives
wrong impression so we have HTML CSS
JavaScript PHP now intuitively you would
say to yourself well let's teach them
the JavaScript first because it's on the
client side it's the programming
language in the browser and then we'll
move to the beginners PHP because PHP is
on the server and it's kind of it's it's
displaced of course from the web browser
you know HTML CSS JavaScript is in a web
browser and it's cold for the web
browser and PHP is cold for the server
now it seemed the case that would seem
to make sense but in fact I'm learning
relearning from experience I know for my
own experience or from the past and it's
been brought to my attention again it's
actually a lot easier once you learn
your HTML and your CSS it's a lot easier
to actually jump into PHP first because
JavaScript is uh it could be a little
tricky to learn not so much because of
the language perhaps but more because of
the web browser the web browser
infrastructure which JavaScript works
inside of is exactly not the most
intuitive thing to learn and one of the
reasons is because each web browser has
their own silly way of doing things and
that's why you have libraries like
jQuery that have come about jQuery is a
JavaScript library and one of the
functions of jQuery is to try and
harmonize the differences between the
different web browsers so to do things
so jQuery provides this layer of code
that sits in between you and the browser
and this layer of code makes a lot
easier for you to interact with the web
browser
anyway I've gone off on a tangent so if
you're new to the whole web design thing
and you know if you've been watching my
videos if you're getting into modern web
design you have to learn how to do at
least some programming it's essential
even for web designers people don't want
to get into web development and so I
would argue is that you do your HTML and
your CSS then jump into beginners PHP
now you don't have to do it as the
studio web while student wants for
schools we have Academy dos to do web
but wherever you learn it you know jump
into beginners PHP because what's that's
what that is going to do if it's taught
to you properly is you're going to learn
how web browsers interact with the
server and that happens all the time the
whole time it's happy that's the whole
process of the web and it's also going
to teach you basic programming concepts
that are universal so to learn those
programming concepts with PHP is going
to be much easier than to learn them
with JavaScript so once you do your
beginners page PHP then you can jump
back and do some JavaScript now having
you know been exposed to basic
programming concepts and if you do get
frustrated with beginners JavaScript
welcome to the club so that's pretty
much it
