recently and actually an Instagram
message which is interesting Esther I'm
getting Instagram messages it's funny
everybody's got their own particular
social network they like to work with
anyhow so I'll get to the point of it
somebody from outside of North America
from Africa specifically and I'm not
gonna say their names to keep them
anonymous so that if you do ask me
questions I will sometimes use them in
vlogs but I will not put out your name
so if you if you're worried about that
don't worry about it
and the gist of it the point of it all
was whether or not he could get a job a
secure job in Nigeria from Nigeria
rather into Canada and I think this is
relevant for everybody any foreigner
well foreigner anybody from outside of
North America wants to come to North
America whether the US or Canada and I
think one of the key things besides of
coding skills and I can't emphasize this
on enough I can't emphasize this enough
is you need good communication skills
being able to write well and speak well
understand the particular cultural
issues or cultural differences in Canada
in the u.s. versus where you happen to
come from and be able to speak and
communicate clearly is a huge advantage
if you want to maximize your chances of
getting a job in another country you
have to understand the local dialect the
local tendencies if you will any I'm
gonna read this email in part and I'm
gonna answer a few questions
my name is Oklahoma John Johnny Johnny
from Nigeria that so common and I'm a
graduate in geophysics though I have a
strong love for programming I switch
career and now I am a c-sharp developer
for a company which is pretty nice
considering the academic background such
a big demand for developers if you have
a background and academic background
outside of software development you know
in this case it's geophysics doesn't
matter because a lot of times developing
developers or developer developer
companies or development companies
rather there we go development company
times are looking for people with a
different background domain knowledge is
when it's called your domain come into
your physics it could be math it could
be physics it could be psychology etc
etc etc etc why is this important for
companies because if you have experience
in different industries your ability to
code and your deep knowledge of this
other industry can come in very handy as
you learn to develop software as I was
saying to one of my former mentees and
now who now is a co-founder and CEO of a
company that's raised millions of
dollars in their doing well the domain
knowledge the knowledge outside of
programming is very very valuable any
help let me go on he says I stay here in
Africa
but I'm trying to go outside of a crowd
I want to see if I can get a job in
Canada I wants to leave basically their
chair because he thinks there's going to
be more opportunities in Canada and
programming there's asking me if I have
available connections or what
possibilities well I work these days
pretty much exclusively exclusively with
freelancers but I'm pretty much full now
I got my little team and so
unfortunately I don't have any jobs for
people at this point do I know anybody
again it's I know people but it's like
it's it's not like I could just call
them up a what's going on you know what
I mean it's there's a long process
especially when you're looking at
development there's very particular
skill sets people are looking for and
that's why there are job people
companies that just place people in jobs
they do all that work all the legwork
all the research that's required is it
even possible to get a job from from
Africa I would imagine so I I'm not an
expert in immigration but there's a lot
of these a lot of people travel from all
over the world to go to the west because
there is a shortage of the
purrs and that's actually a big
political issue in the u.s. in that
regard where big companies like
Microsoft Google except for pay facebook
they want to hire people from India and
all over the place
I would imagine half Raqqah too and they
need to get the visas so it's a big
political battle anyway so he lists the
skills he loves JavaScript front-end
CMS's WordPress etc etc and he's got
work experience a very important work
experience work experience is much more
important in software development in
software development than crew event
degrees and certification work
experience is huge so basically we want
to know is it possible to get a job from
here yes he summarizes bullet points
that's very important when you send out
the emails yes as possible I would
imagine but I'm not an expert do you
have any available links connects or
possible ways you can help I don't have
any contacts in terms of bringing in
people internationally what I would
suggest what you do do is you go to see
the local Caine Canadian Embassy or
consulate and let them know what you
want to do and start working with them
asking questions is gonna be a hassle
because you're dealing with government
bureaucracies which are pretty slow to
move any part of the world and I would
also start reaching out to companies in
the US and seeing what you could do
there or maybe you look at companies
place people contact them let them know
what's going on that might be a good way
to go as well what do you think the
chances are getting here in Canada I
think the chances are probably
reasonably well because Canada's very
open to immigration especially now so I
think you have good chances in that
regard and despite the rhetoric as far
as I can understand the u.s. brings in
ton they bring in a ton of people
especially people with high tech skills
so again I would also approach the u.s.
US consulate and see what's going on
there he is fourth question is fourth
question I really wanted to know is
c-sharp and J's are the best for getting
good work anywhere in a company depends
on the company depends on a company
and depends on what you're looking for
where do you want to go every I hear
about every developed nation in and you
know not so developed nations they each
have their areas where certain language
is more popular and other I I was from
another YouTube guy he was telling me
that in Germany PHP is huge and other
parts of the world could be different
languages so you're gonna have to
explore that but the good thing is you
know how to program in C sharp you know
the web stack whether you know they do
in Java whether they're in doing in
Python whether they're doing in c-sharp
it's you know it would be easy for you
to pick up and that's pretty much it I
think the most important thing I have to
say about this message that I got from
this guy John from Nigeria is that he
writes well he writes well some putt
some typos so on but generally is very
speaking straight forward to the point
gave me nice bullet point summaries when
you're doing business communication
especially today you have to learn to
write concisely that means not long
drawn out use bullet points small
paragraphs get to the point right away
and you'll be much more successful than
you think otherwise
it's such an important thing that you
develop these communication skills as
I'm a developer whether you're trying to
get here from Africa or whether you're
just trying to get a job if you can
develop good communication skills that
would take you far far more more further
ahead than if you learn a new framework
or you learn a new language now
communication skills are key as software
in software development that's it Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
