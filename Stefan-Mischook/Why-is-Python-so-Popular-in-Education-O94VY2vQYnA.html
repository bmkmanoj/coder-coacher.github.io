in education why is it used in colleges
universities the teach code why is it
used in elementary school high school
middle school you see it all over the
place to teach coding so what's the
reason for that well I was interested
myself when I first started looking into
Python and I discovered it in about
three minutes after looking at the
language Python is a cool language
because a it reads very much like
English it's very natural it reads like
a human language it's also a very
expressive language in that with very
little bit of Python code you can get a
lot done so this you would expect would
sacrifice capabilities not the case
though Python is easily readable easy
easy to read rather easy to write and
it's very expressive me a little bit of
Cole gets a lot done it doesn't
sacrifice flexibility in power it's
actually in fact Python is a very
capable language
the only drawback with Python I would
argue well is the speed issues Python
does not run terribly quickly but of
course for most applications out there
it's not really that important and in
fact this speed issue is becoming less
less of an issue with every passing year
simply because computers and processors
are getting so much more quick just is
getting so much faster that it's it's a
non-issue for many applications now I
wouldn't be using Python to write a game
engine but you could use Python to
support the kernel or the heart of a
game engine which you might write in C
C++ and then you surround that with a
bunch of Python to create the rest of
your app but I'm not going to get into
that so because python is so easy to
read so easy to write and it's
expressive
it's an excellent first programming
language that's why you see it use a lot
in schools because it's just so
approachable and you don't sacrifice
sophistication even though it is so
approachable so you can express some
pretty sophisticated concepts in Python
and without the complexity if you will
or without some of the baggage of more
less human readable language languages
if you will so for instance I'm a huge
fan of Java I did most of my commercial
work in the 90s and early 2000 in Java
and Java syntax ataxia standard word for
Coast Java syntax is just a lot less
approachable than Python first of all
saying about because Java is what you
would call a strongly typed language
there's a lot more code to write to get
something done in Java versus Python now
there are advantages to Java and the
approach that they take but again we're
talking about how Python is used in
education and why is used in education
and don't get me wrong
python is not just a wimpy learning
language it's actually used quite a bit
in industry most significantly AI and
machine learning and let me tell you AI
machine learning are today what the web
was back in nineteen and ninety five
it's extremely important stuff and you
know that by that has a long future
ahead of it simply because of it a is
machine learning application that alone
and guarantees pythons place it's going
to be one of the key languages as it is
today it will be for many years to come
simply because of that application so as
you know if you've been watching my
videos I've been creating a Python
course and I know I've been promising
it's going to be out soon and
the problem with my courses is that they
are designed for schools and classrooms
which means they are far more refined
than the typical course that you see out
there there's a lot more work in putting
together a study web based course that
creating just a typical video course
that you see out there on competing
platforms well they don't really compete
because designing courses for school is
very different different game so by the
way if you happen to be a college
professor or teacher in high school
middle school who is interested in maybe
teaching Python and you'd be curious to
see what I produce feel free to contact
me and I can that we can arrange for you
to get a demo and a sneak peek at what
we have the course is nearly complete
from end to end
now we're entering the stage of high
high level edits if you will and revite
and refinements and that means I have my
editor and we're working together to
find tune the course to polish it I had
a bunch of demo testers who provided a
very good insight for me and based on
what we learned from them based on you
know just the contribution of the editor
and so forth the course is going to be
made significantly well it's going to be
made better it's pretty good already we
got great reviews from everybody so it's
already pretty good but again like I
said when I'm developing a course for
the schools it takes a lot more work to
get get a tip top and ready for the
classroom experience especially when you
start adding in the quizzing and the
projects and the code challenges and all
the other things that are included with
every studio web course so in conclusion
and my apologies to regular listeners or
just looking to your step blog about
stuff if you are an educator you're
interested in the Python course please
feel free to reach out to me I'm loved
working with schools we have been for
six seven years now and I think you'd be
very happy with the results in the
outcomes of using my new powerful Python
3 course beginners course
takes people totally new to programming
introduces the basics right into
object-oriented code to get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
