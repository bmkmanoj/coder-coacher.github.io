follow-up to the previous video I want
to add two additional pieces of
functionality to edit dot PHP basically
I want to anticipate any sort of issues
that might come up as the user is using
our application and the first thing is a
security based issue at the moment
there's no way to make sure that the
user is properly logged in if they view
the Edit dot PHP page so how I'm going
to make that function properly if you
remember from a couple videos ago we
created a settings that PHP file as a
demonstration to make sure that our
authorization system was working
properly and users wouldn't be able to
access pages that they shouldn't be able
to access to without the proper
authorization so I'm going to copy this
line from our settings that PHP file and
paste it in here at the top of our edit
dot PHP file right below the include so
what will happen now if the user isn't
logged in and actually let me go ahead
and test this let me log out and let's
try to access that edit dot PHP page
directly so it's with a nap
CMS edit dot PHP you notice we do get an
unauthorized message that is working
properly
let me go back and log back in and talk
about the second change that I wanted to
make okay so the second thing is what
happens if rather than clicking on an
editable area as normal and having it
pop up in a color box what happens if
the user decides to right-click on it
and open it in a new tab or a new window
well if they do that they get a page
that looks sort of like this and to be
honest there isn't that much we can do
about this if you look at the source
code you'll notice that it doesn't
include the usual HTML and head and body
tags that are necessary for a fully
functioning web site and we aren't
including JavaScript excuse me we are
not including jQuery so this Ajax
functionality isn't going to work
what happens though if I go back and let
me refresh this page and try to submit
the form we get error messages because
the form tries to submit but it has
issues it when runs into unidentified
index of ID and type because if we check
edit dot PHP it's trying to access
variables that are only set using Ajax
so I want to make sure there's a way to
catch this and to automatically display
an error to the user indicating what's
going on so here basically what happens
go back here for one second the form
submits and this field is set so there
is a post field variable that's set
properly but index or excuse me ID and
type or not set so that's what I'm going
to check for so if is set and I'm going
to check if the field variable is set if
that is set and either the post ID or
the post type or not set
so if is set of post ID equals false or
is that a post type is false then we
want to handle things a little bit
differently and what we're going to do
is we're going to call our template
error function like we set up earlier
I'm going to paste that into place and
then down below rather than a regular if
statement I'm going to do an else if
like so as the last change to this file
let's update the error function so we
can actually pass along a message to
display rather than having a set message
that too always displays so let's open
up thin core models an undersquare
template let's take a look at our error
function the first argument is type and
I actually want to modify this so it
defaults to a blank string so we don't
have to specify a type variable if we
don't want to if we don't specify a type
it'll default to the automatic error
message however I also want to add a
second variable I'm going to call it
message and this is also going to
default to a blank string
and down here at the bottom I'm going to
say if message does not equal a blank
string I want to use this set data and
I'm going to create a variable that'll
be accessible within our views I'm going
to call it message and I'm going to pass
a long message to it now we're going to
use a set data function here otherwise
so else we're also going to do another
set data function except rather than
using the message variable we're going
to pass in a string and we open up V
under square PHP I'm going to copy this
content I'll delete it for the moment
and we'll come back here in one second
and I'm going to copy I'm going to paste
that content here so basically what this
does is it sets a default message encase
message is not predefined so to go back
here rather than displaying a fixed
message and use the PHP function so
we're going to echo out this get data
and we're going to echo out that message
variable
that we just created like so so let me
save this file
I'll save em underscore template as well
and let's go back to our edit a PHP file
and the last change we need to do is we
need to modify our error message here so
now it now accepts two arguments it
accepts the error type and also the
error message itself so in this case we
can leave the error type alone so I'm
just going to include a blank string
there and then a comma and then the
actual message and this message is up to
you maybe you can think of something
better than I can but I'm simply gonna
say please do not open up edit windows
within a new window or a tab and the
only other thing that I noticed very
quickly was that this is ft and it
should be FP the same thing with this
one down here so I'm just in case you
run into that arrow make sure to double
check that so let's go ahead and preview
this when we open this up in a new tab
hit submit you'll notice that we do get
the proper error window the error page
with the correct error message</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
