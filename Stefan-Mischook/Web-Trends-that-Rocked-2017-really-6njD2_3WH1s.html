website development trends that rocked
2017 at least according to this article
on MSN just popped up in my feet so I
think I'd comment on a few things that
they're talking about give you my two
cents
so they said number one angularjs so
angularjs came out with the new
angularjs for I was very different from
the previous versions I remember a
couple year ago so and angularjs I think
was in version 2 maybe was version 3 and
I told people don't put too much time to
angularjs cuz version the new versions
coming out which is parently a total
rewrite from the old version so don't
waste your time so anyhow so angular 4
is out yeah angular and react j/s from
Facebook I they compete with each other
I think there's slightly different use
cases again with all these libraries
react angler whatever whatever library
pick whether it be a JavaScript library
whether it be a CSS library whatever I
say learn on a need-to-know basis need
to nerd basis you should be aware of
them sort of look at what they do maybe
do the equivalent of the hello world
with each of them but don't go crazy
because don't think because something is
hot that you have to use it just
understand what's out there and leverage
these libraries again when you need to
use them
number two in their list artificial
intelligence AI yes AI is getting pretty
big you see it all over the place a is
kind of interesting in that it is it's
not necessarily very obvious to people
unless you're honored that AI is
starting to creep in every
we're like my Google pixel I got the
pixel phone and the biggest part about
it for me in terms of its utility is the
AI Dai to me kills it in terms of the
Google assistant I use it all the time
and a is huge it's going to make the
dot-com boom and revolution if you will
look kind of quaint in comparison huge
changes are coming in terms of our not
just our economies in our societies
because of AI and robotics I think 40
good personally but yeah
AI is huge the ARS is right here Merrill
Lynch huge Bank estimates that AI market
derived 153 billion by the end of 2018
Microsoft's Cortana google's assistants
are some of the high-level web-based AI
adjustments of this age yeah so II see a
point out oh sorry I've got a lot of
companies will use AI in their branding
and marketing to sort of sell it because
it's the hot new thing
ai it's very important in fact with
studio web now that I'm trying to market
here but in studio with Studio web for
some time in six months from now
I plan to implement an AI component into
the architecture I won't get into the
details what we're gonna be doing with
it I don't want to tip my hand but it's
pretty interesting stuff so yeah a I
lose AI mean in terms of you as a
developer
it means languages of Python it means go
know are let go our thing is I was
forgetting yeah just going to Python I
just did a vlog on that if you want to
get to AI now learning Python the basics
of it the core is the beginning of AI
you have to get into other things as
well the libraries that the modules
associated with AI but if usually in the
AI first step is to learn Python
I have virtual reality VR technology is
often associated with video games
although the tech has been around for
some time now its potential is
increasingly getting realized by
corporate bigwigs well I think
virtuality AR augmented reality and VR
virtual reality I think that I don't see
it going far beyond the niche so if I
were you if you are interested in the
tech I would not drop everything to get
into a our VR I think it's a highly
specialized thing meaning it's only
going to be used in very specific
purposes think about it ai I was now the
I commend it to reality AR and VR
problem with that you get put these
glasses on which are really covering it
so they're gonna have to get the glasses
something minimal like a Google glass
they're not there yet a few years a year
a few years away and then you have to
question how how often is this stuff
going to be used
I think AR AR and VR are a lot of hype
I've got I like the 3d TV I don't think
it's gonna be as bad as 3d TV where 3d
TV just collapsed
but I think it's be highly nice oh yeah
proceed with caution with augmented
reality and virtual reality
number four Ruby on Rails and are they
mentioned the new features in Ruby on
Rails but I don't know about that I've
seen another report saying in Ruby on
Rails is its uses is dropping you know
all the hipster coders are moving
towards nodejs so I'm sure Ruby on Rails
is a still great full stack solution
although if you follow my vlogs for a
bunch of business reasons I and
performance reasons I suggest you go
with PHP Alera Val as opposed to Ruby
and Ruby on Rails number five doesn't
interesting to be static website
generators so
yes I guess they mentioned some some
bogus modules like pelicans yes sorry
the camera stopped recording for some
reason alright I haven't heard about the
static web site generators these
particular ones like Pelican and Python
and I'm sure there are others this is
kind of funny so what would tell you
what that is for small static website
generator is nothing new this is
something that Perl one of the old
languages of the web still use quite a
bit out there but it's not something I
would learn today Perot used to do that
itself it used to create static pages so
way typical dynamic websites work
whether it be Ruby on Rails or peach
bolero or Java etc is that with every
time somebody requests a dynamic page a
dynamic page the page that talks to
databases every time that page is
requested every time so he says show me
the shopping cart what would happen is
that the decoding the programming would
be PHP Ruby Java C sharp Python whatever
the coding that they were it would
contact a database pull the records from
database and display the page
dynamically dynamically meaning
constantly changing well with static
website generators and what Perl used to
do is that they said well there's
certain pages but don't really need to
be generated every single time somebody
comes to a site for instance maybe you
have a website with houses for sale a
real estate website how often do you
change the number of houses that are for
sale it seems kind of silly but a site
like that would constantly go to the
database to load up the houses for sale
when you might add a new house wield
force five times a week max so you may
have to update the the actual page just
a few a few times a week as opposed to
every single time somebody hits that
page so with static website generators
would Perla do it would basically
generate a static page meaning it would
create that HTML page with all the house
information in place to use that example
and stick in a to interest particular in
a particular directory so when somebody
would come to visit the site it would
just load the static page meaning
wouldn't bother the database you
wouldn't have to go to the database
folder records how is a significant
because the most expensive part in terms
of CPU and memory requirements and so
forth in any website any dynamic
database driven websites operation the
most expensive part in a web app is
actually talking to the database it
takes a lot of information a lot of CPU
power and open that connection
maybe not once but if you're doing it
you know thousands of times in a minute
it starts to really you know humless CPU
so by having static pages it takes
hardly any CPU power so it's this much
more efficient it scales much more
meaning your sake you have a much more
traffic that's the whole advantage of a
static website generator it's uh it's
interesting I think though but it's very
rare these days that your website will
need to do that you would have to have a
super super popular website and you
would have to it can only be used in
very targeted situations like I said for
example a web page or website that shows
a listing of houses for sale you know if
if that page only has to be refreshed it
has to be changed if you will you know
once a day that's where static website
generator type of system would make
sense right because you just need to
update it once a day and it would say
huge amount of server resources here's
the other thing though why do I say that
most sites really don't need to concern
themselves with this web servers are so
powerful these days CPUs are getting so
powerful that for the vast majority of
sites unless you have a huge amount of
traffic it will not have much of an
impact if any impact at all in terms of
your website's performance and the
amount of resources that your server
uses but you know it's interesting thing
to keep in mind again this is one of
these technologies one of these design
patterns if you
where you can input you just have to be
mindful of it you have to be aware of it
so that when you're faced with a
situation where you have a very popular
website oh boy these pages are really
little slow then you if you're aware of
static web site generators you'll be
able to at least look at them say okay
maybe we could use a website generator
static web page that are in a generator
because the load is getting heavy then
you explored that again you learn the
technology on a need-to-know basis
that's one of the things that keep
preaching and there you go that is my
summary and commentary and the five
website development trends that Rock 217
I don't know if I agree with these
things like angular as far as I could
tell react was the king artificial
intelligence all the way vr we virtual
reality for sure defenders the Cubbies
trying to sell these technologies are
pushing it I don't think it's going to
go anywhere Ruby on Rails I don't know
as far as I understood adoption is even
flatlining or going down slowly for me
if I was doing a web stack I would be
doing PHP laravel static website
generators we just talked about that
that's it we'll talk to oh yeah by the
way just let me know if you like me
commenting on these technology
developments technology technology
trends I figure my twenty plus years of
experience as a developer and my
perspective on these might be
interesting for some of you ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
