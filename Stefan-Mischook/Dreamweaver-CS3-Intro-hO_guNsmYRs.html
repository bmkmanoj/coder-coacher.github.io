name is Stephanie shucks with killer
sites calm and in this particular video
I just want to introduce you to the
course itself and give you an idea of
the flavor of the course
because this is a beginners course on
Dreamweaver I have two goals in mind
number one to teach you how to build a
website as quickly as possible with
Dreamweaver because I'm of the opinion
that most people out there just want to
get to it right away
and you don't want to list sit through
and have to listen to hours of
theoretical blather number two I want to
introduce you to the basics of web
design there are some key web design
principles that even if you're using a
powerful program like Dreamweaver cs3
you're still going to need to know these
principles fortunately this is a
hands-on tutorial where I imagine that
you're sitting right here beside me and
we're actually going through the process
of learning how to use Dreamweaver to
build a website so I'm not the type of
guy who sort of sits there in front of
you and rambles on about theory that
just bores people to death and I think
it's not a good way to teach because
it's not a good way to learn I believe
the best way to learn is to do something
so the best way to learn how to use
Dreamweaver is to actually use the
program to build websites so that's what
we're gonna jump into right away and as
we're building I may pause every now and
then to explain some basic web design
theory or some basic cs300 in
Dreamweaver cs3 concepts but that's only
going to be a very small part of the
video course
if I were to sum up the flavor of the
course the field of course I could sum
it up in three basic ideas that I carry
through in all my videos and in my web
design web programming work and they are
keep it simple keep it practical and
keep it to the point I think that says
it all and I think that will give you a
good idea of how the course is going to
unroll in front of you
as far as the order of the videos each
video is numbered you know number one
number two number three just follow the
numbers and you will be following the
order which you should be watching the
videos
all right that pretty much covers all I
have to say with regards to introducing
the the whole course I hope you enjoy it
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
