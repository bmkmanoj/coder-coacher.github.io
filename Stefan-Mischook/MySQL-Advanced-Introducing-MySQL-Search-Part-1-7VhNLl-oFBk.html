part 9 of a wonderful little series on
advanced mysql usage for killer PHP calm
and in this part 9 what I'm going to be
doing is looking at my SQL search so
basically how we can leverage mysql
search engine now i'm not going to be
building on the existing tutorial that
was set up in the previous parts of this
particular video tutorial series but
rather we're going to start with
something completely different and
that's only because we're going to be
dealing with something that requires
just a lot of content and i'm going to
show you various searching techniques
that you can use one is full text search
using mysql search engine and the other
one is just using the like claws and
various where queries and seeing what
that what that gives you just to note
what i'm going to be doing during this
tutorial is I'm just going to log in
here and we'll say show tables I've got
a whole bunch of tables here in Mike a
PHP database right now and I'm just
going to start by dropping all these
tables drop table author I'll drop table
post drop table author drop table it's
actually a view but I don't think it's
going to get mad at me if I say drop
table post count Oh drop view post count
drop view post with authors and drop
view published posts and now we are left
with a pristine empty database which we
are now going to fill with Shakespearean
sonnets the reason being that they're
just there's a lot of words there and we
can probably get some semblance of an
interesting search result out of that so
to start off I am going to create a new
text file and this is going to be called
MySQL search
SQL and this time around I'm going to
reference my post table and I'm going to
drop if table exists I think or yeah
drop table if exists drop table if
exists for a table called sonnet and
here I'm just going to say create table
samet and we're going to have in the
sonnet table we're just gonna have a
title that we're going to have taught
and we're going to have content which is
going to be text content in this case
and I'm just going to have those very
two small columns now something that I
need to mention right off the bat is
that searching with MySQL requires that
you use a different database engine in
the first video I talked about the
advantages of using nodb primarily that
you can create foreign key constraints
you can constrain the keys of your
database so that if you've got two
tables that are related to each other a
modification in one isn't gonna cause
integrity issues in another now
unfortunately my SQL search engine only
works with my Isom which is an older
database engine and it doesn't look like
there is a really good solution for
leveraging mysql search if you're not
using my ECM some people have devised a
way of basically using triggers which
are another part of MySQL whereby they
create copies of their nodb tables and
they create what are called shadow
tables which are the equivalent but
they're using my e Sam and that's more
of an implementation kind of problem
than a educational design problem so I'm
going to avoid showing you how to set up
shadow tables and all of that at least
in this tutorial series so for now we're
just going to insert some text into our
sonnet table so I'm going to have insert
into sonnet and I'm going to have title
and content values and for now I'm going
to say sonnet one and I'll just going to
use double quotes because the source i'm
using is going to have some single
quotes and two three four five six seven
eight I'm not exactly sure how many
sonnets we're going to take let's just
say we're going to take 11 sonnets
before I go further I'm just going to
select all of this and then paste it and
it looks like I'm getting errors create
table sonnet primary key autoincrement
content looks like this is okay but it's
saying you have a syntax error oh I
forgot my semicolon here that's why very
important to have the semicolon to end
your statements hit enter again star
from sonnet and I'm going to have all my
sonnets and absolutely zero content
notice by the way that this is empty as
opposed to null so this is also can be a
point of confusion when you're starting
out with MySQL or any database engine is
that empty or having a zero string
length and having a null value mean two
separate things to a database so for
example if you wanted to do something
with a boolean where you have true or
false if something is not set then it's
null and you end up with a trinary logic
where you can have something that's true
false or no so just something this
little side note to keep in mind when
you're developing your database schema
that you always want consistency more
than anything else so I'm just going to
Google some Shakespearean sonnets and
there we go as plain text song it's 1
through 50 these are just some very nice
poems about all sorts of lovely things
and I'm going to take 11 sonnets I think
9 10 and 11 oh good they're all on one
page so I actually only need one of
these guys okay so this is sonnet one
actually we'll start with Sun at 11 and
then work down so there's song at 11
paste that in sauna at 10 paste that in
sauna at nine of course this could be
any text I'm just picking this because
it's free and it's out there of course
we could be searching documents we could
be searching logs we could be searching
anything really sonnet we're down to
seven now something to keep in mind when
you're dealing with the MySQL search
engine is that it does not search within
words so you can't you can't search
within a word it's only going to it's
actually going to break things up in
terms of spaces so if there's like a if
there's a ' within the word then you're
going to probably need some special
configuration to handle that there are
some extensions to mysql that lets you
do sounding out but again you're
probably going to have a pretty
specialized configuration at that point
then sonnet number two another thing too
is that when we're going to be dealing
with mysql search engine one of the
advantages is that it has a scoring
feature so that when we do our searches
we can see which is actually the most
relevant search result and this is
determined based on the number of times
that a particular
a word appears in that particular row so
if I just paste this in again and I
select star from sonnet I'm going to get
all my content back into my table
doesn't look very good but I mean we're
dealing with a command line here right
so we're obviously not going to get a
perfect display of our data when we're
dealing with mysql is command line tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
