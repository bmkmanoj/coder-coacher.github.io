time it's about the realities of being
an entrepreneur I've been seeing a lot
of YouTube videos well not so much but
I've seen a bunch of YouTube videos on
being an entrepreneur or starting a
business and I feel there's a lot of
misconceptions being spread around out
there by people so I just wanted to go
over a few bullet points here to give
you some idea of what it's like to be an
entrepreneur and how the process
typically on folds so just a little
background been doing this stuff for 28
years started my first business when I
was 18 and haven't worked for anybody
since I was 18 or 19 years old last job
I took working for somebody I was a
bouncer in a nightclub so I have a long
track record to base my opinions on not
just my opinions based on hearing what
other people say there's actual real
world experience here so I think the
number one rule you have to understand
about being entrepreneur it's that it's
much more of a long distance run than a
sprint a lot of people like to look at
examples of tremendous successes like
Apple Steve Jobs or Zuckerberg and
Facebook or Bill Gates it's just
Instagram and these are super rare
exceptions this is like somebody these
are people who actually won the super
lotto in business in fact and they are
the first to admit it themselves a huge
part of being that successful business
has to do with dumb luck dumb luck and
if you actually look at the the
progression of the Google and the
Facebook's and the apples you'll see but
a lot of it was dumb luck so first of
all I would not be basing my
entrepreneurial activities on the
example of these ultra lucky businesses
I would rather do is base of my
entrepreneurial strategies based on what
works to make most people successful as
a business person now what's the
difference between multi-millionaire and
a billionaire what's the difference look
that's it that's it
multi-millionaire was a long track
record 10 20 years or longer of being
successful in business is somebody who's
just as accomplished as Google as
Facebook as any of these guys and
perhaps much more accomplished there
were difference is that they didn't get
that super lucky product or service
another thing you should consider when
looking at business operators to see
whether or not they are one-hit wonders
that just grew huge and then they could
launch off of that or whether or not
they're actually successful it consists
in entrepreneurs so for example let's
look at lucky Zuckerberg he's had one
hit Facebook right and he's been a good
operator and he's maneuvered and he's
done his things and you know you can
look at his history but he's really just
wasn't done one thing so he's smart
there's no question but I look at him
more of a very lucky guy whereas
unproven yet in my opinion a proven
entrepreneur is more like a Steve Jobs
who was able to make Apple successful
and then he was able to make Pixar
successful but then he failed what next
he actually failed initially and some
major products with Apple but he came
back and he made Apple successful again
and not with just one good product but
very good two very huge iconic products
iPod and iPhone and iPad I suppose those
three so that is more an example my
opinion Steve Jobs of a true art for
nerve operator because he's proven
himself himself multiple times the world
is filled with
business people who had huge success in
one company and then they figured out
well I'm a great business person and
then they go to other business and they
and they fail this happens all the time
I'll give you an example close to home
with me we're really good friend of mine
his relative of his I'm going to say who
this years back some very successful guy
in a particular industry started a
company built it up and then sold it off
or if it was like ten million back in
the day when it was like 15 years ago
with ten billion was a lot of money but
still a lot of money today but anyway
say sells his business because he knew
how to operate that type of business and
then he decided well I'm gonna go into
another type of business so I took a
bunch of money from his sale his first
business waiter to another business and
he lost most of it he lost most of it
not such a good operator let's look at
the guy who started up Victoria's
Secret's started up the store I believe
the store Victoria's Secret's big
lingerie a line of clothing now of
course and he started up that business
and named after his wife I believe was
Victoria and he had six stores they
built up six stores over years and then
they sold it to some group of people and
he got six million for I believe it was
so he then proceeded to start a new line
of baby clothes for whatever reason and
so his baby business bankrupted if he
lost all his money within a short period
of time meanwhile within a year or two
the people who bought Victoria's
Secret's built it into a half a billion
dollar business so these two weeks
combined the guy ended up killing
himself jumping off the Golden Gate
Bridge so you have to ask yourself was
he a great business operator well he was
good at operating those stores and he
had something he had an idea of at work
with Victoria's Secret's but he wasn't
able to make it work again in other
businesses so I have another guy who
made some money because he just bought
real estate when the real estate market
was
lo it was a crash he took a risk he
bought it and I bought a few places and
they grew in value during the greatest
housing bubble in history during this
time and then he decide he was gonna get
him to other things and again same story
he he made the mistake of thinking
because he bought real estate at the
right time kind of like buying a lottery
ticket to the right time he thought he
was this great business person and it
turns out he wasn't so the lesson I'm
trying to convey to you is that there's
a lot of people out there who just they
got lucky and a lot of people out there
who assume that just because they've got
successful in one business doesn't it
doesn't necessarily mean they to be
successful all other businesses it's
very common to see of this type of
failure officer success so there's a
strategy to come out of it so I'm not
trying to dissuade you from getting to
business just trying to help you to be
able to better evaluate what you see out
there what you want to look for is you
want to look for people who have success
in several businesses over a long period
of time in several types of business you
know a lot of things that that works me
as he rich kids who go work for their
fathers and then the business continues
to grow as they're working at their
father's business and then they proclaim
themselves to be business experts it's
like you know I'm not gonna need me if
these guys yeah I just went working for
my father and his business is only worth
five million and we built it up together
to a hundred million and I'm a great
business person I took that money and I
took it and run into something else it's
good they went into something else and
they showed that they're able to do
something else that's that's point one
but what they don't get the rich kids
don't get is that the hardest part about
starting a business is starting a
business is figuring out the business
model figure out figure out figure out
the market coming up with workflows
coming up with structures building up
the initial money that you know to start
a business that's the hard part I know
I've done it my first company started
what it was two hundred dollars and I
went
to an industry that had nothing to do
with anything my parents were doing I
didn't use contacts from my parents of
use money from my parents I was on my
own and that's very different from just
going in and working for your dad in
their business you're missing a huge
part of the chunk of the process you
miss a huge chunk of the process that
initial stages those initial stages of
starting a business is very difficult
and it takes a lot of skill to do that
anyway so what you want to do is you
want to look for people who have had
multiple businesses and a long track
record
another thing that irks me that I see
out there is people were going to teach
you how to be in business but it's clear
that they have one business to teach you
how to be a business so that tells you
about their business experience you know
I in full disclosure I have a business
course but this is the first business
course I've ever put out and I've been
in business for 28 years right my
original business was import/export of
rare fish for public aquariums
collectors high in pet stores and they
had pet product line and so on
nothing to do with education nothing to
do with business training now if you do
a coating and I've had several other
things in between I've had some ups and
some downs
anyway I'm getting to the details here
so yeah I hope these I hope this
discussion is useful for you to help you
to evaluate the reality of the landscape
out there one of the things you have to
do as entrepreneurs you have to learn to
become brutally honest with your
assessments of everything out there and
yourself having sugar coated news or
sugar-coated opinions from people about
what you're doing is not going to help
you at all having well having brutally
disarms opinions also is not going to
help you at all in your ability to be
able to assess things as they really are
is a huge skill to have so this is like
the first step the first discussion here
to help you to understand how to see the
landscape out
and this is gonna help you in terms of
your own business choices your own
business practices choosing partners if
you decide to take a bond being being
able to assess business opportunities
etc having these business eyes if you
will is is important you start
developing them so when you're looking
around out there I'm assuming watching
this case you want to become an
entrepreneur freelancer excetera when
you're looking around out there consider
what I've just talked about and I think
will help you to have a better idea in
terms of how to proceed anyway I hope
this is useful to you guys but live</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
