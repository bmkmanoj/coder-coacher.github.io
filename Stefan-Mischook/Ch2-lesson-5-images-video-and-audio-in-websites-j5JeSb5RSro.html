HTML handles images video and sound
files when you include them in a webpage
so I got a web page here and you see we
have a paragraph and we got the Java
Script sheep here looking at us and this
file is actually right here on the
desktop it says index dot HTML let's
name it a file
you know it's an HTML file because it
says dot HTML that tells us that and
here's our page in the web browser and
you can actually see the image the
little sheep image I know if you can see
the little icon here on the desktop this
is a sheep image right in our web page
that's the actual size here so let's
look at the code here is a code that
generates this page here so you got our
paragraph on top here and here's our
paragraph you see our opening paragraph
tag and our closing paragraph tag and
you see here OOP blue mistake let me say
that
and you see here a new tag a new HTML
tag we haven't seen before this is the
image tag now this is one of the strange
tags and HTML that does not have a
closing tag you remember before I said
all the tags had opening and closing
tags opening paragraphs closing
paragraph well there are a few tags not
many well you don't have a closing tag
and one of them is the image tag and if
you think about it you don't need a
closing tag to tell the web browser
where the image stops because it's just
right here it's pretty simple we have an
image it's pretty evident it's you know
this is where it is well learn more
about the image tag later on but all you
want to know now is that we've added the
image of the Sheep to our page using
this image tag now if we go back to our
desktop we can see our HTML page and we
can see our image here what you need to
understand is that when you're adding
images to a web page the image is not
becoming part of the web page this is
very different from let's say when you
create a PowerPoint when you add an
image to a PowerPoint slot file or you
add an image to let's say a Microsoft
Word document the image gets embedded
right into the file itself the image
becomes part of the PowerPoint file the
image becomes part of the word file it
doesn't work that way with HTML when you
are inserting images or video or audio
into a web page you are not joining
together all you're doing is you're
using HTML code to point to where the
Sheep image happens to be in this
example so for instance if I were to
create a new folder and I'll just call
it images if I put the sheep in the
images folder so now the Sheep is moved
it's not where it was before and let's
see what happens when we load our page
oh you see that that's the browser
saying to us we know you want to load an
image there but you see it's it's a
little broken image you can't find the
image now the web browser is reading our
HTML code and we're saying to it just
grabbed a sheep image which is right
beside the HTML document but it's not
because we move the Sheep into the
images folder the web browser can no
longer find the Sheep image so there you
go all you need to learn from this
particular lesson is that images videos
sound files like mp3s when you add them
to webpages they don't become part of
the webpage you're just using the code
to tell a web browser where to find
images so if you move the image to a
different position after you've written
your code the web browser won't be able
to find the image we'll learn more about
this later on in the course but just
just so you know if you get the basic
idea that's all you need to know for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
