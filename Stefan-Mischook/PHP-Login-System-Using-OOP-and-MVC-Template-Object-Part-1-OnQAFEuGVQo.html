up the basic files and set up our
database the next step is to start the
coding and I've looked at how we want to
build this project and I figured that
the first thing we probably want to work
on is the template object this will be
the object that will display our views
and the first thing that I want to do is
to work on a temporary view that we use
to test things so I'm going to open up
my V underscore login dot PHP file and
I'm just gonna fill it with some sample
HTML for the moment so I'm just putting
in standard HTML code I have a doctype
normal HTML head and body tags and I'm
going to fill this with a little bit of
sample information just temporarily
and I'm also going to include the CSS
style feet
and you'll notice that the link to the
stylesheet includes the views folder and
I'll explain that more in a second so
let me open up style dot CSS and it
looks like this I have already set up
all the code for this style sheet just
to save a little bit time in this video
series so it's just pausing the video
copying in the code and then starting
the video back up again once you're done
you can also download this code if you
want I've included the source files with
these videos so please take a look at
that it might be faster to simply copy
and paste from an existing file so now
that style dot CSS is fully populated
with your code let's go ahead and work
in I work on our login dot PHP
controller and I'm going to start out
just with some simple sample code just
to make sure our view is working
properly so I'm going to start out with
an opening PHP tag I'm going to include
the view so views
fee underscore login dot PHP close that
off and as I talked about earlier the
reason why we need the views folder
included in our style sheet reference is
we are going to be using includes to
display these view files so the path to
that CSS file will be based on the
controller login dot PHP rather than
where the view file itself is located so
keep that in mind any links that appear
within the views they actually reference
the main folder not relative to where
the views are located one other thing
that I wanted to discuss briefly I'm
going to be doing something slightly
different with this particular series
and follow along with PHP best practice
which is often in many cases you don't
want to include the closing PHP tag for
files that contain only PHP content
WordPress does this quite a few you know
PHP based systems do this and the reason
why you don't want to include the
closing tag is one it's not necessary
but mainly because you might
accidentally have spaces that get put in
after the closing PHP tag for example
like this and if you're dealing with a
header function or just it causes issues
and it's best to avoid this so one of
the best practices I'm going to be
showing you today is leaving the closing
PHP tag off and as I said this is only
for files that only contain PHP content
the server is smart enough to understand
that this file once it has an opening
PHP tag all contents within the file are
PHP and you don't need a closing PHP tag
so let's go ahead and test this and it
looks like everything's working properly
now we have our test content and it
looks like the styling is showing up
correctly styling bit
appears within the style.css file so the
next step after this is to get started
on our templates object so I'm going to
open up the template file it's M
underscore template dot PHP within the
models and you'll notice I have an
opening PHP tag and I have a comment
that's gonna start all of my model files
it indicates what is contained within
this file in this case it's going to be
a template class and this class is going
to handle all templating tasks anything
related to displaying views showing
alerts or errors anything like that so
to get started on this we're going to
start with a class template like so and
we're going to probably start by
initializing the controller or the
constructor excuse me so I like adding
comments just to keep my file neat and
tidy so I'm going to do function I'm
going to do two underscores and
construct and this constructor doesn't
actually need to do anything but I
always include it just in case we need
to edit things later and then below this
I'm going to start off with my functions
and the first function that I want to
build out is a function that I'm going
to call load and basically it's going to
replace the includes that we've been
using previously so include and it's
pretty simple it's just going to be a
wrapper function so a function load
and we're going to provide it a URL that
we want to load and we're going to
include that URL so I'm gonna save it
let's go back to login dot PHP and let's
tweak this code to test our object that
we just created so I'm gonna go ahead
and copy this code fuse slash V
underscore login dot PHP because we'll
use it in a second and instead of
including with you immediately I'm going
to include our template code so I'm
going to do that by using the include
and instead linking in models M
underscore template dot PHP so that'll
include this file so we now have access
to the template and I'm going to create
a new template object so template equals
new template and my variable has an
uppercase first letter just to indicate
it's an object and keeps that in the
back of my mind for future reference
just a best practice thing that I do so
now that we have the object created
let's go ahead and use that object I'm
going to do template load and we're
gonna pass in the path to our view file
save it and let's preview this
so you notice everything is working
correctly it looks like we are
correcting the template object correctly
we are loading the view now you may
argue well you know we have three lines
here
why is doing this approach better than
simply using one include and including
the view and the reason I would argue
that this method is better is it's a
little bit easier to scan you
immediately know that this particular
path is related to the template and you
know you're loading this particular file
so it just keeps that in the back of my
mind it makes my code a little bit
easier to scan
and you could use a simple include but
this gives it a little bit of a context
it indicates as I said before that it's
related to the template object and
that's loading a specific view</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
