I'm gonna tell you a quick story about
how I got my very first web development
gig when I wrote my first web app now
web app back in those days 1996 we used
to call them database driven websites so
how did I do it I wrote my first website
in 94 but I didn't get commercial in
terms of writing code for other people
being paid for code until 95 where I did
my first website job for a legal firm
for a pretty respectable legal firm at
the time and anyway so but I really got
into the whole web development thing in
1996 and at this point a new HTML I knew
some JavaScript just the basics I knew
what a function was variables and raves
very basic stuff you have to understand
javascript in 1996 was really really
limited prepared to what we have today
not so much limited in the language
overall the language has improved since
that time but it was very limited in
terms what you could do with it because
web browsers were we're only supporting
JavaScript whereas now as you may know
you can use JavaScript both on the web
browsers you can use it on the
server-side programming with projects
like nodejs and they even use javascript
now in mobile application design part of
the html5 stack of mobile mobile app
development and that's another story
javascript in those days kind of
primitive and I wouldn't really call
myself a programmer I was a coder but I
wasn't a programmer because I would add
a hard time building anything with
JavaScript anything beyond simple HTML
form validation routines anyway just to
give you context I want you to know
where I was and turns of my abilities so
I get a call from a client said listen
we need to rebuild a web app that we
built with Perl CGI and so could you
come in so I came in and I looked at I
looked through it and
I never written database-driven websites
before never did never did
I'd even know what a database was why I
had I had an idea but I never worked
with them I'd understand the concepts
you know the basic concepts let alone
the SQL language which is the language
of databases and you know so I went in
there I took a look at it I remember
sitting there with the CEO and of course
he didn't have any coding abilities so I
looked at it and I figured you know it
took me 20 minutes I figured it would
take me it took me 20 minutes to figure
it out that it would probably take me
two weeks to write the app give or take
so what I did is as any smart freelancer
would do as I doubled that time so I
said it's gonna take me about a month
and there was a risk because I had never
done this before but it was a real good
contract I needed the money and I was
intending to do this no matter what I
was going to get this thing done I had
to stay up all night I was you know for
many nights I was gonna get it done I
got the gig and I got the check for 50%
up front and at that time and I was not
I had not come up with my 33 split idea
so 50% is still better than nothing so I
got 50% up front and I went straight
from the client right to the book store
in those days this is pre Google this is
pre you know in in 1996 I remember the
search engines were next to useless all
you would get was porn sites all the
time so you had to bookstores were still
huge in those days you go to your book
store and there would be like a floor a
whole floor of the book store would be
on tech books it was incredible how big
it was these days you're lucky if you
get like two shelves right anyhow so I
went straight to the bookstore and I
picked up three books on something
called ASP
and that's it yeah three books on ASP
and now ASP is short for active server
pages it was one of the original
server-side page based frameworks out
there put out there and this is by
Microsoft now les don't use it today
this is old stuff you don't use today
and it's been replaced make 10 15 years
ago on 10 years ago 15 years ago and
time flies anyway so I picked up the
books went home and I sat there for like
for like Oh 10 days 2 weeks and I just
every day hours and hours a day went
through as much as I could learning how
to create a web app how to create a
database German website so I had to
learn server-side coding which in ASP
classic you do a JavaScript or VB script
but most everybody did with VB script
which was Microsoft scripting language
and I had to learn databases and as you
learn SQL I had to learn a structured
databases but the good thing is as I was
able to lean on some universal
principles I had learned from Believe It
or Not martial arts and my previous
business and I was able to leverage
those so I instinctively almost had
clean code I had separation of concerns
I had the major good naming convention
self describing function names and so on
these are things had learned just in
business and and in martial arts like
for instance in martial arts we learnt I
did a lot of our shorts and one of the
things I learned is that very complex
martial art systems don't really work in
the real world you have these systems
are very complex we have tons of sets
and forms for you to learn all these
techniques and then you go to fight and
you get a beating the better martial
arts the ones that are practical or much
simpler they concentrate on core
principles and their that they don't
overburden the students with tons of
techniques and patterns to remember same
thing with writing code by the way keep
them simple keep your code simple keep
it straightforward and you're gonna get
much better apps in the end so anyway so
long story almost a little longer
anyway I was able to write the app I hit
my deadline in 30 days and I was able to
put out the app pretty quickly and I was
able to put up the app and the app brand
very well of course back in those days
web apps were generally simpler because
the technology was much more primitive
as it is today so the ASP classic that's
what they call it now ASP classic was
not nearly as complex as what you would
get in a modern day MVC framework in ASP
was not by design MVC like you see with
PHP laravel Django which is python-based
Ruby rails and of course I'm sure Java
spring Java spring and we looked at in
like ten years but Java spring is MVC as
well back in those days MVC was just
coming coming around we used to call pre
embassy we called model one in terms of
web application frameworks and then
model 2 came out which was MVC a lot of
people built model 1 stuff in the mid
90s late night early mid mid to late 90s
early 90s but now everybody has
everything MVC for the most part that's
pretty much it I hope you found that
interesting the point of this video is
to show you that if you've got the will
and you got the dedication you can learn
how to do this stuff now the way the
best lay way to learn how to write code
and to and to develop apps is to first
learn your basics you got to learn it on
the baby so if you're learning Webster
the web stack you got to learn HTML CSS
and you learn a bit of JavaScript and
then you got to pick a server-side
language whether it be PHP whether it be
Python whether it be Java whether it be
Ruby that's you know and we've discussed
this ad nauseam other videos which ones
which which languages have certain
advantages depending on what your job
considerations are
because in terms of languages themselves
they all are neck-and-neck in terms of
capabilities each one has their
strengths in their weaknesses just like
an Audi versus a BMW versus of Porsche
each one has their strengths the
weaknesses comes down to taste in terms
of which language or which car you want
to to drive so yeah so anybody can do
these things you just got to jump into
it you learn your basics and then once
you learn your basics you start building
simple projects there's something very
simple like what I teach we start with
like you learn your PHP and your HTML
your CSS and JavaScript don't we start
simple things you learn how to do like a
tag cloud and then you learn how to do
something simple like simple crud
operations CR UD e credits create read
update delete that's basically using a
language whether it be PHP Python Ruby
Java in conjunction with SQL to update
and to interact with a database to
update the database to write to the
database to delete records from the
database and so on
anyway I'll stop there so I hope you
found this interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
