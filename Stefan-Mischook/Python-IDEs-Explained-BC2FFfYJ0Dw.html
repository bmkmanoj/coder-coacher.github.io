about integrated development
environments so what is an integrated
development environment nurses we call
them IDE now you've been using pythons
built in IDE
it's called idelle IDL II and it is an
integrated development environment now
you know basically is a code editor that
has extra capabilities built into it to
make it easier for you to read code they
have code completion code hinting the
cold color and the more fancy I des will
have even more capabilities they'll be
able to read your code and help you to
debug it more easily etc etc what I want
you to take away from this video is that
you have many options in terms of IDE
there's many apps out there that will be
great Python IDE s and I might list a
few right here to pay on how I feel if I
don't I didn't feel like doing it but
you can just look it up on Google type
in Python IDE and you see there's many
out there I decided to use the built in
Python IDE just to make it easy for
everybody because depending on you know
if you're learning from school you may
not have the options to install this IDE
or you may want you know who knows so
I'm just using the built in one it's
fine
but there are many others out there and
they're much more powerful and if you
get really deep into writing Python code
these other ID ID es might make your
life easier so I just want you to be
aware is that I des our programs design
programs your apps programs apps
programs kind of old-school way of
saying apps apps of course is short for
application anyway not within their
terms so there are many IDE s out there
from different companies different
groups each one has their pros and cons
and just like you know somebody choosing
between iOS or Android or Windows or Mac
everybody's got their choice about which
one is best so if you get deeper into
coding your
we're going to take a look at different
IDs and you might use this one you might
use that one depending on your
particular chick your taste I just want
you to be aware that there are many
ideas out there are many options in fact
many I des will support many languages
so you may have dedicated Python IDs
that you may have IDE or code editors
that that can do multiple languages and
there's several out there an IDE versus
a code editor a code editor is usually
an app that just deals with code simpler
a full-blown IDE integrated development
environment is a code editor but all
kinds of extra power tools on top of it
this video here is just I just put it in
place because I want you to I wanted you
to be more aware of the world of
programming so this is just one aspect
understanding IDs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
