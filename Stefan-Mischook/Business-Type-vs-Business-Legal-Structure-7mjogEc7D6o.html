vlog I'm trying a new style I got the
lapel mic I got the overhead mic we'll
see how it goes
anyhow so I wanted to address a comment
that was put to me under my last YouTube
video where I talked about using
freelancing as a bridge to becoming an
entrepreneur they assumed that I said
freelancing was the only way to learning
how to become an entrepreneur I didn't
say that I said it was the easiest and
the quickest way there are many ways to
do it but that's the easiest and
quickest way because a you don't need to
spend years working for somebody else to
earn the right to become a manager B you
don't need to outlay a lot of cash like
setting up a restaurant or some other
type of factory and there you go you can
start right away boom boom you head out
there now the poster of the comment
asserted that if you are a freelancer
you are a sole proprietorship so it's
not you're just selling your time it's
not learning business first of all sole
proprietorship is a business legal
structure has nothing to do with the
type of business you run you can own a
restaurant and have a sole
proprietorship you could be a freelancer
have a sole proprietorship you could be
a freelancer and operate the freelancing
business as a sole proprietor or as an
incorporation right it is their apples
and oranges so this person is mixing up
things a little bit here second of all
they also asserted that you're just
selling your time and your a wage slave
as a sole proprietor no necessarily if
you are taught how to be a good
freelancer you can actually learn to
leverage your time leverage your time
through proper workflows but you develop
and implement through automation semi or
fully fully automating things and
through outsourcing as well these are
three tools off top of my head the union
that you can utilize to become a far
more effective
freelancer so you're not quote-unquote
selling your time and becoming a slave
to your time whereas when you work for
somebody you're actually selling your
time because there's no way or it's
harder at least in work to leverage
technology and the other things I
mentioned workflows etc to maximize the
amount of time you have to put in to get
something done and you're kind of stuck
you're stuck at a salary until you
negotiate your raise etc whereas
freelancing you're not stuck by being a
good business negotiator and negotiating
good contracts by leveraging the things
I just mentioned you can actually
increase the amount of money making per
hour considerably and in fact when I
first started freelancing I was making
1x and by the end of my freelancing
career I was making literally 10x not
another exaggeration meaning one if it
was others use round numbers if it was
$10 the hour when it's starting I was
making $100 an hour when I was finishing
Y workflows implementing automation good
negotiation and a few other little
things here and there that I learned to
do in my time as a freelancer anyhow so
this is one of the things that you see a
lot on the web unfortunately and
YouTube's you see a lot of half-truths
misinformation like somebody mixing up a
business type freelancing versus a
business legal structure sole
proprietorship versus incorporation and
these subtleties make all the difference
in terms of leading people down a wrong
path versus leading people you know you
know a straight line to the proper goal
to the goal that you want to achieve
another thing they asserted in the in
the comment that is you could do it
through other means
I didn't dispute that but I said that
becoming a freelancer is the quickest
way in the cheapest way least risky way
one idea that they put for for the idea
that they perform is you can manage
somebody else's business now here's a
problem with that approach a you're not
gonna walk into somebody's store with no
experience hey I'm gonna manage your
store and they're gonna call great
you've never done this before
yeah you can manage my store
it's not gonna happen you're gonna have
to probably work there at least a year
or two depending on circumstances or
more before you have the opportunity to
become the manager and guess what
managing the business is not the same
thing as starting a business from
scratch when you manage a business it's
like buying a premade meal at the
grocery store and putting any oven and
pressing cook a lot of the hard part has
been resolved for you coming up with the
business model coming up with the
workflows coming with the product or
service establishing your initial client
base these are the hardest these are the
hardest stages of building any business
so when you come in you just manage
somebody else's business it's good but
you've you've missed out the first half
a crucial step in the process and in
fact I've seen people in the past who
were managers of businesses who didn't
understand this reality because they
never built a business from scratch and
then they actually went out there in the
real world to try to build a business
from scratch and he learned a very
painful lesson they had never
experienced this stuff before even
though they had quite a bit of
experience of managing somebody else's
business and here's another little tip
the bigger the organization you come
from in terms of your management
experience the more detached you are
from the entrepreneurial experience
where you have to invent the business
model from scratch it's a whole
different kettle of fish anyway I hope
this helps it's an unfortunate reality
of the web yeah a lot of a lot of
half-truths and misinformation are put
out there unfortunately I don't
typically address it yeah though I see
it in business courses I see the
business vlogs I seeing
cold vlogs and Technology vlogs I don't
typically address it because I'm not a I
don't care and I can't go around and
start calling out everybody but when
somebody calls me out on my channel I
have to address it directly anyway
that's it for the Saturday afternoon
vlog cheers guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
