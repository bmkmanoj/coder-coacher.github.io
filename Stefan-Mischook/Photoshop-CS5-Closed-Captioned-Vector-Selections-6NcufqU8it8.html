you about is working with the path that
we had just created and you can do this
with any path no matter what you're
working with and what I want to talk
about is what if you are unhappy with
the way things look and you want to move
things around well there are a number of
options here inside of the pen tool if
you click down and hold on it you'll
open up this submenu and it's got some
other options that you have available to
you and another way of manipulating that
path is working with the path selection
tools there's a black one that allows
you to select the entire path and that's
pretty simple and straightforward
however there's also a white one which
allows you to select only one of these
anchor points so the direct selection
path allows me to click on this point
right here and notice independent from
all the others I can move it around if
you want to manipulate how the handles
look well notice by stretching them out
that determines how wide that curve is
going to be for example if I want this
to be even further accentuated I can
drag this one and make a longer handle
see that long handles long handles what
about this one long handle if you want I
can now move this out higher so you can
see how these points can be manipulated
and the handles can be as well well
let's look at one thing in particular
when it comes to this particular point
here I'll just bring these handles down
a little bit make them a little bit more
reasonable to work with and let's look
at this if I have two handles well when
I move one it moves the other one in
direct proportion to where I've moved
the original so it's an opposite effect
so what I want to do instead then is
what if I only want one of these things
to move for example this but I don't
want to move the other corresponding one
so press option again
as you move things well look at that it
allows you now now I don't have to press
option because these two are not
connected in any way so I can move this
around and I can manipulate these things
independently isn't that great and if I
click on this one I can further
accentuate these handles see just
clicking on this one bang I can bring
that one out and do a number of
different things to it so i can select
this point i could say hey you know I
want these to be more exaggerated or I
could say well let's press option and
I'll move these in a separate fashion
notice you've got to make sure that when
we do select it just selecting the one
sorry and moving them so there you go
there are a lot of different ways that
we can manipulate our objects selecting
just one of them moving them in any
number of different positions and you
can create a very very interesting
drawing and interesting effect just
working with those elements notice that
if I were to select that entire path as
you can see here then I could use the
pen tool to do a number of other things
for example I could click on this option
to add to a specific point on that path
notice clicking their clicking there now
I have more points that I can manipulate
the white arrow tool if you don't like
all of those points well then you
certainly can press the minus option +
delete them but now I'd have to change
where my handles look because they might
have gotten a little messed up working
in that fashion so those are some great
options but notice when you're with the
pen tool if you were to press option
actually hold on a second let's select
that first of all so I'll come in here
and with my black our tool I'll select
that path and then with my pen tool
notice just clicking on the edge here
you'll already see you don't need to
activate
that tool with the plus sign because it
already gives you a plus right there and
then if you move over it again gives you
the minus sign to get rid of it so all
of these things are easily accessible
just by using the pen tool so when we
come back we're going to look at the
next option inside of your vector
drawing and that is working with these
vector shapes here and I'll show you how
you can make the most of them and really
create some interesting things inside of
your work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
