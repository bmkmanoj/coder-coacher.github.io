with killer sites calm and killer PHP
calm in this video I want to point out
about the new flash cs6 this is just
going to be coming out very soon I'm
recording this in late April 2012 the
new flash cs6 is actually going to be
putting out html5-based animations I
don't know all the detail because it
hasn't been released to the general
public I'm not sure how advanced the
animations will be in the output but
nonetheless as predicted flash we have
people that doe be rather realized that
the future of the animated web is
probably going to be html5 in jscript
while JavaScript and so the new flash
cs6 is going to be outputting html5
based applications at least animations
if so if you're a flash developer and
we're all worried looks like adobe has
got your back at least to a limited
extent nonetheless you should still be
learning html5 and JavaScript so you
understand it's you know what's going on
behind the scenes and in fact a quarter
in MO Adobe just pointed that out
they're actually using an open-source
JavaScript framework called create jas
which I know nothing about it at this
time to output their flash animation so
there you go it's it was expected given
that adobe decided to cancel the
development of the flash player for
mobile devices including android of
course iOS is not going to be there so
you know that was a pretty good
indicator that the writing was on the
wall in terms of the flash player
eventually because a huge percentage of
the web traffic is actually mobile
traffic
there you have it just a quick note here
I jumped over to our killer sites
roadmaps this is something we recently
put together to help people learning web
design or web programming and even
people who have small businesses who
want to understand what they need to
learn to sort of manage their sites
we've put together these roadmaps and if
you just mouse over things it will give
you a pretty good idea of mom not just a
pretty good idea exactly what you need
to learn and in what order this is a
hierarchy so you start with HTML then
you start with CSS and you will be way
down the road map we have a web
programmers rome at as well so you can
see what you need to learn again in
hierarchical order this mouse over you
get your details and finally we have a
for small business owners I guess most
of you watching this video this won't
apply but again outline what small
business owners need to learn to get up
and running</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
