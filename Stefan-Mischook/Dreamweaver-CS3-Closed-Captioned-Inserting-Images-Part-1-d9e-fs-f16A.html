look at dreamweaver cs3 in this video
tutorial we're going to learn how to
insert images into web pages using
dreamweaver what you're going to find
out is that there are several different
ways you can insert images into
Dreamweaver and and we're also going to
look at how we can position images and
we're going to look at the different
image types that you can insert into web
pages so let's let's start with that now
I've popped open well I'm in the just a
windows file system here so I could show
you a preview of the images that I'm
going to insert it into our pages now I
want to point out a few things first of
all I want you to notice that we have an
image which is reading man dot PNG this
is a PNG image this is a JPEG image jpg
is short for jpg and this is a gif some
people call a gif or gif image so the
first thing what we gotta learn from
this is that there are three different
image types that you can insert into a
webpage PNG jpg gif and so the first
question that comes to mind is why do
you need three different image types to
insert it into web pages what's the
what's the point
I'm not going to get into big history of
it but a lot of his things like jiff and
PNG and JPG it wasn't some grand master
plan by the early nerds in web design it
was just a question of different groups
of people seeing a need for a different
type of image for web pages so these
types were created so let's get into it
gif is well you know I'm not going to
give you a history but let me just say
this there are different times when you
want to use a gif or jpg or PNG and I'll
quickly just cover that here although I
haven't have a separate video on images
in web pages but essentially gifts are
great for images have very few colors
like you see has very few colors and
it's and has basic transparency you see
it's semi-transparent you can actually
see a little white outline here which is
the transparency limit of this image
whereas jpg is another image type it
doesn't have transparency you see it's a
solid square JPEGs basically art as a
file format you get you can think of a
file format as a way of just packaging
up an image or packaging up image
information so the JPEG file format is
really best suited for images that have
lots of shifting cars you know how
there's tons and tons of different
colors when you go from the orange to
the red and back to the orange and
because the colors not really that solid
jpg compresses these really well so
though images will can be quite small
but still look good now you could use a
gif format for this particular image
here but the resulting compression
because of the way gif works or a gift
jiff give her gif the way that the the
this file format works the gif file
format works it wouldn't do as good a
job as JPEG when it comes to these type
of photographs where you got all clients
oh but
gradiation in terms of your colors
whereas gif is much better at
compressing solid colors like this it's
better than jpg is so if you have like
text logos that kind of stuff in our
solid in color it's better to use a jiff
if you got photographs natural pictures
it's better to use JPEGs for instance in
this website here on this page you
notice like this button here this is a
gift because you see it's a solid orange
and white wears down here because we
have a photograph of my my mug my face
here we use a JPEG because it has always
see how it goes from light green because
the group degradation really JPEGs does
a superior job although I want to know
that you could use a gift to make this
and you can use a JPEG to make this
button up here it it's just that the
JPEG to get the same quality look you're
going to get a much larger file size
anyhow we'll get into this in more
detail in the the video dedicated to
creating images for the web what is PNG
PNG or paying as the people call is
another file format that is close to gif
in terms of how it packages up image
information in terms of help compresses
PNG came later than gif PNG is much more
advanced it has much more advanced
transparencies and has all kinds of
capabilities that jiff doesn't have so
would you use gif or PNG gif depending
on the software but use the output your
images tend to be slightly smaller than
the equivalent P&amp;amp;G so let's say you know
this reading man P&amp;amp;G is a six kilobyte
file as a jiff it may be a 5.5 kilobyte
file so it's really not such a huge
thing and most of time for any anything
with the very smallest of images like
arrows and stuff I usually use PNG and
for photographs of course I always use
JPEG irregardless in terms of file sizes
you know it's always good to have very
light pages i download quickly but in
today's Internet in today's web or more
and more people are getting high speed
internet and you have you know sites
where you have videos playing and stuff
to get too concerned about how many
kilobytes your pages are is becoming
more and more thing of past anyway when
we get into the video editing excuse me
the image editing video where I show you
how to use Photoshop to prepare images
for the web viste path I'll get into
detail with regards to this anyway we
have our three images here and I want
you to know one last thing and that's
the names of these images you also got
reading dash man sunset in video dash
wheel first of all he knows there's no
space here it's reading dash man not
reading spaceman the reason I do that is
because it's you never want to have
spaces in your file names when it comes
to any files related to websites whether
it be your page names folder names or
image names
mine another thing you should point I
should point out is that I always like
to use all lowercase in the naming
because it's just cleaner as a pulse if
I had if I had uppercase you know
reading man it's actually cleaner to
keep it all lowercase trust me when you
start dealing with tons of images and
tons of pages and your website you're
going to thank me for that and finally I
think a very important thing I want to
point out is that you should name your
images with intelligent names that
describe the images so reading man PNG
sort of tells you what reading man you
know what you're going to see in the
photo sunset tells you what you're going
to see in photo and so on and the reason
you do this is two reasons number one
when you're working with Dreamweaver and
here are these images now or you're just
looking at your images as files you see
how the names tell me something about
the images without me having to go right
click and preview in browser improve
your browser Firefox so you know
dreamweaver then previewed image but
since i gave it an intelligent name I
know what pretty much what the image is
about
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
