doing to Fargo the same day I guess the
tell is the fact that I'm wearing the
same clothes so let's talk about the
career paths in programming this is
something I mentioned in a previous vlog
and something I covered in detail
spoiler not spoiler shameless
self-promotion something I cover in
detail in my killer Python course so
what are career paths in programming
career paths and programming are
essentially that what are the three main
career paths that you can take as a
programmer once you developed your
foundation skills in programming the
career paths include getting a job
number one number two becoming a
freelancer number three writing your own
code that you sell into the marketplace
now I've done all three well getting a
job not so much I did it once for about
three weeks or as a hired gun on a very
high-profile project up here in Canada
where they needed somebody to come in to
take care of certain part of the system
and it was for all kinds of legal
reasons anyway long story short I was
brought in for about three weeks working
on this high-profile project and it was
actually one of the slightest jobs I
have ever done you see most of my adult
career has been as an entrepreneur or in
some form or another my first business
had nothing to do a code but I learned
how to code in early 90s for my business
and then take it from there
I've done a lot of freelance work I've
dealt my own apps and sauces and so on
so forth so yeah let's look at the
career paths you have three career paths
you have the getting a job you got
number two becoming a freelancer number
three selling your code as a product so
there are pros and cons to each each one
has a different lifestyle and for each
of these you have a different route that
you have to take the different steps
that you have to take to get there I go
into detail
in my killer Python course I talk about
all this kind of stuff and I think I'm
going to include a similar module in my
iwd my interactive web developer course
just because people are asking for it so
when you're looking at becoming a coder
or a programmer as a career you have to
first consider your career paths and you
have to consider the type of work that
you want to do the specializations like
again I cover this in a Python course in
terms of Python specializations there's
also specializations in the web stack so
Python specializations I talked about
becoming AI programmer or may become a
web stack programmer may be getting into
Data Sciences etc in the web stack
specializations include a front-end
developer full stack developer back-end
developer WordPress specialist and
there's other specializations as well
each of these specializations will
determine what specific skills you got
to get into so what do I mean by that so
if you're getting into the web stack if
you're going to do we're pressed you're
gonna become a wordpress developer then
of course you have to learn your basics
as always you know 2 H 2 O 5 2 css3 a
touch of JavaScript and a pinch of PHP
would be very useful as well because
WordPress is created in PHP not I
understand necessary but it's kind of a
useful skill to have and then of course
you're gonna need WordPress specific
skills that's the specialization so you
have to know how to install and set up
and configure WordPress and then you
need to know things like the WordPress
ecosystem all the plugins available the
themes are available etc understand how
to deal with its vulnerabilities I don't
mitigate against that and of course
theme building and I learned how to
build themes in my iwd package by the
way I teach theme building which is the
hardest thing to learn we make it easy
with the course but in terms of the
wordpress world's the hardest thing and
you may be asking yourself why would you
become a wordpress specialist well
because 30 35 % of world's websites run
on WordPress lots of them are small
business owners
and for them to install a new theme or
to install a plug-in or whatever it
could be a daunting task well if you're
the freelancer or somebody works for a
firm it does this kind of service for
small businesses this is a great
opportunity for you that's what are the
niches what are the huge niches niches
and I see a G niche yeah in the coding
world is the WordPress developer because
it's not sexy enough for young nerdlings
they want to go do node which there's
far fewer jobs far fewer business
opportunities meanwhile you get this
whole WordPress PHP thing which is huge
so if you're wondering a smart ones you
jump into the whole PHP WordPress world
you can make a lot of money so she does
a freelancer because it's just so much
work out there further for you so anyway
yeah specializations in web development
and the web space they're
specializations of Python or
specializations and a lot of different
programming languages and technologies
and then you got to also consider as I
said in the beginning of this whole
thing is the career paths well if you
want to get in as an entrepreneur as an
employee c-suite as an employee as a
freelancer or you want to deliver your
own codebase each of these things have
different pearls and cons and each of
these career paths have different
personality types that are required if
you're what it'll work for somebody you
like that stability you don't want to
have to go get clients you want that
guaranteed paycheck cetera etc then the
employee track is probably best for you
but if you want to create your own work
environments you want to manufacture or
create or design your own way of working
and you want to go out there and meet
people and get clients and deal with
clients that requires a different
personality trait and it requires a
different set of skills in terms of how
you navigate that and I talked about
that admitting of logs and some of my
courses as well anyway I hope that's
useful to you career paths in terms of
programming is something to consider to
wrap it up here career paths and
coatings have two codes
when you're getting into the game but at
the end of the day though you still need
to understand your core you still still
need to understand the basics of
programming if you're gonna do any of
this
and that's why I teach that stuff all
right bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
