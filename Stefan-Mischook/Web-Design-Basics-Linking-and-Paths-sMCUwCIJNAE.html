video tutorial is a web design basics
video tutorial and it's meant to clarify
a commonly asked question I find that
what are most difficult things at what
designers have when they're first of all
people learning what design is linking
from one page to the next the hyperlink
the link tag is the heart of what makes
the web work because it allows the web
to be interconnected another thing we're
going to talk about well first I'm going
to show you how to link from one page to
another and another thing we're going to
do is we're going to look over a basic
concept theory of paths this is what is
actually the source of a lot of web
designers problems is they don't
understand paths properly so when you
understand paths you understand linking
from one page to the next and you avoid
all kind of errors and at the same time
of course you're going to learn about
how to properly link from one page to
another that said if of course you're
more than a very beginner at web design
this this particular video is probably
going to bore us are you you're probably
not going to want to watch this one but
if your total beginner totally green and
you're having trouble with the light
with hyperlinks and linking from one
page to an X then this is a very good
video for you
what I've done is I've created a few
basic web pages inside this folder on my
desktop now before I go on if you're a
Mac user this all applies to the Mac as
well although things are going to look a
bit different for you you can still
follow along though so what I've done is
created a couple pages and I created an
empty folder here and we'll get into
using these very shortly so first let's
launch the first page and it says page 1
and page 1 of course has a link here and
page 1 links to page 2 now you see this
error file not found this is the error
of a lot of people have when you're
trying to link from one page to an ex if
I do this with Internet Explorer we just
open up the same file with Internet
Explorer and I click the link again you
get this page cannot be displayed error
so what we're going to do now is look at
why this page cannot be displayed
so this is the page that we were
clicking where the link was was on and
we were clicking the link in that page
and was trying to find this page middle
is not launching so let's take a look at
it cause we're going to open while just
going to hit at it so it opens up this
simple text editor now if you look at
the hyperlink tag the a href says is
equal to page dash dash 1 dot HTML as
you can see here we're looking for page
dash two so let's just say that control
save file save and we're going to
relaunch this and let's close this click
on that and of course it gets us back to
we got we're on page two here right so I
go back to page one this is page one
back check out page two and what gets us
to page two so the link works again this
is really simple stuff I know but you
want to make sure if you're getting that
error page that we saw earlier you want
to make sure that the name of your page
matches exactly the name of where you
want to go to where you're linking to
right so this is very important so let's
see another way how we can reproduce
that error let's say you're getting the
error even though the name of the page
in your link this name here matches the
name of this page for some reason may
not work and the reason is probably not
working is because of something called
paths so what does that mean well let me
just demonstrate this and I think will
become clear let's say you're linking to
a page this is the page where here page
two and page 2 happens to be in the
folder called level two now if we launch
page 2 again and we try and go there we
get that error again and the reason
we're getting that error is because it
can find page 2 of course right document
not found the reason can't find page 2
is because page two is now actually in
the folder called level two so which is
we're going to have to change our link
to tell the browser to look for page 2
in the level 2 folder so let's do that
now so you're going to hit edit and it's
how we do it waitest I'm just going to
paste in level 2 and I put a slash this
is a forward slash because it's leaning
forward this key on the PC is actually
just shares the key with the question
mark so it's just a forward slash
against leaning forward this is the
opposite of the backslash which is found
this is a backslash it's sort of leaning
backward so what does the slash tell us
this tells the computer that we want to
look inside this is this is a folder we
want to look inside of now we got to put
a slash because we don't put a slash is
it going to assume that this is one big
file or if you put a space this is one
if this is one file this is a file name
the slash basically tells the computer
that we're going into another folder or
another directory now in this case the
folder is level two so that's what we
have a slash so let's save this and
we're going to launch this page and we
check it out and of course we're hitting
page two so let's check just click this
link it takes us back to page one and
we'll see what happens up we have a
problem again the problem is exactly the
same thing it's the SEC excuse me we
have the exactly the same prom in page
to that link no longer works why because
we've now move where page two is it's
actually inside the folder level two and
so you can't find the page one right so
why because when you have a link like
this where you don't specify a different
directory as we did or a different
folder it's the browser seems that page
one in this case is actually sitting on
the same level say it's sitting in the
same folder as page as page one so
you're not because we're not telling it
to go anywhere say just you know page
one is right here excuse me
pages on HTML is right here so what we
need to do is we need to tell the
computer where to find page one now
here's something is going to be a little
confusing for some of you this is how
you do it you go dot dot slash
when you have this piece of text here
dot slash that tells the browser that
we're going up one level in the folder
hierarchy or the directory hierarchy
this could be a little bit difficult for
some people to grasp so just bear with
me if you think about we go up this is
the this is the the level this is a top
level so because we're going down like
this that's level two and let's say I
create another folder I'll say we call
it level what can call it level 3
without anything we like really this
would be level but three right so we're
going deeper think of it as like a stack
if you will so this is the top of the
stack right as far as this page is
concerned or for starting from this is
the starting point so this is level two
so be down one level in the stack and
should be down to levels in the stack
right so if we edit this page this tells
us we are down one level and stack so
basically you have dot dot slash like
this in front of the name you're telling
the browser we're going up one level
we're going backwards so page 2 knows it
has to go up see the apparel and goes up
to page one so let's say let's even
higher up so let's say we have page two
and we'll put it in levels level 3 here
we just edited I'm going to call it I'm
just going to call it oops three in this
case because if level because this page
is actually two levels deep right let me
make this very clear see this is the top
level 12 because it's two levels down
let me edit this we have to put two of
these so I make sense because each of
these that the browser sees it means go
up one level so since we're two levels
deep here we have to go up two levels so
like this so now we're going up two
levels right
I'm going to save this this is page
three we say that so let's actually even
though I called a page 2 doesn't matter
because it's the links in all the matter
so here it is we're going to page one
watch what happens it works why because
we told it to go up two levels
alright we're almost done here so let's
say you're in page one here and you want
to link down to level this page to down
here what's actually change this name so
just so it's it's clear so I'll just
going to call it page three although you
can call it anything all you want so
let's say you wanted to link from page
one which is two levels up down to page
three well you're going to have to tell
you're gonna have to tell page one the
page one link where to go so you have to
go down through level two and then you
got to go into folder level three right
so let's do that in our code right now
it's going to edit and i'm just going to
just going to paste this so i just
remember the name of the page so let me
just create a new link and it's going to
check out page 3 which is two levels
down so how do we do that well we know
page three dot HTML so it's going to
call say three that's the actual name of
page we want to open we know that page 3
dot HTML is not in level two right this
is this is the folder if you remember
right it's not in level two it's
actually in folder level three which is
below folder level tour inside a folder
level two right so what we need to do
whoops we need to do is tell it that so
we're going to go like this we're going
to go first go to level two and then go
to folder level three and here's our
page so so we're giving a browser the
path to this page we know this is a page
because it's got the dot extension here
we know these are folders because they
have no extension centers their preceded
by the slashes we have our slashes here
so you're starting to see so if we want
to go to see you're starting to see how
since we want to go to a file in page 3
we have to tell specifically where it is
we can't just say go to level 3
alone we have to say no no frizzy go to
level two and then in the folder level
to either look for level three and then
here's our page so let's see if that
will work i'll save that
say this school here page one so you
check out page three up it works why
because the path to page three was
specifically specified in the link as we
saw people go view page source you see
so we totally love go to level 2 folder
then level 3 and here you go so if you
ever find yourself with that annoying
error message and you can't figure out
why it's either because your page names
are wrong in your links or you're not
specifying a proper path to your
particular file
I wanted to give you another look at the
files or excuse me yeah at the files so
that you get a better idea of the
hierarchy so here it is again we're
having our level we got our base root of
the site level 2 folder and our level 3
folder so let's look at that with
Dreamweaver again here's the base of
sight our level of 2 folder our level 3
folder so as you can see as as
Dreamweaver displays it you see there's
clearly a hierarchy since since level 3
folders inside the level 2 folder and so
on so I hope that this visual
representation of the paths of the
hierarchy between folders and pages and
how they relate to each other will help
you understand this very important basic
concept in web design
I hope that clarifies that situation
this is a common problem for beginners
so don't beat yourself up if you're
having problems I remember having the
exact same problem in my day and it's
probably a good idea to create a bunch
of web pages or a few of them put them
in different folders and try linking to
them and try experimenting with paths</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
