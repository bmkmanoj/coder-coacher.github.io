markup language like HTML from a
programming language like Java Script is
that in a programming language you can
make decisions you can't do that in HTML
whereas in JavaScript you can actually
see what somebody is doing and then have
the JavaScript take an action based on
what's happening that is one of the key
differences between a programming
language and a markup language so what
we're going to do in this video is look
at one of the most basic decision-making
mechanisms built into JavaScript and
many other languages something called
the if statement
so we're back in our well dreamweaver
cs4 in this case but again you can use
any text editor and you see I've
pre-built the basic structure of an if
statement you have the keyword if two
brackets and then two curly brackets so
the best way to explain this is actually
just jump into it if three is less than
four and in here i'm going to write some
code so i'm just going to say console
dot log and i'll say i don't know indeed
it is so let's take a look at the
console and see how that turns out there
we go indeed it is so basically the way
the if statement works about anything in
between these brackets if that's true
then anything in between these brackets
but follow it will will happen now if
this was false I'll just do the opposite
3 is greater than 4 then javascript will
go up this is false and it will skip
whatever code is in between these two
curly braces so let's try this out as
you can see it disappears if statements
are exceptionally important and you're
going to be using them all the time you
can be using them for instance in a
conjunction with a function so let's use
a function that we used earlier remember
index of so we're going to go string str
our string variable i'm going to say in
dec sloops index of and we're going to
look for the letter e so if the string
thus far string rather contains the
letter e then we're going to run this
otherwise it won't so what's this we
save that let's run that and script
indeed it is so let's say we say index
you know of no space notice it obviously
there's no space in here so we
run this again so we relocate and you
can see it doesn't fire off
we show you another example yeah mostly
a now you you would expect that since a
is not part of hello right spring hello
it you figure it would return false what
I mean returning on remember a function
returns value so the index of function
would return a value the first time it
said it was one right so you figure a we
remember last time we did string index
of a it returns a minus one now
javaScript is an interesting language
it's a great language but sometimes it's
kind of weird so typically minus one
you'd figure it mean false but it
doesn't in JavaScript unfortunately so
even though in this case there's no
value there's no a in the string for
some reason if we'll still fire off as
if it is true and then we'll see this
Rama undersea indexes ooh it's true so
for some reason index of if it sees
minus one if I if rather C's minus 1
because we know that index of a returns
minus y night i'll show you what i mean
by that if i go here
console dot except minus one is what
make it so it's not so confusing for you
guys so couch C student it shouldn't do
that but litter so we got console dot
log got string index EA so soon see you
see that index of returns minus one when
it doesn't find a value right so that
sucks so it's a it's no good so what we
can do we can change this so it gives me
an opportunity to you where to be change
this so i can go okay we could do this
with you go minus 10 get in here minus
one double equals so this double equal
operators basically is called a
comparison operator because it compares
this with this so we know that from down
here we know this will output minus one
so if minus 1 is equal to minus 1 we say
council dot log ouch so we're going to
do that let me just erase this so we
refresh that don't worry I'm going to
get back and i'll explain those things a
little bit so i'll just come out of
course so let me explain this now these
double arrows this is an operator and
because it operates on right member we
had operators like the dot operator and
equals this is the assignment operator
as it is signs of value we're assigning
the value of hello to the VAR string in
this case situation we have double
equals what we're actually doing is
called a comparison operator we're
asking JavaScript to compare what's on
this side to whatever is on this side so
because it's in an if we're going to get
in a vibe we're going to get a if it's
going to evaluate that so it's like
we're basically saying compare minus 1
versus the output of string of index of
and tell us what it is and in this case
because they are equal it will be true
so because it's true this is run
I hope that makes sense if i said- to
that should be false and we should get
nothing in the console let's try that
out see that nothing appears right
because this we know outputs minus one
so let's go back to minus one and we go
index of e so we know that this will
output a index position of 0 1 but since
this is not true it will also be false
as well I hope that makes sense think
about it if not play with it at home so
let's try it out again see how it's
right so we know that that is true right
Oh a second that shouldn't picture when
we try it again we say then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
