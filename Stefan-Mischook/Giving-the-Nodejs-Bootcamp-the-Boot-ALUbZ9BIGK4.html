and that's because the cameras at a big
distance unless I just want to see how
it's going to sound anyway so the furry
mic is if it gets in the way my
apologies so I'm going to answer a
question of putting me a couple of days
ago from a Youtube subscriber and yeah
I'll just going to skim through it cuz I
don't bore you guys so I've been a
subscriber for a while just sign up to
your IWD course thank you very much I
enjoy watching the videos and experience
i watch a recent video about boot camps
and left me wondering ooh boy I am in a
situation of confusion at the moment
after watching the video and was hoping
you could straighten my compass as he
says I value advice all right I was
self-employed contractor for 30 years
that's quite a while the daily physical
work has taken its toll on my body I'm
now 60 and trying to change careers
again to become a web dev or do
something from the neck up yeah I can
see that I can see that as you get older
your body becomes less resilient so even
more reason to stay in shape I'm sure
this guy's in shape but you know 60 or
60 but nonetheless if you're a young
developer try to get into a habit of
staying in shape it's going to pay off
down the road I can guarantee I've
always had a passion for computer since
I own my Tandy model 3 I went to night
school back in 2000 per year but took
what was the best web dev course
available at the time unfortunately
light got in a way but a part of 15
years is now here and Here I am trying
to get back on my feet what it isn't is
that what you learned in 2 mm the web
depth stuff that you learnt in 2000's
largely all outdated for the most part
although the basics are still the basics
program is still programming but boy
have web design and development
practices changed since the year 2000
it's huge I remember a friend of mine
who cut his teeth in the 90s with me
he came to me about the year 2003 I'd
lost contact with him and he had been a
manager for one of the very pretty big
well-established web-based business back
at the time and he was somewhat of a
coder anyhow long story short 2003 he
realized he could sort of decide he had
to get back into the game again and he
realized that how much the game had
changed
it was drastic into from from just like
98 to 2003 so yet to basically relearn
everything from scratch and I remember
that conversation because I remember
saying to me I know I feel because I was
on top of it unlike him I kept myself up
to date with things but again then there
was another radical change I say in the
wall when html5 came around I guess
around 2012 that was that was huge
because we went from XHTML to html5 and
everything changed again not so big a
change versus 98 to 2003 but nonetheless
anyway so don't worry about you know not
having completed things back in the day
it would have been better but it's not
really crucial so he said I tried
self-study for a year and you to me but
I felt it needed something a bit more
structured to move things along so I
wrote in a bootcamp almost a year ago
and I am currently enrolled but have
been off for two months take care of
some personal issues not a good things
as I forgot a lot so far run through
HTML CSS jQuery now finishing of
JavaScript API is about to learn node
then react I've been there understanding
so far but not necessarily what I would
call proficient especially when it comes
to functions I am subscribed online to
only a few experienced developers I am
subscribed online to only if you dispute
only a few experienced developers as a
feel that my best resources for advice
but then again everyone has an opinion
okay I guess he says he subscribed to
three online developers different
opinions I'm just going to power through
this because it's a pretty long email
here's this dilemma coding is taking me
away from WordPress my mentors frown on
CMS and think hand code is best way to
go I've been told that you make much
less working with WordPress design as a
coder I have also heard that it is not
accurate both concepts told by
experienced developers very confusing
who should I believe stats online
confirm WordPress guys make less is that
just certain instances but the money is
important I've been led to be believe a
trying to go at it on your own as a noob
is near impossible today some have said
work for a company another has say of
because of my age I should go freelance
route spin-spin-spin
what's a six year old fellow to do I
live in NYS not a fan of commuting I
like WordPress I like doweling designed
layout and design I want to be able to
code at least for what I need to do to
get the point of being able to make some
money do I continue to push forward and
learn no Jazz react or my better hitting
the breaks and divert to learning PHP
MySQL my bootcamp does not teach those I
just don't want to waste time learning
stuff that isn't going to provide a mini
benefit what I don't need right now I
can learn down the road I understand
that it is also to do with what the job
requires my end point go if there's
decent money in it to become WordPress
efficient and flew ads as a wordpress
site renovator be designer of existing
sites and create new sites or be
employed to do the same i would
appreciate any professional guidance
suggestions from a guy who's got the
experience and finger on the pulse of
what's going on today tomorrow so yeah
well if you're in a boot camp you paid
for and you only have a couple months
left after a year I would say your Moz
will just you know get the training
learn the node
learn to react because it's just going
to be two tools in your toolbox that you
might find very very useful down the
road you never know you if you're having
troubles with functions that tells me
that you steam need to go back and
revisit the basics once again it's a
classic example of what I preach all the
time one of the fundamentals I keep
hammering is that the key to all this
stuff is to really grasp the basics well
once you have the basics of functions
you stand completely in objects and
collection types and databases and how
the request-response cycle these are all
the basics but I really emphasize in my
courses why because they're so important
because there's a fundamental they're
fundamental to all this technology all
the languages would it be JavaScript
Python PHP Java C sharp
whatever all this kind of stuff is very
important understanding request response
cycles key to web apps now it's not
going to have a huge impact but it's
going to really open your mind to how
all this stuff works
I think that's 60 definitely I would
think to myself it's the startup world
is not for you because startups are
looking for people were willing to work
very long hours for less money in hope
at three four five six seven ten years
down the line you get the big payoff
where 80% of time it doesn't happen and
that's just it's not a business
statistics eighty percent of startups
fail so to keep that in mind so if
you're twenty years old thirty years old
you have some time left in you
to get into a startup sure you can get a
lot of experience and develop a lot of
contacts but at sixty I don't think
that's probably the route for you I
think the route would be to either go
work for a small company that's doing
WordPress work once you get some
WordPress chop stick that you can show
if you want to do that and the object
other option is to and my preferred
option again because this is my
preference is to get into to get into
freelance work
a wordpress professional or wordpress
web developer or wordpress web designer
and the reason to say that is because
then you're gonna have a lot more
control over your schedule of your time
and I think that the you could approach
clients would be more open to you
especially at first because that first
when you're newb in any industry you
don't have to prove yourself so you
don't have to do a couple freebie sites
now WordPress is so widely used by small
businesses that there's probably a lot
of businesses out there that you could
approach so perhaps you'll be able to
find business owners who are within your
age bracket late forties well 50s 60s
and they may be much more open to
working with you now you have a
background you did 30 years another work
or I forget if you mention it an email
perhaps you'll be able to reach out to
your former employers or people in that
industry where you could bring to the
table not only your WordPress skills and
your coding skills you'll be able to
bring to it your knowledge of that
industry that domain which will help you
to put out and better put out better
WordPress based sites or modify them and
that could be a good selling point for
you as well so to conclude is pretty
long vlog because I I was stuttering
through your email so my apologies for
that
I would suggest that route with regards
to the bootcamp you look at two months
Mazal do it those skills are there to be
to learn to learn I would really on the
side as well go back and to basics of
coding learn your functions well learn
object-oriented programming these are
basics that should be second nature to
you and then the rest will come much
more easily and I can tell you that much
but I understand I remember that
conceptually trying to understand what a
function was and well it was what was
the point of object-oriented code etc
etc that's why I cover that extensively
it's key so yep that's what I would do I
would be leaning towards a freelance
area in terms of WordPress with the Erb
imagine perhaps more people doing
WordPress work working for somebody else
would earn less than a pure coder but
there's different things you do in
WordPress there's WordPress theme
creation which requires a good knowledge
of the WordPress architecture theme
architecture and that means you have to
understand code as you HTML CSS touch
your JavaScript but PHP you'd be more
important WordPress was created with PHP
so you got to learn your PHP in that
situation so I imagine if you're a
master theme creator and editor or
somebody who can go in there and tweak
it and change things or somebody has
knowledge of all the plugins that are
available in the WordPress world I bet
you the salaries go much higher in that
situation as opposed to just couldn't
configures and sets up WordPress maybe
does modify as themes to a lesser degree
that being said all bets are off on
yourself employed in your consultant
then you can start making a lot more
money because as you become more
efficient even though you tell your
client you're charging X amount of
dollars per hour in fact of the matter
is your efficiency will increase
tremendously and the amount that you can
charge will increase quite a bit so you
got to look at it look at that as well
so that is my council amaz will finish
it reactives like I think it's a
predominant library for Jas these days
so a maza learn it you never know you
may use it every now and then and who
knows it might creep into WordPress in
some way but I would go back to basics I
would get your portfolio site up there
I'd be started looking for freebie
clients one or two but you can work with
they say listen you know I'm just
starting us up I'm going to do the site
free to begin with just so you can start
developing some contacts and reputation
so forth and developing your workflow
very important I don't emphasize is
enough I think in my videos a developer
workflow was huge whether you're doing
WordPress work or you're writing apps
and node you have to develop a really
good workflow to maximize the efficiency
of your time and that will go a long way
you know in terms of you becoming
profitable especially as a freelancer so
I hope that answers that question
