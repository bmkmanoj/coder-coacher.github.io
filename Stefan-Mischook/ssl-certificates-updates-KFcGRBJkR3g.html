with killer sites and killer PHP calm in
this video tutorial miles on a vision
story this is a video blog I want to
just quickly make a couple points about
ssl certificates by the way I'm just
wearing a hat because of having a bad
hair day so I don't feel like combing my
hair anyhow recently my one my ssl
certificates came close to expiring a
registered it for a year at a time and
it expired no it didn't expire renewed
it but then i forgot to upload the new
certificate to the server now the thing
is when you have an ssl certificate you
can buy for one year three year two
years three years five years sometimes
more i advise and think that your store
is going to be operational for a while
to get at least a three year or more
certificate because when the certificate
is up for renewal whether you get a
one-year two-year etc you have to
actually reapply a new certificate every
time so what happened to me for period
about 78 days though and renew that i
had forgotten to upload it so when
people were attempting to purchase
videos from us they would if they hit
the credit card option they hit this big
screen with a warning but the
certificate was not secure and was
unsecured shopping which you know
doesn't help in terms of sales any
products when people get this huge
warning message on there on our web
browser so there you go that's a lesson
when you renew an ssl certificate and
that's just to keep on a way but you use
when you have an online store so you
have the you know two HTTP / https HTTP
if you look in there in your URLs in
your any websites it starts with HTTP
colon slash slash and
secure server is HTTP s colon slash
slash and if you have that as the web
browser is going to be looking for a
certificate and if it doesn't find it
valocer tificate but has not been
updated recently or so on you're going
to get that error which is going to
scare away a lot of people so yeah if
you do get certificate and you got to
store but you feel it's going to be
there for a while I would advise you get
at least a three-year certification
certificate certificate certificate
there we go otherwise you may run into a
problem with me when you forget a year
or two later or two years later you
forget to upload to the certificate and
your store will be effectively offline
for those hours or days and I can
guarantee you that if there's that huge
warning message this site is insecure
you're going to you're going to be if
your sales are going to be effective
affected in a negative manner there you
go that's my new video tip for today and
we'll talk to we'll talk soon ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
