I just want to quickly comment on one
other benefit of learning multiple
languages whether it be markup languages
or programming languages or just yet
spoken languages and that is to stave
off dementia and Alzheimer's all the
studies are coming in and it's pretty
conclusive the people who continue to
learn new in different languages or new
and different things it actually goes a
long way to contributing against or
preventing these diseases from coming on
and it only makes sense because as you
learn new things new your brain is
stimulated rather to create new pathways
to sort of restructure itself and to
adapt to what you're throwing at it but
if you keep doing the same thing over
and over again it's not a good thing
it's not a good thing so besides all the
economic benefits but I've cited about
learning new programming languages and
so on and how is this going to improve
your abilities as a programmer it in of
itself you it's actually good for your
health too so you know it's not for your
bank account for your brain you know
learn new languages is just you know
there's so many benefits to it and
that's pretty much it ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
