video in this video we're going to learn
how to create forms in HTML so this is
gonna be a quick video we're gonna jump
through two paces
pans gonna be quick so on your desktop
whether it be on Mac or PC you want to
create a new simple text document so on
PC you want to use I don't I don't have
an option for notepad so I'm gonna go
into my menus and they're all programs
accessories you might get out notepad
it's important you use notepad in a
WordPad because you know if you use word
or something you're gonna add all these
extra characters that you don't want
anyway so what's let's create our form I
assume for this video
that you've done the basic HTML before
so you understand that so I'm not gonna
get into all these little basic details
about what tags are and so on I assume
that you know that so this is gonna be a
bare-bones page and of course I'm typing
a little bit slower since I'm trying to
discuss what's going on at the same time
alright so what we want to do is start
with the very first form tag so of
course it's called form and this is a
very basic form tag that's really not
usable but it does set the form up so
let's add something called an input type
now an input is basically so we'll just
say input type input type equals text
this will create a text box we'll take a
look at our second so this is a very
basic form input type equals submit that
will create the submit button so we can
send the form somewhere so we'll save
that I'm gonna save it as you don't say
those txt well I'll see if it as an HTML
file so that is called index
dot html' if you don't know why I'm
using index and so on and dot html' all
this is kind of confusing for you you
need to do a basic video on web design
so let's look at this now and open this
let me just minimize this so we can see
what's going on and here you go boys and
girls we have our very first form beyond
our input box we've got our form so if
you're typing stuff and it does nothing
because we have to tell the form where
to send the information to that's the
key so let's open up our text editor
again so we got our form and we haven't
told it anything so what's
so we need to tell the forum where we
want to send this information to the
information that we collect in the input
boxes
so let's but to add that now it's an
attribute of the tags or the action
attribute so this basically tells the
form or a webpage where you want the
form information sent to I said that a
couple times so we're going to say
what's called response dot HTML so I'm
gonna create a I'm gonna create that
page in two seconds here so responsive
HTML so that's that's pretty cool so
let's actually create another file new
and okay I screwed up there boys and
girls
so let's uh let's try this again here
open with notepad action response HTML
let's save all this file new paste just
take out the form again this is very
simple I want to call this response dot
HTML sorry so we got response dot HTML
and this is the owl doesn't say hi so
let's let's check this out first of all
let's launch the index we minimize this
for you guys hold on so let's submit
something and of course it takes us to
response dot HTML right response dot
HTML and that page just said hi so let's
let's see if what we can do next what's
one of the things we're going to look at
index cut that with notepad and I want
to put in a new attribute in the form
tag something called method equals now
there's two ways to sand one is more
than two but the two main ways to send a
form to a target script or page like a
PHP page or or a dot in that page or
something
is the sending either by a get let me
see we have get or something called post
now I'm going to get into this in a
second post now your programmer is going
to tell you what method they prefer
depending on how the script is
configured in a nutshell and I'm not
going to get into new details here the
method attribute tells the form how to
send the information you see there are
more than a couple ways the two most
popular ways or get imposed to send the
information to the server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
