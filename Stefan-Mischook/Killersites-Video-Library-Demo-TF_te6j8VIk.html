keller sites calm in this video i want
to give you a quick tour of the calcite
university web design video tutorial
library this is essentially while we're
looking at the public home page here
this is essentially a video tutorial
collection consisting of literally
hundreds and hundreds of videos on all
subjects related to web design
everything from actionscript to CSS to
dreamweaver javascript photoshop tons of
PHP and web design basics of course you
know HTML CSS laying out forms tables
even html5 css3 stuff wordpress anyway
you get the idea you have a huge
collection to access and it's all
delivered to you via a
subscription-based service meaning when
you buy subscription you can buy for
three months or full year you will have
full access to our videos where you log
on and you click on whatever videos you
want to see and you watch him soap on
this homepage here this is the public
home page you'll see if we click on one
of the links so beginners CSS nine
videos click down you see a list of
videos now because this is the public
section you notice that some of the
videos are clickable you've got the blue
highlight here and some down here or not
obviously these are the teasers we're
showing you what you have access to when
you actually join the subscription to
view a video all you have to do is click
on a link and it will spawn a window as
you see here and then you click play and
away you go the video starts playing for
you no big deal you can you can pause it
you can fast forward and just close it
when you're done if you want to come
back a later on and view the video again
just click on it again you also notice
how the video link has changed color
from a blue to a grey letting you know
that you just viewed that video
beyond that you notice that on the side
we have a newsletter directly related to
the University this is something you can
join for free and it will keep you
informed of any changes to the
University video tutorial library this
usually means new video content we're
always producing new content for the
video library so you can expect an hour
to of new content every month if not
much more as I said there are already
many hundreds of videos I think we're
getting close to actually a thousand
videos the videos range in length from
you know five minutes 7 or 20 minutes I
probably the average video is between
7-10 minutes of peace so it's really a
great value
to join as I said you got two options
the subscription services and you just
click on whatever one you want so I'm
going to click on the year and what
we've done for the University Library is
to use paypal to process the payments
now you don't have to be a paypal member
to use this you can use your credit card
to join up we just use paypal because it
just makes things easy for everybody if
for some reason you're having troubles
with paypal you can just email us and
we'll fix you up we have other ways we
can process a credit card through our
alternate system through our normal
store or you can just say even say
there's a money order or something so
there's no worries just we try to make
it as easy as possible for you guys if
you ever need to contact us you just hit
the contact link of course and we have a
Heuer we you know talk about some common
issues in terms of the subscription
itself it's a you're not committed so if
you buy a three-month subscription and
you decide what you don't want to renew
it's no big deal you can just you can go
to paypal you can cancel it there or you
just contact us and we'll cancel your
subscription for you so you don't have
to worry about that there's no
obligation beyond you know beyond
anything normal bone which that again
there is no obligation period you know
once you subscribe you'll get an email
back from the system which your username
and password this is usually processed
within a couple minutes and you'll be
able to log on you can log on up here or
you can go to a login page itself your
choice so what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to log on using my account so
you can take a look at what is going on
inside the system as you can see here we
go we just logged in and it's a very
similar layout of course it's a little
bit more Spartan because we want to make
more room for for the content so you'll
see what's new up here
and some highlights and information on
the side here of course the ability to
join a newsletter but we've also added
you have account information when your
account is going to be renewed so you
get a you keep track of that and you
actually have some links to our form
communities some recent community posts
and questions and recent blog activity
so this is sort of like a home base for
yo control panel where you can access
this information the heart of this of
course though is in the videos
themselves arranged in alphabetical
order what you're going to notice here
is that inside the university there's a
lot more content then you see in the
public homepage so I'm just going to
show you to a public whole page really
really quickly saw my killer sites here
and I just scroll down web design videos
tutorials for children subscription
excuse me ocurre I'm logged back in here
I would have to login out of another
account but you get the idea there's
that there's a big difference basically
between what we show the public versus
what we have so for instance dreamweaver
cs5 which right now is the latest
version we we click you know is we have
over 50 videos so there's a heck of a
lot of content here and we also have the
source files related to whatever topics
we cover or projects recover in those in
these videos so for instance tables
click on that load it up and hear your
dreamweaver cs5 tables video starts to
run and play for you no problem so it's
it's pretty complete
so there you have it if you're a total
beginner to web design or web
programming or maybe you're highly
experienced and you want to polish your
skills and I don't know advanced PHP as
you can see we got a lot of object
oriented PHP and form validation and tag
clouds and crud or maybe your small
business owner our trainer who wants to
polish up some skills maybe you want to
learn some WordPress theming or maybe
you want to learn a little bit of jQuery
right here we have it here and this
collection the advantage of being a
subscribers at this collection will keep
expanding and will keep improving and as
a subscriber you will be able to offer a
speed back and we'll take it much more
seriously than if you were just some guy
off the web membership has its
privileges and there you go one last
point I want to make about all our video
content which I think differentiates us
from other people is what we do provide
tons of tips and tricks videos so you
get that out there so we do have that
but another thing that we have is we
also carry complete courses on
particular subject so for instance we
have a beginners flash cs4 course 33
videos we have a beginners JavaScript
course 39 videos we you know we get
photoshop cs5 course almost 60 videos 59
so we have complete courses for you we
have tips and tricks videos and even
more to that you'll find that we have
curriculums in there and the idea is to
put into your hands not just a bunch of
skills that are unrelated but we really
want to get into your hands complete
skill sets career building skill sets we
want to turn you into marketable web
professionals if my if that's your goal
so we have a full comment here
and there's a whole bunch of new stuff
coming out I'm not going to talk about
in this particular video anyhow so
that's pretty much it so I so I invite
you to take a look at the kill site
university web design video tutorial
library if you have any questions feel
free to contact us and we will do our
best to answer the any questions you may
have as quickly as possible thanks for
