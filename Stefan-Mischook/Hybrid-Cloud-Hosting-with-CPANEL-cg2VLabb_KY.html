type of hybrid cloud hosting solution
that you're seeing more and more of out
there and what that is is combining
cloud hosting which has all those
advantages namely that it's super
scalable easy to migrate Auto backups
all kinds of really cool features and
capabilities and your hybrid this with
the use of control panels like cPanel so
cPanel a company is one of the big two
companies of ever provide control panels
for hosting you got cPanel and you got
Plus can't believe it is I've used both
in the past these days I have a cPanel
overlay so I use both your standard
cloud I have a digitalocean installed
where basically it's like here you go
here's a cloud see you later buddies
good luck you better know how to set up
and run servers and configure and patch
them and do all this kind of headache
stuff to me one of my basic philosophies
is that developers shouldn't be messing
around keeping servers up to date and
configuring servers at least ideally
that's the situation I wouldn't want to
be involved especially if you're a
freelancer or maybe you're a small but
are doing freelance work for small
businesses or maybe you have a very
small startup you your bootstrapping
with your buddy do you really want to be
messing around trying to figure out all
kinds of server installation issues the
option of going cloud with a control
panel is kind of the best of both worlds
you get the control panel and I'll talk
about cPanel where it's in the cloud but
you get the cPanel it allows you to
configure server click click click setup
Python and install click click setup a
ruby click latex choose what version of
PHP with version of MySQL etc etc so
give you all this ability to quickly and
easily get your server up and running
and make changes to it without any of
the headaches without having to know
or have a great understanding of server
administration I'm taking Linux here
that is where I would be going for you
so I have both a digitalocean install
where I have to pay another company to
do the provisioning so it just makes it
easy then I still have to be able to log
in and use command line and patch it
update it to all kinds of silly things
whereas I have a hybrid cloud base
hosting with a company called formula up
here in Montreal where they provide all
the advantages of the cloud including on
top of that having a control panel setup
so it just makes my life easy now with
the control panel setup I have more
limits in terms of my configurations but
generally speaking we have it has not
caused any issues with our apple
whatsoever and sometimes when I have to
allocate RAM to a particular app etc I
have to contact a tech support but I
just send them a quick tech support
request and they handle it within the
same day usually within an hour and I
don't have to worry about it I that then
I don't have to worry about patching the
server updating and keeping you all the
OS up to date etc Exeter it's just a big
monkey off my back where I don't have to
worry about that they take care of auto
backups and restores they do all these
things and guess what the price is
pretty much the same as using a digital
ocean a dumb dumb server as I'd call it
what do you have to do everything
yourself to me cloud hosting was great
is great I think it's a great hosting
option for people who are who want more
control and want to be have more
flexibility in terms of their hosting
environment for their apps you don't
need that for your typical website or
typical WordPress site or a CMS site
anyway the cloud provides a great
advantage but the disadvantage with the
cloud is you've got all those it's it's
kind of like naked kind of like going
backwards in terms of the
level of automation the level of
services that comes with that type of
hosting so I'm glad to see that cPanel
is now working with cloud providers to
sort of combine these two worlds do you
have a beautiful hybrid type of hosting
solution which I highly recommend
especially for young developers again I
don't believe developers need to become
expert server administrators I think
it's overkill
all right we'll talk soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
