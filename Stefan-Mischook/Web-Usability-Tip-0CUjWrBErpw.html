sights calm and CSS tutorial dawn net in
this quick video I'm gonna give you a
little course on usability something
that we just discovered in the recent
revamp of the CSS tutorial website
so let's well right here in front of you
we have the new version of CSS tutorial
along the same lines as our our
university layout cure sites University
if you haven't seen it and the same
family of course of the new killer sites
redesign this is in 2010 so let's go
back to CSS tutorial and we upgraded
this site here I'm going to go this is a
snapshot of the old site and well don't
laugh this site was actually built in
2004 and I hadn't changed the design
since so it was in need of an upgrade so
what I want you to pay attention to is
not the design changes is this this is a
video on usability so let's look at this
newsletter so right in the page or in
the middle of the page I have this CSS
basic newsletter subscribe box here
nothing special and what I did in the
new design well what we did rather is we
put it right here subscribe to our
newsletter you know still very prominent
at the top easy to see so what's
interesting is I thought about the new
web design this you know it's pretty
slick in comparison I figured that this
new web design would encourage people to
subscribe to the newsletter because you
know it's a nice-looking site so yeah
you know let's learn web design from
these guys who can produce decent
looking sites as it turns out though
this particular layout got me a lot more
subscribers in fact this newsletter form
here would get me you know maybe 12 or
so subscribers a day just on this
newsletter
and when I changed to this design it can
range anywhere from three to six or
seven a days so you're seeing a 50% or
more decline in the subscribers just by
moving it from the middle here to up
here so that's a pretty significant
change with a minimal move just keep in
mind how important the placement of
widgets items on your page are to
usability or to user interaction with
the page there you go so of course what
we're gonna do as a result of these
quick results we're gonna be moving the
subscriber newsletter back in the middle
here we're gonna dress it up though with
some you know icons or something and so
on one other thing I fail to point out
is you look the newsletter is very
descriptive CSS basic newsletter
whereas here all it just says is
subscribed to our newsletter this is
very generic doesn't tell anybody about
the newsletter I assume though that
since this was a CSS tutorial Dada
website you know I figured they would
figure out that this was of course a CSS
related newsletter I'm going to be doing
some more tests to see reaction but I
got a feeling the fact that the title is
very explicit here and we have a little
bit of information about the newsletter
here and that it's centered I think that
these three issues these three things
have affected the number of people
subscribing to the page
and there you go that's your lesson in
usability from killer sites calm and
just case you want to see me I'm Steph
miss trip I'm this guy here and I hope
you find this video useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
