killer sites calm in this quick little
video I want to introduce you to the web
designers roadmap and this can be found
at killer sites calm you can either find
it on the side here the scroll down web
designers roadmap you click through here
or more easily just at the top of the
page wondering wondering where to start
check out our web designers roadmaps so
you click through so what exactly is
this this is basically a visual guide
designed to help people who are learning
web design what technologies to learn in
what order this is a hierarchical map
and you see we have web designer web
programmer and small business world map
essentially what it does it list the
technologies that you have to learn to
be a web designer or which we suggest
that you should learn and in which order
so we start of course at the top with
HTML so give a little description and
then of course we link to our various
courses that we offer to teach you HTML
of course HTML is the root of all
websites and of course what follows
afterwards is CSS same type of deal we
list the courses where we teach CSS and
after CSS and HTML you have several
options available to you in terms of
what to learn and let me point out
ultimately if you want to become a
professional web designer you want to
learn all these technologies here you
don't necessarily have to be an expert
in everything that's for sure but it's
good to know everything here so we start
with HTML CSS and in terms of the next
level it's up to you all these are can
be approached you could start with
WordPress maybe glitter PHP or you can
start with JavaScript it's up to you and
say you have you just mouse over the
various icons and it gives you a pretty
detailed description of what's going on
here
and of course any links to courses that
are related and finally of course we
have at the bottom jquery which is a
javascript library anyway that's it i
just wanted to give you a quick tour of
his web designers road map again design
help people out who are learning web
design and what a know in which order to
learn what that's about it bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
