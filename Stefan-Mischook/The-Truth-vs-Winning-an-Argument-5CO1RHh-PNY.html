talk about being right versus winning an
argument sometimes they are in conflict
so I'll start with the quick story I
once wasn't an argument big arguing with
somebody at the end of the argument my
opponent said you know what Steph you're
right I'm wrong that's what a few weeks
or a month or two liver was and then I
realized that I was actually wrong right
but the other guy was right but I was
also wrong and the victory in the debate
seemed very hollow at that point in time
because I was wrong and then I started
to think about it in a philosophical
sense in a broader sense and I came to
the conclusion that being right or
winning an argument is not a victory if
in the end the idea or the position that
you are arguing for turns out to be
false or self to be wrong so I decided
then there that winning the argument is
not important what's important is
figuring out what the truth is so when I
go into a conversation with somebody
I'll have my positions my preconceptions
I have my ideas of course but I always
tried and it's hard sometimes because
you get very emotional when you're in a
debate I always try to seek the truth to
try to figure out what is actually
reality because in my opinion if you win
the argument but you were wrong that
means in the end you actually lost for
me I'm always trying to figure out what
is true so in business you have to be
brutally honest with yourself so if you
have a product you think the product is
the greatest product ever ever created
and you bring it to market and it's not
working you try different marketing
methods and you try different sales
tactics you try different venues and
it's not something it's not selling this
is where you have to step back and you
know you're emotionally and financially
and temporally invested in as this
product or services to try to sell it
doesn't work it doesn't work you got to
let it go you got
it go because if you dolt you're going
to get killed right you're going to
bleed to money you're going to bleed
money and waste time trying to push this
thing and I've seen this tool with
companies people trying and trying try
it just doesn't work you got to drop it
you got to drop it a product is not your
baby you know it's a product it's a
service that you're selling and when you
see it's starting to get traction and
sales will tell you that then you can
start refining the product and the
process according to the data that's
coming in so you have to be a very
data-centric person especially in
business you cannot be emotionally
invested in an idea or a product or
service that you're trying to provide
and this principle I think can be
applied to any aspects of life if you
get into a debate with somebody instead
of going there trying to win try to go
in there with the intention of trying to
figure out what is actually true even if
as it turns out what is true contradicts
your initial position because even if
you are wrong in the end and you're
accepted and you've acknowledged what is
the truth you actually win because
you've moved yourself forward
intellectually and I have seen in my own
life people a lot of people who are
unable to do this they're unable to ever
admit they're wrong right and as a
result they never advanced
intellectually emotionally and I've seen
people over a decade or two
they've never advanced they've never
been willing to admit they're wrong and
frankly that they're not in a good
position you know in life and in so many
ways financially emotionally in their
relationships so honesty
and south honesty and ability to
acknowledge when you're wrong and to
seek out what's true rather than try to
win in a debate for instance is a key
principle that can be applied to all
aspects of life I hope you found this
vlog useful I think I'm going to cut it
here at 4 minutes because I want to
finish my tea and then I got a head out
to a family a family barbecue I guess
you'd call it a family barbecue and it's
a couple hours away but I always enjoy
my drives on a sunny day because I get
an opportunity to get on the highway
with the convertible play a bunch of
tunes that to me is one of the most fun
things I like to do in fact what are
these I'm going to be doing if all goes
well within the next year so is a road
trip around the u.s. I get yourself a
self-driving car I think they're
supposed to come out about two years now
you're gonna have two years of them who
you talk to and that's my thing my dream
is to do as a North American
self-driving car trip across the u.s.
and Canada
anyway I don't know why that came up I
hope this blog is useful and let me know
what you think in the comments below
