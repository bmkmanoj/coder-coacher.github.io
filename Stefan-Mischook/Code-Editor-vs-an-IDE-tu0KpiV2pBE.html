editor to write code or should you get
yourself an IDE an IDE is short for
integrated development environment and
these are far more powerful far more
robust apps that are designed to make
the coding easy but some people kind of
like the simplicity of a simple code
editor so from my experience I think
when you're just getting started in
coding if you're learning how to code I
would just get a simple code editor like
sublime text if you're doing a PHP
JavaScript HTML CSS I'd use sublime text
maybe you can use a sublime text or
Python as well of course
although Python when you doing you
download Python and install it it has a
built in code editor it's not nearly as
nice as a sublime text let me just
suggest something I talked about code
atera versus simple text editor a simple
text editor is like on Windows is no pad
and on on Mac I think it would be
TextEdit I think it is I always mix it
up so now simple text editor just writes
text so it doesn't have anything
built-in to help you to code whereas a
simple code editor because design is a
text editor but it's also designed to
help you write code so it will color
your code and it will give you more
advanced tools that will make coding
easier for you now if you first learn
how to code I would get a simple code
editor at first now the next step is the
IDE the integrated development
environment so you have to code text
editor code editor and the IDE the IDE
is the integrated development
environment and this is by far our more
complex of the apps but boy do they save
you a lot of time once you get into them
what do they do while they do all the
color coding and the formatting that you
would expect in any code editor but IDs
take it to a whole new level
and those are things like cold
completion where you you start typing in
some code and the ID will be able to
guess what you wanted to type and it'll
drop down this will appear and you get
to select it from the drop-down list so
it makes coding much easier much less
mistakes because you be able you'll be
selecting code from drop-down list the
ID you be Auto completing things for you
and a whole bunch of other tools and
capabilities but these capabilities come
at a cost in that you're gonna have to
learn the IDE so I always say when
you're first learning to code in any
language I would just use a code editor
with Python was is the exception they
have a co literature they call it they
called I del IDL Yi and it's their IDE
and it's kind of a bare-bones things but
it does color coding and stuff like that
so it's kind of cool for Python or PHP a
when you sublime text or notepad plus
plus or on windows a sublime text works
on Mac and Windows so that's that's a
good option for you there so there you
go yes when you're first learning how to
code stick to a code editor or uses a
simple text editor although I would drop
that pretty quickly because I for the
reasons I just said but once you you're
starting to get familiar with Cody
you're comfortable at least with the
basics of a particular precoding
language or a programming language that
you're learning then I would start
exploring proper integrated development
environments ites now I recommend my top
recommendation rather and people argue
this is from a company called jet brains
JetBrains
they got famous in the 90s from creating
the best Java IDE something called
IntelliJ was amazing and since then
they've kept up the reputation and they
have one for PHP is called phpstorm
again it's an amazing IDE for PHP and
they have one for Python called pycharm
which is amazing from my understand it's
an amazing ide for python I haven't used
Python pycharm and so I I'm not giving
you a personal recommendation but from
from what I've seen JetBrains I used
intellij a lot it was amazing they were
best of class and I hear a phpstorm from
my developers they say it's best of
class to an amazing development tool so
there you go that's how you should look
at simple co-editors simple text editor
simple code editors in I des I hope you
