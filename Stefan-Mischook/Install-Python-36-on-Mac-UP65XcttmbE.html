do now is install Python on the Mac
Python comes in two basic flavors or two
basic versions let me just go to the
downloads you see here I'm on downloads
and because I'm on a Mac it's showing me
the download options for Mac OS 10 it's
pretty much the same thing on Windows
the difference between Python on Windows
and on Mac is tiny tiny tiny makes no
difference so in this course I'm doing
summative demos on the Mac some of the
demos on the windows computers doesn't
matter which one you're using you can
even be using Chromebooks with or Linux
with Python and you'll be fine because
Python itself on all the operating
systems all the types of computers is
the same so you see I'm recording this
now python 3.6 is out and you have a
Python 2.7
now what's their swing 3.6 and 2.7 well
we call the three branch three branch
meaning 3.6 3.7 you know whatever 3.6 is
the latest version when you get the two
branch 2.6 2.7 etc etc so the big
difference is that python 3 is the newer
version it's the version you should be
learning with there are some differences
between python 3 and python 72.7 layers
would say this is the 3x branch because
it's because it could be 3.5 2 plus a
soup or something today and this is the
2x branch 2.7 etc now the two branches
the older version and they still keep it
around because there are there are a lot
of Python apps and still use 2.7 you see
point you see 2.13 when you have version
numbers like 2 that's a major version
number 3 that's a major version number
then you see a point 6 that tells you
that they they've add significant
changes to the version 3 so when you
have three point five or three point six
that means that point five that point 6
tells you the
has been some significant changes to
python when you see a so same thing with
2.5 2.6 2.7 we're at 2.7 now now you see
the point 1 3 these when you have a sub
sub version so 2.7 is a subversion 3
point 6 here in this version here's
subversion and when you have point 1 3
after the subversion sub subversion this
usually means bug fixes bug fixes so
this applies to whether it be apps or
programming language it is you know when
you see these points you now know what
it means
so the 2x branch meaning two point seven
point 1 3 in this case is the old
version people still use it so they
maintain it but they're not making any
new changes to the 2x branch or just
maintaining it fixing some bugs the 3
branch is where all the action is that's
what we're going to learn Python 2 into
Python 3 are very similar but there are
some significant differences so we're
going to be learning with Python 3 point
6
although whether you have three point
five on your system or three point seven
or eight or even Python for the chasis
are everything in this course will be
totally fine for you it's no big deal so
what you do is you click on this button
here three point six and you're going to
see it's going to start downloading here
no you can see down here I already
downloaded it so let's go show in finder
on the Mac and here it is python 3.6 so
have it twice cuz i download it twice
i'm just going to delete this so let me
shake you i'll bring this to my desktop
just so it's clean and so good so now we
install this like we would any other app
now on Mac Mac comes pre-installed with
Python so let me show you to get to that
so we're going to go to the terminal so
I've opened up spotlight which is
command space bar and I type in terminal
and the terminal launches let me just
get this out of the way for now
terminal allows you to basically talk to
your computer directly so I'm going to
just type in Python like this and it's
going to tell me which version of Python
is installed on Mac you can see here
it's two point seven point one OS not
even the latest version of two point
seven latest version of two point seven
is two point seven one three still
pretty putting you now we want to use
two point seven no we want to use three
point six now I had installed Python
three bit of three point five so let me
show you what I'm doing here I'm just
going to get out of Python one exit and
I'm going to say Python three and you
see here now I'm inside a Python three
point five point two which is the
earlier version now if you have two
point five point two and you don't want
to install three point six you probably
going to be perfectly fine especially
when you're getting into all the
standard packages the basic stuff in
Python and now right in the terminal the
Mac terminal and if you check out the
windows install I'll show you how to
have the I'll show you the equivalent
thing on Windows we can run Python
commands like the basic command and
Python is print you can print some text
the fan is a nerd no question about that
hit enter and Python senses back to text
but that is a nerd but what we want to
do is we want to install the later
version of Python so let's exit this and
let me just close this window and let's
go back to our Python package here and
what we're going to do here is install
Python so install Python loan boom
continue blah blah we agree agree a real
good you can trust Python installers
trying to install software use touch ID
touch a key I am
if you have a computer with touch ID you
don't have to enter your password you
can just use your touch ID to give apps
permission to install so this should
install says less than a minute I got a
brand new computer here so it should be
pretty fast all right it's installed
pretty good so now I don't need this
installer and I can just delete it and
Python should be installed now I had
installed a previous version of Python
let's see what happens when I click on
this so yeah python 3.5 that's the old
version of python so let me just get
that it is and let's see if I can find
the new version so I'm going to open up
the spotlight again Python see I got the
two versions here right I found launched
one for 3.5 3.6 we launched 3.6 so I hit
the enter so what's going on here see
now it basically is configuring python
to work our with our system settings for
Python script above run terminal window
or the below okay just leave it all as
it is we're good let's write IDL e there
we go that's what we want so the Python
launcher but we just saw before this
thing preferences yeah we thought of
preferences so the presence is just
leave it like this is leave it standard
so it's not the Python launch I just
want to show you about the Python launch
it allows you to configure your computer
so the Python will work on the computer
you just leave a default you should be
okay
so we want command-spacebar IDL e which
the Python integrated development
environment so I'm going to say yes I
must select 3.6 we launch here we go 3.6
so this window this is an app that comes
with Python that allows you to write
Python code now you see this morning
here
it's saying you have a version of TCL
/tk this is an app that may be unstable
we have version eight point five point
nine and if you want more information
visit this page here which I'll take us
to hold on this is what are you talking
about here see look here for five long 0
6 3 plus like 2 this is what they're
talking about now I have this version to
consider it an alternate and they're
giving me a warning could be unstable
they recommend the earlier version I've
been working with this newer version and
I haven't had any problems myself so
when you if you see this morning because
you have the eight point five point nine
version of TCL /tk just hit enter and
you'll get to the command prompt what is
the command prompt is these three arrows
so now you can start writing commands
print this is Python alright so hit
enter and python prints back to us the
text this is some Python in blue we'll
learn more about all this stuff in later
videos this has been going on too long
so I'm going to pause it right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
