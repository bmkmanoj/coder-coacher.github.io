in this V blog i'm going to talk about
the new samsung note 7 vs the iphone 7
and this is going to have a coder or a
developer's point of view a developer
slant so my last phone a curveball that
i'm using is a nexus 5 which is a google
android phone they stock android the
base vanilla Android and i went with
android because well that's what i've
been using for years now i've never used
an iphone although I do have an iPad so
it's very similar and I just wanted to
have my hands in Android to be familiar
enough with Android just have a feel for
it and that's important as a developer
to understand the different platforms
out there android OS iOS Windows Mac
Linux too much lesser extent but just
it's it's good to know the different
platforms so you have a feel for what it
is and it there is an undefined tangible
advantage to understanding these
platforms I'm not saying should you need
to be able to code against all these
platforms but it's just a good thing to
know just a gift familiar just see how
user interfaces are working how the big
boys are dealing with UI user experience
the icons and all this kind of stuff
it's just interesting to understand this
these trends because understanding the
trends in software is going to help you
to stay ahead of the game so you can
position yourself in terms of skills
that you have or the services that you
offer in the marketplace so I've been
looking at the I went and just checked
out the note 7 and I was going to shoot
a video of me playing with the note 7
but you can find 10,000 videos out there
terms of people you know saying yeah you
press on this button that does this and
that my impression is that note said
very impressive device in terms of
hardware that wraparound screen gives
you kind of a cool bezel asst feel to it
I was that too
impress with the responsiveness of it
it's it's it's fast but you know it's no
faster than my own Nexus 5 although it's
a bigger screen by my nexus 5 or nexus 5
believes a 5-inch screen and the note 7
is a 5.7 inch if it is or 5.5 inch
rather it seemed a little hmm and it in
the icons it was not stock Android it
was the Samsung candy ish type of icons
I was impressed I think overall I get
the impression that iOS is a more
refined operating system and that's why
when you look at the hardware the iphone
they have less ram and so on but because
of the operating system is more refined
than android it moves very nicely very
smoothly so you know but at the end of
the day it's really you're really
quibbling in terms of which one is
better because it really depends on what
you're looking to do you know the
general the general comment that you
hear is that your want flexibility but
what android if you want something easy
and you know you just do it you want the
apple ecosystem you go to iOS what am I
going to choose alternately my major
thing for me though is is browsing the
web checking my email I use gmail and
I'm not sure I heard that the apps on
iOS four Gmail's are fantastic so you
know I concerned about that Google Maps
and finally the camera since people like
the vlogging what i do now on youtube
right now i'm using my point-and-shoot
here which shoots very high quality
video but it's it's inconvenient and so
i hear that the well the new samsung
right now has the best built in camera
out there apparently in terms of the
smartphones and does really a really
good job and but i'm going to wait to
see what iphone 7 does which is coming
out for next 2-3 weeks that's the gas
anyway and so i'm leaning towards
getting iOS just because i want to get
something different I want to try
something new since I
had an iphone before so keep that in
mind again from a developer's point of
view to bring it back again it's good to
expose yourself to different user
interfaces different operating systems
different languages it just opens your
mind to different possibilities when I
for instance when I jump from Java into
C sharp asp.net my java got better and
so on and so forth so i can mention the
different languages as you learn more
languages programming languages markup
languages and so forth you will get
better at the previous languages you've
done because they all share common
traits and then you by comparing one to
the other you'll be able to get a much
better feel for what it is you are doing
overall so if you take it to it you I
was going to trying to come up with
another analogy but it's like working
with cameras my lumix here but I have a
base it's a mirrorless camera so it's
one of those compact cameras but it has
all the capabilities just about more
have all the capabilities of dls are one
of those big pro cameras so I can
control a shutter speed and f-stop and
sensor sensitivity excuse me and a few
other everything it's all there and I'm
not far from a camera expert I'm
starting to get my way know my way
around it but by working with this
camera then if I jump to another camera
I'll be able to start comparing and
contrasting how each of these cameras
handle different things and overall I'll
just make me better at using the cameras
to do my work so there you go that's my
blog do I think one is better than the
other interns I iphone 7 iphone 7 is not
out yet but you know from what i've seen
iphone 6s in terms of speed and
capabilities it's very comparable to the
brand new note 7 although note 7 has
much more flexibility cuz you get that
pan you can write notes and i'm not sure
how I would much I would use that or not
but they're both compelling
both both compelling devices and I think
by the way more and more people are just
going to have smartphones for their
computers I see you know I see very soon
as Lowry there we can just put your
iphone or your put your your google
android phone or whatever phone on your
desk and it projects to a monitor and it
connects to bluetooth bluetooth keyboard
and you pop open your spreadsheet your
prop open your word processor your Papa
when your editor you do everything you
store all your stuff on the cloud and
that's where I think it's going to go
the the towers and stuff that's more for
just power users and big-time gamers I
think more people most people buy
laptops these days and soon we'll be
going to hybrids laptops and like the
surface pro which is a laptop / tablet
hybrid that's my Windows machine hi
that's why i use my Windows machine now
my windows 10 machine is essentially a
tablet believe it or not so here you go
this is my tennis is my surface pro 4
it's essentially it's a tablet this is
my main machine it's a tablet it's a
cool tablet unlike the I the apples
iPads but this Kicks down here this is
huge because then I can place it on my
desk on any angle and I got this one
connector right here and it allows me to
power up to 42 k displays so this is
amazing to me that this thing device is
my main windows work machine it's very
powerful so there I 5 in here I got 16
gigs ram that's a great job it's a great
tablet as well though with latest
updates as typical stupid windows
fashion they've been screwing it up a
little bit slowing it down unfortunately
but it's still really good device so
there you go that's the future of
computing it's enough of my rambling
