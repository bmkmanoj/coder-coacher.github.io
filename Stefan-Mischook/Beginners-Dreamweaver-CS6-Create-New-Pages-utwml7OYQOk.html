documents inside of Dreamweaver I've
returned back to the my first site site
definition which we made in previous
videos and if you are following along I
encourage you to do the same so how do
you go about creating the basic
structure of what we want to be doing
with this website now you may remember
in a previous video how I mentioned a
little bit about the root folder and the
structure that we were working with well
here is our word root folder but we
don't have anything inside of it and one
of the first things we want to put
inside of this is a new file an index
not an HTML file now we can do this in a
number of ways number one I can come
right to the files menu and I can right
click on this and just say new file and
in doing so it would go about creating a
file for me that says untitled HTML
which I could rename index.html and just
as easy as that we have a new page to
work with if you were to double click
that page you would see a blank page
with nothing on it in the design view
but if you go to the split screen or the
code view you'll notice that I have a
number of HTML tags created and that's
the beauty of working inside of a
Dreamweaver environment is unlike a
simple text editor when you create a new
file Dreamweaver actually gives you the
basic skeletal structure of those files
so I'm going to quit this for a second
or actually close that for a second just
by clicking on the little X and let's
take a look at another way of creating a
file you could also go to the file new
or command n or if you're on a PC ctrl n
clicking on that window creates or opens
rather this new document window and
inside that new document window you can
create from any number of different
files and there are 4 separate columns
that we're dealing with here notice in
the first column
it gives you the option of creating a
blank page and those blank pages are
among many different types you can
create something from a blank template
so if you had a template that you've
created you can work with that you could
create a fluid grid layout which we will
be talking about later in another video
or if you'd created your own templates
you could create a page from one of
those existing ones you can create a
page from a sample and these are sort of
CSS samples these are not really sample
pages per se they're just samples styles
and sample color schemes working with a
CSS environment there's also mobile
starters here which will give you some
jQuery Mobile functioning we'll talk
about that a little bit later too and
there's other types of pages which are
mostly for programming you'll see C
sharp or ActionScript pages that you can
create but we're not really interested
in any of these within the context of
this particular video so if we go back
to our blank page you'll see in the
second column there are page types you
can create a simple HTML pages we will
be doing or templates or as you can see
in here our CSS JavaScript those are
very common types of pages that you will
be probably creating when you're working
in Dreamweaver in the third column
you'll see layout now layout is
something that we are going to be
concerned with when we're working inside
of Dreamweaver the first option is none
well what that means is a blank page
with just the skeleton of the HTML but
nothing else however there are these
starter pages that you can work with and
as you can see here if you're very new
to CSS and HTML and or perhaps if you
just want to get up and running very
quickly these layout pages these starter
pages are really quite easy to work with
and they give you some different options
you have to clean them up and sort of
work with them but they give you a lot
of the most common options that you'll
see so for example one column fixed and
centered one column with a liquid layout
two columns with a sidebar on the
you can even have things like three
columns or three columns with a header
and a footer they're all a number of
different types of files
there's even HTML files with two columns
fixed right sidebar header footer and
three columns with header and footer
well html5 brings me to the last
remaining column I'm going to go back to
layout none and as you can see here the
most important element that you can be
working with is the doctype now the
doctype as you'll notice is something
that I can choose from and there are
many different types of doc types well
if you're working with cs6 the most the
defaulted doctype is going to be html5
if it's not I will encourage you to
change it to html5 the more common doc
types that we are probably going to see
the most are either going to be H xhtml
1.0 transitional or now we are moving
towards the newer doctype which is a
html5 doctype and I will encourage you
to work within this doctype everything
that we're going to be creating in this
video is going to be exploring the use
of html5 and I'll get you up and running
and show you how to do just that so that
we can make things work really nicely
also if you had an existing CSS
stylesheet you could attach it using
this little icon right here but given
that we're just starting things from
scratch and we're working from the very
basic beginning structure this is what
we're gonna choose and we don't have a
CSS file to go with it so I can go about
creating a file you'll notice it's got
the same doctype the html5 doctype that
we had when we created it here but do
notice that this has not been saved yet
it says untitled one whereas the one
that we created we were able to give it
a name when we right clicked inside the
files menu so this one would have to be
saved so if I wanted to I could come to
file save and I could save it in a
specific area you'll notice my root
folder is
located on the desktop work more than
likely yours is and let let me just say
if I name this test dot HTML notice now
test out HTML happens to be right here
so these are two different ways of
creating your pages and probably the
most common ones that you're going to be
using I however generally prefer the
right-click on the root folder method
that we were working with first and
foremost by the way if you want to
delete a file first of all I'm going to
come here and hit the X to close that
file but if I wanted to delete this just
select it and hit or right-click rather
and go to the Edit menu and you can work
with delete just like that and it'll
usually ask you do you want to delete
the file we'll say yes all right so now
that we've created a simple page and
double-clicking it will open up that
page when we come back we're gonna
create some very basic structure inside
of this HTML page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
