killer PHP calm and killer sites calm in
this video I'm just going to give you a
little bit of a heads up of what's going
to be coming out in January of 2011 if
not sooner we may release it around
Christmas time depending on how lazy we
are essentially there's going to be a
lot of new content on WordPress on
editing thieves of WordPress and
specifically we're going to be releasing
a bunch of videos on using Dreamweaver
cs5 to edit to wordpress themes you will
see that Dreamweaver cs5 has a bunch of
built-in tools now but makes it easier
to to create themes for WordPress but
you don't need to be a Dream Weaver five
cs five years or to get something out of
these videos because as we're building
all these these themes within
Dreamweaver we're going to be learning
about the whole theme structure and how
WordPress works along the way a lot of
times we're going to be working in code
in the actual code itself through
dreamweaver so it's pretty cool the
other thing we're going to be looking at
which will be of interest to PHP
developers is you know my beginners PHP
tutorials pretty popular out there I
wrote that years ago and it's very
popular tutorial but it just covers very
basics of Hopi object oriented PHP
programming so I've heard the demand for
people so what we're doing is we're
putting out a brand new course which
will come out with next again within the
next few weeks latest january early
january will be an intermediate level
course on oval PHP where we're actually
going to build a project using pure oil
p and it's going to be the bridge
between our my basic PHP videos and are
very advanced there's n stuff
we've done so it's going to be a nice
middle ground where you'd be able to
take the PHP learning that you got from
my basic tutorial at killer PHP com just
look for just look for the object
oriented PHP tutorial and then you're
going to be able to have that brit that
new video is going to fill the gap
between you know the basics you'd be
able to build some things fairly you
know the simple but nonetheless you
learn how to utilize 00 p and a very
practical project and that way you can
extend into you know sand or code
igniter or whatever framework you choose
to get into if if you decide to use a
frame worker at all so there you go I'm
that's it if I don't get to say this
before happy new years and Happy
Holidays to everybody yeah that's it
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
