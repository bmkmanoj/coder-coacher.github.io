calm and killer PHP calm in this video
blog I want to talk about becoming a
freelance web designer or freelance web
programmer I'm not going to get into be
technical skills because I've covered
that in another another video and pretty
a pretty detailed blog post where I list
the skill sets that a modern web
designer the modern web programmer
programmers should know you just can you
can check that up but Kelly sighs calm
or look through your videos here in this
video well I'll talk about what I want
to talk about is the personality traits
of the self-employed web a web
contractor so I'll just start off with
the number one trade number one thing
you have to have is the ability to be
disciplined and to be a self-starter
when you work on your own as a
contractor you have no schedule you have
nobody telling you when to go to work
what to start work how long to work for
me that's a huge advantage now that was
the reason why I went into contracting a
long time ago because they just didn't
like the idea of having to show up at a
particular place in time because you
know my boss told me to so on the flip
side though you have to have that
ability to to be able to get up in the
morning or in the middle of the
afternoon and actually start working
that's that they have to be motivated
and have the ability to do that to be
able be able to create your own
structure to say I'm going to do this at
this time get this done that is one of
the key personality traits that a
contractor must have number two you have
to be comfortable with at first working
on your own it's especially in the
beginning it's a solitaire game
you know because you're probably gonna
be at home and you're gonna be writing
code or designing pages or what have you
and you won't be interacting with people
as you would if you were going into an
office workspace so keep that in mind
selves for some people that may not be
something they want to deal with they
may find it lonely I don't know for me I
enjoy my time on my own so I can get
things done so you know worked out for
me
so keep that in mind the next point you
have to be confident about going out
there and dealing with new people
especially in the beginning when you
first start out as a web contractor
whether it be programming or design the
first little while is going to be about
knocking on doors talking to people not
being afraid to engage with new
potential clients and as an extension to
this you also have to understand that
you have to not be afraid to cert your
particular demands for lack of better
words so for instance when you're
dealing with clients you can't be afraid
to negotiate a good price for you so
that you can make a pretty good living
you can't be afraid to push the client a
little bit and get them to come forth
with you know what's the payments on
time or to the door to demand but in a
polite way that you get paid a certain
percentage of front I've covered this in
great detail in my business of web
design podcast series again you can get
that at a killer sites comm slash
business and this is a big part of that
it's you know the big theme here rather
with be a contractor and be on your own
is that you have to be assertive not
only on others but on yourself you'll be
able to set your own structure set your
own path this is important and I think
that's the defining characteristic when
you go out on your own you have to at
least be ready mentally to cross over
from being somebody who's given a
structure
and that's how we're talking school or
talk to comply to show up on time to go
to the bathroom when it's time to go to
bathroom to go eat when we're you know I
don't like sheep but if if so you need
to be able to define your own structure
to be in that lone wolf type of
character if you're gonna be
self-employed web professional now go
get me wrong I use the word sheep and
that's like this is a little derogatory
I'm not trying to put down people or for
companies because there's a lot of
advantages for working in working for
someone for instance you have to worry
about getting paid typically you you
don't have to come up with ideas you
have to chase that client you have to do
any of this you just come in you just
have to be concerned about your part of
the cause of job so if you're a web
designer you just have to be worried
about making sure that the design comes
out nice and it looks good you don't
have to worry about the backend stuff
you don't worry I have to have to worry
about chasing out clients and getting
requirements and getting paid there's a
lot of advantages you don't have to
worry about having maybe getting calls
from crazy clients will call you try to
call you eight o'clock at night on
Saturday these sorts of things you don't
have to deal with when working for
somebody and that for a lot of people is
worth the the downside of having to
follow the schedule of the workplace and
to have to to be limited in that way so
keep that in mind these are the
personality characteristics of the
self-employed that applies to web
designers and programmers alike and you
need to have at least a part of that and
or are willing to develop those traits
and personalities if you want to be
successful and I'll just want to close
up in addition to that you also have to
be very very very tight with your cash
one of the key things that ruins people
is that they don't know how to manage
money now it would seem like a simple
simple problem right you just you kind
of you know you got you know two grand
comes in in a month you don't spend two
grand you spend
hundred you know you don't you know you
save money you know you have to save
money every month that's a big thing so
I should point that out when you're
self-employed you have to really
conserve and manage your money because
you never know when the next gig the
next job is going to come and what you
far especially in the beginning the
variability of jobs will be like you
know be like all tons and tons of work
but no work at all times intensive work
no work at all so when you get tons and
tons of work you're gonna be socking
away to catch the cover you treat the
downside eventually this will even out
where you have steady flow of income
coming in steady flow workers you
develop you know contact so you have a
lot of clients need updates their
websites and so on but you should keep
that in mind so do you get any no you
got to be assertive you'd be a
self-starter you got to be disciplined
you're gonna have a little bit of
confidence in yourself so you can
negotiate with clients and I'll and very
importantly you get over how to manage
your money for the down times because
you know I think you're not gonna have
that standing paycheck especially in the
beginning it sounds all kind of you know
some of you might be listening to this
going oh my god I'm just gonna get a job
and that's fine it's not like I said I
know some people do very well working
for people and with great money and
they're very happy but there's huge
advantages to be a self-employed total
freedom you work when you want to work
you work how you want to work you work
where you want to work the tax situation
I would imagine around the world at
least in in North America is tremendous
tremendously advantageous officer a
proper grammar there but it's very
advantageous to the entrepreneur and
business owner because you get taxed as
much much less you can write off a
pewter cost and gas costs and all kinds
of things so it's extremely advantageous
to be self-employed in terms of the
taxes so law and it's been very
rewarding for me of course understand
from my perspective I I started my first
company was nineteen so I haven't worked
for anybody since
nineteen years old and you know when I
was 19 I was a bouncer in a nightclub so
you know I may not be the best judge in
terms of weighing what it's like to be
self-employed business owner versus
being an employee working for an
established company anyway I hope you
