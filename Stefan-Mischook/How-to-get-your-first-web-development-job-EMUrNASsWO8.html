and other website so question that comes
up every now and then I'm going to
answer it again but I'm going to try to
do as quickly as possible how do you get
your first web development or web design
jobs what do you do so I assume at this
point that you've learned how to code
and you've learned how to build apps
that means today you know html5 css3 and
you know some JavaScript before you'll
have to be an expert for the most part
depending what you do and then I would
really strongly advise if you want to
get work you really have to know your
server-side coding that would either be
PHP or maybe Python Django with the
Django or maybe node which is a
JavaScript engine there's there's
several options out there besides that
but those are the three I would be
looking at number one PHP number two
JavaScript node number three Django
there's also Ruby on Rails but as I said
in another video recently this is a
technology if it's fading so I wouldn't
go there so yeah so what do you need to
do so you got your skills so what you
got to do is you've got to demo those
skills you have to show that you know
what you're doing so what you do with
that is you get you get yourself up a
website and then you have on your
website examples of the type of work
that you have done working examples and
this applies to if you want to get into
app development as well whether it be
for iOS or Android maybe you you want to
do app development
that's where html5 comes in because
html5 combined with css3 javascript and
some translation layer like Cordova and
others allows you to build mobile apps
you can look into that as well and you
know people are going to evolve if
you're going to do mobile don't you have
to learn Swift for iOS or Java for
Android yes those are popular but was
becoming even more popular quickly is
building these mobile apps with html5
because all kinds of business advantages
a 99% of apps can be built very
effectively and will run very well on
Android and iOS with html5 it's just
because the engines to process the
JavaScript nation are just becoming so
fast now and so a lot of companies are
going to html5 for mobile app
development because otherwise if you
write an app in for iOS and Swift or
objective-c then you're going to want it
for Android
probably since it's such a huge market
the android market so you're going to
have to write it again
from scratch with java very expensive
but if you do in html5 it will work on
both platforms no problemo
anyway back to getting your jobs how do
you get your job so you got to show some
stuff that you can build put up a site
that you can demonstrate your skills you
know so people can check out what you're
doing so there's two option do you want
to get a job somewhere or do you want to
become a freelancer maybe slowly start
your own web development firm if you
want to get a job you just going to show
your work most small and medium sized
web development development firms are
far more concerned with skills that you
can demonstrate than they are with
diplomas and degrees and certificates
you know where diplomas and degrees come
in handy is when you want to go work for
huge corporations or they have HR
departments where there's a protocol
where they're going to want people with
certain degrees so keep that in mind but
for most jobs eighty ninety percent of
jobs
degrees is now account it's skillset
that you that you can demonstrate skills
that you can demonstrate so you want to
get a job build build your skills build
some demo sites maybe do a couple
freebie projects for small companies for
free freebie so you gain some experience
you can show real-world project projects
then you can hand your resume in and
start talking to people who are looking
for coders there's a huge demand for web
developers and app developers to a huge
demand so if you do that and you can
speak well clearly answer phone calls
don't be arrogant be a good guy
be good girl
you will you will likely find a job in
entry level position fairly quickly if
you want to do it on your own as a
contractor with the idea in the end is
becoming setting up your own web
development firm the key against this is
pretty much the same if you develop your
skills put up a site show some demo
projects do a couple freebie freebie
projects and show your skills also you
learn how to interact with clients and
deal with them and then word-of-mouth
will start coming into play you can do
word of mouth you know you do I don't
know site for a local bar or local
restaurant you do for free and I'm down
you know these owners are going to know
other people and if you do a good job
you work with them they're going to tell
other people so you tell the guy listen
I'm doing you this this job free because
I'm just building my portfolio I'll do
the first bit for free we'll get your
site up and running we'll run through
the proximal cost you anything but all I
want you know I just wanted to put my
name there's a site design by app design
by and that's it and you're going to
find somebody you know who doesn't want
free work and then you move on from
there and then slowly slowly you're
going to get word-of-mouth it's always
starts off slow but with more
word-of-mouth more contacts more jobs
you're going to find yourself with huge
amounts of work it's always the case I
don't know how long it's going to take
it to take you three to six months it
could take you six months to a year
depending on the market but you're in
the other option is to maybe do some
online bidding for contracts if you
can't find a local freebie contract go
to one of these online sites where you
could bid for contracts and just take
them on take them on for a low low bit
it's not about making money with the
first projects it's about just gaining
some experience that you can demonstrate
to people and you can start there and
slowly slowly start adding to your
resume start adding to your portfolio so
you can show look what the work I've
done if you do that it's it's almost a
guarantee if you stick your stick to it
you work hard at it you will get a job
whether as an employee or as a
independent contractor that's out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
