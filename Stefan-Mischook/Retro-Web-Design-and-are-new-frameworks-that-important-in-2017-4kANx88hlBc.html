article in The New York Times and they
were talking about how I'll show you how
retro retro web design from the 90s is
making a comeback well I don't know
what's making a comeback but at least
some people are getting diggin it and so
I think I've log about it because I know
but a lot of people watch my blogs
because they want to get the perspective
of a crusty old nerd such as myself and
I have to admit when I read that article
they were talking about whether he will
look it up within the New York Times but
they brought up a few things the design
considerations of the 90s if you will or
V lack of design considerations animated
gifs and marquee tags I wonder if the
marquee tag which was an internet
explorer thing I wonder if it still
still supported by Internet Explorer or
any of the other browsers I doubt it
it's one of these custom tags back in
the 1990's a Microsoft didn't take the
web seriously and then they saw it as a
threat and then Netscape which became
Mozilla got into a big battle with
Microsoft over dominance in the browser
world he had IE vs. Mozilla and each of
them had their own flavors of HTML if
you will and it was very very difficult
to create websites that worked on both
web browsers both major web browsers
well so what you had to do back in those
days you had to
you have to appeal to the lowest common
denominator and you had to create web
sites that are really really basic in
terms of the look simply because you
couldn't use any advanced features
because Mozilla or for Netscape would do
it one way
Microsoft do it the other this is a way
before Chrome Safari was a non-issue
thankfully a movement in the late 90s
early 2000s the web standards movement a
bunch of nerds decided to put pressure
on the big boys to say listen you gotta
you gotta adhere to standards so that as
web designers and developers can you
know do our jobs there's a real pain I'm
Mary I was on a project in late 90s
working with a team and I was a hired
gun it was for a very large company that
went public well they were a public
company and I remember one of the guys
he was a lead developer just to give you
context he spent about two weeks working
on a calendar picker to be able to pick
dates on a website now this may freak
you out because these days you just
think of html5 is in Vegas the calendar
object and data object you forget it now
but it's just so easy now or jQuery back
then roof it was really difficult
because again the browser's didn't play
nice and a lot of times what are the
strategies people would utilize they
would they would do browser sniffing to
check which browser you are using and
direct you accordingly to first two
different basically different site
almost same URL but different pages for
Netscape different page for IE
and then it got more sophisticated they
would use dynamic page technology like
PHP or classic a JSP etc to to rewrite
the page rewrite the code into page
according to which web browser sometimes
even which version of the web browser
that was visiting your site it was a
nightmare
but fortunately these days in 2017 the
game is a lot easier the stickers
standard should be fine
that being said in those days because of
the rapid change in the technology you
had to always be on top of what was
coming out the new server-side Technos
coming out for instance so I'll give you
an example in the early 90s everybody
was doing Perl CGI CGI based programming
common gateway interface is the early
way in which you would create web apps
and then Microsoft came out with page
based framework if you will for web app
development and with cynical ASP today
they call classic ASP nobody uses it's
way too old now but this is a huge leap
forward over CGI and I remember I had I
did one gig in particular where I took a
CGI based web app that the company spent
a year developing and I was able to
develop it in classic ASP in one month
not because I was amazing programmer
just because that the classic ASP
technology was so far ahead of Perot CGI
terms of productivity why don't we
mention all this well it's a question
that comes up to a lot of it's a
question rather that comes up with a lot
of learning developers blooding
developers they're wondering about the
new framework that's out or should I
jump into the new language should I jump
into you know they're worried about the
technology changes and they're worried
that they're going to miss out and the
next great super productive thing in
terms of the web stack if you're looking
at web development all these frameworks
all these tools are all kind of
neck-and-neck in terms of their
capabilities in terms of their
productivity enhancements so whether
you're getting into Ruby you're getting
to peach peeler bell or Python Django or
job spring you're going to be in good
hands in any of these situations it's
not like it used to be
so I wouldn't be so concerned about the
latest version of some framework coming
out or some CSS framework these things
their productivity enhancement sort of
what they bring to the table in terms of
enhanced productivity there we go that's
better
it's not nearly as profound as it was
back in the day in terms of technology
shifts so if you just learned your
vanilla PHP laravel you're set
you're doing great you learn Ruby on
Rails you're fine you learn pews you
learn Python Django you're fine you know
you don't have to worry about getting
into the latest JavaScript based
framework node and I forget that maybe
the other frameworks will come around
gems with new things
there's I look at it and in certain
small circumstances each framework or
each language will have certain
advantages in certain situations and
certain circumstances but in terms of
overall capabilities are all very
similar I wouldn't be so concerned about
that anyway you might want to pop over
to new york times to pick up to take a
look at that article it's actually an
interesting read
you know just show it again just in case
there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
