a little bit more about the adjustment
layer that we just applied to this
particular image you'll notice if I just
click down here for a second and I'm not
selecting the particular image that
we're working with here you will see
that in the adjustments window it gives
us all those options hey what about the
information that we added just before
well as soon as you select this window
ah yes we go back to this moment in time
and what we see here is 5727 that's what
it was originally but if I wanted to at
this point in time unlike going to the
image adjustments over here that's done
permanently well here we can come in and
we can further adjust this for example
let's say I wanted to boost that up a
little bit more and i'll bring the
contrast a little lower if I wanted to
and if this is something that we liked
well you know you've got something in
place and it's all good if we save this
because it's got layers it would save as
a Photoshop document a PSD rather than a
JPEG as you see here and you'll notice
that as soon as you go to file save it
will ask you to save a Photoshop
document I'm just going to cancel that
for a second so now that we actually
have this information in place let me
show you a little bit about what some of
these tools do and some of the options
do inside of this window well first and
foremost you will see that there's a
couple in here number one right now this
layer as I mentioned is by default
affecting every layer that's underneath
it well we only have one layer
underneath it so that's not really
showing me much however if we did have
more than one layer this little icon
right here we'll be able to say hey let
it affect all the layers below or clip
to clip click to clip a layer which
would allow it to affect just one
another way to do that is to position
your mouse right in between these two
layers and if you press alt on a PC or
option on a Mac you'll see that same
icon again and that will cause your
adjustment layer to effect own
Lee the one that's directly underneath
it and nothing else however do remember
by default adjustment layers affect
every layer that's underneath it all
right well let's look at another one of
these icons here and you'll see a simple
toggle toggle layer visibility if i
click on it that'll just hide the layer
and you'll notice that we go back to
what it was before we applied the
adjustment what about this little icon
here well this one also shows you
remember I made some changes just now
and if I click and hold on this icon
you'll notice it's showing me what the
previous information looked like here
i'm at 75 minus 17 well just before i
changed it it looked like this so you
can decide which one you like if you
remember there's less contrast in this
new one and more contrast in the
previous one so if you do want to revert
to that previous one all you gotta do is
to click on this icon to reset to the
previous state cancel the current
settings in other words and now we're
back to 5727 I go back to normal click
on it again and it resets everything 20
so command Z or controls that on your
Mac on your pc and as you can see here
I'm going back to what it was so if I do
want to keep it at 5727 I'm just going
to do this and that's a great way that
you can work with and apply these things
as well one last thing if you wanted to
change the name of the layer itself
right here it just says brightness and
contrast one and all you got to do in
order to do that is to double-click this
so I can name this you know bright BG
for background for example and that will
rename your file what's this little
square right here well if you click on
this little square this is a layer mask
that is been applied to this particular
file here is the layer thumbnail
here is the layer mask and what that is
doing see here when I click on this it's
showing me layer 0 I can use it to
rename that layer we rename this one
just by clicking on it right here and if
I click on this area there I can delete
the entire bright BG mask which is not
something I want to do and if I go back
just a second or two here if I say
option commands that I can go back more
than one step there we go so depending
on what you wanted and how you wanted
this to look and how it's going to be
applied it all depends on how you're
going to work with these elements now
you'll notice again you can just delete
that by clicking on it but also notice
this this layer mask which we'll get
into a little bit layer I'll show you
more about how layer masks can be
applied to anything not just an
adjustment layer if you wanted to get
rid of it because you're not working on
it you can do you can right click on it
and say delete the layer mask simple as
that or as you saw just a second ago I
could drag it there i'll rename this
again so let's say bright BG that's what
i wanted to call it and you'll notice if
you're not using layer mask well then
why not just rename it like this so you
have more room to see your names and it
still does exactly the same thing that
we'd saw him before so we'll learn more
about layer masks in a future lesson but
when we do come back we're going to be
talking a little bit more about how we
can work with our adjustment layers and
some good things that we can do with it
and we'll do that as soon as we return</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
