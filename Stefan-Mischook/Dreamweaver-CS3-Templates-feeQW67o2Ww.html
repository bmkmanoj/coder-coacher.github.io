CSS and CSS layouts I want to finally
show you those templates i was talking
about when you can create those in a few
different ways easiest way to use this
dashboard here another way you can go
file new and you can choose blank page
and you get all these options here we're
going to go through now you don't want
to go blank template and page from
template and page from sample because
these template tools here are really
designed for situations where you may be
working with another team of dreamweaver
users and these quote-unquote
dreamweaver templates here are used in
that situation and i'm not going to
cover that in this video what we want to
look at is these blank page templates
and HTML and we don't choose HTML tab
we're going to choose HTML and here we
have a whole bunch of layouts these are
all predefined layouts and you can see
how they little thumbnail here it gives
us an idea of how the layouts will work
for instance if you have a little spring
that means the layout is flexible or
stretching the text its text will
stretch and flow to pay on how big the
browser window is where as here if you
have a lock on it you know that the land
of set and solid and we we demo'd that
in our own layout so we may before so
typically liquid would imply a liquid
layout of flexible layout so we have all
kinds of different options here to
column 3 column whatever you want so i'm
going to go with let's say two column
liquid layout right sidebar now doctype
this is something i don't i haven't
addressed before doctype basically is as
you see we got different options here
nutshell the doctype is basically the is
the rules that the engines will use to
process your code so how can I explain
this you see there are different
versions of HTML HTML strict
transitional and then there's something
called XHTML which is very very similar
to HTML but it's different then you have
different versions of XHTML transitional
strict and so on the co looks very
similar and only code monkeys will
really see the difference and very
subtle the key to the doctype it
basically gives instructions to the
browser what type of code you're
creating so that it can use the best
engine to process that code I hope that
makes sense so we have a whole bunch of
types here I always tell people to use
HTML strict or transitional not XHTML
not going to get into the reasons here
but for now just use HTML 401 strict so
what that will do is will tell
dreamweaver to first of all dreamy roll
inside insert this doctype code in the
page telling the browser with the cult
about and at the same time the code that
Dreamweaver will create will be HTML
4.01 strict so yeah we'll go with that
so layout CSS now what says it's asking
us here the code to create this layout
do you want to add it to the head of the
page now had referred to pieces of a
page in between the on top of the body
I'll show you better in a sec it's
basically embedding the code in the page
or do you want to create a new file to
embed that code a code to create that's
loud or do you actually want to link to
an existing file so we're going to say
just add it to the head I'm gonna go
create so here's our page we've seen
this before so let's take a look at the
code scroll up and now quizzes minimize
all these so you see head and we scroll
down and head that's
head the head section of a web page is
the section that contains all kinds of
miscellaneous information mostly for the
browser that people don't actually see
so nobody's going to see this right
you're not going to see this this code
appear in the pages anything that users
see is going to be in between the body
and body tags so as you can see here not
only do we have all the CSS rules that
we need to create our page generated for
us buy dreamweaver here but they've also
tagged the divs with the proper IDs to
create this layout here let's preview
this I have to save changes so let me
say that so whenever you add a new to
page from a template you're going to
save it so I'm going to call it DW
template so here we go here's our page
and we said give us a liquid layout of
flows and here we go so now instead of
having to fudge around with trying to
get our layout to work it's all ready
for us all we have to do is go in there
and on our own content you'll welcome to
the page and say my domain and you and
we can just put in our own text right
this is just like using Microsoft Word
so you get the idea and you can drop in
images as you normally would I hit enter
certain image and i'll put the reading
man here all those i will put any
alternate text for the sake of what
we're doing save that preview that of 12
so as you can see i'm able to build up a
page really really quickly by using a
template
so you can see if we go in we got our
Roxy we've got our DW template here
let's see the CSS see all the CSS that's
been added to our page now that doesn't
stop us we can add ons the assessors so
we can go in here which redefine a tag
let's say our paragraphs paragraphs here
we go in this document only so they say
the font style for our paragraphs Times
New Roman and we're going to do
something bad we're going to make it all
bolt just really stupid but for a second
demo say that f12 so here we go so as
you can see with the template we can add
our own rules and we can do all kinds of
funky stuff and it saves us a lot of
times you notice how much time it took
me to show you how to just create a new
page from a template versus having to
build it from scratch another great
thing about these templates is that
they've been debugged the good people at
adobe have worked hard to make sure that
these templates work consistently in all
the browsers you have much less had
headaches and hassles with with your
layouts and one last bone is as you can
see you see this slash forward slash
star and the closes / star or slush
these are what you would call comments
and essentially these are instructions
left to us by the people at Dreamweaver
who created these templates for us and
these instructions tell us why they're
doing certain things and this is this is
a good way you can actually learn from
their work and you can learn how they do
certain things and why they do certain
things if you decide to become a real
cold monkey yet another reason to use a
dreamweaver templates as you can see how
these people who you can be guaranteed
has spent a lot of time working on this
stuff to make it work it it will save
you headaches why reinvent the wheel to
see
what they've done and you can build out
from there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
