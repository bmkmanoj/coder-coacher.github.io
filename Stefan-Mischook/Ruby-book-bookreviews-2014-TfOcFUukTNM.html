blog I'm just going to do a quick quick
book review a couple of book reviews so
the first one is this learn to program
second edition with Ruby now some of you
may know what I'm actually working on a
couple Ruby courses so I have some
publishers irri gracious enough to send
me some books so this is a good book for
total beginners to programming it covers
the very basic concepts of ruby
programming and programming in general
and yeah it's very basic it's not a very
thick book but it's a it's something
might be cool if you're like a teacher
teaching programming this might be an
interesting book to work with and if
your total beginner to programming and
you want to learn Ruby this will be a
big book now on the other hand if you
are brothers if you are an experienced
programmer and you want to get into ruby
programming this is a book that i would
recommend actually highly i just got it
recently started reading it and it's one
of those books where you have the the
quick blast introduction to ruby and
then you have the reference some people
who may be asking why would you want to
get a print book when you can just look
at tutorial in the web well this is a
good reference book there's advantages
to printed books or a kindle book i
suppose i just kind of like the printed
book back in the day when I was a
hardcore programmer I used to read thick
books like this all the time used to
read I could read something like this in
the four or five days but I was an
insomniac then and that's why I learned
so many different languages and
technologies it just couldn't fall
asleep so I would read anyway this is a
great book if you already know how to
program because it really gets to the
nuts and bolt of nuts and bolts of the
Ruby programming language quite quickly
and this is the lot of these people call
this the pickaxe book yeah so
I would recommend the books Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
