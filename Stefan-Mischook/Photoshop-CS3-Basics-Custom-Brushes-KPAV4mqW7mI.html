how to create our own custom brushes
inside a Photoshop and in particular
I'll be looking at how to create your
own dirty or grungy brush some of these
sometimes you can see in the brushes
window and if you look to select your
own brushes just by scrolling down here
you'll see that there are a few
defaulted brushes inside of Photoshop
and in an earlier exercise we saw how to
apply some of these brushes but i'll
just pick out one of these custom
photoshop ones here and as you can see
looks great but it's rather small and if
i was in fact to increase the size of
this particular brush and you can do
that just by increasing the diameter see
the basic shape of it but notice that it
gets a little blurry at this point and
it doesn't look as good as is as it
would have if it was smaller what's nice
about these brushes is that you can
apply them in any number of different
ways either as a mask or some other
elements on top of text and you can
create a very nice grungy look two
things so for example I just happen to
have an image that's open right here if
it were to have a mask applied to it you
can see that I've masked out a portion
of that using this brush but as you can
see I'm not really all that satisfied
with it because it gives me this sort of
blurred effect when it's increased in
size so along comes the question of well
if we have one that's not small how can
I make one that's bigger so I'm going to
show you something with a very small a
very small image it's actually 300 by
300 not all that much to begin with but
nevertheless the point being is you
could duplicate this same idea with any
number of different kinds of sizes and
any number of different kinds of images
for example you can create a brush out
of your particular signature you could
create a brush out of a picture if you
wish but here I'm going to create a
grungy or diff
type of brush so let's see how to do
this well in order to effectively use
this brush it's best if we create
something that becomes more black and
white or in those gray scale tones so
you could certainly turn this into a
grayscale image by going to the image
modes and working to grayscale however
what I want to do is go into my
adjustments and I will in fact number
one first and foremost show you what
happens when you use a invert and what
happened is is that I've inverted those
darker and lighter colors you'll notice
that there are areas in here that look
darker and some are lighter doesn't have
this bluish tint to it so I'm going to
go to adjustments and I'll work with
threshold and as we can see by sliding
the threshold level you can see that
we've picked up a lot of those blacks
scratches and different elements that
are inside of here so I'll just click OK
after some final adjustments see what it
looks like I liked that line that's
happening right there that looks good so
at this point we can do a number of
things I can create an a brush out of
this entire size of the image and to do
that first I would have to select all
control a and once doing that I'll then
go to edit define brush preset you can
give it a name I've called it after the
jpg stress detail let's call it stress
detail one because I'm going to make a
number of different brushes based on
this so I'll just put that on the side
for a second and let's go back to our
practice area here and we'll take out
some of our brushes we have a custom
brush so if I scroll down to the bottom
you can see that the width of this is
300 and when I apply it voila we have a
nice brush that can be applied in just
about any number of different areas any
number of different ways you could have
even made a pattern out of this and that
would have created a repetitive sort of
scene along those lines however I'm
going to go back to our original element
that we had open and what I'm going to
do is create some other brushes try this
I'm going to not a fixed style
but let's say just normal here troll d
I'll deselect that and at this point
maybe I only want this area to be a
brush so I could select only that area I
could define this as a brush preset and
you can see what it looks like here it's
at 300 which does happen to be a little
large so it probably should be cropping
this so let me do this once i have that
selection i could just come to image i
could crop it into this size then if i
make my define brush preset you can see
what that looks like I undo this you can
produce brushes in any number of
different ways different fashion let me
show you using our practice what our
brush actually ends up looking like down
here and now I just have this small
portion what's going on so you can apply
this in a number of different ways let's
go back to that brush example and check
it out if I do in fact put in a little
element like this I could apply that
brush all of a sudden this gets very
very scratchy sort of overlapping those
elements you can also switch back to one
of the other brushes that we've created
larger brush and you can see how that
looks
you
really want to get that scratchiness
happening in here and if you produce
this you can do this at any given size
in any different fashion any number of
different ways and you can add a whole
slew of brushes to your work
incidentally if you were to apply this
upon some text
it would also show up with a grungy
looking text many many different ways to
sort of apply this technique and show it
looks like one last job you'll notice
that a lot of these that we just created
seem to have work into areas where there
was a lot of dark space well if I just
simply define this area now I don't
think we'll have to crop it but if we
just come in here and say define brush
pattern there's my sample click OK now
I'll go back to at last one which is the
new one which we've created and notice
this one is a little scratch here
and doesn't have as much in the way of
what it's going to look like so
nevertheless these are different ways of
creating your own custom rushes and how
you can do it inside a Photoshop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
