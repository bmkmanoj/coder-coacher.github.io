again I'm on Mac you can use whatever
operating system you want to use doesn't
matter Python is the same so I got the
shell here
you remember you use the shell to send
commands I can just type in 23 and it
gives us back 23 or I can type in the
text so if I steps and it tastes backs
to find a step scuze me if I do this
without quotes watch what happens o
arrow or trace back right here this is
the key thing named arrow names death is
not defined and that will take us to our
next subject before I get into that
though let's just open up a new window a
new file a new Python file rather so we
can save our work remember when you type
commands in the shell you can't save
your work but if you type commands in a
Python file and I'm going to ctrl save
that and I save it to the desktop I'm
going to call it variables you can call
it whatever you like here is variables
now I can still type in commands here I
can type in code here that depends on
whether or not I want to save the stuff
but for now let me just take them this
way here because I want to show you two
things so why did we get this name error
and this message to us this Oh business
this is basically Python say well your
code you've got a problem your buddy you
made a problem here's the problem name
error an error in your name and it's
talking about this here right so what
does that mean that means that you can't
just type in text like that and expect
Python to be happy about it
some of you are probably saying yeah but
you just take them text here in quotes
and pass on didn't complain what's the
difference you will learn that in
programming you have this concept of
something called a data type well we can
reverse it we can say it's a type of
data
remember data is just a nerd word for
information so to put it in a nice
sentence data type
are just types of information and
programming languages like Python will
handle different types of information in
different ways
so there are some rules with that so
we'll get more to the dirty details as
we go as we go through the course but
understand our data types and there are
a few data types in Python more than a
few but we're going to talk about just a
couple in the next couple videos so
let's jump into our Python window here
and I'm going to type in the print
command here it's going to print I'm
going to put six and they're going to go
print I'm going to put it in brackets 66
and here is an example of reusing the
print command to print out two data
types now what all the print command
does it just prints the result of our
code it present' to the screen it just
prints the text to the screen and I said
the result of our code a set of prints
the result of our Kovach because you can
get a little bit more complicated than
that but I'm going off on different
directions so let me just get back to
what we're doing so all you want to take
away now is that we have two different
data types that we're looking at here
now you see this little pound sign it
shares the same key as of three this is
called a comment comment now comment is
just text that Python ignores Python
will ignore any text after this pound
symbol here so it's placed leave
comments or leave messages behind the
case and about the code so we're
learning about data types and what data
types and we're going to learn about two
different data types in this little
lesson we learned about int which is
show for integers which are numbers 0 to
huge numbers with 0 1 2 3 4 lies within
800,000 10 billion those are all in so
they play with that now and we're gonna
learn about something called strings
which are strings of text or string of
characters so in Python to create an INT
you just write out the end it could be 6
it could be 65 it could be six thousand
eight hundred billion whatever that will
all work and to create strings
in Python you use the quotes whatever
characters you put in between quotes is
considered a string in Python
I put the plural here string string in
Python so let me just save this and let
me run this by function and 5 watch down
here you see no errors right no big deal
it printed out the number the int and it
printed out the string right so it's
pretty good now the string it could be
any symbols with you could be letters
capitals or case it could be symbols
these are all pretty good strings so
I'll just say that again function f5 or
you can just go run run module if you
hear no problem but if I do this I'll
save that and then I'll function f5
again
invalid syntax now syntax is a nerd word
for code so all Python is telling us
here wait a second this doesn't make any
sense to us so in the next video we're
going to learn why this doesn't make any
sense to Python so I suggest to you
going forward is you print up some
numbers print up some strings remember
you treat your strings with the double
quotes you can also create strings with
single quotes and the next video we'll
learn more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
