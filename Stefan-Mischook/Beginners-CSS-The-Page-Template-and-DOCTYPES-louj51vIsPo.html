the basic template that we're going to
use for many of the supplemental CSS
tutorial or training videos that fall
outside of the core project base
tutorial and it's a very basic page we
have our headers and some paragraphs and
we get out of a list item here what I
want to point out in this particular
video it's something that falls a little
bit outside of CSS but it's important
because there's a lot of misinformation
out there as far as I'm concerned and
this has to do with the doctype up here
now everybody out there in any world of
web design all these nerds they all say
you should use the XHTML doctype whether
it be transitional or strict or whatnot
this is a big mistake which you really
want to use is the strict doctype now
I'm showing you this and I'm showing you
the options here in Dreamweaver you
don't have to use Dreamweaver of course
and use any editor you want any help
here's a key thing XHTML is a terrible
choice simply because all the supposed
benefits of using XHTML basically the
page will render quicker and the
browser's are lost with about seventy to
eighty percent of the browser's being
used out there right now I'm creating
this video in late 2009 basically IE six
seven and eight and moving forward does
not recognize XHTML just in case you
don't know XHTML is basically XML that's
meant that structured rather to work
like HTML the problem is is that
Microsoft refuses to accept XHTML as a
language for HTML so when I EC's the
XHTML doctype it doesn't know what to do
with it so what it does it drops down
into something called quirks mode which
is basically it's down and dirty
way of processing pages and when it does
drop it to quirks mode all those
advantages or supposes advantages of
using XHTML or lost so it's kind of
useless but if you use HTML for strict
then I II and the other browsers will
use a and engine built into it that
processes HTML for straight nice and
effectively and efficiently you see just
in case you don't know the web browsers
will have several engines if you will
that will interpret code in a web page
depending on the doctype so when you
declare a doctype at the top of the page
here you're basically telling the
browser which engine you want to use to
process the page
the other reason why you don't want to
use XHTML is because if you get into
JavaScript or don scripting using you
know jquery where you get all those
fancy effects or this basic JavaScript
where you want to do some Dom script if
you don't know what this is you can go
to cure JavaScript calm you can learn
all about it there again XHTML gets in
the way of Dom scripting and makes it
very difficult for you as a programmer
to actually write code that works so at
the end of the day you really have to
drop down to HTML for this is the
ultimate choice today and for the
foreseeable future
okay now that we've seen the basic
template page we're going to use to do
our examples in CSS we can move forward
with concrete examples</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
