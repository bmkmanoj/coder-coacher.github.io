and set up our database the next step is
to start the coding and I've looked at
how we want to build this project and I
figured that the first thing we probably
want to work on is the template object
this will be the object that will
display our views and the first thing
that I want to do is to work on a
temporary view that we use to test
things so I'm going to open up my V
underscore login dot PHP file and I'm
just going to fill it with some sample
HTML for the moment so I'm just putting
in standard HTML code I have a doctype
normal HTML head and body tags and I'm
going to fill this with a little bit of
sample information just temporarily
and I'm also going to include the CSS
stylesheet
and you'll notice that the link to the
style sheet includes the views folder
and I'll explain that more in a second
so let me open up style dot CSS and it
looks like this I have already set up
all the code for this style sheet just
to save a little bit time in this video
series so it's just pausing the video
copying in the code and then starting
the video back up again once you're done
you can also download this code if you
want I've included the source files with
these videos so please take a look at
that it might be faster to simply copy
and paste from an existing file so now
that style.css is fully populated with
your code let's go ahead and work in I
work on our login dot PHP controller and
I'm going to start out just with some
simple sample code just to make sure our
view is working properly so I'm going to
start out with a opening PHP tag I'm
going to include the view so views
v underscore login dot PHP close that
off and as I talked about earlier the
reason why we need the views folder
included in our style sheet reference is
we are going to be using includes to
display these view files so the path to
that CSS file will be based on the
controller login dot PHP rather than
where the view file itself is located so
keep that in mind any links that appear
within the views they actually reference
the main folder not relative to where
the views are located one other thing
that I wanted to discuss briefly I'm
going to be doing something slightly
different with this particular series
and follow along with a PHP best
practice which is often in many cases
you don't want to include the closing
PHP tag for files that contain only PHP
content WordPress does this quite a few
you know PHP based systems do this and
the reason why you don't want to include
the closing tag is one it's not
necessary but mainly because you might
accidentally have spaces that get put in
after the closing PHP tag for example
like this and if you're dealing with the
header function or just it causes issues
and it's best to avoid this so one of
the best practices I'm going to be
showing you today is leaving the closing
PHP tag off and as I said this is only
for files that only contain PHP content
the server is smart enough to understand
that this file once it has an opening
PHP tag all contents within the file our
PHP and you don't need a closing PHP tag
so let's go ahead and test this and it
looks like everything's working properly
how we have our test content and it
looks like the styling is showing up
correctly that's styling bit
appears within the style that CSS file
so the next step after this is to get
started on our templates object so I'm
going to open up the template file its m
undo square template dot PHP within the
models and you'll notice i have an
opening PHP tag and i have a comment
that's going to start all of my model
files it indicates what is contained
within this file in this case it's going
to be a template class and this class is
going to handle all templating tasks
anything related to displaying views
showing the loads your errors anything
like that so to get started on this
we're going to start with a class
template like so and we're going to
probably start by initializing the
controller or the constructor excuse me
so I like adding comments just to keep
my file neat and tidy so I'm going to do
function I'm going to do two underscores
and construct and this constructor
doesn't actually need to do anything but
I always include it just in case we need
to edit things later and then below this
I'm going to start off with my functions
and the first function that I want to
build out is a function that i'm going
to call load and basically it's going to
replace the includes that we've been
using previously so include and it's
pretty simple it's just going to be a
wrapper function so functional load
and we're going to provide a URL that we
want to load and we're going to include
that URL so I'm going to save it let's
go back to login dot PHP and let's tweak
this code to test our object that we
just created so I'm going to go ahead
and copy this code fuse /v underscore
login dot PHP because we'll use it in a
second and instead of including the view
immediately I'm going to include our
template code so I'm going to do that by
using the include and instead linking in
models m underscore template dot PHP so
that'll include this file so we now have
access to the template and I'm going to
create a new template object so template
equals new template and my variable has
an upper case first letter just indicate
it's an object and keeps that in the
back of my mind for future reference
just a best practice thing that I do so
now that we have the object created
let's go ahead and use that object I'm
going to do template load and we're
going to pass in the path to our view
file save it and let's preview this so
you notice everything is working
correctly it looks like we are
correcting the template object correctly
we are loading review now you may argue
well you know we have three lines here
why is doing this approach better than
simply using one include and including
the view and the reason I would argue
that this method is better is it's a
little bit easier to scan you
immediately know that this particular
path is related to the template and you
know you're loading this particular file
so it just keeps that in the back of my
mind it makes my code a little bit
easier to scan
and you could use a simple include but
this gives it a little bit of a context
it indicates as I said before that it's
related to the template object and its
loading a specific view</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
