here just a quick one so I want to
confess what am I one of my
psychological issues well maybe my only
psychological issue I am a and a is
probably optimistic I'm an obsessive
compulsive and my excessive
compulsiveness is good for me in certain
ways because I'm a perfectionist I try
as hard as I can to make things as best
as they can be now of course looking at
some of my vlogs you wouldn't think that
but trust me I'm trying but it's also
very good encoding it's very good in
business where you always you know the
process of coding and caught the process
of building an app is a process of
continuous refinement of course right
you're always refining your code you
always refining a functionality of the
app so it's kind of cool that to be an
obsessive-compulsive in that situation
same thing with building a small
business when you're building a small
business you're always fixing problems
always trying to continuously improve
what the business does the product the
processes of the the business whether it
be back out this work managing how you
handle processing orders or manage
inventory or the way you manage your
client acquisition marketing and so
forth anyway going off on a tangent so
with the problem of obsessive-compulsive
behavior is that it can get you into a
situation where like me I get caught up
with the equipment that i'm using so
right now as i'm recording this i'm
recording this on a reasonably priced
mirrorless camera well it's not
reasonable it's actually quite expensive
it's a lumix and it cost me about it's
about 900 bucks us 8 900 us something
like that and it shoots very good video
as you can see here this is like the
evening now I have no lights on I'm just
using what's left of light outside and
recording this vlog now it's not perfect
it has its problems which are not huge
but they're just slightly inconvenient
so here I am
now obsessing over this camera and
obsessing trying to find the perfect
camera solution so I'm decided what
about the girls go out and spend another
six seven hundred dollars on another
camera that solves some problems with
this camera has but then of course when
you buy that other camera you're
probably going to have problems you're
going to probably have capabilities that
this camera has and that camera new
camera doesn't have and what happens I
get caught up in these traps of trying
to perfect my technology perfect my
tools rather but I used to build my
vlogs or my tools to write my code or
whatever tools I happen to use and I
spend more time working on my tools then
trying to work on the actual end product
that's one of my problems I get caught
up in this sometimes it's like I have to
fight it like a drug addict has to fight
not taking that hit or an alcoholic not
getting taking that drink I know it
sounds crazy but we give me an example
Mike's microphones I was a nut with
microphones I have literally spent maybe
four five thousand dollars on
microphones believe it or not and at the
end of the day the microphone I uses
either this one which is ninety nine
dollars or I use another one which is
about a hundred fifty dollar Mike
sometimes I break out my $1,500
microphones which I have a couple but
what a waste of time and money that has
been I even bought a mic preamp there's
like four or five years ago which cost
me about 7,800 bucks which was a total
waste of money i've used it i've used it
to create some courses with but at the
end of the day they don't need it you
see as an obsessive-compulsive
especially me i'm a bit of an audio file
as well i get caught up in sound quality
caught up in sound quality and in the
process of doing that sometimes i don't
produce very good sound it's a silliness
at the end of the day you got to be
careful to keep your eye on the prize
and not get cut up caught up in
peripheral activities like trying to
come up with
best camera if you're a vlogger or
trying to come up the best Mike if you
want to record podcast or music or
whatever just get decent equipment good
equipment and start doing the work
concentrate on producing a good end
product or you know because at the end
of the day people are not going to see
these little details that you probably
see it's kind of like a pimple on your
face you know you might see that pimple
on your face as this big huge thing but
for most people they barely notice it
and the same thing with the tools that
you use the tools may enhance your
capabilities in some situations a little
bit but at the end of the day most of
the time it has you know not no
noticeable impact so when choosing a
laptop for your coding work don't go
crazy don't you know find a good one
choose one looks good but don't you know
worry about this processor that
processor if it's this type of rabbit
that type of right within limits you
know at the end of the day you know like
the new generation processor typically
is maybe ten fifteen percent faster than
the previous generation you know what i
mean so it's not like a huge game
breaking different most of the time of
course there are exceptions if you like
doing heavy duty processing or a fine
with your your computer just doesn't
have the juice to do what you need to do
that does happen on occasion but my
advice you try not to get obsessed with
the tools of the trade and be more
obsessed with the end product that
you're looking to produce I hope that
helps ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
