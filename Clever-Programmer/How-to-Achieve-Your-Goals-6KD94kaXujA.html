something really important today so if
you have like two minutes please watch
this it might change your life
look some of you remember I had a goal
of reaching 1,000 subscribers on my
youtube channel okay here's a picture I
will show you guys it's proof that I had
this low for a while now
you
now how did this happen this doesn't
happen magically I set a goal and I
follow the relentlessly and I'm sure our
little ton of you guys were annoyed as
how I kept posting about it so much but
see that's the exact thing what you got
to do is follow your goal so
persistently that it annoys the out
of other people see people give way too
much of a about what others think
about them
this one girl stopped posting pictures
of her fitness because of her colleagues
were getting annoyed but there's one
thing that people don't notice when you
do something that's successful it's how
much crap you actually failed to get
there let me show you
you
the list of failures doesn't actually
end there as you can see there are only
two successes out of those let me show
you more goals that actually failed
you
once again you can see a list of all of
those failures but you see the reason
why it's so important to set so many
goals is even if you follow one right
that good now what does 1k subscribers
actually means for me I have 200
students enrolled in my website and I'm
making a difference in 32 different
countries there has been over ninety
eight days worth of footage watched by
over 38,000 people I'm gonna end it with
this don't make your goal small they can
succeed every time make your goal so big
that you mostly failed them but when you
succeed you succeed big</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
