than just a lesson
it's a story when I started my path on
this journey there was nothing for me
but confusion you have to understand
that programming wasn't something that
came naturally to me it took a long time
and it was a lot of pain it was then
that I had this idea why does everybody
have to go through the same pain that I
did
why can't learning for them be easy I
took it upon myself to build my own
educational system for computer
programming and teach it to every one of
you after all
if of all the people I could do it so Q
acts clever programmer you don't learn
through boring lectures you learn
through hands-on interactive exercises
engaging lessons you collaborate with
other students in the community to
brainstorm ideas because here you're not
just another frustrated student who
doesn't get help our community cares for
you so what are you waiting for go
enroll now and see how it can change
your life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
