clever programmer calm and I want to
talk with you guys about the power of
investing in yourself and what can it do
for you and how it can actually make you
a better computer programmer or a
software developer now there are a lot
of people that I you know talk to and
and see who are trying to learn and and
are really struggling with a lot of
things but you know they have good
intentions their intentions that their
very core or genuine they want to work
hard they want to improve they want to
get better but most people never want to
spend anything to learn something like
so many people are so interested in you
know their they always want to buy
something they'll spend on buying new
shoes they'll spend on buying new
clothes they'll buy suits they will buy
any kind of technology you know if
you're interested in soccer you might
buy a soccer ball or a basketball and
people are always you know we love mine
stuff right we love I love to buy new
things that get new things but when
people want to accelerate their learning
and get better and get better results
people hesitate on buying a book a book
that's worth maybe ten twenty thirty
dollars right but it has a potential to
change your life that's honestly how I
think of anytime I can see a way to
further education right it has anything
that you invest in that's in yourself
that can actually improve you that has
the pot that has potential to power and
change your entire life and people are
always trying to shortchange themselves
in that regard they want to spend money
when it comes to buying new things but
they hesitate and those new things
aren't an investment in themselves
there are investment that is that is
super
official and it's okay right invest
right like I bought this watch I love
this watch really cool watch but I this
is something that I was you know
thinking about should I get it should I
not get it but I ended up and then
ultimately ended up getting it right but
when it comes to getting improving your
education improving the quality of your
learning skills people will be very
hesitant in spending people are just
always thinking about so what's my point
my point is stop being hesitant when it
comes to investing in yourself because
that's the most important investment you
can make and any time that you invest in
yourself you'll see benefits that are
not just twofold or threefold they'll
literally be like tenfold or more
something that you can't even
quantitatively measure okay so that time
that it takes you to think about buying
that new book that you have in your mind
or purchasing the course I could
potentially teach you something new you
shouldn't have spent that time actually
purchasing it and then learning from it
okay a lot of people are like hey I
don't know if I should get a membership
to this site or I don't know if I should
you know purchase this book well if you
make that investment would it break your
bank and they'll be like no well then do
it and test it out and try it out if
then after you've invested in it and
it's not giving you the benefit that you
want it and it's not having any impact
on your life a lot of these things even
have a 30-day return so you could just
return them and they'll give you your
money back but ultimately my point is
you shouldn't be afraid to invest in
yourself people will all the time you'll
buy chips you'll buy random stuff you'll
buy cookies but really you're not gonna
buy an e-book for 5 bucks you're not
gonna buy you know a $2.00 app that
could teach you about computer
programming and help you so it's really
a paradigm shift that I'm suggesting
that you should think about
and that should you should try to
implement it's a different way of
looking at things but if you value
knowledge you will be very knowledgeable
that's it guys this is Kazi I'm signing
out but here are some videos you guys
can watch if you're interested ok this
is probably the newest video you can
watch my courses subscribe to the
channel and don't be afraid to invest in
yourself and learn something new ok do
your research go out learn binge learn
that's something you can't regret it's
unlike Netflix I love every single one
of you I'll see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
