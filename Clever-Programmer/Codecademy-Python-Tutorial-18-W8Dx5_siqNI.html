clever programmer comm and you are
watching code Khadem e part 18 no forget
the fingers I don't know why I did that
but it's part 18 okay I was super
excited to get to my studio today so I
can start recording this and we can get
to part 18
alright so get psyched because we're
going to get through this and it's going
to be awesome
we finished hide that has to do with
grids battleships remember just a little
recall now we're going to move on to the
n seek part of height right you can't
have hide without n seek and then it's
not cheating it's debugging so we're
going to have that as well so let's see
let's hit start next lesson great job
for now let's store coordinates for the
ship in the variables alright Narayan
put ask user for input and returns it as
a string but we're going to want to use
integers for our guesses so what they
were having us do is take an input from
the user so we can use it as a guess
right so for example this line here I
can now paste it here and let's see what
happens this is Python 3 so raw input
won't work so I'm going to copy this and
I'm going to use it in my idle which is
opened by B which is open in Python 2
okay so I'm going to hit this part and
after hitting Enter it's going to say
enter a number so whatever number I type
in it's now going to store in the
variable number okay so your user is
going to come on in at this point and
say 4 and now if I spit out number it's
4 okay it's not an integer for but it's
the string 4 if you wanted to turn it
into an integer right you'd have to call
int on it or you can just say in number
since for the strength for stored in the
variable
number okay so they're teaching us how
we can get input from the user
to do this we'll ramp the Ryan put with
in so here what they're doing they're
just saying we'll wrap the raw input
within okay what does that mean here's
what it means instead of calling into
later we can just call int right here
and store it as a variable so what
happens here I'll tell you right now if
I print out number look at what it is
integer this part got evaluated right
when the user typed in something this
entire part got evaluated to the number
for the string four and then integer got
called on that so here's what happened
int the inside parentheses part where
the user entered their number got
evaluated to four then int got called on
four and that turned it into a four and
that's stored it in the variable number
okay so this whole thing eventually just
turned into the integer for create a new
variable called guest row and set it to
that okay so what they want us to do is
just create guess row now is instead of
number call it guess row and then guess
a column so big scheme of things what
we're doing is we're creating the five
by five grid
we're randomly selecting some square
there to hide our ship and then we let
the other player try to see where the
ship is or the other player could be you
may be playing against the computer and
you have to guess where the ship is so
you have to give the row and the column
to attack that point in the grid okay so
two one right row two column one that
would mean it's two rows down and one
column over to the right that's the
right from your perspective probably
from my perspective to right as this
okay
so let's do exactly what they're saying
gas Rho is equal to int how I write this
a lot of times as I write the inner part
and then I write the outer part because
that's actually how Python will read it
so I'll do Ryan put gas column okay and
now once the user gives us something
they'll store it as like a number and
then we should call int on that number
right so that's the logic behind why we
need to now call int right here okay
once this part gets evaluated to like a
string four and it gets called on it and
it just turns into a 4 and gets stored
there okay same logic applies here oh
sorry not guess column guess row and for
this one it should be guessed column but
not row here it gets call that should be
good we should now simply be able to
save and submit it's taking a second so
I'm going to refresh the page but I
copied the code so just in case
everything is gone we should be a-okay
guess row okay I'll say for it gets
column I'll say 3 okay those got stored
in there as integers you see that no
strings around that bad boy it's not
cheating it's debugging awesome now we
have a hidden battleship and a guess
from our player in the next few steps
we'll check out the user's guest to see
if they are correct
okay so in the next few steps we're
going to figure out how we can detect
what the user guessed and check it
against the random hidden ship location
if it's correct then the ship maybe
sinks otherwise it doesn't sink and we
keep playing so you can already probably
imagine it's going to be some kind of
you know if then kind of situation and
if we want to play the game over and
over again
what helps you do things over and over
again hmm does it sound like loops so
maybe we'll have to put our entire
program in a giant loop okay
so already start thinking about that
while we're waiting and debugging this
part of the program it will be helpful
to know where that battleship is hidden
let's add a print statement that
displays the location of the hidden ship
so we're going to try to find where it's
hidden and so we'll print out that of
course will remove this output under
finished debugging since if we left it
in our game wouldn't be very challenging
so if we right now we're just doing it
for debugging and seeing where the
hidden location is but if we had it for
the game the game wouldn't be very
challenging because you'll see right
away where you hit it and then you can
just give guess the right row and right
column and win every time so print ship
row and print ship coal short for column
okay four four okay so we guessed four
four but the actual location was one
zero all right hit or miss so now we're
going to detect if we hit it or miss it
probably okay now for the fun we have
the actual location of the ship and the
players guessed so we can check to see
if the player guessed right that makes
sense for a guest to be right yes column
should equal ship column and guess row
should equal ship bro that also makes
sense the column should match and the
row should match right if they if you
want to guess the correct location bro
should match with the column and vice
versa so I think it the idea there the
example above is just a reminder about
how if statements work I think at this
point you have plenty of practice you
understand how if statements work so try
to write it without looking at the code
and then come back to this video so here
is ours if guess row equal equal ship
row
and guess Col equal equal ship coal then
we're going to say print step two this
is what I'm reading now I just
translated step one now we're on step
two in that case print print
congratulations
you sank my battleship and boom okay
that's pretty good that's a you know
kind of the logic of the game right here
okay let's play this game a little bit I
think it's ready to be taken out for a
spin here so let's play it a little bit
and we're going to cheat we're going to
put this print statement we're going to
figure out where the hidden ships are
before we get to guess our answer so
this way we can win on evaluating a
command undefined what command is
undefined I don't see any undefined
commands okay let's refresh this page
and come back to it
join okay print see print evil print
ship Row is not defined ship Row is
defined right there what line is it
complaining about line 20 it says ship
Row is not defined well that would make
sense because it's not defined at that
point it's defined here okay so we see
that it was put at zero zero so we're
gonna guess row zero and guess column
zero and it's going to say
congratulations you sank my sink
sank my ship now let's do it again it
gets a twofer row it printed it out and
for column it gets four so I'm going to
get two for row four for column and
again it goes congratulations you thank
my ship
where is two and four well zero Row 1
Row 2 so this is Row 2 and then where's
column 4 0 1 2 3 4 so that's actually
where the hidden point is okay see right
here awesome
let's just start next lesson danger Will
Robinson great of course the player
isn't going to guess right all the time
so we also need to handle the case where
the guess is wrong so what happens if
the user guesses wrong well I would
think that the user should have less
guesses left right so let's say the user
had 10 guesses if he guesses wrong he
should have less guesses left maybe 9
guesses
that's just my hunch let's see what they
say the example above prints out oh the
element in the third row and first
column because they're all add an else
under the if we you know we wrote in the
previous step print out you miss my
battleship okay
so what I'm going to write is if the
column and the row does not match with
the guest then I'm going to say print
you missed my battleship okay and then
I'm going to say I'm going to do set the
list element at guests row guest column
to X okay so I'm going to change that
element in the list to and X which means
that let's say that your ship was hidden
right here where I highlighted okay so
let's say your ship was hidden in Row 1
column 1 this part right here and let's
say I guessed in row 0 column 1 so I
guess right here since I'm mister ship
is going to say you missed the ship and
it's going to turn this into an X that
way
we know we where I've already tried to
shoot your ship or where I've guessed
already okay that's what we're
effectively trying to do here so I'm
gonna say board right that's how that's
the variable board right there I'm gonna
say board guess row guess column where
the user guessed set that location equal
to X okay so if you guess 0 1 row 0
column 1 up there it's going to change
the O in to an X as the last line in
your else statement call print board so
now we're going to call our print board
function which is going to print out the
board in a nice way instead of our
regular print function because remember
regular print function just prints out
the list of five elements and which are
all lists themselves which just looks
hideous but when we create our print
board function we make it look really
pretty and have our each o on its online
so you can see the X so we're printing
at the board up so we can see the X and
that should be good okay so let's play
the game here we're going to guess Row 3
column 2 and it says you missed my
battleship right because the actual
location was 3 0 so we guess Row 3
column 2 but they hit their ship at 3
and 0 now it says you missed my
battleship and it shows us that at
location 3 - that's where we try to
shoot the ship so this is 0 this is Row
1 this is Row 2 Row 3 and this is a
column 0 column 1 and column 2 okay
let's move on start next lesson bad aim
great job now we can handle both correct
and incorrect guesses from the user but
now let's think a little bit more about
the Miss condition what else should
happen in Miss again in my head we
should be reducing lives or something
right reducing guesses or something
there should be a negative there
otherwise what kind of game is it they
can enter I guess that's off the board
they can guess a spot they've already
yes yeah so what about if they guess off
the board your board is a 5 by 5 grid
which means that you should you can the
only rows you can access is between the
number 0 and 5 including 0 and 5 and the
only columns you can access is 0 and 5
including 0 and 5 so if user guesses
negative 1 for column and positive 6 for
row should they be able to guess that
and if they do guess that what happens
well your program throws a giant error
or big error written in red which
everybody hates do you use one of your
favorite apps and if you do something I
don't know kind of weird
that doesn't make any sense you click
somewhere there is nothing does it just
crash the entire app and red lines start
showing up no so they must have done
something in the backend to be like okay
if the user does something stupid we
still want to take care of it and not
give them an error back so that's
effectively what you're trying to do
predict you're trying to predict these
things right like misty mystic max I'm
trying to predict the errors so you can
catch them and make everything look
super nice so they can enter I guess
that's off the board too they can guess
a spot they've already guessed so you
can guess to 1 then s to 1 again
should it allow you to do that no that
would be boring keep guessing the same
spot they can just miss the ship yeah
they can just miss the ship we've kind
of taken care of that by saying you
missed my ship but we want to now
probably do something else we'll add
these tests inside our else condition
let's build the first test now so if X
is not in range 8 or why not in range 3
so think about it if what we can say is
if ship row guess row is not in range 5
0 1 2 3 4 right those are your five
places oh sorry I think I confuse you
guys earlier when I said 0 2 5 including
0 &amp;amp; 5 that's wrong it's 0 &amp;amp; 4 including
0 4 0 1 2 3 4 that gives you 5 locations
it gives you five rows 0 1 2 3 4 that
gives you 5 columns ok sorry about that
I didn't mean to confuse you but I fixed
that now let's keep going so what we can
say is if our ship bro or error guest
Row is not in the range 5 right range 5
what does that give you that gives you a
list with it goes from 0 to 4 so range 5
okay zero one two three four that's
actually all our ship rows can be and
our ship columns or our guest columns
can only be between that range and
including those end points so range of
five is our range so what we can say is
if our if guess row not in range five or
guess column not in range five then say
outside the range or something yeah
print your thing was outside of the
range you you got it wrong and how does
you know our conditions
I'll show you their beauty really
quickly
you guest outside of the board
okay so it picked it up it says you
guessed outside of the board and how did
the or condition work well let me go
through it one more time and let's say I
put two and I put five you guess outside
of the board how did it work
guess row not in range five range five
remember is zero one two three four and
range five here is also zero one two
three four
the only time the if condition runs if
the block of code underneath the if
statement runs is if the condition is
evaluated to true so this whole part is
one condition okay and if this whole
thing evaluates are true then this block
of code runs if this value is still
false then line 38 and anything
underneath that you know if it's part of
that if statement will not run so how
will this work okay
so not in checks if the guest row was in
this list okay for example I can show
you a trick with N and it checks if
something exists so I can say five in
list 0 5 6 4 and you can see it's a true
if I do the same thing and I don't have
a 5 in there it will say false if I say
5 not in 0 5 4 what do you think it will
say we're saying 5 is not in that list
just going to give me back false because
5 is in that list and now if I do it on
this list they'll say true you're right
5 is not in that list ok so you can use
not in an end to kind of check through
things instead of having to do these
long loops Python made it so it's very
easy for you so how does this work
destro evaluates to some integer in our
case it was a 2 right we gave it a 2
right here for guest column we gave it a
5 so let's see what happens to two not
in
zero one two three four is to not in all
of that right that's uh this statement
right here what do you think it will be
right let's take it in our Idol and put
it right there it says false and now
let's check this part is this part false
what's going on here well if we go
through this part guess column is six
this evaluates to a what a false
statement or sorry we have five here
this part of value is a true statement
right sorry Idol true
you're right five is not it so we have
this statement is a false and this
statement is a true and lo and behold we
come back to our bare-bones fundamentals
boolean logic and I've already gave you
those poison and ice cream or statement
examples so you should be a boss at this
and figure it out right away what is
this whole thing and evaluate to don't
fail me here please it's going to
evaluate to a true right the only time
or statement is false is when both of
the conditions are false so now this
whole thing evaluates to a true and our
line 38 runs okay hopefully the that
blew your mind or statements are not
something you know just use for very
simple examples you cannot actually use
them for some complicated cool stuff as
well alright add a new if statement that
is under the on that is nested under the
else so nested under the else this means
that I'm not going to put a newest
statement here it's going to be a part
of the else statement so it needs to run
every time this else blah
runs so it needs to be indented Stevens
light example about it should check if
guests row is not in range five so I
guess rope um guess row not in range
five and guess call not in range five
okay they did that hideous thing with
the slash I'm not going to stoop down to
that level I hate that backward slash so
what they're saying is that you can do
this and hit enter and then continue
writing code here and you'll see it as
one line but that just makes your code
look hideous don't do it if guests Road
not in range five and guess column is
not in range five and it reads like
English right at the end of the day
that's what I want you to oh I'm sorry
or or do they do yeah or basically what
we want to do is any one of them is
outside of the range it should stop
because if you did end and both of the
statements would have to be true you
remember but then both conditions have
to be true for it to evaluate to a true
so what that means is that both of row
and column would have to be outside of
the board but that's not necessarily
true only one of the indices a row or a
column has to be outside of the board
and then the whole thing is false or in
this in our case it's true and then we
run like you you are outside of the
board or something if guests row not in
range five in guests column not in range
five let's see what happens print oops
that's kind of funny that's not even in
the ocean it's almost like a
disrespectful message right after your
if statement add an else I got to make
it look nicer here
else and that else should be a part of
that if statement that we wrote right
this else is actually connected to that
if statement you can't just write a else
by itself it has to be connected to an
if statement else that contains your
existing handler for an incorrect guess
um one add a new if statement that is
nested under the else if that is the
case print out oops
after your new if statement add an else
that contains your existing handler for
and incorrect guess what do they mean by
existing hand ler okay let's reason
through this if you guess my row and
column correctly you win hooray if you
don't we run this else statement here
I'm mark that spot as X and I print the
board if guess is if guess if you guess
outside of the range I print oops that's
not even in the ocean do they want me to
put this whole thing right here now I
what's going on so basically that's
saying that if it's not out of the range
then go ahead and Mark that spot as an X
yeah I think that's what they're saying
it's weird not again great now let's
handle the second type of incorrect
guess the player guesses a location
those already guessed how will we know
that a location was previously guessed
okay add an else if so okay first of all
think about it how can we know the first
location was already
yes it's simple you guys that location
has an X on it right if it doesn't have
an O it as an X on it you already know
it's been checked so don't check that so
maybe just write a simple else if for
whatever condition that checks for that
X if it's that X and you know guess
again or something
so here add an else--if to see if the
guessed location already has an X in it
so I'm going to write an else--if which
I can put in here right elsif goes in
between if and else so I can say else if
a board of that guess row and guess
column if that is equal to an X so what
will happen the board this board is a 5
by 5 grid I'm not going to put it here
it's going to look confusing but this is
if this is a 5 by 5 grid
this is an index this is some index and
this is another index using this you
access an element of the board and that
element might either be an O or if the
ship has already been hit it might be an
X okay so we're checking if it's an X so
if that is an X we're going to say print
you guessed that one already okay
just like that
I did you guessed that one all ready I
did put that message did you put that
message in your elsif statement yep I
did they want me to put this else if in
here
is that what they want me to do
you
did you remember to add the you guess
that one already message in your else if
statement
I said if that board location already
has an X print you guessed that oh all
my goodness okay I didn't put a period
in there okay Wow
big deal all right these guys you got to
be careful gotta pay attention to detail
attention to detail goodness okay guys
um so for this video that is it we are
going to continue from test run and
we're getting so close to sinking the
ship yours you sunk my battleship and
all over here and finishing this up just
to so stay motivated you're doing a
great job making it so far because I
know we're so far into this but all good
things come with hard work okay
so don't give up now you're at your
beast mode right now we're at 57% and
where are we
68% we're almost completed with this
okay we're more than halfway there and
we have pretty much completed the game
we just have to do some very basic parts
of it now all right that's it for this
video please like the video if you liked
it please subscribe to the channel it
would really help out and other than
that I will see you guys in Codecademy
Python tutorial part 19 boom nailed it
