am 54 in other videos you said to get on
youtube i don't want to or make any
udemy videos can you still make a living
coding and am I too old okay Lisa this
is a very good question that you have
you said I'm 54
I'm worried first of all am I too old
that's one of your concerns and then
also you mentioned that you don't want
to get in front of a camera and you
don't want to create content or whatever
okay great
not everybody wants to create content
not everybody wants to do videos I
totally get it
99% of the developers actually even more
and none of them do any of that okay and
you don't have to it's possible for you
to get jobs it's possible for you to get
work without any of those things keep in
mind guys that I got my first job in 3
months of learning to code okay wasn't
some amazing thing that happened there
are a few things and I always talk about
them you know in my emails I talked
about it last livestream if you missed
it
go watch it and I'm gonna be talking
about it over the next coming weeks I
have some amazing things put together
for you guys like this masterclass where
i cover a lot but to answer Lisa's
question you're not too old because
you're gonna be 55 regardless of what
happens in your life right you're 54
right now you're gonna be 55 somebody
who's 55 is gonna be 56 regardless of
what happens the question is do you want
to be 55 exactly how you are right now
or do you want to be 55 with a new skill
added on okay so that's kind of really
what it is and for you to get some kind
of result in 3 to 6 months or maybe even
a year let's say it takes you a year
that's not that long of a time okay it's
still happening within that time
for if you're whether if you're too old
I have also made a special video on this
which is called am I too old to start
coding and how that video kind of came
about was this one person one of my
students she said her name was Catherine
and she said that she was I think
forty-five years old she had three kids
had a full-time job had a husband and
she finds it very difficult that out of
that all of that stuff she gets any like
getting any time to code but she was
still finding two to three hours to code
every single day and then improving one
route to go is spend a lot of time and
just work with hours and that's usually
what I say is like the theoretical route
where you can just spend a lot of time
coding and building those skills but
here's another alternative route that I
am a big fan of that I think is highly
effective and this is something that
came on came out in Carnegie Mellon
Carnegie Mellon right that's the name of
the university their study and they said
85% of your financial success comes from
your likeability your personal skills
your communication all right and so
basically in other words to sum it up
85% of your success comes with your soft
skills 15% of your success comes with
technical skills so here's the awesome
part as a 54 year old you have all this
experience that you've gained in your
life that will be helping you unlike
somebody who was 20 when they were
starting okay so maybe being younger it
can even be a disadvantage at certain
times okay it can be advantage in other
ways where we have maybe more time to
invest maybe more energy maybe more
passion and motivation but what you have
is a lot of references throughout your
life you can use those okay to get a
jump start
and you only have to know actually a
little bit of coding what I would have
you spend your time on is learn how to
do practical things that solve people's
problems
don't just be doing those coding
exercises that are super complicated and
require all this crazy math</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
