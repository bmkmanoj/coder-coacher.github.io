the night to get some pizza and go to my

this area pretty dark as you can see
it's kind of like cabin in the woods
that was actually one of my favorite
horror movies of all times all right
guys we are in our tower as you guys can
see very very dark outside it's no
warning the hell's that don't
hit that bruh okay guys so we don't know
anybody in this area so we're gonna have
to navigate you guys now we're heading
to my oldest brother's place where he
has some pizza coming in
change of plans guys first we're gonna
have to go pick up some pizza then we're
actually heading to our brothers place
and we're gonna bring pizza his personal
delivery boys once we give him the pizza
then I think we're gonna chill at their
place for a little bit their place is
bigger and better than ours is what the
word around town is and survived the
night out here in the dangerous
dangerous woods alright guys we are here
under pizza place it's literally called
pizza American flag is blocking my view
this is literally called pizza Wow

alright guys now we're heading to my
brother from the pizza place let's do
battle I'll see you guys at my brother's
trip alright guys what a few house
you guys what tragedy happen he wanted
alfredo sauce but he ended up getting
marinara sauce so now we heading back to
the pizza shop be here to get back the
pizza we rightfully deserve bad news we
ordered alfredo but this one are narrow
yeah there any other place open near
back because yeah we have we travel like
we travel from like San Jose to come
here but yeah we have an eight like all
day at all yeah I don't know tell you
I'm safe ways down the road that's
something everything closes down like a
clock around here oh well at least let's
just return it because I don't want to
pay for something I'm not gonna have
I've already done my books I'm throwing
all the way that's auntie is coming
tomorrow and tell the boss tomorrow what
happened and she can help you out then
cuz I don't have any I just put my money
in the safe
that's one for money so I'll make a note
to the boss and let her know all right
let me know if we're gonna have time for
do that to do that we're here for one
day but I mean this is really blows you
know look I mean it's Tahoe I'm gonna
close at 9 o'clock usually we're not the
city well I don't mean that blows what I
mean is like you know I had you read the
order that right way but it didn't come
out the right way so that poor human
mistakes happen
okay we don't get to eat now and I don't
I don't have my money now so hey there's
that and there's I order not that
something else yeah okay so it's my
fault not your nose give me something
shitty than what I want come in tomorrow
grace okay it's actually called the this
place is called Wally's huddle grille
and tavern so we ordered basically
alfredo sauce in our pizza they ended up
giving us marinara sauce so we're like
okay whatever no problem we found that
out when we went home and then we came
here to return it and yeah you guys just
heard that and basically they are
telling us that's pretty much like our
fault and that we should have just like
checked before we left even though we
said we want with Fredo sauce
they're not gonna refund us either and
they're just like oh the best thing is
come tomorrow but that's not the point
the money is like not the problem it's
just that we don't eat there in here at
all so now we're not gonna eat any food
and apparently it's our fault so this is
the place Wally's huddle Grill and
tavern we suggest you guys don't come
here yeah ever and if you get a chance
you know and you think this is not fair
you guys should find their Yelp and
actually send him a message
but we definitely don't think it's fair
and it was actually a pretty crappy
conversation that he had with us wow
this place is awesome so we're in a much
better place now tie place looks really
freaking cool
and once we eat their food we'll let you
guys know how bad it is to your
right I'm gonna go with fried rice as
well Thai style fried rice with like
chicken and yeah can we make mine spicy
this is literally the best fried rice a
number
getting some door books regular coffee
double shot espresso
it's a pretty epic view here as you guys
can see you guys should definitely come
to this place and check it out
now we're hiking up the Eagle Lake it's
gonna be really awesome we hear some
waterfalls from over there and we've
decided to take a loop to get to it
instead of the regular boring straight
path guys this just keeps getting more
and more epic alright guys so we just
wanted to see front track or not so
we're headed towards a lake it's gonna
be pretty epic yeah so the Sun is gonna
go down soon now we're coming up to
literally one of the most fascinating
and beautiful spots literally feels like
something out of Lord of the Rings
check out this bridge and we got epic
waterfalls here coming from
yeah guys okay so right after crossing
that bridge it has gone very difficult
slippery and dangerous so hopefully I'm
not gonna fall here yes got one for me
sweet Oh
equipped alright so basically that Tahoe
vacation was epic it was a lot of fun
and that ice mountain that we were going
on it was actually a lot more freaky
dangerous than it looked and then you
can like fall 500 feet from the edge and
the people that just crossed us like
there are two women they came back and
we asked them if we should go and if
we're able to go and be fine and they're
like yeah you'll be fine except no you
know they proved it to us cuz they had
like a little baby in their hands and
they just like hiked the whole thing and
came back yeah we thought would be fine
except when we went we got murdered and
we had to actually head back after just
like five minutes of hiking it so
couldn't do it we have to come back more
prepared more skilled and just get
better at all this stuff other than that
you pretty much saw everything else
right the little adventures we had now
what I want to leave you with is like
look no matter what you're doing in life
no matter how busy your life is make
time for the people that you care about
make time for your friends and family
and that's what is so enjoyable about
life right especially if you become
let's say a program or a freelancer
programmer and you are making money
you're earning an income you're able to
live that comfortable lifestyle what can
you do with your time this is an example
there's me showing you what you can do
at that time right now I'm focusing on
building a business it's hard to find
time at the time that I do find I make
sure I try to travel I hang out with
friends live life to the fullest because
if you don't experience this whole
spectrum is gonna get boring really
freaking fast with that said that's it
thank you so much for watching I love
your faces off and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
