disc Ozzie from clever programmer calm
and today I wanted to answer your
question of what's the difference
between a freelancer versus a consultant
so without any further ado let's jump
right into it
okay so this question I've been getting
a lot because I talk about it almost
interchangeably and I say freelancer
software consultant or software
freelancer
so I want to answer this question for
you guys whether you're a programmer or
in any field this is out pretty similar
okay so this is not going to be so
programming specific because I think it
applies to pretty much any field and you
can take it away right after watching
this video so a freelancer is somebody
who doesn't really work for one company
as an employee a full-time employee they
can generally choose their own hours
choose to work with their own clients
and a consultant is you know pretty
similar in that case they choose to work
on their own time to pick their own
clients but here is one key difference
that I think is there between a
freelancer and a consultant so
freelancer you know you're just trying
to get as many people to work with you
as possible trying to accept as many
jobs as possible whereas for as a
software consultant you're not thinking
of these people as your customers you're
thinking of them as your clients so the
difference between customers and clients
is that a customer is somebody who buys
from you whereas a client by definition
is somebody who is under your protection
and there's something I got from Jay
Abraham and it's helped me make that
connection so as a consultant you're
thinking that of them as your clients
not just like somebody who's giving you
a temporary job or just like you're
trying to make a few extra cash or make
fifty hundred thousand dollars extra
this month as a consultant you're
choosing to work with this person
because you respect them or this
business and you want to basically
safeguard them and protect them from
anything even if they're not thinking
about it so now let's make these
examples just a little bit more tangible
so as a freelancer maybe you get a job
right as well as a web developer you can
go on up were calm and try to apply for
a job there and let's say that they give
you some Python job to do which is okay
make this simple web app for us so
people can check out and buy things okay
as a freelancer you're going to
literally follow every single thing
that's given to you but do nothing more
outside of it so everything that's in
the requirements like make a check out
page make this make that and then that's
it whereas as a consultant even though
you're up taesan web development
consultant
you'll be like okay wait a minute I get
that you're trying to sell something but
before I start to work on it do you have
an audience and if these people are like
no I don't have an audience well you
should be like okay if you don't have an
audience who are you going to where are
you going to sell this to it doesn't
matter if you have the greatest product
in the world or the greatest service in
the world if you don't have an audience
so or somebody there who's ready to buy
what's the point of investing all this
effort hiring me as a Python developer
for you you know charging you X amount
of dollars to make something for you
when at the end of the day there's
nobody that you can sell it to and at
this point they might go okay this guy's
thinking too much
I just wanted to hire somebody who's
like a dumb brute and just does things
and they might fire you in that case
that's not the type of person you wanted
to work with anyways because you want
them to respect you and actually give
you you know a thoughtful answer and not
just fire anybody that you know they
don't like or they don't like a question
from them you should be in a habit of
challenging people and challenging pre
you know these these assumptions on the
other hand instead of firing you they
might be like holy crap this guy doesn't
just do this geiger curl doesn't just do
the bare minimum out of work that we
give him this person does everything and
then Beyond and still is able to think
so he's not just following directions
he's somebody who's actually autonomous
and can think for himself so that level
of autonomy is what most people need or
most businesses need that type of you
just being able to think by yourself
whereas and that can make the difference
between a lot of some people like how do
you become a $100 an hour freelancer and
I have a video on that and I think that
something that's misleading maybe in
that video is that it should really be
$100 an hour consultant because it's
hard to pay a freelancer that much money
because you're just a commodity you
think like everybody else you're just
offering the same service that everybody
else is offering there's nothing more
that you bring to the table but as a
consultant you bring your brain with you
and you bring some other skills and care
and love for what you're doing
other than oh let me just get this job
done because the person who's working
with you is thinking this person doesn't
even care about his own job he's trying
to do what's best for me so somebody who
you're trying to do the best for and
they feel that do you think they're
gonna try to gyp you and pay you less
money or will they be thinking okay I
can trust this person a hundred percent
now the question is just whether I just
want to pay them or not and most likely
they're gonna be like okay I want to pay
this person the price of he or she's
asking because it takes out the thinking
for me to deliver quality work and if
something's not right they'll also watch
my back and tell me even if it hurts
them it has a consultants one of the
biggest things even if it hurts you you
have to make the decision that's best
for your client because they are under
your protection that's your difference
between a freelancer and consultant
that's why I always talk about software
consultants the reason why I'll use a
term like freelancer is because most
people don't understand consultant and
they do understand freelancers so
consultant is similar except that you
really care and put your neck out there
for your clients that's when you can
charge $100 $150 two hundred two hundred
fifty dollars an hour or sometimes even
thousands of dollars an hour but if
you're just starting out focus on first
getting to that $100 an hour all right
guys that's it for this video thank you
for watching as always I love your faces
often I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
