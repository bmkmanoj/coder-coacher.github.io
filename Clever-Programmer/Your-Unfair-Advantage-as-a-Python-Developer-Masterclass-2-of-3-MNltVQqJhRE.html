the founder of Create Apps and Land Your
First Client With Python,
and learn Python by building projects
with over 100,000 students enrolled.
This is video number two
of my new video series
titled Your Profitable
Programmer Master Class.
Welcome, and let's get going.
I'll show you why the
best programmers are broke
and how you can avoid that.
I'll also show you the number one secret
to how you can become a Python developer
in less than three months,
even if you have no technical skills,
no degree, no money, and no time.
I'll show you how I made $104,000 at my
second year at Oakton Community College.
And again, this is not
because of my talent,
but because of the
system that I discovered
that I wanna share with you.
But more importantly, I
wanna show you that you
can have the freedom to wake up and work
because you want to,
not because you have to.
Make an impact in the world doing it,
and ultimately getting
paid what you deserve.
Okay, so if you're just starting out
and you don't know a line of code,
that is perfectly fine,
because I'm gonna teach you
exactly all the practical stuff you know,
and we're gonna skip over
all that technical jargon
that fluff that you don't need.
And I'll help you be able
to make money from your
newly found Python skills
in less than three months.
Or, let's say you're on the
other end of the spectrum,
and you already have some
of the coding skills,
but you aren't making any money from it.
In other words, you have
the chops, but not the cash.
I'll help you put the
missing pieces into place.
And I'll show you why
people like you and I
can become profitable programmers
and why it's critical that you
get this handled right now.
In the previous video we talked
about your Python potential.
We talked about the lifestyle
that you can create,
your earning potential, and
whether you would be doing this
full time, side hustle,
or as a freelancer.
So in the last one we kind
of do it where we describe
your lifestyle and we help
you figure it out, okay?
So if you haven't watched that,
go back and watch that one
and then come back to this video.
Today I'm also going to build
on what we already discussed
which is the number one
thing that you need to know
about becoming a profitable programmer.
This is an entirely new
way that shows you how you
can be earning money while
learning at the same time.
In this video I'm going
to literally hand you
a portfolio app specifically
designed for Python freelancers
that you can literally click a button,
go on this, and use this app,
and it'll be yours, okay?
And the reason why I wanna give you this
is so you can start
smelling and kind of tasting
what it feels like to be a programmer.
And you'll also learn along the way
that it's super easy, fun, and simple,
to build this, and I'm
gonna walk you through
behind the scenes of the
code so you can understand
that this doesn't require
you to be a rocket scientist,
mathematician, doesn't
need you to be too smart,
or be coding since you
were like five years old.
So I don't know about you,
but this is really exciting.
It would excite me if
I could go back in time
and I'm sitting there
where you are right now.
I'm going to reveal to
you the most important
and best way of learning anything.
I like to call it my 80/20 rule,
and it's play and then learn.
And how I can relate it to real life
is, for example, if you
wanted to learn soccer,
would it be better that
you're sitting in a classroom,
and they're teaching theory on the wall,
like on the chalkboard?
Or would it just be a lot better
if you kick the soccer ball
first, then come back
and learn the theory.
How about animals, you know how they learn
is they play first, and
because they're just
playing and enjoying
themselves, and running around,
they learn how to run,
they learn how to hunt,
they learn how to detect
danger, all of that,
they build an instinct for it.
Relating it to what we're doing,
what I'm gonna be doing
with you is not only
teaching you fun and awesome things,
I wanna be teaching you
practical things first
where we're making web apps and websites,
and then we go and break it down and learn
what components went into it.
So this way, not only
are you learning Python,
but you're not learning it from this
very theoretical perspective,
you're learning it from a way of
how it can be making you money,
how can you build real useful stuff
that solves people problems,
and you can start to think about how you
can be the one who's building
things like the next
Instagram, the next Snapchat,
the next Reddit, the next
Google, the next Dropbox.
Keep that in mind as you follow along,
and I'm going to reveal all these
things as we go through this video.
So the goal of all of
this is to break you free
from theoretical dude
who just goes to college,
accumulates loans, comes
out, doesn't have a job,
has all these loans and
really nothing to show for it.
Versus showing you the
practical guy that learns
all these skills, doesn't
necessarily needs a degree,
but if he has it it's even better then.
And can be making good money,
making an impact in the world,
getting paid essentially what you deserve,
and then waking up to have the freedom
because you want to work,
not because you have to work,
and also impacting the
world and changing lives
all at the same time.
So keep the big picture
in perspective that
I'm gonna show you the difference between
the theoretical guy, right,
and then that practical guy,
and how quickly you can
start be making money
and having the lifestyle you want,
versus the theoretical guy who spends
years of his times to follow the
accepted path but not
getting any real results,
or getting them way too late,
and I wanna help you avoid that fate.
Alright, so we have a lot to cover today.
I'm excited, make sure
you have a pen and paper,
and you follow along
and take notes as we go.
Okay now look, any time
you're trying to learn coding,
or make money from it, you'll
likely hit a few road blocks.
And I'm gonna bring them up right now,
and just sit there and
think if you've experienced
any of these before, okay?
Road block number one, let's just say.
Has it ever happened to you
where you're sitting there
and you're just thinking,
you're frustrated,
and you feel overwhelmed because of
the breadth of the resources
that exist online in the world?
And how overwhelming that can be?
Sometimes you can't even choose between
one or two different resources.
You look at all these online forums
and everybody's telling
you something different,
and sometimes it's contradicting.
They're like, learn C++, or
learn C, or learn Python.
Which language to start off with first,
what kind of projects to build first,
and it's just confusing, right?
Or has this ever happened to you,
where you kinda maybe know
just a little bit of code
but you're just frustrated
trying to figure out
how can I go from just knowing code,
writing these lines of code,
to turning it into something practical,
to turning it into something
that you can later sell,
to turning it to something somebody
will actually pay you money for.
To solve somebody's actual problem,
how can you do that, from
code to practicality,
from theory to practicality, how?
Or has this ever happened to you,
where maybe you know all of these things,
but you just can't figure out
a way to make money from it.
To earn an income, to start like,
where is that online
course that teaches you
when you're ready to go
and start making money?
Where is that course that teaches you how
to transition from complete beginner,
to start learning practicality,
to then how do you
negotiate and start getting
either clients or get
that full time position.
I don't know about you, but at least I've
never seen something like this out there.
Now, whichever one of
those problems for you
that I just mentioned right now
ring true for you, here's one
thing I know to be a fact.
If you let these things
be your everyday truth,
and these problems to exist
and persist in your life,
here's what I can guarantee you.
You'll never find success in this field.
Most people follow online tutorials
that are taught by experienced programmers
who maybe have five or
10 years of experience.
The level they're teaching
at doesn't relate with you.
Like they don't even know,
they don't even remember
what it's like to be a beginner.
That's why they have a lot
of trouble relating with you.
At Clever Programmer, one
of the biggest reasons
that students have found
my program so helpful
is precisely because I'm not an expert.
I didn't work for some big name company,
I don't have 10 years of experience.
And as a matter of fact,
like I said before,
I went to Oakton Community College.
I was a below-average student.
I simply discovered this
system and it worked for me.
And one very weird and
amazing thing I realized
is after refining it for many years,
it works even better for others.
And so that's why I want to
share this system with you.
I want this system to work for people
who have jobs, and
people who have a family,
and people who only have a
few hours a week to spend.
I wanted this system to work for somebody
who's bad at math, or thinks that they're
not smart enough, or
they're not good enough.
Or they're too old.
I wanted this system to
be extremely practical,
extremely tangible, and gets you results,
and gets you start making
money as fast as possible.
In as little as three months.
And I wanted this system
to work for somebody
who's never even written a line of code.
Take my student Nazar Malyy, for example,
who used Python to boost his income
while working as a
freelancer, CG generalist.
He loves having the freedom to spend
time with his little daughter.
And right after taking my Python course,
here is the big win he had.
So from this little app,
you made what, $300 total,
or how much did you make if
you don't mind me asking?
- I made more than 2,000 in four hours.
- And that's why in this video
I'm going to show you exactly how
you can build a practical app,
and I'm gonna take you
step by step through it
so you can see how fun
it is, how easy it is,
you can start seeing
yourself like a programmer,
feel like a programmer.
Now it's time to jump into
the meat and potatoes of this,
so let's get started.
Okay, so now let me move on,
and I'm gonna show you my
$20,000 app that I made, okay,
let's get started with that,
I'm gonna even show you
the specific code that was used to bring
some of the real world app
stuff from the Python code, okay
I hope you're excited,
come on, and let's now,
let me show you this, okay.
Alright, so my first Python
client paid me $20,173.30, okay
this is for less than
two months worth of work.
Again, these are my invoices, done, boom,
at the bottom you can see
that's how much I got.
Here's what I was working on for them.
Okay so let me tell you
a little bit about that.
They needed to bring me on board
so I could save them a lot of man hours.
They had to do a lot of
tasks that were manual,
and they were spending
hundreds of hours a week,
which was adding up to thousands
of hours or more every year
and that was costing them between
$300,000 to $500,000 a year.
If they could automate that process,
they would not have a problem
paying somebody, okay,
so now let me show you kinda
what I was working on with them
and how easy it is, and
this is something that
when you learn it, and if you
learn things the right way,
you can get started doing
something like this very easily.
So this is what I needed to be building,
and this is kinda what I built for them,
and I'll show you what Python code
I wrote to make this exactly.
So check this out, look at this.
This is the form on the left hand side,
the same form, employee farm,
I showed you in this picture.
This is a form, alright, so you can see
full name, address, all this stuff.
And then on the right hand side,
you can see the code I used
to build it, the Python code.
Full_name, models., this is something that
sometimes you just have to
remember and you get used to it
once you learn coding, and
this is just character field.
Max_length I said 120
characters, that's it.
And boom, you have Rafeh Qazi here.
Address, wrote this
line, got this in return.
Wrote this line, got this in return.
Now, for some different
ones like the date ones
where you can click it and
the date pops open like this,
and looks beautiful, I didn't have to
write any amazing code, I just
did something pretty simple.
Look at the, hire_date, models.DateField.
That's it.
Birth_date, models.DateField, again,
then this thing popped up.
And to make this multiple choice one,
simple, title, choices, title_choices,
this choices is equal to thing
is what gives you the dropdown.
That's it okay, nothing complicated.
Same thing with this form,
okay, if you read through it.
These are the check boxes, which is
Boolean in programming, we call it.
Boolean is anything that has a yes or no.
That's it, so I do BooleanField,
and that's what it creates.
And to set it to something
that's not checked from the start
I just aid default is equal to False.
Simple, simple code, and beautiful
result with dead simple code.
So this was kind of the result I got.
And again, this is not
the real version of it
because of NDA agreements,
I can't show everything
in the real app, but this
is what I put together
so you can see what I was working on.
Again, for those of you
who wanna be more specific,
this is some framework
in Python called Django,
and you can use it to build things
very easily and very fast.
Alright, here's what everybody
makes coding seem like.
They make it seem like it's
something just so difficult.
They make it seem like it is something
that's like rocket science.
And let me tell you
that it's not, alright?
I just showed you some of the
things that look so simple,
and somebody paid me $20,000 in two months
while I got to travel, while I got to work
on things that I enjoyed,
while I got to spend time with my family.
Pretty freaking awesome.
All of this stuff, there's a huge market.
There's not just one company that
I showed you who I work for
with thousands of opportunities out there.
If somebody is trying to get
into freelancing with Python,
this is the time, and
you could be crushing it.
Now I wanna show you
the difference between
regular websites, and web apps.
And I kinda wanna show you
what people pay real money for,
meaning good money for.
Here's what people don't pay
for, or don't pay a lot for.
Your regular websites, these
are your about me pages,
your contact me pages,
your static websites.
Think of a restaurant that
just has their menu there
and you can call in.
Your haircut website.
Or the website that you
might wanna put together.
Maybe it can just do blogging.
Right, that's something you can build
with platforms like WordPress,
or Squarespace, or Wix, or Weebly,
if you've ever heard of them,
if not, not a problem, but
those are the point and click
and you make a website.
But that's not what I'm talking about
when I say web development.
What I'm talking about is web apps.
I'm talking about building solutions
to burning burning burning problems.
Let me give you some
examples of what kinda things
are considered web apps,
and what kinda solutions
you can be making for people
that would pay you good money.
So Dropbox, alright, this
was a Cloud storage problem,
and guess what this was solved with?
Guess what people used to solve this one?
Python.
Spotify was a music streaming problem.
What was used to solve this problem?
Python, okay?
Again, the common thread
is problem, problem, okay,
and this is a solution.
Somebody who knows how to build things,
who knows how to take
things from just code,
and turn it into reality kinda
like how I should you earlier.
Again, YouTube, what is this?
It's a video sharing problem.
And they were stuck for a while,
they were like, how are we gonna do this,
that's when the burning
need to solve it came, okay,
and you can't just build a
regular website to solve this,
you have to use something custom.
And again, you guessed
it, Python was the tool
they used to build it.
So hopefully now you kinda
get the difference between
regular websites and web apps, okay.
Again, these are things
that my mentor showed me,
he showed me the way of
the profitable programmer.
He showed me the differences between
somebody, again, who spends 30 years
learning to code, becoming a professional,
making $30 an hour,
versus somebody who spends
three months and makes $100 an hour
working with a client.
Or makes $150 an hour.
And he showed me, of
all the useless things
I didn't need to know, if I
go back to some of the code
right, if I just go back real quick.
Do you really need to know
really complicated math,
do you have to be really smart to do this?
Absolutely not, okay.
This doesn't require some
kind of crazy fancy degree,
it just requires you to realize
where there's a problem,
know how to get in there and get that job,
and then tell them you can
solve their burning problem.
And then that's it, it can be
as simple as this, alright.
So again, this is what
they make you think,
but it's not like this, alright.
Again, this was the path
that my mentor showed me,
and what I wanted to do was,
after years of refining this,
I took the road map my mentor gave me,
improved it, improved it, improved it,
and that's how I came up with Create Apps
and Land Your First Client with Python.
This is a course I put
together that would help you
get your first paycheck
in less than 90 days.
I have something very special
for you in this video,
and now we're gonna move on to that.
The think we talked about earlier,
which was your amazing portfolio,
your profitable programmer
portfolio, you know,
this is specially designed
for a Python freelancer,
and the way that I have made this
and put this together for you,
you're my work section,
I've made it in a way
where once you go forward
in your Python career,
you can just plug and
chug projects in there.
So as you build Python projects
or as you build Python apps,
you can just plug and chug
them in that portfolio
and it will look phenomenal,
and it's ready to get you hired.
And you can share this with
people as of right now.
And I'm gonna give you
all the code for it,
and I'm gonna show you
exactly how to use it,
where to go to change things,
and personalize it, okay.
I hope you're excited, and
I'm gonna be showing you
kind of over here what you're looking at
I'm gonna be showing you
how you could take this,
make this your own, and
then boom, download it,
and that's what we're
gonna crack into right now.
Alright, so as promised I have what
I said I would have for you,
that amazing portfolio that
I'm gonna share with you
that you can literally steal.
And whether you even
choose to even go down
the road of becoming a Python freelancer,
which is actually why this
portfolio is designed,
it's specially designed
for a Python freelancer,
and when you're in my work
section you can literally
plug and chug your projects,
I'm gonna go over it.
But if you weren't aiming
to go down that path,
I want you to be able
to take value from it.
So whether you are you
know, a guitar instructor,
or maybe you are in IT, or
you're becoming a sys admin,
I want you to be able to still use this
and bring value to you,
and be able to get jobs
using this portfolio.
So let me show it to you a little bit
so you can kinda get excited about it.
So for example, let me refresh this,
what it looks like when you come.
Hi, I'm Qazi, and I am
a profitable programmer.
Love everything about code,
also teach programming to
people, and I change the world.
Okay, so you can change your name,
and I can show you exactly where
you can go to change your
name, you can change the
text on the button and also
this button opens up an email.
I'll show you how to
change who that email's to,
you can change all of these,
and all of this stuff.
And then the my work area is
where, as a Python freelancer,
when you're building projects,
you put the project here,
and you put the specific
work or the description
and that web app or
website right over here,
alright, link it.
When you download this,
and I'll show you how,
when you download it and
how you can basically
take this app from its portfolio app,
and how you can use it,
and once you download it,
there are video instructions in there
to guide you every step of the way.
So don't worry if I'm
going too fast right now,
you can download it and
go at your own pace.
I just wanna show you some awesome things
before we go further, alright?
So again, your app description,
app description, app description.
Then at the bottom, it's this
part which is kinda cool,
let me refresh and show
you how this looks like.
So whichever technology you know the most,
you wanna put in here,
and then at the bottom
you wanna say, wanna work with me,
and a call to action, start now.
So this is great, it's field
tested, it's gotten me josb,
this exact portfolio has
gotten my friends jobs,
this exact portfolio, and
how we put this together,
is we took a look at a lot of portfolios,
of professional Python freelancers,
and we asked them, and
we put together something
that takes all of the best
things and puts it into one.
Nice area for image, headline,
who you are, what you're about,
your experience, and your my work.
Alright, so now I'm gonna
show you a little bit
of where you can go and
change things in the code.
Again, even most programmers,
even professional programmers like myself,
you don't have to worry about what
almost any of this code
means, it's not necessary.
It looks complicated, but I'll show you
where you need to go and change things,
and that's what most
of coding can be, okay.
You don't have to know everything,
because that's what takes
time and adds years.
If you know the most effective things,
you can just get templates from online
and then make them work, okay.
So let me show you, that's why,
if you focus on just the practical things
and not all the extra stuff,
you can save yourself a lot of time.
Alright, so for example let's say
I wanna change the Hi, I'm Qazi part.
I can go right here on line 36, for me,
and I'm gonna say hi, I'm Bob.
And come here, and I refresh,
so after I save I refresh,
and look, it says hi, I'm Bob.
Again, if you wanna open this
and you can't open the index.html,
I'll show you that too.
You wanna open up a tab in Chrome,
or whatever browser you
use, click Open File,
and then all we do is
just click index.html,
because that's where it
was, the index.html file.
Open it and it's running.
And then if I wanna change
any of these things,
okay, get in touch, I can
say punch my face, alright.
And if I hit refresh, you can
see that this text changes.
Now, if I wanna change
who it's mailing to,
I can even change the specific part
that talks about emailing, alright,
you can put your email here.
I wanna show you other simple
things before we continue.
You might be wondering how
can you change this image,
very simple, I just google
some cat pictures online,
found this one, thought
this cat is adorable,
and I'm gonna go here, line 34,
where it's source, so
img class, img-circle,
and then for src we're
just gonna paste this.
I'm gonna go back, I
hit refresh, and boom.
This text editor that you're seeing
is a fancy one for code,
it's called Sublime Text,
and you can download it.
It's just like an
Evernote, or your notepad,
nothing complicated, okay.
Just a fancy one that
makes code look beautiful,
just a text editor.
Basically when you go down,
these things are super easy to change.
This part that says my experience,
this part that says specialists
in need, generalist at heart.
Again, video instructions are there
on how to change the animation.
Maybe you're also wondering
how can you change this animation.
Those are also simple, in
the video instructions.
If you liked it, if you
got any value out of it,
would you please share this with a friend.
Because teaching other people,
or getting other people on board,
and having that accountability,
will help you more than anything else.
Email somebody, shoot them a quick text,
or maybe reach out to
them on social media.
Doesn't matter.
If you have somebody
else doing this with you,
it will completely change
the pace you're learning at.
Because I remember when
I started learning,
I was learning with one of
my best friends, Tenzin,
and the portfolio that I showed you,
we also put it together and we
learned to code together
as well, that helped a lot.
So again, share this with a friend
so you both can learn together
at a much much much faster pace.
Okay, up until this
point, if you are here,
and you found this valuable,
and you got this portfolio,
where you can build these
apps with Python later,
and you can just plug and chug them
and build your career
as a Python freelancer,
if you think this was
valuable and exciting,
you're about to have
your brains blown out.
Because in part three
of this master class,
which you're gonna be getting,
is the exact road map that's
inspired by my mentor,
that helped me become
a software developer,
become that Python freelancer
in less than three months.
And over the course of the last few years,
I have refined this so
that it helps other people
get even more powerful
results than it got me.
Because remember, I had to
discover this the hard way,
and then I put this together,
and I made it even easier for you.
And then in the next video I'm gonna be
sharing with you exactly how you too
can get your first client
in less than 90 days,
and get that first pay check while
working with creating apps with Python.
Here's what I want you to do.
First of all, you're gonna download this
portfolio that I shared with you.
And I want you to tell me,
what would success mean to you
as a Python freelancer?
Earning that extra $1000,
or $2000, or $3000,
whatever it is, a month,
what would that mean for you,
and what would that mean for your family.
I want you to comment down below
and I will see you in the next part
of this profitable
programmer master class.
