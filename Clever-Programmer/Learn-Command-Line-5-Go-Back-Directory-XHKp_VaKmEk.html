to show you it's so important it's so
freaking important that I decided to
just make a video on this step itself
one of the most common things that
happens that I didn't know to do for the
longest time is ok let's say I'm in some
deep nested directories so let's say I
am in CD virtual machines and I'm in CD
ubuntu something and when I PWD I'm in
some deep directory but what if I wanted
to come back and go to documents right
what if I wanted to come back out of
this directory and out of this other
directory and get back into documents or
something like that right how do i do
that i don't want to have to go back all
the way to users I don't want to do that
because that means or that means I have
to go home or even if i want to go to
user / just tastic like i have to go all
the way home and then come back so what
if i want to just step back one
directory so i'll show you guys that
really quickly okay this trick is really
cool so you can do CD and check this out
dot dot that's it okay one dot means
current directory so if you do CD dot
you just change into the current
directory which doesn't really make
sense but we need to see the dot dot you
come back one directory so let me do CD
dot and now when I do PWD I don't even
need to do it you can see that i'm
actually in this directory right here
and I've come out of this one over here
all right now if I want to get to
documents well what can I do so if
you're watching it what should i do CD
I'm sorry move the mic a little bit CD
dot dot again and I'm back to documents
that's it so if you make a mistake you
do CD Adobe well just do CD dot and I'll
teach you a trick if you're on Linux you
can even do something cooler so on
Windows you have to do CD dot but if
you're
unlike linux or mac or whatever bunt to
you just need to do two dots and it'll
take you back okay and don't worry about
my terminal because it looks different
than your guys's I have it souped up I
have it pimped out i have my own setups
i will teach you guys how to do my own
setups however don't worry about it
right now this has taken me many years
to do and learn how to do setups like
these and I'll make a course on teaching
you guys how to create your own
customized setups for now just
understand how to go back a directory
okay this is one of the most common
commands i use all i'll go to again i'll
go to this one and i'll need to come
back and I'll just do dot dot and I'm
right back this way feel free to make
mistakes go into any directory you want
hit down come back okay practice it I
want you to stop this video I want you
to go ahead and practice that going as
many directories as you can and then
just keep coming back one step two steps
and then go in again and then keep
repeating the process okay that's it for
this video you just learn how to go back
a directory will learn some more cool
things upcoming like removing a file
renaming a file or a folder things like
that so stay tuned I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
