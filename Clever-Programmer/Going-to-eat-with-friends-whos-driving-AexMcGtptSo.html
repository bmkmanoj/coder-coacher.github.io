whatever kind of motivation levels
you're at one ultimate hack for your
motivation is one good thing you can do
is hang out with your friends that night
or like before sleeping or like go out
to eat with your friends family whoever
because
it really kind of motivates you in the
morning and then you have like super
productive days usually when I directed
well usually when I do this and I wake
up in the morning I have like super
productive mornings because my brain is
like in this positive mode so I'm gonna
stop being weird now I gotta go I'll see
you guys in the next video
