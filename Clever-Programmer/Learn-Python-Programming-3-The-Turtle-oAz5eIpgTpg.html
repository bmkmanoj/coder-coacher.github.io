the turtle so what is the turtle you
might be asking well we're going to find
out before we get into some of the more
boring or the technical stuff which is
actually really fun
but before we get into that I want you
to be able to visualize the code I want
you to be able to see that what we type
and what we do you can do something fun
with it right away okay and this is not
just something for maybe kids this is
something that's going to be very
valuable I don't care how old you are
even if you're 200 years old
because visualization is a key tool so
if I show you that now I think it's
going to benefit you in the long run and
also sometimes when you're confused
about things you can try this thing out
that I'm going to about to show you
right now to maybe make those examples
and concepts more concrete that you
might be a little hazy about without
further ado let's get started so what we
are going to do is start doing something
with the turtle so I want you to do
import turtle as your first line okay
import this secret command here what it
means is that some programmers who
stayed up really late at night and wrote
code and ate ramen noodle and that's all
they did they spent hundreds and
thousands of hours writing all this code
for you and you just get to steal it by
typing in import so basically think of
it like you have amazing powers of the
tip of your fingers by using this
command import and you get all those
powers ok let's do my turtle is equal to
turtle dot turtle okay and what we're
going to do is we're going to say my
turtle dot uh I don't know let's do
something simple like move or sorry
forward 100 all right so let's see what
just happened all right what is going on
there right let's close that let's start
it again so I'm going to write this line
again and we're going to kind of do like
a slow motion okay we're just going to
play it out again
so I said my turtle dot right after this
first line that I did right
my turtle showed up here okay just to
make it even clearer for you guys I'm
going to start this thing again and I'm
just going to write the first line that
I wrote so you can see my turtle showed
up okay
now let's say I'm going to do my turtle
dot move or sorry I keep saying move
let's do forward and let's do 100 yeah
let's try it we'll see what happens
did you just see that thing go to the
right so that thing went to the right
now what if I wanted to move it up well
what you need what you need to do is
essentially it's like okay it's like
this I want you to look at my face right
now so if I'm the turtle and I'm going
in this direction here I will go like
this much and then in order for me to
turn left
what I need to do is first turn 90
degrees left like this and then to move
forward I just go forward right like
that okay so we're going to do that with
our turtle so let's do my turtle dot
left how many degrees 90 degrees okay
now if you notice the turtle now it's
facing towards the left and it's looking
at going up so we simply do my turtle
dot forward 100 again and you can see my
turtle is right over here
now let's do some more fun stuff let's
say my turtle dot right 50 and let's say
my turtle dot forward again 100 and you
can see we're starting to make
interesting shapes now right like what
is that
maybe it could be a shirt it's a ladder
I don't know I don't know what that is
but here's what I want you to do I want
you to create a square with the turtle
okay and I want you to copy whatever
code that you
and I want you to paste it in the
comments so either if you're watching
this on youtube or if you're watching
this on my website and clever programmer
I want you to go to exercise 2 the
turtle on clever programmer calm and I
want you to literally copy whatever code
you haven't pasted here okay I read
every single one of your comments and
I'll go through it and I'll comment on
it and other people will get to see what
you're up to as well okay also on my
website I've linked you guys to a blog
that says read this on how to do more
fun things with the turtle okay so if
you go to this blog it'll teach you what
more fun things you can do okay so it
teaches you how to create stars and some
really fun shapes okay so that is it for
this video I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
