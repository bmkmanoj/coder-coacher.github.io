episode of the command-line tutorial
series so now we are going to be doing
more practical things okay I want you to
keep playing that game on your own it's
a great game to play but let's jump in
and start doing some more practical
things so on the left hand side we see
the actual world as you see it so if
you're using Windows you'll see a
different world but essentially it's the
same idea you got some folders you got
directories you got files and all that
stuff and if you're looking at Linux or
Mac or whatever it's going to look
pretty similar to what I have on my left
hand side so now let's see how moving in
the real world looks in the terminal
world okay and once you understand that
it's essentially the same thing you will
become a lot less intimidated with it
and start to understand what's going on
all right
so okay so I clicked on documents and
I'm in this folder called documents I
don't know what its depth is I don't
know if it's in users or if it's in like
my directory like users slash something
slash documents or whatever so I can
figure that out first of all on the
right-hand side I'm gonna do LS and just
see what's around me and when I look
around me I see this thing called
documents and so if I go to documents
how can I check where I am so if you
remember from your previous commands if
you're ever lost there's something
called print working directory so
whatever directory you're currently in
that's your working directory so if I
hit PWD it tells me I'm in user slash
chess tastic slash documents which is
actually this thing okay so I'm actually
here but from my terminal rather than my
GUI graphical user interface so I know I
said you sir with the ass but it's user
now if I hit LS what do you expect to
see do you expect to see playground do
you expect to see
the playground here Final Cut Pro do you
see you expect to see those things well
let me hit LS and indeed you see Final
Cut pearl playground clever programmer
and everything that's on the left-hand
side here you see that on the right-hand
side right there now what if I wanted to
do something more let's say I want to
actually go inside of a directory well I
can do CD playground you remember that
one so if I do CD playground that's
effectively going to playground and
double-clicking playground okay so I
want to keep this video short because I
really want to be explicit and make sure
you understand what it is that we're
doing here even if the last two videos
were maybe a little confusing or if they
didn't do a good job of explaining this
concept it's okay if this still seems a
little bit basic because fundamentals
are the most important part of this we
will get to the more advanced things but
I don't want to take any for anything
for granted I want to make sure you
understand every step of the way and in
the next video I'll show you how you can
perhaps create a folder right from your
command line all right I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
