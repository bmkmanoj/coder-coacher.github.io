talking about how to make a function so
we wrapped up our square in a function
and that way we were really easily able
to use the square and this way we can
use the square as many times as we want
and it's very easy so what yeah let's do
something cool so I said let's talk
about the idea of arguments or
parameters in a function so what we want
to be able to do is let's say that
instead of a hundred what if you wanted
to move a different length every single
time so let's say we don't want to be
boring and just move I don't know 100
steps so let's take a look at it what's
up we don't want to move oh I didn't
call it anywhere let's call it again and
I'm going to remove this line here okay
let's run it okay and let's say we don't
want to be boring and make a really
small square like this let's say we want
to maybe go 200 steps okay so let's try
it let's go 200 200 200 and 200 and
let's take a look at what that looks
like nice the square looks better let's
try to tweak it a little bit and let's
make it I don't know 240 240 240 240 hmm
let's see that looks pretty cool but
what if I wanted the turtle to go all
the way to that edge perfectly and then
go down and then go to the left and then
come back up okay let's let's try
something let's try 280 280 280 280 and
hopefully oh oh it's still not hitting
the exact so maybe let's try 290 or
something so I hope that you're seeing
that we have to change these values here
a lot right we have to change it every
single time and we have to change all
four of them
all of those locations which is kind of
annoying so how can we make it so we
don't have to constantly change all
those values you know again and again
it's kind of really frustrating so we
want to make it so we just change it one
time and it changes it everywhere so
let's say um I don't know let's call it
n okay let's make it a variable that's
the same everywhere so let's just call
it N and I'm going to make a variable
here and I'm going to call it N and I'm
going to say go 250 okay so now
everywhere N is we have 250 okay so
let's try to run this bad boy now okay
cool 250 let's make that really small
let's say 50 okay that was really small
so that's pretty cool we were able to
use that and that made our life really
easy but a lot of the times we don't
want to change the function itself like
the definition of the function here it's
job is to make a square and that's all
it should need to know how to do and we
want to be able to give it something
which based on which it changes it
changes the length of it right so like
how far it goes or how big the square is
okay maybe you can think of it like in
English if you have a definition of a
word that you look up once you learn
that word you can use it in whatever way
you want right it really depends on the
context for example if you want to say
wow man you really killed it you're
basically saying you did a really good
job and you get amazing or if you said
oh man you just really kill that thing
for me you know you really killed it for
me I don't even find it fun anymore
now you're using it and it now the
context is basically that somebody
really made something less enjoyable for
you or discouraged you in some way so
the word kill in this case right it
has a completely different meaning but
based on the context we change it right
well depending on what context we give
it we change the word kill but we
shouldn't actually go and change the
definition of the word kill every time
you want to use it in a different
context okay so what I'm trying to say
here is instead of changing the function
itself let's do something really cool
let's give it context okay so I'm going
to say Square takes in some input n so
whatever and I give it it just puts that
in here and instead of calling it and
let's make it more fun and call it
length so everywhere I see and I'm just
going to replace it with length so now
the cool thing that's going to happen is
if I give it the length of five
everywhere it sees length it just
replaces it with five if I give it the
length of let's say I don't know 200
it'll go everywhere and replace
everything with 200 okay that way we'll
get a longer square so let's try it if I
run this right now I'm going to get an
error and let's see why okay I got an
error and the error says type error the
function square right that's what the
parentheses afterwards it means missing
that is missing one required positional
argument length so we're we are supposed
to give it something we're supposed to
give it context right like the word kill
we gave it context and it changes the
whole meaning of the thing so here in
square we're going to give it the length
so let's say for length we say hundred
okay now let's see what happens let's
run it and we get a square that it goes
hundred in each direction right so what
just happened we pass in 100 here which
really passed in the hundred here right
and since those 100 here it became 100
everywhere else and so we got a square
those a size 100 and we can effectively
do the same thing if I give it 300
that's probably not even going to fit on
the screen
oh it pretty
does it makes a bigger square right so
now the only place I have to change it
is really here
this thing's job is to now just make a
square that's all it does and here we
can tell it what how big that square
should be so let's say that we say make
a square of you know 300 and then make a
square that's under 150 and then make a
square that's hundred okay let's see
what that does let's see what that looks
like me
okay that's 300
that's the 150 and that's the fifty whoa
that was cool right that kind of it was
it seemed like it was about to make some
kind of design right there okay so
hopefully you guys have a little bit
more of an understanding of how
arguments work just to take it maybe one
step further what if think what if
instead of these 90 degrees you wanted
to be able to change the degrees maybe
we can go in here huh and say angle
right and replace everywhere we see 90
with angle and so now we have to give
our function not one but two arguments
okay so let's say 390 so the 300 will
replace the length part so everywhere
there's length it'll replace that with
300 and the 90 will replace angle so
every where it says angle it will
replace that with 90 how cool is that so
let's run this bad boy and check it out
what it looks like we've seen the square
before multiple times 300 but now let's
add a twist let's make this 45 degrees
let's see what happens oh I don't even
know what it did let's reduce the length
so we can at least see what it does
right let's run it
whoa that's kind of cool it didn't make
a square it did something weird with it
okay so I'm foreshadowing multiple
arguments and in the next video we'll
talk more about it alright guys I'll see
you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
