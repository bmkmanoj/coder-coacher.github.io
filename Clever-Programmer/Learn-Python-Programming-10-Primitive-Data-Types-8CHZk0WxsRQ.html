want to talk about primitive data types
now we're getting into the adult
programming stuff okay getting out of
the little bit of the baby stuff even
though it's not baby but you know let's
just submit it so let's talk about
primitive data types what are they well
um okay so let's start off with like
basic ones first okay and I also want to
clarify something about variables for
you guys so you can't start a variable
with a number okay so if you say five is
equal to I don't know hello right the
string hello you're gonna get an error
so you got to start it you got to start
your variable with a letter now you also
can't start it with symbols you can't
say something like this is equal to
hello okay you're gonna get an error you
can combine underscores with your
variable so you can say hi hello
something like this okay
and that would work for you okay
primitive data types what are they so if
I have this thing in the green that you
see that is a string all right so um in
this video I think we can just keep it
like this okay so that's a string hello
anything with the quotes around it and
you can also put double quotes if you
want this is a string data type
okay this terminology is very important
to remember then you have your integers
integers or anything that is like this
okay 4.3 4.0 I'm sorry 4 5 2 those are
all your integers obviously things that
have decimal points in math they're
called decimal numbers in Python we call
them floating numbers okay so you have
floating numbers like four hundred fifty
five point five four hundred and three
hundred and fifty four point nine zero
okay these are your floating numbers so
that's another important thing to
remember
so this was just a little primer on
primitive datatype just so when I use
this terminology you guys don't get
confused or like want to throw things at
your screen right like I don't what he's
talking about boom just throw your like
mouse or your socks don't do that um
telling you them what they are hear and
feel free to look them up a little bit
more so you can understand more about
them but this is some of the basic ones
we're gonna be dealing with and in the
next videos I'm gonna talk about things
like what is a list what is a dictionary
so we're gonna go over those as well
okay just to give you a little bit of
foreshadowing into it for your for you
advanced people there you wanna learn
more
right you wanna over achieve a list is
basically something that holds multiple
things at once so for example I can say
banana and apple and oranges like this
right and at the start I can say X is
equal to I hate X I hate one letter
variables and most Python people do as
well because it's usually a sign of bad
coding always try to make your names
very relevant get into that habit right
now promise yourself
cross your heart I don't know I don't
care what you have to do but work hard
on variable naming even if it slows you
down sometimes okay so no X no y
only if you have to it's gonna make your
code really hard to read and when you're
reasoning through your logic you're
gonna not understand what you were doing
so let's say I don't know fruits it's a
good variable name fruits and now if I
call fruits you see a list of that thing
okay I was talking about primitive data
types but I got ahead of myself I
started talking about some data
structures like a list and dictionaries
we'll cover all that later be patient
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
