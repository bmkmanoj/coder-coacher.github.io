clever programmer dot-com and you are
watching KOAT Khadem e part 14 yeah you
guys excited I hope you guys are really
excited because now we're about to get
to even more exciting stuff so check it
out
46 percent complete that's almost where
we're halfway there but keep in mind
there's one of those bitwise stuff which
is kind of weird I'm almost thinking to
skip it because it's so esoteric so
we're actually probably closer to 100%
then you might think okay we've
completed all these parts we've
completed some of really tough stuff
and getting started is really the
hardest part as you start to get better
at and understanding how computer
programming is working you can figure
lots of other stuff out easier much
easier okay so let's keep going here we
finish student becomes teacher that was
a big one that's why I was a unit in
itself self and we got to listen
functions now so this is going to be
great it says lists and functions now so
you've learned about lists
let's turbocharged them with functions
turbocharged with functions that sounds
great and after that that sounds even
more epic battleship but one thing at a
time
let's continue on with lists and
functions unit 7
ok lists accessing this is simple stuff
we've already done it who are they
kidding right
Oh add your code here this said print
the second element so n of 1 print put
parentheses around because I'm trying to
train you for Python 3 simple we keep
getting this back over and over again I
love it though list element modification
ok
a element modification change the
element to something else so I don't
know on line three multiply the second
what does it say multiply the second
element so that by five so it'd be n of
1 times 5 or x equals five but you know
let's just use the long hand notation
here to do this because like that book
learn Python the hard way always try to
do things the hard way at first then
you'll really get it and then the
shortcuts and everything will come more
naturally overwrite the second element
with that result
wait I did yep
print out the list ok create okay so you
see that was pretty simple n was equal
to one three five I multiplied the
second element by five and now as a
result a lot of people make this mistake
this is not changing what n of one was
right this element right here this is
just taking that element and multiplying
by five does it does nothing by itself
let me just show you this is the point I
do want to elaborate and not take for
granted because it is confusing if I did
this right first of all it wouldn't show
you anything at all but if I put in a
print statement you can see that all it
does is it just multiplies that by 15
you're not actually saying hey change
the value of it so if I print out the
list end you'll see that n is still 135
you didn't actually change what the
first element was so that's why you have
to go here and change and of one to be
equal to n of 1 times 5 how I read it is
hey the new n of 1 is going to be what n
of one was slash is times five so now n
a 1 is M
by itself being multiplied by five
alright let's keep rolling here
appending to a list we've already seen
that a pen
it says append the number four and a pen
for easy easy
sleazy whatever that means removing
elements from a list the exercise this
exercise will expand on ways to remove
items from a list you actually have a
few options first a list called n so you
can do pop and pop removes an item from
the end of a list so let me show you if
I did print and pop here's what it does
it pops off the element and then prints
it out now why that's important is check
it out if I do print and here what pop
actually does is now the new list is
going to actually be one three and it
prints that result so it literally like
break slash
pops it out at the end of the list and
and then it shows it to the screen so I
almost think of it like pop just put his
hand in the bucket of the list 135 took
five and just shot it out and since we
use the print function it took the five
and shot it out to the screen and it got
pasted into the terminal right here
which is where it's showing and it's not
in the list that bucket anymore okay so
I'll prove it to you by running this
code here and you will see
oh I'm sorry actually I have to put the
five back in I'll prove it to you by
running this code here and you will see
that original list was one three five
but after the end being popped and we
print out n you see that the pop printed
out the five and then print n should
have printed out one three five but
because pop had already taken out five
and threw it smacked it against the
screen now the list only has one three
two elements left in it okay that's a
function pop that's what it does it's a
method but I don't want to confuse you
guys with too much terminology right now
easy way to think about it is if it has
a dot
it's most likely a method and otherwise
it's a function just for now okay n dot
pop index will remove the item at index
from the list and return it to you so
you can also say hey instead of pop
which by default returns the last
element so in this case pop
automatically puts in a two here because
zero one and five is that location too
so if you don't put anything it
automatically puts in a two there but if
I do index of one you'll see that pop
actually puts it in hands in a bucket
takes out the three which is the first
index item and smacks it out to the
screen because of print and then that
item is not in the list anymore so you
can see it right here right one five it
didn't it printed out the three at the
top it popped it out and then it just
printed up one five in the list okay so
we can do that and we can also do remove
now what's the difference between pop
and remove remove takes out that item
but it doesn't actually remove it from
that um or sorry it actually removes the
item but it doesn't hold it anywhere so
pop when you pop it out right it let's
say we do X is equal to n of pop and
that's it right and then I do print X
and then okay sure I'll do print n as
well so what this does is this item got
popped out and turned into five and then
it printed out the X which is why you
get a five and then I printed out the
list and the print list is 1 comma 3 but
would remove it doesn't make that item
usable it doesn't return an item it just
removes the item so if I try to end now
remove we actually have to pass in an
index so if I give it index 2 right
it will store none here okay so if I did
and I remove one or if I did end that oh
sorry in remove method does not take in
index indices it actually takes in the
number you want to give it so I I want
to give it let's say five for sure right
now look for that five and you'll remove
it but it doesn't pop it out so you X is
actually you know none because there's
nothing it just removes that item from
the list and that's it so when you use a
remove function it doesn't make sense to
actually store it anywhere it's just for
removing that item from the list okay
whereas pop pops it off also pop takes
in an index great and then there is
delete which is like pop in that it will
remove the item at the given index but
it won't return it so the only way it's
like pop is because they both take in an
index but it doesn't actually return
anything so for example if I call if I
did delete the item n2 and I print and
well that item is gone but if I did X is
equal to that and it print X let's see
what we get here you actually it says
invalid syntax it doesn't even allow you
to do that okay
so though when you use delete you can
only just do it on a line of its own
pretty much and it doesn't return
anything it just removes that item from
the list to me I would use delete that's
a nice way to delete an item and
remember when you're making games or
anything more complicated it doesn't
always have to be integers that you're
deleting right so don't think of it look
one would I need to delete a number well
sometimes you might have some more
complicated information in there you
might have your let's say you're making
a video game and it has a list of
characters well let's say that two of
those Care is a two versus two
whatever game fighting game or whatever
if one of the character dies one side
only has one character and other side
has two characters well from that list
where you only have one character left
you're going to delete the character
from that list okay you're still using
the same data structures even if you're
making really complicated games in the
back end you're still using dictionaries
and lists and all those kind of things
okay remember that and if you want to
look more into making games with Python
there's a very great Python library
called pi game so go there and play
around with it if you want and you can
make really cool games I have made a few
games from that as well alright remove
the first item from the list and using
either pop remove or delete so I'm just
going to use delete because it makes the
most sense and it's the easiest to
understand right delete it looks like
your list is one three instead of thirty
five oh they want us to remove the first
element okay congratulations we've
finished the section great next up is
function recap so a lot of things here
but let's get on to the next section all
right changing the functionality of a
function functionality of a function
that's a bit wordy there in this
exercise you will just be making a minor
change to a function to change what the
function does change the functions of
the given argument is x three in return
again they're using terminology here on
programming specific terminology not to
necessarily throw you off but to just
get you attuned to how programming
terminology works and they you start
paying attention to it okay at first you
might be like what it's like sometimes
mathematicians when they're using
something like given this conjecture
according to proposition three we have
the following
Rufe you know a intersex be so we're
going to try to demystify all of this
and simplify it what is an argument it's
whatever you put in the parentheses okay
if you have something comma and another
argument that's now you have two
arguments okay these are arguments
function this is the name of your
function this is the argument that it
takes mean that's information it's
dependent on for this function to run
right if you wanted to calculate a trip
to O to some other country you would
have to take into account how much the
plane ticket cost how much the hotel
there cost how much you're going to
spend there so automatically a function
is dependent on three inputs okay so
that's the function being defined here
and now here they're calling the
function so what they're saying is
change the function to the given
argument is multiplied by three in
return everything is fine except they're
taking the argument which is the X and
they're adding it by three so what
they're doing is if I did so I made
number is equal to five let me just put
it here for simplicity sake and I pass
in I pass in five to our function what
is it going to do it's going to change
this X with our number which is five
it's going to put a five there it's
going to do five five plus three gives
you eight and it's going to return it
right so let's check it out we got back
eight we want to make it so instead of
being added by adding by three we
multiply by three it's that simple as
changing the plus sign to an asterisk
you get back a fifteen let's give it a
try and I can guarantee you that we are
correct guarantees next more than one
argument that this exercise is to recap
how to use more than one argument in a
function define a function okay simple
okay two arguments in a function I've
given you this problem before but I'm
going to give it to you again try to do
it without looking at anything make a
function that takes in two arguments and
returns their sum or make a function
that takes in two arguments a and B and
return to their multiple multiplication
or their product
do it quickly all right I'm going to
show you I'm going to define a function
sum a comma B returns whoops
return a plus B now to use this function
I'm just going to say sum of two 2 comma
5 I'm going to say print and you're
going to see that's going to give me 2
plus 5 which is 7 for the multiplication
1 I will say define multiply this fell
it right no it did not multiply a comma
b return a times B and I can say print
multiply 2 comma 5 which should give me
back a nice 10 so that therefore I get a
7 and a 10 here function it's very
simple to find a function called add
function that has two parameters X and y
and adds them together the function name
should be add function has two
parameters and added them together
simple define add function to parameters
I can call these parameters whatever I
want
okay just to prove a point here a
ridiculous point a lot of people think
that it has to do with these parameters
names and that they should match your
definition no these are arbitrary which
means that you just make them up
whatever you want whatever you feel like
that day okay but don't make it so
confusing that what somebody else is
reading your code is like what is this
what does this language this person is
using all right return this Plus this
okay and it's going to say I'm right
well of course I'm right okay but that
should really be wrong because that's a
terrible names let's make the name
simpler we can call it m n n if we
wanted to be consistent with everything
else we can call it a and B I like in B
for this but if it was really up to me
ow
actually call it num1 maybe like this
and num2 and then say num1 plus num2
okay or if I really wanted to be very
clear with what's going on I would call
it number one plus number two and now
this reads really nicely we're defining
an add function that takes in the number
one and a number two and returns number
one plus number two it's really easy to
read then a and B some arbitrary
variables all right start next lesson
string in functions write a function
called string function that takes in a
string argument and then returns that
argument concatenated with the word
world don't add a space before world
takes in a string and then returns that
aren't even concatenated with the word
world okay simple let's try it let's
create a function that takes in an input
and add something to it so let's say
that we took in whatever we took in we
wrote um ice cream next to it okay if we
want it to so we would just simply say
oh sorry I would define the function
define string function and it would take
in something and what it would do is
return something plus is not an ice
cream that's what I wanted to say
okay with the period let's run it
oh yeah print Python three you gotta put
parentheses parentheses hello is not an
ice cream because we took the string
function passed in hello to it what it
did is went up to the string function
put in hello for something and
everywhere it saw something and put
hello there if you put Hello right here
now it says hello plus is not an ice
cream notice I put a little space here
if I didn't put that space right there
you would see a pocketful first of all
okay so let's say I didn't put this
space here you'd see Hello is not an ice
cream right next to each other so I put
a space there it makes it nice okay and
if I want it to be fancier and use
string well this is I think this is
pretty simple let's just leave it at
that okay so do i I just want to make
sure you understand what we did okay so
again put in hello for n right this is n
so this is Hello string function gets
called on hello
this parameter takes in that hello and
then returns Hello plus whatever we want
to put there so now you try doing this
one on your own and then watch the video
alright so I'm going to define it right
here define string function takes in
something returns something plus they
want us to say a world that's it don't
forget to add a space before world you
see that don't owe it says wait don't
add a space before world No
so I guess they want you to do it at the
same location alright hello world look
at that
introduction to using functions with
lists nice so now we have a function
right here define list function it takes
in something we're assuming that
something right now is list and it
returns that and we're creating a list n
outside of the function and then we're
printing out the result of calling that
function and passing in that list so
what happens is that and is this it goes
to that replaces this with list and then
it returns that list this whole thing
just turns into that list and gets I'm
sorry this whole thing gets turned into
that list and because of that that gets
printed out to the screen 3 5 7 so let's
run this one really quickly ok fairly
simple using an element from a list in a
function passing a list to a function
will store it in the argument just like
with a string or a number ok so what are
they saying here passing a list to a
function will store it in the argument
so basically what they're saying is that
if you pass it in here this argument
here you know this X is stored that
argument is stored you know so that list
is stored in the argument alright what
they're showing here is something really
simple we have ok it's kind of cool and
so let's talk about it
right so this argument here is just an
arbitrary argument if you gave it a
number it would be really confused on
line two because let's say you gave it a
five it would come down here and I would
say give me the 0th index of five and
then it'd be like what I might what the
heck am I talking about that doesn't
make any sense and the program would
poop out and give you a giant red error
saying you can't index an integer right
if I open up my terminal and showed you
really quickly it's so like int object
is not subscrip Tabo right here it'll
like start crying so we're assuming that
we're getting a list so let's say if we
got a list here then this part turns
into a list 5 comma 4 and calling zero
on this list getting a 0th index of that
well that simply evaluates to 5 and that
actually gives us back something nice so
imagine we created a list called numbers
and we passed that list to the function
first item it would go up to that items
would be stored as this list right here
279 and on to 79 we would get the 0th
index of 2 7 &amp;amp; 9
what's the 0th index of 2 7 &amp;amp; 9 it's 2
this would get evaluated to 2 and that
would get shot out to the screen so
let's see in slow motion all right sorry
I'm not going to go into post-production
make it slow motion but you hopefully
got my point all right let's keep
rolling change line 2 so that list
function returns only the items stored
in index 1 of X rather than the entire X
list so we are going to pull out index 1
so if we pass it in this list it would
pull out 5 but when will this it's also
always good to think about when will
this program poop out you know why
because if you have friends for
programming you want to crack their code
and you want to break their code to
embarrass them and also hopefully to
teach them a not teach them a lesson
but to maybe help them find a bug so
they can fix it and there are also jobs
called programming testers who make a
ton of money every year so programming
testing is an actual job so their job is
to try to see what edge cases break the
code so it's a good idea to try to break
the code all the time either you can
make fun of your friends or get a high
paying job or both so the case where
this would break the code is if I gave
it a list of only one element it will
try to index the second element because
it has a one right here and it will pop
out and give an error I can also give it
a list with no elements I can also what
if I gave it a set a dictionary what if
I gave it an integer right or a float
number all of those would give you back
errors if I gave it a string right like
Hello
that would work because you can index a
string so it would pull out the e but if
I gave it a string with only one letter
in there it would poop out right
so just to just be aware of that okay
this should be good we gave it three
five seven
it went up here pulled out the first
second element five or the index one and
returned it very simple modifying an
element of a list in a function okay so
we're just modifying an element of a
list okay so basically let's say that we
have this list 3 5 7 right what we want
to be able to do is pass it to a
function and have it change one of the
values inside of that list is something
else permanently so let's say right now
this is 5 once I take this a list and
dump it into my function machine that
churns out some kind of output so I dump
it into my function machine my function
machine takes this a list and makes
changes one of the elements and then
returns the list okay so let's say that
I wanted everything
every number in my thing to me multiply
multiply by three or I wanted one of the
numbers to be completely changed and
multiplied by three so let's say I take
define a changer I'm just going to call
a changer and it's going to take in some
lists I'll just say list one and I'll
take the list ones second item and or
sorry the second item and multiply it or
sorry yeah
multiplied by five and change it like
permanently right so since I want to
change it permanently what I'm saying is
that the new list one so the new second
element of that list is what that
element was up to this point multiplied
by five okay so and here I'll I don't
have to return anything I can just say
print list one right that's it and I can
say print list one here as well just so
it can print out and show you how the
changes took place and here I can define
some lists I'm not going to call list
one because I don't want you guys can be
confused that function arguments have to
match the variable names outside of the
function sometimes people get confused
with that so I'm not going to make it
list one just to not confuse you but
list one would be a perfectly good name
I'm just going to call it list
underscore and I'm going to say this
list is you know has three elements in
it and I'm going to call them a change
or function on this list so let's run it
and you can see that it was five four
and five but after it got thrown into my
function changer right this machine and
then it once it goes into this machine
the machine is like damn ran ran ran I
like to dust something to it for three
whole lines right two three four but
really the third line does something to
it so it takes it and it turns up that
one of the numbers in it and mutates it
changes it to something else and so now
that four is that now a twenty and then
it takes that and you know
returns that or whatever and that's it
we're done so they're they're just kind
of showing you that here and actually
they're giving you a example that does
just that so it takes in the 0th element
and multiplies it by two so it takes in
the first element multiplies it by two
that's really what they're doing okay so
we're going to change it so that add
three to the item at index 1 of the list
so we're going to take this is index or
sorry this is index 1 and we're gonna
add 3 to it right we're not just doing
this because this will just take that
number and if it's 5 we'll just do 5
plus 3 and 8 and done you're not saying
that hey um make the first element 8
you're just saying take the first
element and just add 3 to it and then
what do don't even print it don't do
anything to it just add 3 to it so it'll
go sure you'll do that on the back end
but it won't that statement won't be
useful to you so you want to say do that
to X of 1 what X of 1 was up to this
point I'm sorry the new X of 1 should be
what it was up to this point plus 3 okay
store the result back into index 1 and
we did all that on line 2 and return to
list so return X in this case
terrible terrible names but that's okay
so you can see that we passed at the
list 3 5 7 but we took the second
element incremented it by 3 and made the
5 into an 8 and kept the rest of the
list the same ok where are we
we're at modifying an element of a list
and we're in the section introduction to
using functions with lists let's see how
long the next part is so we're going to
finish this part and this will be the
last part of this video well then this
is coke atom e Python part 14
hard to keep track with this now but
this should be the last thing we're
going to do and then I'll see you guys
in the next video so let's keep going
through this right here all right you
can also append or delete items of a
list inside a function just as if you
were manipulating the list outside of a
function so you guys have already seen a
little bit of how we do append and
delete items and remove and pop and so
on and so forth
define a function called list extender
define list extender that takes in that
has one parameter LST is a common way of
saying lists in Python the reason why we
don't say actually list is because list
is a defined word so that's why we try
to stay away from that right just like
del is a defined word or print as a
defined word tuple as a defined word so
we try to stay away from using the
defined words because we don't want to
change the meaning of something that
already exists in Python itself so LST
and inside the function append number
nine to the list so we're going to do
list dot or I'm sorry list append nine
so that will add attached on a nine so
if we pass it this list then it would
just tack on a nine like that and then
return the modified list so return what
will happen if I had to break it down n
is equal to this it'll pass that into
the function list extender it'll come up
here pass that list in right there it
would take this list and do dot append
on it and append a nine to it and now
this list effectively becomes that and
then it returns
it returns that list with the nine at
the end of it now let's check it out
don't take my word for it let's prove it
by running this and you can see that we
have added a nine congratulations guys
we have finished this section this is it
for this video
