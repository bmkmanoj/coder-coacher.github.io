clever programmer calm and in this video
I want to answer two really cool
questions for you guys the first one I'm
going to keep it relevant and it's about
how do I practice coding in the best way
by Chris gamer and then we have a second
question which is do I have any other
chat channels or whatever so I'm going
to answer both of those questions for
you guys
there going to be a lot of fun and let's
jump right into it so the best way to
practice coding if I'm going to be
honest with you guys
I am going to say that you definitely
want to spend as much time as possible
but I want to be respectful of your
constraints because you might be working
already at a job or you might have no
jobs so now you have time or you might
be at school college student or a high
school student or middle school or
whatever so if that's the case which was
the case for me any extra time that I
would have I would spend in coding but
let's say if I have time where college
was off then I would just spend full
time in programming and in coding and
this question also ties in with one of
the previous questions of apps - I live
my life cause II do I have spend time
with friends or do I choose coding and
how I entered him was you don't have to
pick one or the other you can kind of
combine the two which is what I did and
I had my friends kind of start day they
were coding and so we kind of did that
together and so we got to spend time
hang out but then we also got to spend
time coding so it was like a double
whammy so that's something I would say
for you now the best actual way to
practice coding I mean it's the question
is a little vague in that sense but the
most important thing again is time and
then resources so a lot of people stick
just academic resource and they treat
like college high school or whatever
it's just the only resource I want you
to think of your school as only one
resource out of the many resources you
can use so don't be dependent on oh I
haven't got a new homework yet so I
guess I'm all caught up like in the
meantime go online look at some other
resources have at least five six seven
different resources that connect fast
with you
Udacity course connects best with you
jump into the Udacity course Coursera
course connects best with you jump into
the course air of course my course at
clever programmer connects the best with
you jump into my course anywhere that
offers you the best value and that you
can connect with jump into those courses
you don't have anything to lose and if
you have multiple resources you can pick
and choose so one of them is not working
for you you can pick the other that's
always cool and you never essentially
run out of homework okay and your
ultimate homework is basically trying to
build projects so the best way to learn
coding is have multiple resources work
on projects and involve your friends or
make friends in the circle of coding and
that's how I would answer that question
Chris gamer hopefully I nailed that one
for you moving on to the second question
do I have any other chess channels I've
been getting a lot of chess interest
because I'm interested in chess I love
chess so you guys see that and some of
you who are interested in it that's one
of the freaking will frequently asked
questions I get so I'm going to just
take the liberty to answer it yes I do
it's called chess tastic it's been dead
it's super high-quality channel but back
in those days I wasn't so good with my
youtubing and I wasn't consistent and
like what I thought was going to be
great with I just made a bunch of videos
and then just publish them on the same
date which is a terrible idea
you should publish it on a consistent
schedule consistency beats anything on
YouTube or in any type of business and
yeah I even have a website called chest
tastic Tom so I guess for you guys go
watch those videos on YouTube I think
they're really awesome there
like one of the highest quality videos
on chess and especially for beginners
and then I play a few games there so you
can pick up some coding chops and in my
learn Python Opie course we are actually
going to be building a chess app so it's
going to be a desktop app it's going to
be local and you're going to be able to
play with a friend and a full graphical
user interface using Python because I
love chess and I found a way to combine
my passion my love for chess people who
play table tennis those pawns using
Python right so it's really up to your
creativity and how you mix your passion
and hobbies and your work together okay
that way you can practice coding in the
best way that way you can learn chess or
whatever else thing that you love to do
and combine it with programming
hopefully that answers your guys's
questions this is ask
Kazi ask your question below hashtag ask
Ozzy and if it's good enough I'm going
to jump in and answer it for you all
right that's it I love you guys so much
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
