calm and in this video i want to talk
about the windows command line okay so
first of all regarding yesterday's video
engineer truth I do not hate his channel
I do not hate him he's awesome if you
want to learn about realistic career
videos you should actually watch some of
his videos that video was just made out
of fun no it wasn't to try to get more
views like I got some comments or it
wasn't that I hate that channel or
anything like that and no I will not
delete it because if I start deleting
things you know that's something that
connects with me I thought it was funny
and I posted it around the channel I'm
sorry to fit if it offends certain
people but again my goal was not
actually go after somebody or hurt them
or whatever it was just a funny video it
was a big coincidence and I wanted to
just talk about it
well anyways don't worry because you
will be getting a lot of awesome content
soon starting right now
so first thing I want to talk about was
a lot I'm getting a lot of questions on
ok
hey Kazi you made all these videos on
the command line but on Windows do these
commands even work and my answer to that
is no the command line that the built-in
command line of Windows is very
different tip number one that's gonna be
really beneficial for you is in Windows
there's something called PowerShell so
when you look up command prompt don't
open up command prompt like don't type
in CMD that's one of the weaker versions
of the command lines open a PowerShell
it's much better it has some
functionality like Mac command lines or
Ubuntu command lines because Windows
command lines sucks and I hate to break
it to you guys but I've been using I've
used every operating system there is but
Windows command line has been the worst
by far it's such a pain to make many
things work even if you're working in
different programming languages and
you're trying to do just import
something it will be so simple in every
other opera
system ever but then in Windows they'll
have it's like separate tutorial that
you have to follow but I understand it
might not align with your budget getting
a MacBook Pro or your ecosystem so
that's not what I want to recommend to
you instead I'm gonna just show you guys
something that will be helpful to you
and valuable to you as you're following
along these tutorials so if you see me
do things like PWD and stuff if you open
up the PowerShell your PWD command
should work okay other commands like
m'kay dirt and the PowerShell should
work that's how you can make a directory
CD for changing directories should also
work at rmdir should also work so if you
can just open up literally powershell
okay that's how it is on Windows P o wer
sh DLL most of the Mac built-in command
lines like should work but if you're
opening up the CMD for whatever reason
and that's the one you want to use then
the commands of that are going to be a
lot different
okay but I would suggest use PowerShell
because after Windows seven they added
that and I think that in when in Windows
10 it's definitely there as well so use
the powershell and this resource that
i'm on is called learn Python the hard
way org I'll link it in the description
below and it has some useful command
lines that you could look up yourself
and learn from so maybe you could use
these command lines and get ahead of the
tutorial series that I'm teaching you
guys so you can use this to prepare
yourselves and learn more things as well
ok so yeah that's it for this video I
hope you guys enjoyed it I hope you guys
learned something new and we will just
get on produce more awesome content and
I'll show you guys some more cool things
all right can't wait to see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
