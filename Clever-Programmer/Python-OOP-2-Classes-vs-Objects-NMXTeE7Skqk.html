object-oriented programming in Python
course whoo mouthful so in the last
video we talked a little bit about how
we had the student thing and then we
were able to use the initialization
method so we talked about kind of an it
method of classes well let's go and talk
about the difference between classes
versus objects so it's the some of the
terminology is important to wrap your
mind around even if it's a repetition or
even if you've seen it somewhere before
it's good to practice and just hear
about it again so you can differentiate
when you're speaking when you're
thinking and more importantly when
you're researching online because if
you're trying to create a game one of
the most common things people will do is
you'll go online go on stackoverflow.com
or whatever and look something up and if
your terminology is not correct you're
not going to look it up correctly as
well so even though it might be knowing
right now focus on learning the
terminology so when you see a class
constantly in your head set class or
tell your friend class or you know say
it out loud and same thing with an
object do the same thing when you
identify it be like oh that's an object
from a class so on and so forth now
let's go ahead and break down the
difference between classes and objects
so let's say again we create a class
called I don't know
fighters okay and in this class we have
let's let's do this okay let's let's
create that init method that we had
earlier and let's go down here and let's
just put whatever we don't care for now
we will just have a name okay and we
will say solve that name is equal to
name and we will delete the pass and
just like that
okay and now I'm going to say Kazi is
equal to fighters dot or no let's pass
them a name so we'll say Kazi here and
i'm going to save it stop giving me that
error about spell check now I'm going to
run this code in a little bit salsa Kazi
name and I'll say print around it and
I'm going to run this piece of code so
let's run it and you see that it says
Causey right over there okay well what
just happened so fighters is the class
name this name here is an attribute and
this initialization thing is a method
Kazi is an object I know I said a lot of
things it's okay if you don't completely
get it
object-oriented programming is one of
those things that the more you do it the
more sense it makes in the store that
will kind of flip your brain a little
bit but fighters
I repeat fighters is the class and cause
E is the object created from the class
fighters all right another way of saying
it is that we just instantiate it an
object and that object happens to be
Kazi okay and now whatever kind of
things we want caused you to do we can
do or we can create another object we
can call Bob is equal to from the
fighters class give them the name Bob or
you can give them the name cat it
doesn't really matter we can say print
Bob's name and again you will see you
know you see cat's name at the bottom
there so might be a repetition of a
little bit of what we did but I wanted
to go a little bit more in depth and
break this terminology apart and again
the more classes you see the more
methods you see me create and the more
methods and classes you create you will
get more comfortable with it therefore
you will get a better under
standing so I want you to pause this
video or after you're done watching this
video and before you move on to the next
video create your own class kind at the
top of your head create your own
initialization method can create your
own kind of objects and go from there
and before I forget here's the code so
go to Chrome or Safari whatever you use
don't use Safari start using Chrome and
go to that link up at the top I'll give
you guys that link okay it's very simple
github comm slash clever programmer
slash clever programmer underscore stuff
I'll leave that hopefully in the
description below if I remember and I've
pushed all of your code up here so
whenever we put something just go right
there so OOP really stands for
object-oriented programming click that
and here's where all of your code will
be alright so do that and please please
which just go and smash that start
button okay right there just just smash
it okay like that saw that now we're at
three but I'm gonna on start it because
it's cooler when you guys like it
instead of me okay guys I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
