clever programmer comm and you are
watching code Kadim e python tutorials
this is tutorial number 20 so let's talk
about where we left off okay so we just
finished battleship recall recall enjoy
that recall right that was a big
accomplishment you should have taken
some time out to mull that over and
think about it and maybe even be an
eager beaver or an overachiever and try
to do the extra credit part okay however
we are now going to move on so we are
59% complete or about to hit that sixty
percent mark which is amazing and we're
going to be talking about loops and
loops are super exciting and this is a
beautiful Thursday morning I made it to
my studio and I was super excited to
record these for you guys so hopefully
you are also having a very good time
right now watching this and hopefully
you're feeling really good too
hopefully your day has gone well so
let's get two loops and talk about it
while you're here haha so they're
talking about while loops right they're
lame jokes always sneak in and I will
always make sure to let you know if
there secret jokes that's why I'm here
the while loop is similar to an if
statement it executes the code inside of
it if some condition is true however it
keeps doing it right that's the only
difference between an if statement and
the while loop kind of if statement it's
like an if statement but it's like an if
statement it keeps repeating while it's
true right so while your push-ups are
less than 10 keep doing push-ups right
so for example I can do something like
let's let's create some variable called
push-ups set it to zero and while
push-ups is less than 10 print um
do one more
or keep yeah do another pushup
and then um if the loop ends and that
means where that if condition doesn't
match and we can say print good job you
have done ten push-ups right and I can
also print what push-up count weird at
just to let us know what's going on okay
let's run this oh oh oh
why is this giving us what's happening
here I'm glad that this happened I'm
really glad this happened it's gonna
like crash my browser Oh God
um let's just yeah
stopping stopped okay
so while it's stopping let's talk about
what just happened so why do you think
that happened my browser was about to
crash things just kept something just
kept happening on the screen up above me
and apparently we lost control of the
whole situation right the captain lost
control over the ship and the ship just
sank and now the ship is just broken ooh
this is bad let's close that it's not
even letting me close the browser that's
how bad it is changes may have not been
saved leave I don't care um okay changes
are not saved we just have to do it
again so let's talk about while why that
happened right so I did print push ups
I said print do do another pushup
right and then I said print you
completed
ten push-ups so you can even make a
health app using this right if you want
to but so why what just happened why did
this thing keep on running and
essentially of a crash or computer well
what happened is something called an
infinite loop and that happens if your
loop doesn't stop so here's what was
happening okay
how loop works it just keeps running
something over and over again so we have
this while loop and it keeps running
this block of code over and over again
until this condition here this condition
right is false until that condition it
evaluates to false
it'll keep running over and over again
so it goes initially push up to zero so
it goes zero is less than ten print zero
and it prints out zero to the screen and
then it says do another pushup then it
goes back up to the very to the line
three which says while push ups is less
than ten well is zero again less than
ten and yes it is so it prints out
another zero where it says push ups and
it says do another pushup
right and then push ups just keep being
zero so if every time push ups is zero
this statement what do you think it is
do you think the statement is false if
push ups a zero or true this statement
is true because zero is less than time
so this statement is true every single
time which means that the loop runs
every single time and there's no there's
no such thing as stopping the loop so
what we want to do is just simply
increment push ups right so I will print
out your push up count I will say do
another pushup and then I will say you
know you've done this many push ups I'll
put this here because in the start it
wouldn't make sense if you've done zero
push ups and it says do another pushup
so we the first thing you do is you do a
push up
so I increment your push up count by one
and then I print out that you've done
one push up and then I say do another
pushup and eventually this thing the
first time the loop runs is zero
then it's one then it's two then it's
three then is 4 that is 5 minutes 6 7
and then 8 and then 9 and then the loop
stops because when it's 10 is less than
10
this statement evaluates to false so
you'd never get um right you get 10 here
but or sorry yeah once it's false this
part of the loop does not run right so
that's the most important thing to keep
in mind that's what stops the loop at
the end and then it just goes to line 9
and says you completed 10 push-ups so
let's check it out how it works there
you go
1 do another pushup to do another pushup
3 do another pushup
keep going keep going to go until 10 do
another pushup
and it goes you completed effectively 10
push-ups good job alright so that was
just an example of a while loop right so
let's check out why what they're talking
about change the loop so it counts up to
9 inclusive which means include at the 9
be careful not to change remove the
count plus 2 equal one bit if python has
no way to increase count your loop could
go on forever and become an infinite
loop so we predicted what they're gonna
do right and where they're going to talk
about and we actually already talked
about the infinite loop so you're not
going to have that problem
hopefully not um okay
so what they're saying is change the
loops it counts up to 9
hello I am an if statement and count is
count so this is going to print out
hello I am and if statement and count is
on and then where it says comma count is
going to basically put in like you know
1 here or 2 here 3 here's something like
that that's what it's going to look like
and this statement is going to run how
many times I'll give you 5 seconds 5 4 3
2 1 this statement will run only one
time because it's an if statement ok and
how many times is this going to run give
you a second to think about it
one two three four or five seconds okay
this statement is going to run five
times because count is zero the first
time so the block of code runs then
count is one so then the block of code
runs then count is two and then the
block of code runs then count is three
and the block of code run and then count
is four and the block of code runs so
zero one two three four that's five
times and we don't when once it says
five this part evaluates to false so the
block of code does not run because five
is not less than five okay so they said
change it so the loop runs nine so the
loop runs and counts up to nine
inclusive which means that we want to
change this to a ten that way it counts
from zero all the way to nine and goes
up to but not including ten okay another
way you can do it is say nine here but
say greater than or equal to that way
it's only false if it's above nine okay
so those are two ways to include the
nine this is a more normal way for me
hello I am an if statement and count is
zero and you don't see that if statement
run again right anywhere then you see
hello I am a while loop and count is
blah blah blah so here you see hello I
am a while loop and count is zero hello
I am a while and count as one hello I am
a while and count is two so on and so
forth and ultimately you see count is
nine and then the loop stops okay
perfect
okay good let's go start next lesson the
condition is the expression that decides
what the loop is going to be executed or
not these are the five steps to the
program so condition again was what I
told you right every loop every if
statement if statement is followed by
some kind of condition um and while loop
is also followed by some condition right
in our case this part I'm going to wrap
in parentheses that's our condition
again important you know determine
ecology right so instead of hand waving
just be like oh yeah I get it just make
sure that you really understand that
that part is called a condition so then
when you refer to it or you hear about
it the information is easier to
synthesize for your brain you'll be like
oh yeah so that's a condition I know all
about those conditions right let's go
back okay
the while loop checks to see if loop
condition is true right that's what we
have already discussed it checks that
the loop condition is true here they
created a variable called loop condition
and set it to true so eventually it's on
the start it's true right and then they
change the loop condition to false and
then it goes back here and this is false
so the loop just stops so this loop how
many times does it run I'll give you
five seconds to answer that question
five four three two one
this loop runs only one time ok let's
test it out boom um it's going to give
me an error because of that print
statement so let's put parentheses there
and it runs once almost like an if
statement and it goes I am a loop and
that's it if I do not change a default
then you're going to have an infinite
loop right if I just say while true this
loop will never stop unless I add maybe
a break statement or something like this
okay um see how the loop checks this
condition and when it stops executing
when you think you've got the hang of it
save and submit I think you've got the
hang of it let's save and submit while
you're at it another joke inside a while
loop you can do anything else you
anything you can do elsewhere including
rhythmic arithmetic operations so while
you're inside of the if block a while
loop block you can just write whatever
code you want right just like you're
normally writing code except it's just
wrapped in a while loop so you can do
print a banana plus you can do print
banana
um bright apple juice Bobby Jon I like
to drink food it's a fun little sentence
it could be a great password actually
good luck breaking that password right a
lot of the just a tip for you guys we're
really who want to have a really strong
password but easy to remember it's
actually have a phrase and separated by
spaces those are tremendously hard to
get there is a difficulty for passwords
and apparently those take like trillions
of years with the best computing systems
and thousands of computers combined
trying to guess that password so those
are actually one of the toughest to
guess and it's easy to remember instead
of having a password like that it's
going to be really hard to remember and
it's actually not it's easier to crack
than that sentence that I wrote above
anyways so let's say we have that
sentence here and if I do run it's just
going to print that well I can just do
the same thing while right I'll just
make something condition is equal to
true and then I'll say while condition
then do that and then otherwise print
and then make the condition is equal to
false in that way the loop stops only
after running once and you can see that
pretty much the same thing I did outside
of the loop I can do inside of a loop I
can also write if statements inside of a
loop which are nested by more if
statements which are nested by for loops
which is nested by another for loop so
all this stuff just builds on top of
each other which is why it's so
important to understand the fundamentals
of it and then you can nest them
together and do whatever kind of logic
you want generally just a piece of
advice it's not going to be so useful
for you right the second but if your
code is having a lot of its statements
underneath it like if a lots of indent
Asians underneath each other it's called
like really nested right and your code
starts to become hard to reason about
it's just a bad idea to have that it
means usually there's something wrong
with your logic if you have tons of if
under ifs and loops under loops it
increases the complexity of your code
and also increases the complexity in
terms of reading it which means your
code is harder to understand and more
likely it's gonna produce some kind of
bugs and it's going to be hard to fix
those so focus on simplicity and make it
so it's very readable and understandable
and make sure that you can explain it to
other people
anyways create a while loop whoops let's
just put this right there create a while
loop prints out all the numbers from 1
to 10 squared each on their own line
okay that's simple so what we're gonna
do is print and it's going to run while
num is less than or equal to 10 because
we want to include the 10 if we didn't
want to include the 10 we would say this
and num would only go up to 9 but they
want the 10 so I'm going to say less
than or equal to 10 and what I will say
is print num squared and then I will
increment num so that way the first time
num will be 1 right because that's what
it is here so is going to do 1 squared
that's going to be 2 then it's going to
be 3 &amp;amp; 4 then 5 then 6 and it's going to
run the ball loop block then it's going
to be 7 it's going to run the while loop
block and eventually it'll be 10 and
notice that this is still true which
means that this block of code line 4 and
5 will still run and then the while loop
will say that this is 11 and 11 less
than or equal to 10 we'll evaluate to
false and so this block of code will not
run okay hopefully you got that let's
run it and there we go we got 1 4 9 16
25 36 49 64 81 100 right Square 1 1 you
get 1 square 2 you get 4 square
three squared right just to make sure we
are following the math as well three
squared that's just three times three
four times four right all of that so
great stuff cool looks good why isn't
that okay it's kind of stuck on my
screen there for a second so we go all
the way up to 100 and then we stop okay
start next lesson see where we're at
cool a simple errors a common
application of a while loop is to check
user input to see if it is valid so
another cut
so basically what they're saying I'm
just going to reiterate it pretty much
is constantly keep running thing while
the while the user input is wrong right
so you even say the word while naturally
while describing that right so anytime
you see yourself describing these words
in English like just keep running the
program while the user is putting in
errors maybe you can start thinking of
there's something like a while loop
working in the background so yeah I keep
typing in some wrong information you
don't want to just end the program or
give me some kind of error or say sorry
wrong error and shut out the program you
want to ask me again like please write a
correct answer okay so that may be one
good reason to keep running while loop
in your software so fill in the loop
condition so the user will be prompted
for a choice over and over oh sorry I
read it wrong will be prompted for a
choice over and over again while choice
is not equal to Y and choice does not
equal an N I think that should be an or
right because you can't pick N and Y at
the same time so this is logically
incorrect it should say or so the loop
should keep on running until the user
picks Y or an R imagine if you were
playing a game
game like rock-paper-scissors you want
to make sure that they pick either our
for rock P for paper or s for scissors
and if they pick banana it just ask them
like go again pick RP s make sure it's
one of the three
okay so sorry I didn't catch that so
here we taken the user input are you
enjoying the course and while we can say
here we can check for the condition
while the user answer or in this case
choice is not yes or no then ask for the
choice again so here we ask for the
choice again and then the loop just
keeps running back and forth back and
forth okay so I can say choice does not
equal Y or choice does not equal n okay
but how I would probably like just says
well not no actually this is fine this
is fine while choice is not Y or choice
is not n keep running okay so let's give
this a try did you enjoy the course
bananas sorry I didn't catch that
let's see code Kadim e YouTube okay
keeps catching it so it's actually
pretty smart
let's try capital y haha okay let's try
small Y what it should have caught that
mm is there error in my logic here let's
see that should have caught that
so maybe my logic is incorrect here oh
right actually they're right I'm wrong
because what they're actually saying is
it shouldn't be the case that neither of
them exist okay so here we're saying
that if both of these don't exist then
run this block of code okay that's the
only case you'll run this block of code
so here let's
how do we end this okay we actually can
end it so what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to copy this I'm gonna reset code oh
that didn't help either let's refresh
I've had some people who have gone stuck
in an infinite loop of code Academy and
they could never get out of it and their
code Academy just freezes forever so
hopefully that's not going to happen to
us
I think and should fix the problem okay
and now if I say why that should work
okay so they were right I'm sorry I was
wrong for you me code Academy people
infinite loops an infinite loop is a
loop that never exits this can happen
for a few reasons you guys already know
about why that happens the condition
cannot possibly false while one does not
equal two right this conditions can
never ever be false if I just said one
does not equal two that statement is
true and it'll be true forever we're not
even using variable names there so we
can't change the value of one or two
we're just using integers that loop just
keeps running until you write maybe
something like break that condition is
going to keep giving you a true you can
also set a condition by mistake that is
going to be a false forever
the logic of the loop prevents the loop
condition from becoming false okay so
here they're showing you example of why
your loop might run forever
so here you have this case okay count is
equal to ten to start off at ten and
they say while ten is greater than zero
so 10 is greater than zero we want to
make this part false when is this part
going to be false when we keep
increasing count or when we keep
decreasing count again to stop the loop
we need to make that statement at that
condition false when is that condition
going to be false when count
we keep increasing count or keep
decreasing count give you a few seconds
to think about it 3 2 1 when we keep
increasing count what's going to happen
is that condition is never ever ever
ever going to be false because if you
have 10 10 is greater than zero is true
if you have 11 is greater than zero
that's true 100 greater than zero is
true thousand greater than zero is true
but if we decrement it every time so
it's like that eventually when it comes
to zero is 0 greater than zero
no is that condition false yes it is if
it's false the loop stops right this
condition evaluates to false the loop
stops okay so just make sure first you
understand which way you got to go on
the number line right are we going to
the right and increasing or left and
decreasing to stop the loop what makes a
condition false when does the loop end
so here they're showing you that a
possible error you can do is instead of
decrementing and reducing the value of
count so it gets to zero you're
increasing the value of count which
means that you're going to keep going up
which means that the loop runs forever
so I'm not going to run it because it's
going to crash my browser but that's
what would effectively happen just for
fun maybe we can run this in my terminal
and I'm gonna say paste with spaces all
right you like spaces more and you see
that it keeps running forever right just
keeps running and keeps running okay it
won't stop there wasn't a condition that
makes it stop so I'm going to do control
C on my Mac and that breaks the loop in
a terminal okay so they just showed you
a common error that can happen but if I
made it - equal 1 which is like
decremented by 1 every time and I open
up my terminal and I paste all of this
there well you see it runs from 10 9 8 1
and then it stops ok the loop in the
editor has two problems it's missing a
colon well obviously the
and count is never incremental logic 'el
error so one is a syntax error which is
the program won't allow you to run it
and the other one is a logical error
which means the program won't stop you
but it's a logical error it's a flaw in
our own logic the latter will result
result in an infinite loop so be sure to
fix both before running so we are going
to fix it and we're going to say count
minus equal 1 or actually we should
increment it because here count is 0 and
this statement is true and if I
decrement it this statement is still
true and still true and still true still
true and still true right so I got to go
on the right side and increment it every
time so I'm going to go here change this
to a plus sign I don't need this comment
and that should be good runs ten times
right because it starts from zero ok
infinite loop so that was a lot about
loops I'll let your brains explode and
ponder over that a little bit
go practice it right now a little bit
more loops have tons of applications
don't tell me you don't have any ideas
look for some ideas that you can work on
some basic basic problems or something
you want to just create for fun
it keeps asking for a name and it's if
it matches one of the names of your
family members its greets them in a
specific way if it's your spouse or your
girlfriend or your mom or your dad
whoever it creates them in their own
unique way and the program just keeps
running forever ok so that's one example
or you can create rock-paper-scissors go
practice loops there are actually
absolutely amazing very powerful tool
you go do that and I will see you in the
next video clever programmer
this is Kazi from clever programmer and
the next part is going to be part 21
please subscribe go like up like the
video give a thumbs up that helps to
reach more people and I'll see you in
the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
