clever programmer calm and you are
watching code Khadem e Python part 16
yeah yeah I think it's 16 for sure okay
so let's get started yeah this is
getting complicated guys I tell myself I
have to remember it's part 15 or part 16
and then I forget so we're really
getting far along that's a good thing
and you're getting far along
that's even better I'm excited for you
if you've gotten to part 15 okay so
don't tap yourself on the back yet do it
maybe at the end of this tutorial
hopefully we'll finish all of this and
get started on battleships so they want
us to do a lot of things here so this
showed us two methods to print out items
from a list which is exactly what I
showed you guys in the last video
remember so that's what they're
effectively doing here um either just
make that uh access that element
directly write the definition of item
came up of distinct physical object so
either access that item in a list
directly or access it using its index
and then you can call the list and call
and pass in the index when you're
indexing the list and then print get
access to each element that way method 1
is useful to loop through the list but
it's not possible to modify the list
this way so there yeah so that's true
you can actually modify on the list this
way if you want to modify the list you
have to know the index of that element
and then you can change that index okay
for example
if I get access to this element directly
let's say I'm looping through for item
in n print or n I don't know equal or
sorry yeah let's say item equals item
plus 1 and then I don't know I print out
and 3 is still 3 even though I told 3 to
increment itself by 1 but what actually
happened is that this list got passed in
we got a 3 just by itself and then it
went ok the new definition of item is
equal to what item was 3 plus 1 so now
item is 4 and that variable item is just
a variable by itself it's not really
connected to the list in any way so what
you want to say here is for I in range
Len of n this translates to 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 I've
already shown you how that works but
just to be just to kind of reiterate Len
of n this is 3 5 7
well length of 3 5 7 is simply 3 range
of 3 gives you a list that's like this
with 3 elements in it okay
and then I will say n of I equals n over
4 I'm sorry I plus 1 now if I print n
you'll see this will be 4 this will be 6
in this will be 8 just like here okay
make sure you really understand that
concept okay 1 loop you go through in
this indices and the other loop you go
through the actual element itself all
right so now they're telling us a lot of
things to do create a function that
returns a sum of a list of numbers okay
so it sums these guys and returns it so
define define a function called total
that accepts one argument called number
it will be a list so we are expecting
numbers to be a list inside the function
create a result create a variable called
result and set it to zero using one of
the two methods above iterate through
the numbers list so I'm going to say for
I in range 0 through and I'm just
writing 0 just to be very verbose as to
what I'm doing it's not necessary at all
if I want to go one step further I can
even say start is equal to zero and stop
is equal to that but I'm not going to go
that crazy normal way would just be to
pass in the length but I'm going to just
specify that I hey I'm starting from 0
and I'm going to pass in Len of numbers
which is whatever the list you pass that
function and we're going to say that for
each number we're going to as it added
to result so I'm going to say result
plus equals or result is equal to result
plus that list indexed by that index
that we loop through so you know this
will be like first I will be zeroth
element right I will be the zeroth
element and numbers of 0 will give you 3
then I will be the second element in the
list that that will be 1 and numbers of
1 might give you back 5 we're assuming
that we passed in this list two numbers
and then it will be 2 so it will say at
indicee to give me what numbers is and
we'll get back 7 so on and so forth I'll
go through this algorithm really quickly
with you guys after we're finished
writing it and then at the end return
result does I really want to make sure
that there's not a single part that we
were skipping over then create a
function called create a function called
total that adds up all the elements of
an arbitrary list and returns that count
using the existing code as a hint use a
for loop so it can be used for any size
so this will work let's take it to the
ripple and do print our function total
let's pass in the list N and let's run
it let's see what it does three plus
five plus seven is indeed fifteen and
that's what we got right over here okay
how did it work well let's see n is
three five seven past and three five
seven two this guy a length of three
five seven evaluated to three range from
zero to three evaluate to zero comma 1
comma 2 the first time in the loop I is
zero numbers of zero numbers of 0
evaluates to numbers evaluates to three
comma 5 comma 7 this list indexed by the
furthest write a zeroth element gives
you back three result is zero zero plus
three gives you three and now result is
three then the loop happens again and
now this time I is actually one numbers
of one gives you back a 5 here result
which was three here it's going to be 3
plus 5 3 + 5 is going to give you back 8
and now you're going to have 8 here it's
going to keep doing that until at the
end result will give you back 15 and
then since that function returns 15 this
whole thing gets evaluated to 15 and it
prints it out to the screen which is how
you get to see it and screen is I think
right above me so it gets printed out to
the screen right there okay
all right another way to do this is just
to get that element directly here it
makes more sense to get it directly so I
would actually say for number in numbers
result is equal to result plus number I
think this is a much easier way to write
this and it's better for this one
because we don't care about the indices
but let's go back to that because I
think they're going to make us use it
using strings and lists and functions
now let's try working with strings so
you can do the same thing and do that
with strings as well but you can't
change values of strengths because it's
very mutable we'll find out what that
means create a function that concatenate
strings so we're going to create a
function that's going to keep looping
through and adding the strings together
that shouldn't be that hard if you guys
really think about it you can do it
yourself so take a stab at it first and
then watch me do it so I'm going to say
define string adder it takes in lists of
strings and what it will do is for each
string in the list of strings it's going
to final string is going to be I'm going
to start it off as an empty string so
what it's going to do is every time it
gets a string I'm going to say that
increment the final string by the final
string plus the new string that we add
okay
and then at the end I'm gonna say return
the final string so let's create a
grocery list let's say or let's just say
groceries is equal to mmm
banana
Apple avocados maybe I can spell that
and berries okay and then let's say for
all we don't have to actually write
anything we've already wrote it let's
call our string adder function on
groceries and let's make sure to print
that and let's run it let's see what
happens and you get a banana then it
adds Apple to it and then it does all
that okay if I want to do it in a little
bit of a better way I can say add an
additional space at the end of each one
so you'll get that space here but you
also get that space right here which you
don't really need but it's still cool
you get D spaces here okay how does this
work well let's go through it really
quickly so groceries is just that list
this gets passed into our function final
string is just an empty string in the
start and then what we do is that for
each string and a so the first time
string is banana and final string is an
empty string and so it adds banana to
that empty string
now this empty string is banana right
banana this whole thing actually
translates to banana with a space at the
end
so our final string is actually that
then what happens is this we get to the
second element Apple actually we got a
yeah it's going to get tricky to do but
little should go back okay oops let's go
back to the part where I had to list
their cool so the second element in the
string is going to be an apple
we have banana here so I'm just going to
leave that and then string is going to
be Apple this part was banana with a
space and then we add empty space here
so this effectively turns into banana
space Apple space and end and so then
this guy is now that okay and this
that's the way you get banana and apple
and then it adds kados and berries and
it adds a space at the end cool okay so
we created a pretty nice function and
that's effectively what they want us to
do so what I'm going to say is I'm
probably just gonna copy this guy and
whoops copy this guy and maybe paste it
here the function is called join strings
so we're going to send strings and
what's the argument the one accepts an
argument called words everywhere I have
lists of strings I'm going to call it
words and for now this would make more
sense to call it a word here word um no
actually yeah word
inside the function create a variable
called result and set it to an empty
string iterate through the words list
that's exactly what they're saying right
create a thing called the result and
make it that instead of final string
call it result okay and iterate through
the words list and append each word to
result and finally return the result
don't add spaces between the joined
strings so we're not adding any spaces
here right otherwise I would do
something like this but I'm not cool
okay and it works so you see Michael and
then it says Lieber man yeah okay
a little foreshadowing I'm going to show
you guys a really cool and advanced
trick to do this a cool way to join all
the things in the list is actually to do
this thing called dot join and then pass
in that list so what this does is it
joins all the items in the list by this
thing here so you can have this thing
here be whatever you want I'm going to
have it be a space I'm going to say
print so you're going to see what I mean
in just a second here so you see it
actually joined all the elements right
each element banana Apple avocados
berries by this empty space here because
I said give it to me by empty space
let's say I told it to join it by this
it would do just that so this is kind of
a nice thing to think about because if
you're like creating a game like
rock-paper-scissors maybe it's nice to
have each thing separated and decorate
it in a way so when a person is
somebody's playing your game it looks
nice it looks formatted
even if you're making just a text-based
game not you know fancy graphics you can
still use these things to make it look
nice you know you can have rock with
some spaces in between and then scissors
so it looks nice and separated just just
some things to keep in mind but this is
a little advanced and cool trick to know
about okay lit using lists of lists and
functions cool let's get to that using
two lists as two arguments in a function
hmm so how what does that even mean well
it's really quite simple okay I'm going
to define some function called join list
and I'm gonna say M comma N and I'm
gonna do return M + n let me show you
guys something cool skip so I'm just
gonna open up my idle here which is the
same thing as having my repple open but
again I just like to open up multiple
things so you guys know that you can do
things multiple ways plus I'm just
showing you in Python - so in Python 2
or 3 is actually the same thing if you
have two lists you can just add them
together + 4 5 6
it just concatenates the list together
that's it ok pretty simple right so if
you wanted to join lists just use the
plus operator it knows what to do it
adds them together and then just return
it so it's literally two lines of code
oh wow they actually did the same
example as us I wasn't even thinking
about that s hilarious I didn't even
read all of this that's really cool
so let's run it and you will see that
that's what you got okay you can call
these variables here whatever you want
remember just as long as you are
consistent it should still give you back
the right answer I just called it MNN I
call PQ a B whatever you want really so
let's take this code and put it in here
and let's just call it PQ and the only
reason I'm calling it different than
this is so you don't get confused and
think oh these two things have to be the
same as the parameters no they don't so
cute okay very easy start next lesson
using a list of lists in a function so
now they're having you do two loops what
does this mean
alright I'll show you just a second here
okay for lists in lists of lists print
lists so what they're doing is let's say
I gave you this list that contains how
many elements take a guess it contains
only two elements okay the first element
in this list is this list here this is
the first element and the second element
in the list is this list here okay so
that comma is telling you since there's
only one comma separating these two
items it's telling you that they're only
two items okay so what does that mean
well we're going to loop through what we
want to do is loop through this and
print out all the items in the first
list and then continue looping and then
print out all the items in the second
list how the heck would we do that
well first of all let's just write four
lists and lists of Lists right this is a
variable list of Lists lists of Lists
let's run it let's see what it prints
out so effectively what it did is it
passed you know that is that the first
element is going to be 1 comma 2 comma 3
so this list
comes one comma 2 comma 3 which is why
up there you see 1 comma 2 comma 3 being
printed out the first time and the
second time the second element is 4
comma 5 comma 6 and so it prints out 4
comma 5 comma 6 which is why you see
that as well right up there 4 comma 5
comma 6 okay but we want to print out 1
2 3 line by line and then 4 5 6 how in
the world do we do that well let's try
this let's say well how we would
normally do that if we were just given
one list so let's say for item in 1
comma 2 comma 3 we would simply do print
item and that would give us 1 comma 2
comma 3 but here we have a list of lists
so the first time it's a little
complicated but it's actually quite
simple because you're getting back a
list so you can still loop through that
right so we're imagining that we get
back let's say 1 comma 2 comma 3 well
you can do just that loop so you can say
for item in that list print I don't so
what will the loop do here's what it
will do it will list of lists is that so
the first time list is going to be 1
comma 2 comma 3 right 1 comma 2 comma 3
for item and list so for item in that
list is going to be the first item is
going to be 1 or I'm sorry 1 like that
and it's going to print out 1 to the
screen then it's not going to go back to
line 3 it's gonna actually just keep
traveling between line 4 and 5 till the
loop here as ended okay it's gonna keep
going like like that then it's going to
go back to the outer loop on line 3 so
next time the element is going to be 2
is going to come down here and you know
since this variable is actually item
this is
item the second time in the loop this is
going to be two and it's going to print
out - which is you're going to get this
then it's going to be again
item item so both of these are going to
be three the last time and it's going to
print out three then it's going to see
that this loop is over because this is
finished so it's going to go back up
here okay the outer loop is not over
because it only became the first element
it now needs to become the second
element it needs to run to the second
element so now it's going to be four
four five six right
since this variable is LST or a list
this is this is going to be the same
thing first so now we come to the second
for loop here on line four item is going
to be for the first time and so we're
going to print out four then item is
going to be five we're going to print
out five and then item is going to be
six we're going to print out six loop is
over right so this kind of thing goes
away and then the we come to the outer
loop and Python realizes like oh we are
done running through that outer list and
we're finished and the program is going
to be over at that point at that point
okay so essentially what we did
just to recap is looped through the
outer list without ER for loop and then
once we got the inner list which was the
first element then we loop through the
inner list till the inner list was
completed then we went back to the outer
list and checked hey are there any more
lists in there to loop through when we
found another list we went to the inner
loop and kept looping through that inner
list okay so enough of the theory let's
check if it works
let's run it and you get back one two
three four five six whoo okay so it's
called flatten so here's what they want
is to do create a function called
flatten that takes a single list so
click and concatenate all the sub lists
that are part of it into a single list
so what we want to do is since we see
one two three four five six seven eight
nine all of that we want to be able to
turn it into one two three four five six
seven eight and nine into one list okay
even if we have a hundred list we want
to just turn all of that into one list
so flattened one argument called lists
and this is going to be pretty simple
but let's let's go through what they're
saying here make a new list call results
so this is going to be an empty list and
what we're going to do is we're going to
iterate through list so I'm going to say
four numbers in lists that's what it
says right iterate through lists call
the looping variable numbers so the
looping variable can be anything I'm
going to call numbers here is going to
be lists so for numbers and lists now
I'm going to iterate through numbers for
number in numbers for each number
appended to results results dot pad
number and then ultimately I'm going to
say return results cool I think there's
an easier way to do this as well which
I'll show you guys after
yes we earn the badge
listen functions we've completed it
congratulations we have completed this
course epic so now you can pat yourself
on the back I know you've been like
holding it in right because at the start
of the videos like don't Pat yourselves
on the back so go ahead and pat yourself
on the back
relax you know stretch whatever you have
to do take a break walk around cool off
your brain a little bit and then come
back because we're not yet done so we
can't go through it okay how did this
how the heck did this thing work this is
the crazy thing about them right they
show you all of this stuff and then
they're not going to explain how each
step works because you could have just
easily coded this by following their
steps without even thinking how to do it
alright so here's what's happening we're
creating an empty list we loop through
each element in that list so let's say
the first element is actually a list so
it would be better to call this variable
list in list rather than numbers because
that's silly so the first time we loop
through n which is these lists right
over here right this is a list
containing list so the first time we
loop through it okay let's just let's
just walk it walk through it okay I'm
gonna recall n here all right
that's n we pass that into our list
variable and our argument now we have
pass in list of Lists again this
function - it took only one argument
keep that in mind this whole thing is
just one list containing multiple lists
inside of it result boom we initialized
it to an empty list so what we did is we
did that okay lists is not that thing so
for lists in that the first element is a
list 1 2 3 and list is 1 2 3 here's well
number the first time we loop through is
one and one we append one right here
then the second time number is - it's
two we append two right here then it's
three right this 3 right here 3 3 we
append 3 loop ends what do we do we go
to the outer loop we change these
variables back to what there were number
list number lists we're sorry that's
list
this is list ok now our inner loop ended
but our outer loop did not end because
it only went through the first element
we still have one more element left the
second element in that is this guy here
so the first number in that list is 4 4
we append we go up here we append 4 then
the second element in that guy is 5 we
go and we append 5 then the next one is
6 we append 6 7 results out of pen 7 8
right results dot append 8 and then it's
9 and results out of pen 9 and it says
return results so this function actually
gets evaluated to that and then we call
the print function on that list and you
see that output on the screen okay so if
I ran all of this
make sure to put a parenthesis there and
if I ran all of this you see a list 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 that's how it actually
worked now why I said there is an easier
way to do this is what I would do is
very simple I would say instead of doing
an inner loop I would just say results
dot append arm this gets a little bit
complicated but so I'm not going to do
it but it would essentially be element
at index 0 plus the element at index 1
so element add current index basically
plus element at next index so what that
means is in this giant list here it
would do current index so let's say our
index was at 0 because this is this list
is at position 0 and this list on this
element here is a position 1 so what it
would essentially do is that plus that
and this would automatically give you
one list containing that ok and and it
would just add it ok and then at the end
you could do results of 1 or results of
0 and get the final result but that just
actually that complicates it a little
bit however that would save you kind of
going through another inner loop but you
would have to do a different kind of
loop for what I was saying because you
need access to the indices so you
actually need to do a loop with the
range function okay so hopefully you
understand how that worked let's take a
look at our course page because we're
done with lists and functions we're at
52%
lowly but surely we're getting there and
we're gonna be at a really fun part in
the next video we're going to be going
through battleship and how to create an
actual game how great is that then we
have unit 8 left unit 9 is going to be
awesome
unit 10 I was thinking about skipping it
but I'm going to do it last because it's
not useful so we're gonna actually get
to more fun parts first that's what that
means for you other than that that's it
