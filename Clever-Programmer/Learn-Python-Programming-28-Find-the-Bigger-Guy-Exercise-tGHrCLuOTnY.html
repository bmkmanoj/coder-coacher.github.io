this video I want to talk about who's
the bigger guy this is Kazi from clever
programmer calm and we're going to solve
a pretty sick problem sick as in good
now this problem essentially wants you
to find max of two numbers so if I give
you look at it look at line 19 if I give
you one two you should return to if you
give this function bigger guy function
if you give it 10 and 20 it should
return 20 if you give it 20 and 10 it
should return 20 and if you give it 2
and 1 it should return to get the idea
and same thing with the strings but you
don't have to do anything special Python
knows how to check strings against each
other okay so let's code this up notes
or below solution is below I think you
guys know the drill at this point if
you're watching this on YouTube that is
if you're watching it on my website
everything is going to be there in your
face so first step d/f define we're
writing a function that does this right
look at the instructions write a
function bigger guy so I know that I do
this with my eyes closed now what is it
taking it takes in two numbers so I know
that it takes in two inputs I can say
num1 num2 or something okay and what can
I do here well I want to check between
those two numbers in whichever is the
bigger one I want to return that number
right so using if statements and
comparison operators we can do all of
this together if you haven't solved this
yet or if you haven't tried to solve it
on your own please don't watch this
pause try the problem then come back but
here's a solution for you guys for you
eager beaver's if
num 1 is greater than num to return num
1 right if num 1 is bigger
well otherwise return num - right
in the case where num 2 is equal to num
1 do we care which one we want to return
of course not
we don't care we just want to return any
of them it doesn't matter okay to
specify that for you guys here I'll be
nice and I'll add in another test ok
10 10 it should return 10 I really don't
care what it returns in the case where
there two are the same okay and what if
they are what if num 2 is the one that's
greater well in either of those cases
right the first case we return num 1 if
it's the case where they're equal or if
num 2 is greater we return num2 which is
why we don't need to give a condition we
just say else and we're done now let's
let's check this bad boy and let's see
how it works right let's let's give it
some ok here I'll just do it to be extra
tangible here for you guys right so
let's let's do 3 5 it returns 5 let's
give it 5 9 it returns
9 and if I gave it 5/5 it should return
5 right so we know what it does and here
let's uncomment this line and when I run
it it should say your code is correct
which means that it passed all of these
assertion tests and then at the end it
said your code it then it went and said
your code is correct now what if all
right I'm going to save that for the
next problem because next problem is
going to be a lot more fun and more
challenging where you're going to have
to solve the biggest guys so if I give
you 3 guys what do you do we're going to
discuss that in the next problem if you
haven't already subscribe I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
