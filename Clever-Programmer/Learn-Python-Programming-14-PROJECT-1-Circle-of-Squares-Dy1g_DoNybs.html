this video I want to talk about a
project alright so we learned a little
bit about loops and how we can do some
cool loops and make squares we learn
about functions and how you can give
multiple arguments to functions we did
all of this while visualizing the code
that's why we use the turtle Python
module so you can learn visually no
matter how old you are no matter how
young you are visual learning is one of
the best ways to learn and to visualize
your code it's amazing because you get
it right away
now I wanna take this time and now allow
you guys to do an actual project so up
to this point we did a lot of fun stuff
and I gave you some basic exercises like
make a square now I'm going to give you
a little bit of a project it might take
you long it might not take you that long
it's not that much code at all it's you
just have to put a lot of these ideas
together here's the project I want you
to make a circle out of squares what do
I mean it just to be clear about what
you need to do in the project and how it
should look like I've designed this demo
for you guys so check it out make a
square turn a little bit make a square
turn a little bit make a squared turn a
little bit make a square turn a little
bit okay you get the idea you keep going
like this and eventually you get a
circle and if you notice and if you look
really into it you can probably keep
looking at this forever it's fascinating
so I love this thing I can myself look
at it forever
umm yeah
pretty enjoyable okay so I'm gonna stop
it right here you guys not have fun with
it try to make something like this okay
it's not too complicated it's really
simple make a square current make a
square current it just helps you put all
the programming concepts we've learned
so far
variables using the turtle module the
looping structures and arguments in
functions and the range thing that we
looked at in the loop so good luck and I
think you can do it all right I will see
you in the next video where I'll provide
you with the solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
