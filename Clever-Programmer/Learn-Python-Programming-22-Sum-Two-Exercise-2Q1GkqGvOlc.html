really interesting stuff we're going to
start doing some problems and you guys
can actually do it okay now this is the
part where you get involved into this
process so if you were passively
learning up until now stop now and start
actively being part of this okay because
that's how you will truly learn so let's
start off by I'm gonna give you guys
problems to do but first I want to show
you how its structured so then when you
read those problems you're not just
sitting there like what is going on I
want you to start understanding how to
problem solve and then I'll give you
guys exercises that you can solve on
your own and then I'll provide you with
solution so let's get started let's say
I give you a function called some - okay
and it returns the sum of two numbers
okay so let's just make it a little bit
more clear a function called sum - that
takes in two inputs and it returns the
sum of those two numbers okay that's the
thing that's what it's saying now your
job would be to break this down so how I
would break this down and I would say
here's what the input does it takes two
things let's call it num1 num2 or let's
not be lazy and say number one and
number two and then output is just
number one plus number two okay so it
takes those two numbers and returns them
so it helps me I'll break this whole
sentence into something that I can code
much easier okay and then a name of the
function function name is called sum -
okay so now I know what the output of it
is lucker kind of how it's done what the
input is
expects now I'm going to try to see if I
can create some examples of what it
should look like so I want to be able to
say some to give it some number like 1 &amp;amp;
2 so this is how I'll actually use it
okay and then my expected output should
be 3 right if I take 1 &amp;amp; 2 if I give it
1 into it should add it and it should
return 3 all right
that's my expected output okay so now
let's get to coding this kind of
function if you give it something like
hundred and then you give it 200 here it
should return 300 so here's our work
define some - I want to give it 1 &amp;amp; 2 or
sorry gonna give it number 1 I want to
give it some number some another
variable called number 2 and I want to
say return number 1 plus number 2 all
right
and now let's test it out I'm gonna give
it if you just define a function and
don't do anything else notice what
happens when I run it I get none nothing
happened it's like defining a variable
if I say X is equal to 5 it doesn't
actually run and give you something it
just makes X 5 so function gives names
to like blocks of code all right now
let's print it out let's call the
function some two on a number 1 &amp;amp; 2 and
let's see if it matches our expectations
and it gives us back 3 okay now let's do
it on another 100 and 200 right
it gave us back 300 that's good it's
taking those two numbers and returns
them well how does it work
when we call the function with 100 and
200 as inputs it goes back to the
definition of the function puts in 100
for number 1 right it puts in this 100
for number 1 and puts in this 200 for
the second second number so everywhere
it sees number 1 it just replaced this
with 100 everywhere it sees number 2 it
replaces with 200
okay so this happens and then this
happens okay it does 300 all right
that's the result of calling the sum to
function so this part evaluates to 300
and then it puts that part out to the
screen okay and that's the same logic
that gets applied for one comma two okay
so this was the example in the next
video I want to give you your very first
problem okay so I hope you're excited
and let's go from there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
