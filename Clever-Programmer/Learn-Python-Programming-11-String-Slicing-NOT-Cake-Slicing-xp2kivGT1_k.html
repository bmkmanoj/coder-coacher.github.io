video we're going to talk about string
slicing what is string slicing we're not
talking about cake slicing so let's get
started well a string as you remember
was that thing in the green here but
that's just really specific to the Idol
that we're using if you're using any
other text editor it's not necessarily
going to be green so the string is just
something in quotes either it's single
quotes or double quotes as long as it's
consistent can't have a single quote
ending with the double quote they got a
match okay so we have to match with the
quotes that's your string right so what
we want to do now is slice those strings
well what does that mean imagine I gave
you an email address email is equal to I
don't know
Rafi at gmail.com something like that
well a common thing that people have to
do when they are getting this data back
is well this is the username or
something this part is the gmail thing
and then this is the dot-com part right
so like let's say we just want the
domain or whatever and here we simply
want like the username so how would we
do that well we can use a little bit of
string slicing so let's just start with
a simple example let's take hello and
let's say we want to get the first
letter from hello we want to get just
the H well how you do it is you index by
opening a bracket and closing a square
bracket and if I do 0 it'll get me the
first letter of that okay so H in this
case is 0 right the e is 1 in Python
most of the things start from 0 so we go
all the way up to this o here which is a
4 ok so we take this hello
and whoops let's take this hello and
let's simply do one and that'll give me
the e okay now another thing I want to
show you guys in strings slicing besides
doing okay that index right this passing
in the index one will give me the second
letter what if you want to do something
cooler like get a chunk of code
well how indexing works is it start :
stop okay : stop
so what you can do is you can say hello
oh I keep doing that
hello and you can say start from zero
and end at - not including - but end at
- so include zero but don't include the
two which means that you really get the
zeros stratum zero index and the first
index right so whatever the letter is at
the 0th index and then whatever the
letter is the first index so in this
case we'll get an H e okay
how you can read this as just give me
the first two letters that's how I read
it so you can just say give me the first
two letters now when you're starting off
from 0 by default index starts at zero
so if you actually don't say this at all
and you just remove the zero you're
going to get back a chi ok everything
that I'm showing you guys here play
around with it
ok don't just sit here and watch my
videos I don't want you to be a passive
learner please please actively do this
with me or pause my video and do this I
want you to spend more time doing and
less time looking at it okay because it
seems really simple when you're watching
it but if you don't put into action and
do things that make sense to you if you
don't turn it like into a game for
yourself where you're doing something
you know like you making fun little
stupid projects using what I'm showing
you uh you're not going to be able to
remember it that's really what my
problem with Co Academy is a lot of
people go through
me but the problem that ends up
happening is that they just go through
it a really fast pace and they don't
really have much projects that they get
to do there and not a lot of stuff that
they get to do on their own
so the most common complaint you're hear
from people who take the code category
like it was great I took the whole thing
but yeah right now I can't line write a
single line of code okay so it's not
impressive the higher you are in really
abstract levels introduction to classes
oh yeah I know all about functions I'm
an introduction to classes write a
function write a function that takes in
three inputs and does dot print
something out in sorted order
I don't know how to do that I'm totally
lost right don't be one of those people
make sure you build strong fundamentals
and your coding level is functional at
all times right so even if I'm teaching
really basic stuff make sure you can do
something with it
that's the only way you'll get better
and make sure you have fun while you're
doing it anyways let's get back to it so
hello right make up your own strings and
break them up and see what you can make
up from what I've just shown you here an
experiment what if I change the end
whatever I change the stop part of it
and what if I change the start part of
it what if I don't put anything in the
stop part what happens so let's try that
so hello and let's put in nothing for
both parts let's see what happens you
just get the whole string it by default
it starts from zero and by default it
ends up the last index okay so it's the
same thing as saying zero two if you
count it up zero one two three four
right oh is four so I'll say four here
that will not give me it I have to say
five right because it will not include
the four if I say four it will go up too
but more and include the four for
example see so we have to do five okay
so that helps us get to the end of the
string now what if I want to get the
last letter from hello or anything if I
want to get the last letter
I can do something like this negative
okay I can also slice by a negative
number so if I want to get hell from
hello I can do hello and I can say go
from zero and let's try and see what
happens if I put negative one here right
so another way basically what I'm saying
is start from the zeroth part go up to
this is the last part but not including
the last part so that gave me hell
another way to write it is by putting a
four here okay another way to write it
is not having a zero here another way to
write this is not having a zero here
that all gives you a house so you see
play around with all those I'm gonna now
show you another thing that you can
slice with and that'll also blow your
mind slicing is very important in hat
it's a very common procedure so it's
pretty good to learn it because like
let's say you were trying to make an app
which goes on Craigslist and pulls a lot
of data from Craigslist soil like
pull-up ads so that act like you might
get the data back in a string form so
you might get something like Xbox 360
pricing is its price is $10 and or
that's stupid it's not $10 right you
might you might get it for $150 nowadays
2016 so the value of it has
significantly dropped and then let's say
it says the condition type so the
condition type is new right so this is
the data that you get from Craigslist
well if you were writing a script or
Python code that would pull that
information and then make sense out of
it for you and like write it to an
actual excel file so like you want it to
you know essentially do something cool
where it opens up Excel and writes to it
and you wanted to like have you know
product price and condition right and in
product you want Xbox 360 in price you
want 150 and in condition you want new
right how would you pull that data
cleanly so it doesn't put Xbox or 6150
new all in one place right so for that
you need to be able to do string slicing
okay
so for instance you might say console or
product right our columns of product is
equal to you know find me the first pipe
right so like let's say we have this guy
here there there is a method you can do
on data which is called index so let's
find the index of pipe it tells me that
pipe is at index 9 so 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 which means that if I index the string
data and I do 9 it'll give me back the
pipe so what that tells me is that to
get Xbox 360 I need to go from the start
of that string all the way up to the
first pipe that should get me the
product so I can say product is equal to
data from the start I don't need to say
0 right I can say from the start to take
the data dot index of the pipe and now
if I show you product boom look at that
we got Xbox 360 and so now I can write
that product to the file teach you guys
how to read and write to files ok so
then what it will do is that'll actually
right Xbox 360 in here for you auto
magically now understand the power and
implications well what can I just do
that by hand right that might be a
question what if it was a hundred
thousand products can do it by hand good
luck right what does a million products
that you were trying to search from and
find the best price using your
Craigslist bottom that's where
programming comes in okay it's very
important to understand how programming
in here ties together and how it's more
powerful than you trying to do this on
your own so that's really the power of
string slicing okay to break this line
down for you a little bit more data :
that's just saying start from zero and
then I'm saying data index of pipe what
does that part evaluate to right dot
index is a method that you can use on
data that's okay which just gives you
something that you're looking for you
pass it into the function write that
function or that method index takes in
one argument so what is this whole part
evaluate to in our case this part
evaluates to a nine right this whole
part data index right evaluates to nine
so if I do data zero through nine you
can see that I just get xbox360 the same
way nine tells me up to but not
including the pipe okay so that's how we
got the xbox360 part how would you get
the 150 you would kind of do the same
way to get the price okay but you would
say instead of starting to look from
here because then you'll find this pipe
right here right this one you want to
find this pipe now so you want to
actually start your string search from
this location or this location that I'm
highlighting and then you want to search
all the way up to this pipe and stop
there and get whatever is in between
these two pipes okay so that's something
that I want you guys to try paste your
code below for how you might get
the price and the condition okay that
would be a fun thing for you guys to do
I'm going to keep moving on and talk a
little bit more about strings and string
slicing because there's still a little
bit more to it so and again I want you
to keep practicing all this right
because otherwise this is going to over
overwhelm you all this knowledge so
let's say that I have
I can do start/stop and here's another
method to blow your mind
step so how many steps do I want to take
when I'm reading something okay so like
let's say I have this string hi how are
you doing it is very nice to meet you I
want to make sure I'm consistent so not
double quote single quote and you know
let's just store that in some variable
greeting okay so if I say greeting you
can see that whole string so what I can
do is take greeting say start at zero um
stop at I don't know negative one so
like all the way at the end and then I
want you to basically it will go up to
oh right because it's up to like or
sorry it'll go up to the u part but not
this period right here
sorry I just it won't let me highlight
that period he won't go up to that
period okay it'll go up to you because
it's up to but not including the period
sorry I keep saying that a lot but I do
know that when you're starting to learn
Python or programming those things
you'll forget a lot so I'm sorry if I'm
reiterating that fact over and over
again all right so we start from zero we
go up to the U right
we go from here all the way to here and
then we want to step so instead of for
example taking I don't know reading
every single one of these we can read
every other letter so I can say instead
of stepping by one which is default if I
if I do one here you'll see this pretty
much the same string without the period
and if I do nothing here you'll see the
same thing right because that's the
default and if I do step by two this is
basically saying give me every other
letter okay so think about maybe
creating a game jibberish game that
takes in a string as enough like it's a
function called gibberish takes in a
string and it just jibber right
jibberish eise's it okay it just like
jumbles it up and if I do three here you
can see now it's stepping by three all
right
so pretty weird but it's also cool at
the same time and another thing that I
want to ask you guys as a practice to do
before I end this video is say I had the
string hello I gave you the string how
would you reverse it okay I want if I
gave you hello I want back or lay or if
I gave you all oleh you should give me a
Mac hello okay so hopefully that blew up
your mind on string slicing I'll try to
put some exercises on clever programmer
calm so if you haven't already go enroll
into the school and there will be
exercises and extra resources that you
can use to get help also there are
others in the community who can help you
okay so good place to go for help
but if you're watching it on YouTube
that's totally fine comment in the
YouTube section below and I will
personally try to help you out other
than that I'll see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
