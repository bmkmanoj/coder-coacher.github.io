pattern using the list that I want to
share with you so let's say we have a
list of numbers okay and what we want to
get back effectively is something that
squares it so the result should look
like one squared so that's just one two
squared that's four this 3 over here
squared that's just 9 that 4 over there
squared that's 16 5 squared is 25 6
squared is 36 and I think you get the
idea so we can we would want to call
that list the squared list or we can say
squared numbers right since this list is
called numbers so how do we do that how
do we turn this list into just all of
these numbers squared let's figure it
out
one way you would do it is you could
type it out manually but that's gonna be
a lot of work right that would mean that
you would do squared numbers dot append
append is a method that allows you to
add to the list so here we have an empty
list and since we want to add something
to it let's just let's just show you
what I mean okay
let's say we want to add a banana in
there okay and let's print out squared
numbers when I run it you can see that
I've now added a banana let's let's
throw something else in there okay let's
throw Apple okay let's run through it
and you can see now banana and Apple are
at it okay so pen just simply add
something to the end of the list hence
append okay so going back here what we
want to do is we want to essentially
append each of those numbers squares so
how can we do that well we leverage off
what we learned in our last video so we
do for a number in numbers this is now
going to give us numbers gonna be one
the first time to the next time three
the third time and so on and so forth
and what do we want to do we want to do
squared numbers dot append number and so
we're appending now the number so we're
gonna basically every time we go through
the loop we add one the first time then
we add two from this list and we add
three but we want to actually add the
squares of those numbers so we want to
do this
and now let's check out what square
numbers looks like and that's it okay as
simple as that
very good pattern remember and and it
works okay
so play around with it see if you can do
something like cubing it or change up
this list and see if you can do
something like dividing it into every
single time and then appending that so
you can call it like half numbers yeah
practice it out run this code I'm going
to add the link of this in the below the
video or above the video so you guys can
actually go directly here and play
around with this alright guys thanks for
watching I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
