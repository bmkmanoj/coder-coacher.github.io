clever programmer calm and in this video
we're going to talk about how I calm
myself to code and how you too can use
the same exact method to teach yourself
and become a professional software
developer so let's jump right into it so
I'm going to first of all start it off
by saying what is computer programming
it's the ability to take any idea that
you have and to digitize it and bring it
on into the world whether it's you'd
want to make practical applications so
then you can use that to make extra
money get clients get a job work as an
independent contractor or maybe you just
want to make cool games right either
case programming is for you okay now the
second thing I want to talk about today
is why you should learn to code now
there are a million and one reasons but
I'm going to give you some of the best
one flexibility of work you can work
from anywhere you want okay so you can
spend time with your family have a good
time out doing whatever the hell you
want to do and still be able to generate
a lot of income because you can have
multiple clients they're working for
so working remotely is a great benefit
that you can have and that's something
that I take advantage of all the time
for example I'll travel to California to
visit my family I will travel to other
states to take novel zones high school
chess game for Chess Championships
because I'm coaching them and I don't
have to worry about oh man like I have
to be at a nine-to-five job so I think
that's great
second of all job security software
development is the number one growing
industry in the world so there's no job
scarcity happening here it's only
growing right so there's a huge market
here and whether you have a degree or
not it doesn't really matter as long as
you can prove to them
you can actually code or build some
applications for that okay so with that
said let's move on into the third
section so now I'm going to go through
how I taught myself to code alright
because you can use this same exact way
to actually teach yourself and get
started on this okay so if you've been
pondering and waiting I have told you
why you shouldn't wait already but now
I'm going to tell you how you can
actually get started so there are a
million resources but the one that I
started off with was Udacity okay I took
a course from Udacity called intro to
computer science okay and there we built
a search engine and like you know two
months basically so while you're
building that search engine you are
constantly doing all these different
exercises as well so you have this one
big massive project but in between you
have these little exercises quizzes to
just keep you on track keep your skills
sharp so you can actually then complete
that final project so that was a really
fun way that I got into the world of
computer programming I remember to this
day actually my brother gave me a call
and I was at this time deciding what
college am I going to go to what should
I do
and before I even started the computer
science course on Udacity comm my
brother gave me a calling he's talking
to me and he's like hey so are you
thinking about any jobs and I said not
really you know maybe computer
networking or something like that and he
said hey there's a big opportunity in
big data analytics and college graduates
can be making like over $200,000 you
know if you learn how Hadoop works so
like big data analytics and stuff like
that and I was like wow so I thought
that was incredibly awesome and then
started looking into it and so then
they're like you have to learn Hadoop
framework just to like learn all these
statistics and all that and so I wanted
to jump into that but then I found out
that
you actually need something more
fundamental to get into that which is
computer programming so I had to rewind
I'd then I started learning computer
programming and then after that I never
looked back so now let me give you my
second resource that I actually used to
learn a lot okay so this resource is
called Coursera you can go to Coursera
comm to take courses from them
I took the intro to interactive
programming in Python course and
basically in that course you're building
like games so you're building
applications and most of them are just
games so something like pong for example
the only thing I don't like so much
about that course is that you're not
building these in actual Python you're
using like a nice little fun thing that
they made on their online platform that
you're using but other than that I still
like the Coursera course and helped me
learn a lot so intro to interactive
programming in Python that's their part
one you can take then they have intro to
interactive programming in Python part
two which is another one you can take
where you're building more applications
and then they have another series called
principles of computing so I took that
and then I took principles of computing
part two and that was like more about
theory graph analysis and just
understanding of statistics and
probability words and how all that kind
of gets tied into the world of coding
and we even made a game like Yahtzee I
think so it was basically you're doing
graphical user interface development
you're building actual applications but
then you're using the logic you know
using some more advanced stuff that we
learn from principles of computing after
this course I jumped into I think I went
to my college class where they were
teaching us Java
and this class the instructor was just
incredibly terrible and most of the
class was just confused I paid $1,500
for this course and what ended up
happening was I got an A but ended up
learning absolutely nothing and I had
some friends from this class too who I
still noted this day who learn nothing
but God even C's or B's or some of them
actually got AIDS so a contrasting this
online education on why you should
pursue the online education route is the
cost of a college degree are just
incredibly high and what's weird is that
some of these teachers aren't even
actually qualified to teach this because
they aren't working in the industry or
creating things in the real world some
of them are actually just teachers who
are teaching others right
while that's good but what you want to
learn from somebody who's actually doing
this on a day to day basis the reason
why I say this is because technology
changes and the world of software
development changes literally every day
so if they have a curriculum that's
designed to last for two three years
it's very hard for them to change it and
usually just stays the way that it is
for many years to come
so you're really sacrificing a lot of
flexibility and agility there in your
growth so I would say go to college and
I would say pursue those courses but
make sure that your professors are
really good and also think of college is
just one learning resource right most
people when they think of college is
just things that I have to depend on it
and I can't get my education from
anywhere else right so use other online
platforms and then mix it in and
complement what you're learning in your
college okay
so with that said let's move on to
another few things that I did and then
I'm going to start to wrap this video up
and give you guys something valuable at
the end as well so if you stay till the
end
there's
thing for you basically after I took
pi/12 Coursera route I looked into code
ketamine
so I was doing a little bit of code
Academy I went through the udemy so I
took about ten five five to ten
different courses their team treehouse
is another great resource so you know
I'm making this really nice and linearly
structured for you guys but in reality I
was probably unlike all ten of them at
the same time and I feel like you might
be in that situation as well and it can
be frustrating it can be a little bit
overwhelming as well and sometimes with
all of that going on sometimes just want
to kind of quit or you're like I'll just
come back to it later and then you don't
end up coming back to it so this is the
path that I'm offering you so you can
actually just take exactly what I did
and learn all those skills and then what
I ended up doing with those skills was I
was getting work as an independent
contractor so I was working and building
software for clients and I was also
working you know like giving personal
coaching lessons you can use that exact
method to be generating pretty good
income I mean as a college student I
think just last year between the month
of May and June I made over $20,000 like
that's not bad as a 21 year old who's a
full-time student and all this while I
was actually on a vacation I went to
California to visit my family and that
my brother just had his son so I went to
see him and I was like super cool little
baby's adorable but the work that I do
and software development will give you
also that kind of flexibility so you can
go wherever you want right whether it's
for vacation or whether you're going out
with your friends and just hanging out
you'll be kind of you'll be able to do
all those things
so what I've decided to do is take
everything that I've done so far right
like all these 20 30 40 different places
that I went to study programming from
all these different courses I've taken
all these soft skills and negotiation
skills that I've learned to be able to
work with clients so they're practically
forced to like look at my resume and
then hire me all these different ways of
generating extra income what I decided
to do is take all of this and build a
course that we offer at clever
programmer now so this course right now
is called learn Python olp create apps
so it teaches you about object-oriented
programming while you're creating apps
that you can actually put on your
portfolio and go and get hired so you're
not just learning this is giving you a
real potential to actually be making
money too because let's be real at the
end of the day yes you're doing this for
fun or whatever but at the end of the
day you're doing this to get paid right
you're doing this so you can pursue
something that's fun but also so you can
live a comfortable lifestyle so that's
really what I decided during this course
and then I also teach you this you know
like the from the aspect of negotiation
skills also what else is in this course
is live sessions so you and I might
actually be in a live session along with
other students and there's a private
community built in so you can actually
work alongside other students just like
yourself so by the time you're watching
this video maybe this course is closed
down because what I want to do is I want
to close this course down so then we can
run this class and I want my focus to be
100% on you right I don't want to
deviate my intention anywhere I want to
make sure that we're all focused
committed and in this together so by the
time you're watching this the course may
be closed down
but if you're watching this when this
video was made you have three days to
enroll and then I'll probably relaunch
it I don't know when is the next time I
will do that but you can click the link
below and you can click on the waiting
list and join that so then when it is
available you'll be the first one to
know all right so thank you guys for
watching I love your faces off that's it
