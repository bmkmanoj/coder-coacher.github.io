how is it going you are watching Kazi
from clever programmer calm and this is
code Academy part 5 so let's get started
just kidding everybody this is actually
part 6 I just wanted to see if you were
paying attention alright so check it out
we are at 30% we are getting we're
almost getting there ok so first of all
I want you to take some time out and pat
yourself on the back for getting this
far because you are quite far in the
project alright but that's the reason
I'm sitting here and doing this with you
so you feel like we're in it together
right so let's keep plowing through this
and hopefully we will get it done
very soon right at 30 percent already ok
so don't give up now because this is the
part where it all starts getting better
and you get to use what you've learned
all right so we are going to find Python
and we're going to continue ok so just
for people who are maybe catching you
know coming in right now we are at the
part we finished Python syntax tip
calculator conditionals and control slow
pig latin functions and we're starting
from taking a vacation hard day at work
rough day at school take a load off with
a programming vacation that's the one
we're on alright so let's click on it
and let's get started this one is still
has to do with functions so we're going
to continue talking about this one ok
so this function is called bigger it
takes in first value second value and it
figures out which one is bigger so
that's really simple I think we can go
through it and write it together write a
function called answer that takes no
arguments and returns a value 42 okay
cool so how this function right here
works I'm going to write it out bigger
first comma and again variable names
here don't matter you can say x and y
but in programming general you want to
use better variable names and avoid one
letter variable names because you're
going to look at it later you're going
to be like what the heck is going on
here
okay so print smacks of first comma
second all right what this does function
max figure out what the max is so here
if you put in let's say 5 and then 10
the function max is going to go in check
case 5 greater than 10 it's going to say
no so then it's going to pick 10 as your
Max and then we just return true so
that's really what this thing is doing
here we define a function called bigger
done we define a function called bigger
it takes you to arguments and then if we
print out the larger one and then
finally the function itself returns true
in step three okay now we try creating a
function ourselves so we're going to
write a function or I'm just going to
leave this this here for you guys in
comments okay cool define answer and it
takes in no arguments so remember the
stuff that goes in parenthesis those are
called arguments or parameters okay if I
had it like this this takes in two
arguments so this one takes no arguments
and returns 42 okay that's all this
function does so if I took this function
it's a pretty simple function and I went
into idle
i pasted it here and then i call this
function you see all it does is it just
keeps going 42 so i can say something
like the answer to life is and we're
going to use some string concatenation
here is 42 the answer to life is 42 best
ER thing i did is so it converts this
integer datatype to a string datatype
and that way it allows me to actually
mix and match them together otherwise
they'll give me an error so for example
if i don't do this to your function on
answer i'll get an error that will say
can't convert into object to string
object or string implicitly cool save
it's meant boom you finish this section
planes hotels and automobiles when
taking a vacation it's very important to
know exactly how much you are going to
spend okay so they have a function
called wages which takes in an input
called hours and then it does eight
point three five times hours let's say
that our hourly hourly rate is equal to
eight point three five so we can just
you know just just for the sake of
clarity here write hourly rate times
hours will give you how much is your
wage okay so if you write a function
wage which is supposed to calculate your
how much money you make in a day or
however long of a period it's dependent
on information it's dependent on one
important information right it's
dependent on hours and i would like to
argue that this function should also be
dependent on your hourly rate right so
it should really be like so you give it
your hourly rate and your hours and then
it spits out something so for example
let me show you guys what i mean by this
gonna take this and I'm going to go here
and you guys should follow along and try
to use this wage calculator and do
something fun right so this is what I
always tell
my students or really whoever wants to
learn programming is don't just look at
this stuff do something with this
information so maybe build something
that helps you so I you know if you have
a job do something that will calculate
you know you just put in hours and
automatically calculates how much money
you make for so for instance I'm going
to create this function wages which
takes an hourly rate and then hours and
then it returns your wages or wage so
I'm going to say I'm going to call this
function with let's say hourly rate is
$20 an hour and you worked 15 hours and
it returns 200 okay just to keep it
simple if I have if I make $10 an hour
and I work for 10 hours boom okay and I
think we can also do this pass in
keyword arguments okay
so cool all right this is great let's
move oh sorry so they want us to create
a different function so I'm going to
leave this up here define a function
called hotel okay hotel cost with one
argument nights so already I'm thinking
the function is called hotel cost and
it's dependent on the nights so I'm
thinking if I give this hotel cause the
number of nights I lived here then it
will give me back the hotel cost okay so
that's generally how functions work you
name a function based on what it's
supposed to tell you and then you put in
as input information it requires to
calculate everything okay the hotel
costs um $140 per night so the function
of the total return 140 times nice okay
and to make it more readable I can say
per night is equal to 140 then I want to
do
or night great times nights okay so when
somebody's reading this code they're not
going to be like what is 140 where did
it come from they now know very clearly
that it's a night you know one night
rate okay cool
start next lesson all right getting
there you're going to need to take a
plane ride to get to your location okay
now before we do that they're giving us
an example of a function that does if
else if else else if and then else at
some point but else if yeah so the
function is called fruit color it takes
in an argument of fruit and if the fruit
was Apple it will return red if the
fruit was banana returns yellow else if
the fruit was pear it returns green so
we're going to take this function we're
going to go to our idle we're going to
paste it there and I'm gonna say fruit
color and I will say so the function is
called fruit color but in for an
argument it takes in a fruit okay so
we're going to give it Apple and you're
going to see it returned red now I'm
going to give it banana is going to
return yellow and if I give it pear to
turn screen okay that's how that works
okay below your existing code define a
function called plain right cost that
takes in a string city as input the
function should return a different price
depending on the locations similar to
the code example above below the valid
destinations and their corresponding
round-trip prices okay we have Tampa
Pittsburgh Los Angeles and all of that
so we're going to write some simple
evidence statements there are better
ways to do it for example using a
dictionary but for in our case we're
just going to use if 10 statements
so if city equal equal you know
Charlotte we are going to say return 183
elsif city is equal equal to Tampa turn
220 it doesn't matter if you put double
quotes or single quotes just as long as
you just remain consistent with it okay
all set
Pittsburgh I just like to put single
quotes because then I don't have to hit
shift every time I do it oh I did it the
other way City equal equal like that
return 222 else if City equal equal Los
Angeles return whoops
475 okay I think this should be good
okay that's fairly simple you're going
to need a rental car in order for you to
get there here they have they're showing
you how to use comparison operators if
score is greater than or equal to ten
then increment the score by fifty or
incremental tickets by fifty and if the
score is greater than or equal to seven
increment the tickets by twenty and then
return tickets so just to give you guys
what that means if I have a something
called tickets right and there are 50
tickets and let's say I want to
increment the variable tickets by ten so
after this line of code tickets should
actually be 60 and not 50 okay so a lot
of people will try this and that's what
I initially will try but if you go back
to the tickets you'll see that tickets
is still 50 so you haven't done your job
correctly how we actually increment the
value of ticket so the next time we
print our tickets it says 60 is like
this tickets is equal to what tickets
previously was plus ten okay now if you
do tickets you see it says 60 so this is
a pretty common operation okay now if I
the tickets again at 70 so tickets
equals
it gets +10 all right now
the shortcut since this is such a common
operation we have a shortcut for it in
our programming languages Python Java
C++ whatever so the shortcut here is
actually this plus equals now if I go
back to tick as you'll see it says 8080
if I do it again I go back to take as LC
right you'll see it says hundred now so
it's just the shortcut is plus equal
because it's such a common operation for
you guys
if you're new write it explicitly write
tickets is equal to tickets plus ten
okay and yeah make sure you write it
explicitly all right and then once you
really understand it and you can really
use it every single time correctly then
move on to the shortcut all right now
let's go on to what they're saying below
your existing code define a function
called define rental car cost with
argument days so I'm thinking already
that it will tell me the rental car cost
based on the number of days that I give
it okay
calculate the cost of renting car every
day you run the car costs $40 okay so
every day each day so day rate is equal
to 40 it's what I would say if you rent
the car for seven or more days you get
$50 off if days is seven or more
okay if Daisy is greater than or equal
to seven
then we are going to decrement or no no
no so I'm going to say total cost is
equal to nothing in the start and then
total cost minus equals fifty which is
the same thing as saying cost minus
fifty okay
total costs we're going to do daya rate
times days all right that should be your
total cost and then we're going to
subtract $50 from the total cost if the
rented days was greater than or equal to
seven okay and else if you rent the car
for three or more days you get $20 off
you cannot get both of the above
discounts meaning well meaning you
cannot get both it above this come so if
you actually did an if statement it'll
go
if blah blah blah give you a $50
discount and then it'll go on to this if
statement and then it'll say oh great
since okay let's say you rented the car
for ten days they'll give you the $50
discount and then we'll go to this
statement it'll say is days greater than
or equal to three it will say yes and
it'll give you a $20 discount as well
okay
so effectively what you want to be able
to do here is so if this part is true
the if condition stops elsif is a great
use case for that so if this is not true
then it's going to go and check if this
condition is true okay only if this
condition is not true so that's the
subtle difference between elsif or Elif
and if and at the end we simply return
cost so it returned total cost right
that's the variable we're using and this
should be good boom okay done good pull
it together
so
now you've got your three main cost
figured out let's put them in order and
use them find the total cost of your
trip okay so here there so there's just
give me an example to create a function
called double would just multiply
something by two then they create a
function called triple which takes in P
as input multiplies P by three so it
just multiplies on number by three and
then now they're showing you how you can
use both of the functions you define in
one main function so here in the
function called add they're using the
function double that's defined up here
and they're using the function called
triple its defined up there okay
below your existing code define a
function called trip costs so we're
going to use this function called trip
cost is really going to put everything
else in to perspective trip cost that
takes two arguments city and days like
the example above have your function
return the sum of calling the rental
card cost days hotel cost and okay so
what I'm going to do here is something
along the lines of this return rental
car cost and pass in the days we give it
plus hotel cost and the days that we
were there plus um plane ride cost and
that function takes in the city and
luckily we have the city right here it
is completely valid to call the hotel
cost nights function with the variable
days just like the example above okay
and this should really do the trick okay
well I'm gonna do is we're gonna play
around with this a little bit okay I
don't want you to do just everything the
code Academy tells you to do because
you're not going to truly understand it
so it's good to take some time out and
really play with it the more time you
spend like you know playing around with
this and not actually just doing the
code Kadim e the better you're gonna get
with programming you're gonna it's gonna
become more natural to you and you're
going to really understand these
concepts okay because understanding
these concepts is not Oh like check mark
I finished this section check mark I
know everything about functions I did
this I know everything about the math
operations it's really when you take out
the extra time and just do something for
fun for yourself it could be whatever
really so I'm going to why is it saying
invalid syntax if I paste it in my
terminal is invalid syntax yes it does
mmm why is it singing notes
um okay let's go to rappelled at it and
try it there because I it's really a lot
it's a lot more helpful to be able to
actually run this and practice it so
rebel that it does not complain right so
we have all these functions now let's
try using them okay for example let's
try using the hotel cost function
let's give it we stayed let's say we
went to France and we stayed there for
five nights and we're going to say print
hotel cost you can see seven hundred
dollars right five times 140 is seven
hundred okay now let's go to plane ride
cost and give it city so let's go to
print plane ride cost and we give it a
city and let's say we give it Pitts burg
okay and now if I run it you can see
that it says 222 right there okay
and how it figured it out is a - City
Charlotte it's that nope city's tampon
nope City is Pittsburgh it evaluated to
true and then it returned to 22 let's
use our third function rental car cost
which takes in the days let's give it 20
days and run this so really it's 40
times 40 times 20 that gave us 800 and
then it says 20 days is greater than 7
it subtract of 50 and that's how we got
750 right there okay
and the last function and let's put this
there so then when we use it we can see
that actually there's it's separated for
emitting everything else so this is
going to be our trip cost so trip cost
and for city we're going to give it Los
Angeles and for the number of days let's
say we stayed there for seven days so we
spent one week okay now try to figure
out before running this exactly what the
cost should be because that will prove
to you that you understand this
algorithm correctly and I'm just gonna
well I guess we can walk through it
together as well so seven days so it's
going to come here is going to put in
it's going to come to this function
right trip cost and to calculate the
rental car cost is going to put in seven
for where you see days right days right
here is going to put in that days into
this function rental car cost it's going
to go to the function rental car cost
put in seven right here right then it's
going to put in seven right here forty
times seven what does I give us I give
this to 80 it's going to go is seven
seven greater than or equal to seven
it's going to value it to true we're
going to get our $50 discount is going
to be 280 minus fifty or at 2:30 so far
is going to go to hotel so this is going
to be 230 it's going to go to hotel cost
function now hotel cost is going to pass
in days for this argument nights here
okay and since let's say we got seven is
going to put in seven right here which
is going to go up here and put seven
right there and it's going to put seven
right there 140 times seven gives you
980 okay
this whole thing is going to evaluate to
980 and then we have the plane ride cost
city it's dependent on the city so for
city we have Los Angeles okay that's
gonna it's going to be like this pretty
much it's going to go to the function
plane ride cost it's going to put in Los
Angeles it's going to find it nope it is
going to trigger note because Los
Angeles is not equal to Charlotte Los
Angeles is not equal to Tampa does not
equal to Pittsburgh is this true
yes it is so it returns 475 this whole
thing turns to 475 so effectively should
be 230 plus nine eighty plus 475 your
total evaluates to 1685 let's see if we
are correct here but that's the general
idea
okay maybe we couldn't be off but that's
the general idea so I'm going to write
down my assumption as 1685 it's a good
idea to walk through the algorithm by
yourself and let's run it trip cost
missing arguments okay so it should
really be seven like this I wrote it
incorrectly
okay 1685 did we get 1685 oh so you can
see that we nailed that one right we got
it perfectly but it's important
understand how all of this works
together we wrote three separate
functions and then at the end we wrote
one main function that uses the three
helper functions that we wrote and so
basically you never have to worry about
these three functions you only call this
one so your life is easier and other
functions figure out their things but
one important thing to note is each
function does one thing all right we're
not May putting everything together in
one place
right
it's called separation of concerns we're
separating out all of our
problem-solving to different functions
and then we put them together at the end
and that ultimately returned something
something hopefully accurate all right
so that was a lot hopefully some of that
makes made sense and as you can see we
did it correctly so we're going to hit
start next lesson hey you never know you
can't expect to only spend money on the
plane ride hotel rental car when going
on a vacation there also needs to be
room for additional costs like fancy
food or souvenirs so modify your trip
cost function definition add a third
argument called spending money modify
what the trip cost function does add the
variable spending money to the sum that
it returns okay plus we could be
spending a lot of money so that we also
have to take that into account so now
the trip cost is really dependent on the
city the number of days and spending
money okay I mean and that's how you
would literally define it in real life
like hey I'm going on a trip I might ask
you what do you think the cost is going
to be dependent on and you're probably
going to say well it depends what city I
go to how many days I stay there and how
much money I spend that's really what
you're telling the computer as well okay
so it's pretty natural but to describe
it I would think save and submit start
an X lesson plan your trip now nice work
now that you have it all together
let's take a trip what if we want to go
to Los Angeles for five days and brought
an extra six hundred dollars of spending
money so that's awesome because we
literally just did this right we opened
up our Idol not that guy Idol and we now
hold on I'm sorry we opened up our
rappelled IT and we literally did what
they are just about to have you do
except they put five days instead of Los
Angeles and they add
another argument called spending money
all right
so now they want us to effectively use
our functions right call them so I'm
gonna say a trip cost make sure to do
print here is Python too so I don't need
to put parentheses after the print
statement I'm gonna say Los Angeles I'm
going to say five and spending money six
hundred dollars and then we save and
submit and we get 1955 cool so that was
excellent I we went together and we
finished this thing right through now we
are on the next section okay let's go
back to the course page we just finished
taking a vacation we are on unit five
lists and dictionaries great job
seriously guys great job for making it
this far because I know it gets tough as
you go on and it's conceptually harder
there's also more work involved
but trust me because this is when it
starts to get fun and you can start to
do powerful things
I mean look down you can already do rock
paper scissors student becomes teacher
so being able to manage classes write
programs I can intelligently figure out
who got ABCD so you don't have to do
that and much more like make your own
games like battleship okay so we are
getting into the stuff that will make
you help you do really powerful things
so don't get discouraged now let's keep
plowing through it I will see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
