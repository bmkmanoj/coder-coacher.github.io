clever programmer calm so I got an email
and kind of bugged me I wanted to jump
on and talk with you guys about it like
I'm recording actually I'm in the middle
of recording my sequel course that I'm
making for you guys but it I think it's
important so I wanted to just jump at it
and talk with you guys about it right
away while it was like kind of while the
iron is still hot so to speak so so this
kid just emailed me you know like he
goes I can't take your course I can't
afford it I'm a broke 13 year old and so
I replied back to him and I said okay
that's I won't let you actually even buy
my course because I I know most of like
most students who are young don't have
the money and I don't want you to go in
debt trying to pay for the course
because how are you gonna actually learn
if you're worrying about having to pay
but what I did tell him is I hate words
like I can't write and that's what a lot
of people always say whether it's trying
to get an apartment or a car or trying
to hire somebody or trying to I don't
know whatever it is that you're trying
to do in life go out and play pool or
that's that's what I've been doing
recently so I always said pool go out to
a bar with friends and buy drinks
whatever it is using words like can't
just handicaps you because like what do
you mean you can't right so I responded
to him I said don't use words like can't
how about how about teach people
programming and you can charge people
who want to learn programming for you at
your at your school or anywhere near you
how about sell something that you don't
need like when I was younger I would
sell my video games or I don't know sell
sell some stupid hacky sack that I had
and something some of those things would
be three dollars some of those things
would be five dollars ten dollars
whatever and it started to add up and I
was able to afford things without having
to ask my parents because I don't know I
always just hated the idea of entitled
and I personally always hated just
asking for money or anything really I
just thought like it should really be
earned so you know if you want to do
that if you have the ego you know you
have the ego to not ask your parents or
anybody for help like that's good but
then also don't just handicap yourself
by saying things like you can't you know
I just never understand what that word
means like you know and I told him that
and then he responded back and he said I
wish people at my school wanted to learn
but all of them hates programming and so
then I said okay so just go somewhere
where people don't hate programming
actually want to learn and then or you
know then you can charge them and teach
them because that's what they need help
with so that's really the answer now I'm
assuming the next thing he's gonna say
is but I don't know where to find people
and then he's gonna stop at that
well how about go a little bit further
and actually start looking actively
where you can find people like that who
needs your help it always just gets to
you get an objection then question it
then go deeper then you get an objection
then question and then go deeper till
you get to the heart of it and you'll
realize most of the times the answer is
a lot simpler than you guys make it out
to be you guys just shut your brains
down to a possible solution and I'm
sorry I'm not saying you guys I do this
thing more than anybody else I should be
the first one to blame I'm just a little
bit passionate about I'm sorry for my
energy on this question but that's just
how I feel it's something that resonates
with me because I think I have been in
that kids boat for a long time and
that's why I'm I'm having this reaction
to reading that like when I was 12 years
old I remember we were trying to get
this game called command &amp;amp; Conquer
general zero hour and I don't know if I
should say this but we're trying to
download it BitTorrent and we got the
like back in those days the internet
sucked Internet was complete crap like
it was really bad so when you had to
download something it would take you
months to download something like now if
I tried to download something you'd be
very quick also now I don't use
BitTorrent because I started my own
business and I know how much it would
hurt me if nobody paid me and went
around it so out of that respect and
also I want these companies to do better
so then they can make better updates and
I can use their software in a better way
then I also get customer support and
whatever so whatever useless tangent
going back to the story I got the game
command &amp;amp; Conquer I'm sorry we didn't
get the game we didn't pay for it
we wanted to just download it okay it
was me and two of my brothers and they
were adults at this point okay we had
the money we had the money like nobody
doesn't have $50 especially if you're in
the United States okay but we just
wouldn't buy that game and we never
thought about how we could earn that
money to buy that game we never came up
we never brainstormed those solutions
but we brainstormed how can we save and
how can we like hack it and go online
and all these crazy places and download
a crack from here and download a key
were keygen generator from here and make
it all work and make the dot DLL files
work and really went through crazy pain
waited over one and a half months to get
the game and the game that I was
probably most passionate about in my
entire life once I got I didn't even
care I did not even care like I had lost
my passion for it so guys I like if
you're gonna take something away from
this just please like don't use words
like I wish because you can and you
don't have to wish and you don't have to
dream you don't have to live in a fairy
tale land whatever it is that you gotta
get or you want you know you don't have
to sacrifice your child's education
because you think you can't afford it if
you just stop for us if you just turn
that switch off for a second the cants
the word that can't and you just go
deeper and instead of going I can't
afford it - how can I afford it you'll
be able to take your child to a better
school where they can get a higher
quality education you'll be able to take
yourself out to a party spend lavishly
have a good time
I don't know whatever whatever things
are important to you guys you'll be able
to do a lot of them without having to
hold back in everything in life like I
would go to college I would go to UIC
and a lot of my friends they weren't
even like I liked playing pool I like
going bowling there I liked eating there
I liked going to the gym there but they
couldn't come to play pool with me
because they didn't have them the money
and they never thought to themselves how
can I make more money they just would
say I don't have the money I can't
afford it and when I will tell them how
you can make more money they would just
shut me out like for whatever reason and
some of us would go to play pool but the
only friends who were coming to do that
were the ones who already had a job or
whatever then another thing that they
would have difficulty with is if we try
to go to the gym because they're not
paying for the gym membership and
because they don't want to spend money
to eat there so it's like all these
constraints and all these things that
they're kind of just giving away in
their life and I don't know that's just
like I don't know I just don't think
it's the right way and he actually just
responded he said okay I'm problem
you're eating it alive so I don't know
how this is gonna go or what I'm gonna
say but finding someone at my school
that wants to learn how to program is
hard I know some year ten I know some
year 10 students I want to learn
programming but I'm really shy and there
most likely won't pay me also I'm still
learning Python and don't know what to
teach if I find someone that wants to
learn okay now we're getting somewhere
let's talk about it I love it I love it
learning okay now we're getting
somewhere
he says he's shy and they most likely
won't pay him so a little little bit of
it is now about self-esteem okay
so shy and they're most likely won't pay
me I don't know what to teach that's an
impostor syndrome I've talked with you
guys about it so a lot of people have
that I don't know what to teach well I
don't know if I'm an expert can I teach
it guys I'm right here I'm the living
example of this the living example I am
I don't have 30 years of experience I
don't have 20 years of experience I
haven't worked with Google I haven't
worked with Microsoft but I am here I
help you guys out I am able to make you
guys learn fast enough and that's good
enough for me and that's good enough for
you
so for him it's the same way he doesn't
need to be the ultimate expert right
like he could teach somebody who's just
a little bit behind him now the fact of
finding that person but his other
objections I'm shy and the most likely
won't pay me okay so that's another one
of those things that happens to people
they just think that they shouldn't be
paid or they don't deserve to be paid
enough or they're shy and they just have
these presumptions that people won't pay
them look again if somebody has a pain
and you're off if you have pain you're
getting a headache you might go to the
for CVS pharmacy and buy Advil right
just like that somebody is actually
having trouble and you can actually
legitimately help them right well why
wouldn't they pay you like like if they
don't have money okay I understand but
it makes sense if they really want if
they want to learn and you can help them
like they'll pay you right so that's
again one of those things and shy and
most like like that's something I want
to talk with you guys about more this
video is getting longer maybe I'll just
stop it here because I'm gonna go back
to making the sequel course but this
part kind of irks me shy and most likely
won't pay me like
it really comes down to the
psychological aspect of it even even
with jobs when they give you a choice to
ask for money and ask for more money
like people are actually physically they
have pain they did some study and they
found out that the physical pain that
you have when you get a lot of emotional
pain the same pain center in your brain
the one that the text physical pain and
gives you alarm that same thing kind of
goes off in your brain so some people
when they're asking for money or trying
to charge they go through that and they
have that pain so when they ask people
how much do you want us to pay you most
of the times most of the people will
automatically give a much much much much
lower price than what's expected so
understand that you know like if you
understand what you're worth and how you
can help other people and how much help
they're getting from you put yourself in
their shoes and imagine if I was getting
this much help I would be willing to pay
so now that I'm helping this person
doesn't it make sense that I should be
paid for what I do
I mean people make caricatures for
people charging $300 an hour $250 an
hour those people just our hobby is like
one thing I want you guys to do is
really brainstorm and think about all
the things that you pay for all the
services all them maybe magazine
subscriptions Netflix like are those
things really that useful like his
Netflix really that useful you still pay
for it
does it it gives you enjoyment so it
solves a problem right that's why you
pay for it in this case it's solve
somebody's problem of learning and
that's why they pay for it
right so yeah I'm probably gonna
continue having a discussion with my
good friend here and yeah okay guys
thank you guys for watching I am going
to stop this and I will go back to
making the sequel sequel course which
you should go check out because it's
going to be awesome
alright guys I love you guys so much
thank you for watching I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
