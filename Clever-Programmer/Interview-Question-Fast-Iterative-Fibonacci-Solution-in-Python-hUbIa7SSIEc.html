so in this video I'm going to talk about
how to write a very fast and iterative
solution to the Fibonacci problem now if
you're at a job interview and they don't
care whether you write a recursive
function or a regular function and they
give you okay go ahead and write
Fibonacci please don't write it
recursively because that is the naive
solution of this problem the way you
want to write it is the fast iterative
way that I'd like to show you now this
way is also you know you can see it on
Stack Overflow and it's one of the most
popular and the best ways to write it so
it's very useful if you learn this
initially you might have to memorize it
but if you practice it enough times
you'll start getting the hang of how
this solution works so let's get started
so I'm going to say I'm gonna define a
Fibonacci of n okay
and we're gonna say that in the start
I'm gonna have some variable called a
and B and I'm gonna set their values to
0 and 1 so remember those two values are
given right 0 and 1 and then every
valley after that is just the sum of the
previous two so we're gonna use pythons
multiple assignment operation here and
the swapping value to you write a very
elegant solution
it's very pythonic so we're going to use
some beautiful Python code and some
Python built-in tricks to write this ok
so now what I want to do is I want to
run my I want to write a for loop that
basically keeps adding values keep
summing the previous two terms so my
code is going to run the same number of
times as the term that you're looking
for so if you're looking for the fifth
term is gonna run five times so here I'm
gonna write my loop and I'm going to say
is be a comma B is equal to B comma and
here's the cool way I'm going
show you so let's move this so this
takes it makes use of some of pythons
built-in elegance you know the
assignment operators and the swapping of
the values you can't really do this in
another language you're gonna need
something called a temporary variable if
you're using C or Java or something like
that so here what I'm effectively saying
is B is now the previous term and the
new term is the sum of the previous two
terms okay so if we wanted to make a run
through this we would effectively say
okay I come down here B is 1 and a plus
B in this case would be 0 plus 1 and you
will get 1 okay and that's a third term
so this is gonna always be the third
term and this is always going to be the
second to last term okay so a plus B
this is the last last term and this B is
the second to last term all right and at
the end I'm just gonna say a return a so
remember a is what we need to return at
the end now I'm gonna run this solution
okay okay so now I'm going to run my
code here all right so I'm gonna say
Python and basics that py oh whoops it's
not going to return anything I gotta add
a print print statement here I'm gonna
say oops Fibonacci of let's say 2
all right I got one that's good so let
me just write the Fibonacci terms here
so you guys can recall how they work and
each one is some of the previous to do
so here three plus five gives it gives
you eight right here zero comma one
so here zero plus one gives you one one
plus two gives you three two plus three
gives you five
so each last term is a sum of the
previous two and here you're gonna see
that my code is gonna work so I'm gonna
go and ask for the fifth term what's the
fifth term this is the first second
I'm sorry zeroth first second third
fourth and fifth
so fifth should give me five so let's
run it and oh I have to save it first
almost run it again and I'm getting back
five okay and if I said give me the
sixth term is gonna give me back eight
all right so my code is working here and
you can see this is a very simple
solution it's very beautiful it's very
pythonic and this is the way that you
should write this solution when you're
at a job interrview UK or if you're
applying for programming boot camps or
whatnot because a lot of the times
you're gonna get a question like this
they're gonna try to understand if not
only you know how to write functions and
algorithms but how efficiently you can
write them so the iterative way is the
way that I think you should approach
this thank you for watching and I'll see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
