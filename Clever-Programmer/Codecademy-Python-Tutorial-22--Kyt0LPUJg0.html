clever programmer calm welcome to
another episode of code Academy Python
tutorial series this is part 21 so I'm
really bad with this numbers thing it's
actually part 22 so where did we leave
off last time we left off covering wild
loops okay and we covered all of this
all the way up to your own else while
and we finished all of that so let's go
just take a little peek at our course
page
just check where we are oh they change
that on us while we were in the middle
of working on it they changed the entire
interface on us so here it is here are
the loops and we are 42 percent of this
and we're past the 60 percent barrier
nice let's click on this loops and let's
keep going so now we're going to work
with four loops
I enjoy four loops much more than while
loops I did used to like while loops a
lot till I started using for loops a lot
and now I just enjoyed them most of the
times you can use for loops and they are
easier to work with and they will do
what you want to do also a lot of the
times with wild loops you have to be
careful and make a condition that stops
for four loops that's never the case you
have to give it that thing to stop and
here we just say run ten times this is
pretty much saying that because range
ten gives you this list right we've
talked about how range is a function
that generates a list on the fly so it
gives you this I is zero the first time
right eyes or the first time then it's
one then it's two and it prints out zero
one two three four five six seven eight
each time
so let's go back and then as soon as it
runs out of the list that stops right so
they want us to make sure that we print
out ten so here
what do they want us to do make the loop
print the numbers from 0 to 19 instead
of 0 to 9 so it should desert in 19
which means that I should really do 20
because 0 is included because we start
from 0 and 20 is excluded but 19 is
included right we go up to 20 but not
including 20 that's the general
convention and here we have counting 0
to 19 perfect for your hobbies this is
this kind of loop is useful when you
want to do something a certain number of
times such as a pen something to a list
so again 4 loops are really useful we
keep looping through keep appending the
thing to the list and that word list
keeps getting bigger so we're gonna keep
appending things so I can do create a
for loop the prompts user for happy
three times an depends each one of those
hobbies okay they want us to get our
hands dirty now so they want us to do
something so we're going to say um
alright so hobby is equal to raw input
what is your favorite right what is or
what is one of your what is your hobby
what are your hobbies sorry I'm I'm
really caring about the user interfaces
what is your hobby so let's just make it
simple
and we got that so that'll give us a
string and then what we want to do is we
want to ask us three times so that'll be
a part of for loop for I in range three
because we already know we need to run
three times are we going to use this I
know so I'm just going to make it that
underscore because I don't think we're
going to be using that variable we just
want to run this loop three times and
I'm going to say hobbies dot append
hobby okay and then ultimately I can say
print hobbies what is your hobby hobby
is soccer another hobby is lifting and
what is another hobby
let's see I went skydiving but that's
not a hobby because I did it once and it
was pretty fun
scary at the same time that was two
months ago
that was amazing hmm let me think of
another good hobby that I like to do so
I have also started shih tzu that's been
amazing I love it let's put that and
here you got that list soccer lifting
jiu-jitsu this U is ignored by Python
it's just there to show you
for some reason python - does it Python
3 does not do this okay so just ignore
that you like it doesn't exist create a
for loop okay cool
for your strings using a for loop you
can print out each individual character
in a string you've already seen this so
thing is equal to spam for seeing thing
print see so better way to say it for
letter right so now they want us to do
it add a second for loop so that each
character in word is printed out so I
would say for character in word print
character or I would say letter in word
letter is simpler I will usually use
letter letter and word
print letter let's run it let's check it
out let's see what happens and you got
exactly what we expected that you would
get right spam exclamation mark the
first loop right here and then the
second loop ran and we got eggs and
exclamation mark right that's what we
expect it to happen okay for your a
string manipulation is useful in for
loops if you want to modify some content
and string so sometimes you want to
change a string okay let's see so here
they're just simply teaching showing you
how to access each character in the word
and print it out the example prints out
M the first time a RB le okay
and here they'll show you the comma
character after our print state it means
that our next print statement keeps
printing on the same line so this is a
nice little trick you can do to print
everything on the same line okay so if I
go here paste it does this actually work
in Python 3 mmm doesn't look like it but
apparently in Python 2 it works right so
let me check that same loop in Python 2
what why not it word is equal to marble
for a car in word print car comma okay
so in Python 2 you can just put a comma
at the end of it and then it'll print it
all in the same line okay
what would I do to print it out
separately well one thing that's coming
to my mind is I would turn it into a
list of lists of a word so that
separates it out like this and then I'd
call dot join but I would say join it by
one space and now
go like this that's just how I would do
it because I'm cool like that then i can
write print in front of it and you can
do it too when you're that cool all
right
um our next print statement keeps
printing on the same line let's filter
out the letter A from our sting do the
following for each character in the
phrase mmm filter out the letter A from
the string so it's just a bird in the
hand not a bird in the head do the
following for each car character in the
phrase if the character is an A or a
character is an A print X instead of
character make sure to include the
trailing comma okay so for character
whoops in phrase if character equal
equal and a here I'll do a little trick
but let's not get fancy let's just do it
simple if the character is capital A or
character is small a the trick that I
did is just make the character in small
or lowercase and then just check it that
way or make it all in uppercase and
check it out so it would be simpler so
if the character is either capital a so
big a or small a replace it with an X so
print X otherwise instead of character
make sure to include the trailing comma
right so here we want to use it like
Python 3 and it include the trailing
comma and then what we want to say is
print character otherwise so or else
right if that's not the case c.x bird in
X H X and D right everywhere it sees oh
a case they do want also for us to
change it to a small if it was a small e
so this is then the correct way today
okay cool we did it nice alright we just
had to put the trailing commas to make
sure everything was on the same line
okay cool next lesson for your list
perhaps the most useful and most common
use of for loops is to go through a list
right we've done a lot of that but
they're going to give us more practice
cool on each iteration the variable num
will be the next value in the list so
the first time through it will be 7 then
it'll be 9 then it'll be 12 so this
variable here right we've done plenty of
practice with this in our previous
videos so if you have but just to recall
if this is the list right numbers is
actually that list first time num is
going to be 7 it's going to print out 7
shoot it up into the screen into the
terminal then num the variable num will
be 9 ill save print 9 i'll shoot it out
to the screen then it'll be 12 this will
be 12 or shoot out to the screen I think
you get the idea
then it gets done 99 I'll print it out
and after that it says the loop is over
because it automatically detects it has
reached the end of the loop or an end of
the list write a second here it says and
then the loop will exit when there are
no more values in the list write a
second for loop that goes through the
numbers listen prints each element
squared on its own line so again I
thought we've done this but ok cool
let's it's good to do more practice oh
they want us to do it on a separate line
so we're going to say for num in number
prints numb square okay all of it on its
online okay that's what they want so
let's see what is 99 squared it is 9801
which is what we get here and then after
that we get none which means everything
is over let's see this for your lists
okay
which partner Rhea step up your fours
nice so we just finish our video on the
entire on the loops on all our four
loops okay
so again that's a great one practice the
four loops more okay use that to
practice the four loops take this time
to practice your four loops just like in
the last section I told you to practice
the while loops I would make this video
longer about the usual 30 minutes
however these concepts are so key the
loops while loops and for loops that I
think that you need to go and practice
them one good place you can go to is w3
resource comm for Python exercises okay
and you can simply choose the data tight
like kinds of exercises you want right
so for example do you want basic
exercises string the ones with lists so
here I would choose these one Python
data types list 34 exercises which
solutions so you can then check the
solution simply click on the exercise
and go okay write a program to sum all
the items in the list can you do that if
you can great write out the program if
you can't great all so go ahead and
write out the program then it's perfect
because now you get to practice and
learn it only if you fail after trying
at least for one hour 30 minutes or one
hour then go and look up the answer for
me when I was starting at programming it
would take me I would be stuck on a
problem
for weeks okay and I tried to never
almost look at the answer which is
probably not the best way to do it
because you can be like pulling your
hair out and going crazy however I get
obsessive when I fall in love with
something so I just truly enjoyed it but
you know if you started getting you know
your own frustration levels if you start
to get frustrated go and look at the
solution and I hope you learn it so here
it is test out your for-loop knowledge
here I'm going to stop the video right
here okay this is Kazi from clever
programmer calm you just finished
watching code counting Python tutorial
number 21 we covered for loops next
video we will be talking about
dictionary and how to use for loops in
dictionaries okay that's going to be
another important key concept key value
pair remember that alright enough of the
lame jokes this is the end of the video
please like it or subscribe I love you
guys I will see you in the next video
code Kadim your path on tutorial number
22 number 22 I mean number 23 that's the
one you guys should get excited for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
