is Kazi from clever programmer common in
this video we're going to tackle the US
states challenge so now we have
completed all of the challenges in the
string challenges section so lower case
all the way through abbreviate or
challenge or you should have completed
it if you didn't that's okay just follow
along from here okay and then later you
can go back and do the other ones and
then after this we have just three more
two more challenges left after this one
okay so we're almost at the finish line
now in this challenge it's going to have
to do with United States States okay
hence US states challenge and basically
how it works is just like a dictionary
it's like a lookup okay so you give me a
state like NC and I give you back North
Carolina if you give me a CA I give you
back California what happens if I give
you il you give me back ill annoy if
you're not in United States and you
won't notice at the top of your head but
you know US has 50 states and each state
has like an acronym two letters long and
that turns into like bigger like NY is
going to be New York so you could you
basically what you would have to do is
create a giant dictionary right with key
value pairs that's what you would have
to do so for example you would create
something called States like a
dictionary like this and you would say
and Y : New York okay and then how you
would use that is you would say States
and you would index it by NY and what
this would return is New York okay kind
of like that now if we had this
dictionary be bigger and have more
elements in it it would look like you
know it would have another key called ca
and then the value of this key would be
California okay just like that so now if
I take this I put it in my command line
right so I open up let's send my command
line I go into Python I paste that
dictionary it's not getting pasted okay
there it is I pasted that dictionary I
do States now if I do States and Y what
you'll notice is it gives me back New
York exactly what we wanted and I'll do
States and then I'll do CA this time it
gives us back California cool okay so
now that we have both of our states we
would just have to repeat this process
for all of the 50 states but as you know
that that could take up a lot of typing
or a lot of copy pasting even if you go
to something like Wikipedia so what did
it for us which is very nice of them I'm
going to comment this out is they create
another file it's called us dot py okay
and this file has basically a long
dictionary called States and it has the
key value pairs for all the states so
for example a K is Alaska al is Alabama
AR is Arkansas and then if you keep
going down the same way right and then
we see NY is New York and if I search
for il which is right here il Illinois
boom done okay so what we're going to do
is we're going to leverage the
dictionary that they gave us so here we
say from US imports states so what that
basically means is now we have access to
the variable states and when we do
states we get back this this variable
States that's it okay but the reason why
we put it in another file is so it's
easier for us to see our code in this
file there as it'll get too messy like
for example I can copy it and just paste
it in here but you can see like it just
takes up a lot of space so it's not
really necessary and plus we're learning
how to import files which is an amazing
thing to learn and it's it makes your
magician encoding because you can use
other people's libraries and other
people's existing code to make it work
with your own and you don't
you can basically build on the shoulders
of giants
okay so let's go down here and figure
out what the answer is so at this point
try pausing the video and see if you can
come up with a solution whatever
solution you come up with put it in the
comments below and if you're on YouTube
click the link below so you can go onto
my website code it up in there and then
post your solution in the comment
section below and then I'll take a look
at it and right now I'm just going to go
through and show you the answer I'm
going to work through it live so I'll
figure it out with you so if you didn't
try it try it right now okay let's go
through the answer now okay so how would
I do it um I think it would be very
simple I will say okay so if you give me
a breviary I just have to pass it as an
index so like for example States
abbreviation right so if you give me NC
and you pass NC to that giant dictionary
it'll go and it will find NC let's see
NCS right here North Carolina and then
it'll just print out this value that's
how dictionaries work if you index it by
the key you get back the value all right
so that's what I'm going to do I'm just
going to do states here oops and I think
that should work I think that's that
should be the solution now let's try
running and let's see what happens I get
back North Carolina in California here
it says that if I do NC I should get
back North Carolina and we do NC and we
do indeed get back North Carolina so as
far as we are concerned we have solved
this challenge okay beautiful job that's
it for this video guys if there are any
questions put them in the comments below
I'll jump in there and somebody or
somebody else will to help you out but
hopefully you're following these
challenges so far my new course called
create apps with Python comes out this
June 26th okay so with these new skills
that you got from doing these challenges
you're now ready to be able to create
apps
real-world apps that you can put into
the hands of other people so then they
can use it as well and you can land your
first client with Python because my goal
is to start getting you paychecks with
Python ok so that's it for this video
guys as always I love your guys faces
off see the link for the new course sign
up for the waiting list of that course
you're the first one to join that's it
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
