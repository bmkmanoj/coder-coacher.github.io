from clever programmer calm and in this
video we're going to talk about how you
can become a freelance software
developer and you can start to charge
$100 an hour without needing a positive
week so without any further ado let's
jump right into it
so first of all let's start off with one
of the really important things why you
actually need a college degree so a
college degree generally is needed
because you need to have something that
you can show but if you don't have a
college degree you need to have
something else to show in place for it
right that's the number one primary
reason why most people actually work so
hard to pursue that degree and a lot of
people doesn't matter how old you are if
you're going for that college degree
it's to basically say hey I don't have
any other experience to show for it but
I'll show you my college degree now
there are alternatives to this meaning
that if you can prove your worth to
somebody else you don't need to show
them you have a college degree they
frankly don't even care so for some
companies it's experience and as a
freelance developer it's not even
necessarily experience it's you being
able to prove to somebody else you can
develop a software for them that can
help them grow their business so if it's
a startup you're working for maybe they
need an application and you're using a
framework like Django in Python to
develop a web application well you can
simply build them an application and
make sure that it's something that they
want that's something that they can use
and if it's generating them more money
by you providing your skillset then they
don't care that clever programmer one of
the things that we need is to create a
companion app for all the stuff that you
know I teach you guys so I have
programming courses and Python and I
want to make it really easy for you so I
might actually hire out a developer to
make an app for me and if they have any
experience in creating apps and we have
like a live interview and they can just
show me that they can create it
and it's something that could actually
be scaled to all of the students right
because right now we have over 10,000
students at clever programmer so if we
can create that app and you guys can use
it well as a business clever programmer
will instantly be making more money and
for me to pay the software developer
it's something that's very easy so if
the developer charges $100 an hour and
he takes 5 10 or 15 or 20 hours to make
the thing which is $2,000 if my return
on investment on that is like let's say
$10,000 or even let's say $5,000 I mean
do I care
Ping's a developer $2,000 no it's a
matter of triviality at that point right
that's how we're meets 80 would say if
somebody I follow and you can look them
up and he teaches you like lots of ways
you can earn a higher income so
ultimately the point is being able to
prove your worth to somebody else
whether it's through a college degree or
it's through different projects or you
being able to convince somebody else
that you can actually help them and
provide them value right so by value
what I mean is getting them a result
that they care about and that they want
for most businesses and most people who
are hiring you think you think it from
their perspective
they're not necessarily looking for a
beautiful website most people are
looking for you know the reason behind
why they want a website which is to
generate more business for them so using
your programming knowledge if you can
put something together for them that
they can sell right or they can use it
to bring in new leads new customers
leads just means somebody who you know
you you have their contact information
and they're interested in either your
services or your product and if they can
use it then turn those people into
customers they're happy for example
let's say that you want to build a
website for a photographer well how
would you go about it
would you just pitch it to them like hey
I have my college degree you're a
freelancer for for photography just hire
me well in that case they might not even
care they're like hey yeah that's cool
you have a college degree and all but I
don't know how that's really applicable
to me but now let's say you you reframe
this you go up to that same photographer
and you say hey so I noticed that each
person whose information that you get
out of every ten people one of those
people becomes your customer is that
right and then they're like yeah that's
actually right how much is that one
client or customer worth to you and
freelance photographer might be like two
thousand dollars right or so you're like
okay so one client to you is worth two
thousand dollars and they're like yes so
then you're like okay so out of ten
people if one person gives you two
thousand dollars then what's the average
on those ten people right so let's
that's simple let's divide two thousand
by ten and we should get something like
two hundred right so that means that
each new lead or each new you know
person who's interested in that
freelancer is essentially worth two
hundred dollars to that right so now
imagine you're a Python developer and
you needed to put together a website for
them it could be a simple website so you
could even go to them and just say hey
I'm going to put a simple website
together for you now if you are helping
them generate let's instead of ten new
leads or potential customers let's say
you're helping them get 50 new customers
or you know leads per month
how much is that worth to them right out
of 50 people if five people give that
freelancer photographer business now
that freelance photographer instead of
making $2,000 now he has five people per
month he's making $10,000 per month
right
so could you safely charge that
freelancer five thousand dollars to put
together a website that gets business
for him right and it could convince that
photographer this or show him this then
it's that he doesn't care and you're
able to make five thousand dollars you
can frankly name your price so saying
100 dollars an hour as a freelance
software developer is an understatement
but I just have to do that so when I'm
making this video it doesn't sound like
scammy right
it doesn't sound too unrealistic but
this is very possible so as a freelancer
you need to think of yourself as a
business and all the people that you get
think of them as a client right let's
think of think of each person not as
like your employer or whatever they're
just each of them are your client and
the beautiful thing here is that you can
fire your clients in a lot of the times
firing 70 to 80 percent of your clients
and focusing on only some of the premium
ones and then at giving them more
services can actually increase your
income and you don't have to deal with a
lot of people who are like nagging at
you right or you don't like dealing with
so that's another beauty of a freelancer
software developer because you're you
it's not like if you go to that
nine-to-five job and you don't like it
you just kind of stuck there doing one
thing here's you can choose and create
your own path and kind of name your
price
and the smarter you can think like a
business then you have infinite growth
and the great thing is you can turn into
an agency over time but in the start you
know one step at a time the first step
is getting that one client so don't just
say okay I just have this one really
cool skill and I can help you I'm just a
cool painter so I'm just going to paint
or I'm a cool designers I'm just going
to do designing think of it how you can
help them earn more business and then
frame it from that perspective they're
much more likely to hire you and
honestly you could even charge way more
than $100 an hour right because if you
can deliver somebody results you can put
together that website for that freelance
photographer right that's not even a
business just that freelance
photographer example that I was talking
about earlier
and that website takes you let's say an
hour or two hours to put together you
can charge $5,000 and it's not tied to
your hourly income it's tied to the
result you're providing them if that's
how you can start to break away from
that hourly mindset and start to go into
higher profits because you're giving
better results right you're selling a
result so with all of that to summarize
think of yourself as a business
everybody else is a client working as a
freelancer is actually safer than
working at a job because a job is just
one client whereas if you have 20
different clients you can even choose to
fire someone you don't like to work with
you have flexibility to work remotely
you can you have flexibility to do work
with whoever you want and basically
however much income you need you can
increase the number of clients you get
and as a bonus tip if you are you know
in college or using some form of
learning you know going to school
that's one resource right
that's not your the only place this like
when you're at a job you think the job
is the only place you can go and get an
income you can go to a job and still
have you know freelance and gigs on the
side to earn an extra income just like
that if you're actually learning like
from a college you can use other
resources to learn as well and you don't
have to treat college just like that one
resource and you can't learn from
anywhere else alright so hopefully this
gives you some perspective of how it's
actually possible to generate $100 an
hour or even more as a freelancer
software developer right I just give you
a very simple example and it doesn't
even require all that complicated
knowledge the example I gave you is
literally being able to charge a ton of
money just for building a website for
somebody right but now think of as a
Python developer you're offering much
more custom solutions to a company and
these custom solutions can be like
providing them with actionable data
analytics proving to somebody that hey
you know based on how much traffic
you're getting and how much conversion
you have if you change this one thing
you'll improve your growth tremendously
for example somebody helped me a Python
developer they did some data analytics a
clever programmer and they were able to
tell me that hey if you focus more on
creating better videos for people or if
you focus more on you know giving people
an offer that's better for them can
actually help you in your business and
it has helped me you know at kelabra
programmer because I'm able to help
people in a better way and that data
insight that they gave me was actually
super actionable for me and something
that I immediately started to get
results from that way for you you know
as a Python developer because you're
offering such customized solutions you
could charge even higher than that so
hopefully this makes sense
shoot me in comments below if you guys
have any more questions about this I'd
love to jump in and answer that for you
for now this is this guys thank you guys
so much for watching and as always I
love your faces off and I'll see you in
