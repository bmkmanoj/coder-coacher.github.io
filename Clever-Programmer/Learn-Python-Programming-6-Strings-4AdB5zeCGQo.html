about variables you can see some basic
examples I stored all this information
in the variable Bob and then as soon as
I typed in Bob I got back all of Bob's
information just a quick thing I want to
say before I continue if any of you are
having problems downloading and
installing this Python stuff that I've
shown you if you're on Windows or Mac or
any other system I want to show you a
quick I want to really quickly show you
a website where you can get all of this
information or you can pretty much do
everything we've been doing right on
here the website is called shrinky IO
okay and here's how it works so on the
right hand side you can see that if I
run all of this code it draws all of
that stuff okay
and they have a bunch of great examples
for you guys to try out so you can go to
Python and you can discover a bunch of
great examples that you can do okay so
for example you can look at this example
here and maybe get an idea of how to
make some really cool shapes using the
turtle module in Python okay so let's
stop there code and let's start our so
if I do import turtle here and I do my
turtle or you know you can call it
really whatever you want you can call it
my John if you want is equal to turtle
turtle and if I say my john dot forward
100 and I run this invalid object has no
okay i misspelled turtle here run it and
you can see that it draws a turtle going
forward now let me bring back their code
and let's do it so for example where it
says black here let's write blue okay
pen color background color that is you
see we change the background color so
that's a good way to see what this stuff
is doing you can change this color too
orange maybe and see what that does okay
so the first turtle that gets drawn is
actually being drawn by an orange color
okay so great place to come and try out
stuff okay
shrink it dot IO now back going back to
learning about strings so let's go over
here and strings is literally the exact
thing that you type okay
so let's say I wanted to say hello world
if I did print hello world I would get
back an error and the error would say
invalid syntax I don't know what you
mean
so let's try to type it in the Python 3
way where you have to put a parenthesis
after print because print is something
called a function which we will cover it
later so let's try hello like this and
hit enter and you can see the error I
get it says hmm name hello is not
defined so it has no idea what you're
talking about when you write hello here
it's looking for the variable hello we
have the variable Bob here we have the
variable X but we never defined variable
hello but you're like no that's not what
I'm trying to tell it I'm trying to tell
it to exactly like say hello not some
variable hello that might have some mom
numbers in it or something like that
right it's not like you're doing hello
is equal to 5 and then printing out
hello and it gives you 5 well in the
case in this case if you want to say
exactly what you wanted to say you have
to use something called a string so that
just simply means putting that thing in
quotes so now Python goes oh you want me
to say exactly hello like this and
they'll say hello now let's say I wanted
to say print hello a world right if I do
space here it's just going to give me a
nerd it's going to be like a variable
with a space in between a variable I
have no idea what you mean so now if you
put both of these in quotes I'll go oh
you want the string that literally says
hello world exactly like that I
understand I got you let me do it for
you okay simple enough cool
that's it four strings I'm going to keep
it really simple I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
