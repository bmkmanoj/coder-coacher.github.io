challenges series and we are doing hour
of Python we just got done doing one of
the dictionary challenges called us
States challenge you should have
completed all of the string challenges
so far in this video we are going to
tackle the Morse code challenge so Morse
code basically what they want you to do
is you know read this for yourself I
will put this in the link below
but essentially what they want you to do
is turn it into code so this is
something that the military I don't know
if they still use Morse code but they
used to use Morse code to encrypt
information and then only the other
person who had the decryption key would
understand the message the beauty of
this is that if somebody was sending a
message to another person and that
person was intercepted in the middle
their message would still mean nothing
to the person who intercepted them
that's the whole point of encryption and
that's what happens when also you know
when you're on Amazon and you're trying
to purchase something your card
transaction goes through but what
happens is your information is encrypted
so if there was somebody in the
something called man-in-the-middle
attacks which is somebody who is in the
middle and taps into your home network
or whatever even if they intercept the
data your card information isn't like
naked like your entire card number with
your name it's encrypted so it looks
like jumbled up code and since they
don't have the decryption key the person
who attacked you they have no idea what
that garbage means so it's useless
information to them okay
that's essentially the idea so this is a
very basic simple encryption that we're
going to be doing here and it's going to
be called Morse code encryption very
simple algorithm but you can imagine
that people have spent years in this
field doing research and this is
something that our banks today run on
there's something that Amazon and
Netflix and literally every website ever
uses this is how your cookies are stored
this is
how you store your information and login
with your password the same reason
Google doesn't actually know what your
password is they just know it in then
crypt a jumbled up form so this is
something that we use every single day
and you deal with every single day and
it's encryption so and we're doing the
most basic form of it so it's a lot of
fun so let's jump right into it now what
I want you to do is give this challenge
of try this might be pretty tricky for
you especially since you might be new to
dictionaries if you have some experience
with dictionaries you don't really give
this a try this will test your skills so
pause the video and give it a try okay
hopefully you have given it a try now so
jump back into it and now we'll try to
solve it together okay all right so
there's another file called Morse again
if you had to write this giant
dictionary right this is one big
dictionary it opens with squiggly
brackets and it goes all the way down
till here and basically how dictionaries
work is you have a key and a value and a
key and a value so if I put an A it
gives me this if I put in B it gives me
this the nice thing is you don't have to
remember all of this you just have to
remember a and the computer remembers
what the code for a is so what do we
have to do well when we have the word
like Z right we know how to Morse code Z
basically what we can just say is like
prints okay what is called Morse Morse
underscore code and then we can index it
by Z and what this will give us back is
simply the Morse code of Z so it'll give
us back - - and a dot dot just like that
okay so this is effectively what we are
trying to do here except you want a
Morse code an entire word so what
happens if I give you a word like
trinket right what happens if I give you
a word like trinket well isn't that just
you get the Morse code for T then you
get the Morse code
for our then you get and then you add it
to the Morse code of T then you get the
Morse code of AI then you add it to the
Morse code of T and R then you get the
Morse code of n then you added to the
Morse code of TR and I and so on and so
forth right and then when you get the
Morse code for the letter let alas T at
the end you append it right which means
adding something to the end append
prepend is adding something to the front
so when you get the last T what you're
going to do is you're going to append it
to the Morse code of T followed by the
Morse code of our eye and so on and so
forth although at the end okay so it's
just going to look like a bunch of
hyphens and dots okay so well how do we
do that well that's why God made for
loop right made it really simple for you
you just run through it and then you
just keep appending to a string so I'll
show you what I mean so we'll say for a
letter in string okay so if you give us
a string like trinket we will loop
through it a letter will be T the first
time or the next time so on and so forth
and what I'm going to say is Morse code
let's create a final string so this is
what we're going to return at the end
and we'll make this empty and then what
we'll say is final string plus equals or
yeah plus equals or if you don't know
plus equals and this is what it looks
like Morse code of that letter okay so
what this basically looks like is we
just keep concatenated things to the end
of final string so basically letter will
be T the first time arm and final string
will be am just a empty string okay like
this
and this will simplify this will
simplify to whatever T's Morse code is
so T's Morse code is just a - so this
whole thing will just turn into an - and
after we're done with this part of the
loop this thing just turns into a - like
that okay and this goes back to me Morse
code and then it goes back to being
letter and this part goes back to being
letter right and then when we loop
through again similar thing happens now
we're at our letter becomes our this
becomes our we add final string is this
so and then ours Morse code is dot - dot
so this becomes dot - dot and it becomes
a string and what happens when you
concatenate two strings I'll show you in
the command line
they become one they just get added to
each other and then it goes back to
being what it was okay so I think that
should be it and then at the end we want
to return whatever final string is oh
and that should be good so if we give it
trinket what we should get back is this
- dot - Tata - dot - dot - Dada - okay
so let's give this bad boy a try oh this
should be letter okay let's give it a
try and - dot blah blah it looks like it
matches what the trinket at the top was
and then also I'm sure that if we try Z
it'll match what Z is as well so we'll
give that a try now and indeed it does
okay so if this was at too fast of a
pace for you which it should be because
I want to make this video go as fast as
possible so then somebody who can't
catch it just go slow rewind put it a
slower speed try it yourself
and if somebody who's keeping up with me
they're able to go through without
getting bored and want to shoot
themselves right so that's why I try to
go through it fast don't feel
intimidated if you can't solve these I
don't expect you to solve these because
you're just starting out and even if you
have a few months of experience it
shouldn't be like you should be able to
just do it right away
okay it should take some time you need
to think you should make some errors and
yeah don't don't when you get these
challenges and if I do them effortlessly
and you find yourself not doing that
Meffert Leslie don't be like I guess I
just wasn't born for programming there's
no such thing I was the biggest idiot
when it came to when I was starting out
and I was going through this stuff like
it would take me six hours to do even
the most basic thing so it's just
literally trial error practice and then
I learned it and then it just becomes
like a skill like swimming or biking or
walking like you can't forget it it's
hard so even sometimes now when if I
don't code for months I come back it's
to me it's like speaking a language or
one of the other skills you learn like
playing soccer or something like that so
don't feel discouraged I hope you enjoy
it if you didn't get it not a problem
just practice it try to do it from
scratch by yourself without taking any
help the next time so come back
understand as much as you can today come
back the next day and then try again
without looking for any help okay
hopefully that was helpful for you as
always I love you guys so much and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
