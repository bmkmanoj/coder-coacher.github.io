try to implement our first function the
main thing that you need to know here
are how to construct a list and
basically add values to it so in R it's
called a vector and we want to create an
empty vector and start adding more and
more values to it so we're going to
learn that first because that's going to
be one very important part of our
pollutant mean dot our function so let's
go ahead and try that out so let's say I
have some vector and it's just called
nums and it it contains some random
numbers ok it doesn't matter what
numbers it has but I'm just going to put
in a few numbers here now I want to
construct a duplicate vector but what I
want to do is I want to pull out one
value from nums at a time and by pulling
out one value at a time i want to then
add that value to dupe so i want to do a
loop and i want to pull one value at a
time and put it into a vector called
dupe so i'm going to construct an empty
vector this is how you construct a
numerical empty vector currently this is
what nums look like and if I showed you
dupe this is what dupe would look like
so as you can see nums contains the
numbers 2 6 3 2 5 6 dupe contains
nothing it's just an empty array or an
empty vector now I want to go through
nums and pull out one value at a time
and add it to dupe so how do I do that
I'm going to say for I in nums so this
is going to go over each value in dumbs
so here a better variable would be for
now
in numbs and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to add that variable so here let's
open a new line and I'm going to say
create a new variable called dupe and
what the new variable dupe will be is
actually a concatenation of the already
constructed array dupe so already what
do previously was except we're going to
add one more value to it this time
which is going to be numb okay so we're
doing here we're saying dupe is now just
itself plus a new value so this is how
we pretty much add values at the end of
the vector so once I run this and this
finishes running you're going to see
that dupe is going to now be an
identical vector just like num so it's
going to look just like that I'm going
to run it and I have to close my
squiggly brackets here now let's take a
look at what dupe is and you can see
it's 263 256 that's the first very
important part in writing our function
so I'm going to leave this one here and
I'm going to start now trying to write
the function and as we go along I'm
going to try to pretty much quiz you on
it so feel free to pause your video and
implement the functions by yourself as
we go on but ok so the last thing that
you need to know about here is how to
access one of the columns so let's say
that I have already have one of the CSV
files stored in the variable data so I'm
going to do head data okay and this is
going to show you the top few lines now
one way to get ax
to the columns is this way and I think
you know about this way if I do sulfate
but here's one really big problem that
occurs here so let's say that I make
some variable like y equal to sulfate
okay
and now if I do data and I do the dollar
sign and I do y it has no idea what that
is I have to literally type in dollar
sign sulfate every time for that to work
meaning in fact that if I use some
variable it's not going to work so from
now on what I'm going to advise you to
do is forget about the dollar sign and
just avoid it the best you can instead
use the two bracket indexing so here if
you want to get the sulfate what I would
say is do two brackets and do sulfate
this is going to get the sulfate column
and that pretty much got you the same
thing so here you can also do mean data
salt you have to make sure you put
quotes around it sulfate and what we can
say is na are m equal true and this is
one way to get the mean this is one
thing that was throwing our function off
and made our function incorrect last
time and we need to use the double
bracket here
okay now we're pretty much ready to put
this all together and finish our first
function okay so now we are ready to
write our function from scratch so let's
get started the function is called
pollutant mean function the first
argument is going to be the directory or
the path the second argument is going to
be what function you want to pass in
what what query you want to pass in so
are you looking for sulfate are you
looking for nitrate or are you looking
for sodium pretty
what are you looking for that's going to
be a pollutant ID is going to be the
file names so here we're going to say
the optional argument is going to be all
of them all 332 unless the user
specifies their desired range so let's
create a variable called file list and
we have done this before but we're going
to basically list all the files path is
going to equal to directory so whatever
we pass in in the directory pattern
remember is going to be or all
extensions are ending as CSV so that's
going to be your pattern that you're
looking for because it's the files are
called 0 0 1 dot CSV 0 0 2 dot CSV and
so on full name full names we want the
full path of the file so we don't just
want 0 0 1 dot CSV 0 0 2 we want
downloads slash spec data slash 0 0 1
dot CSV that's a lot more useful for us
now I'm going to create that empty
vector like we talked about in the
previous video and the Constructors and
the constructor here is going to be just
called Namir so the constructor here is
called numeric every of calling it
values and it's just an empty vector
right now so we were going to say for I
in ID so this is just any number in 1
and 332 unless the user specifies then
it'll be something like 2 through 10 or
1 through 10 what not we're going to
create something data which is just
going to be your file list and that
number I think you get that part and now
remember the trick we want to do is we
want to go through each file and every
time we calculate the mean from a file
we need to save that mean then we need
to go through another file calculate the
mean say
that mean the reason why we created this
vector in line three is for that exact
reason so we can go through multiple
files and store all our values in here
before we iterate to the next loop
because every time you loop again
you're losing your previous information
so the reason why we're using a vector
is so it can retain the information for
a longer period of time so here what
we're doing is we're saying hey the new
vector values is just going to be the
previous vector values concatenated with
now the new piece of information we have
which is data so the new file and we
just pretty much append one mean value
to values so here remember
to instead of using the dollar sign and
saying pollutant you're going to get an
error because remember here you would
have to only say sulfate otherwise you
get an error or you have to say nitrate
otherwise you get an error so here the
variable pollutant would mean nothing so
we're actually going to have to use this
index with the double brackets and pass
and pollutant and remember pollutant is
going to be something like sulfate or
nitrate it's going to be like a string
and we're going to close this and now
all we do at the end is we just get the
mean and pretty much remove our non
usable values or our non available
values rather na okay so this is working
correctly now to test that this is
working correctly let's just do a test
case here and let's say pollutant mean
and I'm going to put in the location of
where this is at so let's do that
Dropbox
Tucker Sara okay so that's the path and
we want to look for sulfate and if I run
this we should get back three point one
eight nine followed by a few numbers so
let's try to run this and see what we
get back okay so I'm going to hopes it
should be called pollutant mean save and
now let's run it so it's taking a second
and you can't see out of the screen but
this is the result that I got in this
case because that part is out of the
screencasts video scope but this is the
main result that I got so if you run
this code and you run it on spec data
you're going to get the same result
that's how you code the pollutant mean
function from scratch in the next video
we're going to code the second function
okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
