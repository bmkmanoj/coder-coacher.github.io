the camera was shaking like crazy
so I'm sorry I don't want you guys to
suffer from like a stroke or a seizure
but I think that what was said in the
video is important so worst case
scenario you can just not look at the
video and listen to it and I want to
just apologize in advance I'm sorry but
I think what is covered in the video is
very important and I think it's
applicable to every single one of you
and it's the idea of ideas versus
execution and what's worth more and what
should you value and focus on more this
can help you with landing jobs this can
help you with how you should price
yourself and this can help you with when
you're working on your entrepreneurial
idea and you want to launch a business
how should you value and how should you
come up with the different percentages
for ideas versus execution so watch this
video I think it'll be helpful to you
again I'm sorry for the crazy seizure
shaking ok didn't realize that sorry
enjoy hey guys what's up this is Kazi
from clever programmer dot-com so I just
got an email from somebody and I am like
this one this email got me triggered so
hard and I want to just share that
experience with you guys and talk to you
and maybe you can tell me maybe I'm
crazy ok so I got this email and we're
just gonna call this guy the 0.5% guy ok
point five percent guy
and here's what happened okay so the
email went hey I got this amazing idea
for an app that I think could
revolutionize the world and I found your
channel and blah blah and I think we can
work together so I'm like okay great
usually when people have ideas of are
like revolutionising the whole world
it's either one of two things one yes
they're ready for it and that whatever
idea they have they'll revolutionize the
world worlds with two they're completely
delusional let me explain why I would
say that there are sometimes delusional
because to see such a to say such a bold
claim you have you have to have some
evidence to kind of back it up you have
to have something that's providing some
kind of data or some kind of analytics
like let's say the app was already
getting thousands of people and then he
had an idea to work with me to kind of
like improve it and take it to the next
level then that would make a ton of
sense
I would I would totally understand I
would be like okay if you already have
results and now you want me to help you
improve it so you're not delusional
let's work on it but here's where the
delusion ality comes into play where
they have an idea but there's nothing
backing it up so that's where is your
detector and your brain goes off and you
go okay there's probably nothing there
and they just want to build something
from scratch and then they think that
it's gonna compete with Facebook and all
that stuff so great now with that part
out of the way the part that actually
bothered me a lot was something
something different okay it's okay to
have big dreams because that's what
allow us to pursue our goals right I
don't look down on people who have a
crazy goal like if you think you're
gonna compete with Google that's a great
goal but you need to then start actually
working towards it and if you can use
energy like that to go towards your goal
you're gonna be successful even if you
don't make something that would compete
with Google you'll create something good
but if you have a goal and you don't act
on it that's when you're in when you're
in trouble right like my own brother had
this crazy F idea that we require like
bajillion dollars he's like it's gonna
change the world and I have this idea
but he didn't pursue it right so that's
what makes it weak the idea is what
makes it great okay let's continue
further as to what actually bothered me
about this particular person's message
and triggered me and he said we'll work
on this blah blah and I'd and I'd like
to give you a share it's a great idea
and I've I've have I've gotten some
feedback from people from schools and
it's gonna be like a real killer in the
social media world I said okay sounds
very interesting but you know to be
frank I'm kind of busy right now I'm
working a lot on my youtube channel so
it's not something I can really pursue
at the moment sign in line with my goals
I would recommend kind of hiring a
developer and this gentleman said well
cause if you choose to work with me that
I would like to even give you a certain
share or a percentage in the company and
I again replied I'm like I'm sorry it's
too difficult but you know I can't do it
and then I got a reply back that said
this okay that said I'm gonna give you
0.5%
share and and if it was any other day I
would have said nothing and just moved
on I would have just ignored that email
or I would have deleted it but it wasn't
any other day and I read it and I was
like I replied back I mean I said did
you mean
0.5 out of 1 as in 50% like is that what
you get but to say maybe just use the
percentage sign incorrectly did you mean
to say 50/50 percent and the reply came
back and he said no I meant 0.5% because
it's my idea and this brings on a huge
problem that I want to talk about
because and this is applicable to all of
you ok so it's not like you're just only
watching this right because you're on my
channel and you know me right I want
this to be also applicable to you in
your life
and I'm gonna tell you why it's so
applicable and this is one big mistake
and I think it's just it requires you to
reframe your way of thinking people put
way too much value and ideas and not
enough value on execution the number one
secret why Facebook became Facebook out
of my space out of Twitter and out of
like a bajillion other things do you
think it's because of just an idea do
you think that nobody else had a idea
for social media do you think nobody had
nobody else had the idea for uber know
what made those work was it the idea no
idea actually had very little to do with
it everybody has an idea it was the
execution that was key that made it a
reality you see this channel clever
programmer has smaller as it is right
now
do you think it was an idea that brought
it to this level right it wasn't it was
us working together having a back and
forth and if I didn't provide you value
the channel wouldn't grow right and also
required on my end to work a lot make
videos give you guys lots of things that
were beneficial to you it wasn't my idea
that really helped right yes ideas what
sparked the initial thing like oh I
would this is something that would be
really cool but it was the tremendous
amount of effort that is behind the
scenes that's not visible to most people
like right it's not like my chest tastic
business that I started which was chest
and it kind of went nowhere
it was idea was there but you know what
kind of made it feel the execution work
really hard on it for a year half a year
but then I kind of stopped if I had
continued working on it it would have
been probably at a completely different
place right now so that's my point
right execution is King work is king
content is king and just talk ideas
they're fluff ideas are almost nothing
so
in my perspective work is a lot more
important than an idea okay
like let's say this person had not a
revolutionary idea some really crappy
idea but he chose to pursue it mister
0.5% if he chose to pursue it he would
have been in a much farther place right
now then having an idea nobody there to
work to bring that idea to life so it
actually should have been something if
anything it should have been the
opposite it should have been 0.5% from
idea
I'll give you 99 percent for actually
working and bringing it to life right or
it should be
worst case scenario it should be 50/50
percent but honestly I'm a huge believer
that ideas are important but execution
is king so if you just have an idea and
you want to pitch to a software
developer you want them to bring your
idea to life don't say 0.5 percent it
takes years and years for businesses to
grow and for that 0.5 percent to mean
anything for me I would have to work on
it for 10 years and it would have to be
as big as Google for me to have some
kind of chunk that was actually valuable
or worth it for the time and the effort
so give if we have to reverse this and
convert it into a 8020 rule
80% of your focus should be on execution
getting technical skills and then 20% on
the ideas okay so work on your
negotiation skills soft skills work on
your technical skills use those right
those are real tangible things use those
to build something ideas they're weak
people spend months years coming up with
the idea
via website the tagline the logo like
even looking back I don't I didn't need
to work so hard on my logo for the
channel or whatever like I could have
waited and which is actually what I did
I waited for a while
but again those are those are
ideas those are kind of like things that
take a lot of time but don't really
produce any real results so focus on
learning things and get it just get
going you have something got an idea get
going don't overthink it and don't value
ideas so much and make them this
mythical thing okay I want you to be
realistic optimistic but not dreamland
and wavy not here okay so 0.5% I wrote
him back a long email I wasn't very
happy it's disrespectful but more
importantly I just wanted to like I want
to actually help him and tell him like
not only how it came off but something
that he shouldn't think about but then
he replied to me and you know he did he
didn't get it he just said oh thank you
okay like he just kind of ignored it and
that's fine and that's fine maybe he
will make the next Google or the next
Facebook you know Who am I I don't know
but from my personal experiences and
also learning from Elon Musk's Steve
Jobs like all these autobiographies that
I've read and a lot of these people that
I follow and learn from that's not what
happened they worked on it
Elon Musk used to sleep point-like used
to work for 20 hours sleep in the same
place where he worked and when his
employees would come in he told them
wake me up when you come in so he could
get back to work on the day of their
launch for what's now called PayPal it's
called something else I can't remember
and commented below if you know but on
the day when Elon Musk was launching it
Elon Musk was the founder of the
original PayPal
he was up for 48 hours on the day of the
launch do you think that was an idea do
you think he came up with the idea and
went to sleep
she's like oh yeah 50% I'll get it he
worked his ass off to make it a reality
right so please value actual work a lot
more than intangible ideas
there's my rant for today that's it guys
thank you guys for watching I love your
faces off comment below if you had
somebody approach you like this or if
you had some pre-existing myth and just
let me know what you think about this
right what what would you have said to
this 0.5% guy would you have accepted
him on this offer am I totally wrong you
know let me know I would like to learn
okay thank you guys love your guys faces
off and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
