clever programmer calm and one of the
questions that I get so commonly is how
do you learn something very quickly and
become skilled at it the secret about
that is making learning into play
think about how anybody or anything gets
good at a skill think about even a
little cub lion how they get good it is
in the start they just play around they
feel things out and over time to start
developing better skills for them it's
in hunting it's in scouting and being
able to see really far for them it's in
running surviving skills but for us
somebody who's learning to code it could
be in becoming a better coder becoming a
better programmer one mistake that I see
a lot of people make is that they want
to stick to the script if you're
following a tutorial you'll literally
follow every exact step by step in the
tutorial and they will never deviate
from that example to try to turn it into
their own example something that helped
me the most was actually taking snippets
of tutorials and then just deviating
into my own world creating something
from just the first few lines of the
tutorial that I was following that was
my own and that could actually help me
in my life when I started learning Java
or when I started learning Python in the
beginning days I would create these
little things that could help me
calculate my paycheck I would just be
like okay 30 days of cause ease time
what's the return one week of cause ease
time what's the return on that and
that's something you can do as well but
make sure that if you're doing something
and you're following and you're learning
more time should actually be spent
outside of just what you're being taught
and you should be exploring playing
around with it and just making it play
really getting the feel for it so invest
the time in just learning invest the
time in making something play because
realistically that's one of the best
ways you are going to get better that's
one of the best ways you're going to
pick up more skills and become skilled
in a very short amount of time right and
again I say this as somebody who
understands the psychology of hundreds
of thousands of students that I've
worked with one-on-one whether it be
teaching them computer programming
whether
be teaching them chess or table tennis
or whatever else and I'm also speaking
from a perspective of somebody who
became top 1% in the world of chess
somebody who became better at computer
programming and there's nothing special
about me I didn't have a 4.0 GPA in high
school I didn't have a 4.0 GPA in
college I didn't have the best ACC
scores and know I was not a math genius
but those things that have helped me
make my skills so good is I never just
did what I was assigned to do I never
just did the bare minimum and did
exactly what it said in the script I
took those examples made them up my own
and ultimately turn it into play that's
it for this video guys thank you guys so
