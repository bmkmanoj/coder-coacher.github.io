back today we are doing another coding
challenge this is your host Rafa Kazi
from clever programmer and we are going
to jump into the reverse slicing
challenge we just completed aardvark or
you should have completed it and today's
coding challenges reverse slicing
challenge so let's see how this one
works
look they're telling you slicing it's
like you know you can think of it like
cutting things and in Python in code if
you are given a list of things you can
slice and pick and choose whichever one
you want
okay so you got apple banana bread you
can just slice by one and pick up that
you know the banana or slice by two and
get the bread or slice by zero and get
the Apple okay so it's very simple and
I'll show you what I mean by that here
as you can see they have some of these
code that some of this code actually
write up on the top and as you can see
where they have you know like a list
with first second third fourth fifth six
they're slicing it from 0 to 3 which
means from first second third fourth but
it only goes from first third as you can
see right here okay and then in this
example where they say list start from
three and go up until forever what that
will get for you is will start from 0 1
2 3 the fourth guy so the fourth element
on the list and go all the way up to 6
and more right and that's what's
happening here now what if we were given
something we are given a function called
reverse string and what we have to do
for this guy is if you give it arc it
should bring back Gras GRA and if you
give it something like hi it should
return hi
verse of how would you do that learn
actively code right below this video if
you're on the website you should be able
to code it right below you don't even
have to open up your own Python and come
up with your own solution and as you can
see on my screen the solution for this
is actually you know quite simple so let
me explain let's say I give you
something like the string hello right
now if I gave it to you from zero to two
what would you get you would get H and
the e that's it so what if I gave it to
you
so I instead of starting from H what if
I wanted to start from the e well I
could say start from one and I could do
this to say go for forever right
now what if I wanted to so remember it
start stop and then step what if I
change the number of steps so let's say
I did this I just kept this default the
middle one which is stop so basically
we're saying don't stop keep going
forever
whoops and then for us for step I'm
saying step by two which means every
other one and you can see you'll get
back you can see you'll get back HL and
O because if you start from hello and
you take out every other character you
take out the H then you take out the L
then you hop over you take out the Oh
what if I wanted to walk backwards well
the solution for that if you haven't
tried it here's a spoiler we put
negative one and what this does is it
says walk backward okay that's the
simplest way to understand it would say
walk backwards negative one and so we
just go here we go boom and in Python
count this is like a super easy way to
do it and boom look at this we said
print reverse string argh
we got back grow the top here and on
line 15 we said hi and we got back the
river
of that so that is amazing you guys we
were able to solve this challenge it was
very easy especially if you are you know
somebody a clever programmer who's been
going through the courses this should be
easy for you well my goal is to make
this easier for everybody who's new so
if you're new to this channel welcome
can you this website welcome but if
you've already been here and you're one
of the clever programmers right this
should be a review for you and this
should be a way for you to test your
skills and don't just go already know
this you should walk away you know
you're too cool for school this is below
you a lot of you guys I work with and
there's really simple things that you
guys might get stuck on and to be honest
I get stuck on simple things too which
is why I take the time out every day to
practice even really simple things
that's when I'm coding I'm coding at the
speed of light people like how are you
doing it well I just made more mistakes
than you did and it was the the simple
reason is that I just keep practicing it
relentlessly so even if it's something
looks like it's below you perfect take
that time to challenge yourself and
crush that challenge rather than be lazy
sit on your couch and just hit skip or
next video
okay so actively learn actively engage
that's the reason for this entire
channel okay I want you to communicate
actively engage posted in the comments
below here on youtube post in the
comments below your solution if you're
on my website and if you are on my
website you'll be able to code right
there as well as always thank you guys
so much for watching I love your faces
off and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
