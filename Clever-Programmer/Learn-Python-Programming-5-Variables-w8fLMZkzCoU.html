clever programmer calm now in the last
video we talked about how can you make a
script that creates a Sur square in one
go right so I gave you an example of a
script that does not make a square in
one go so I'm going to start off in this
video talking about how to do that so
I'm going to solve that problem if you
haven't done it go still try to do that
problem but I'm going to go over the
solution and then after that we're going
to talk about what the heck are
variables so let's keep going so here if
I run this code right
notice what actually happens we get this
thing but we don't want it to go to the
right and down we wanted to keep going
till it makes a square so I'm simply
going to copy this code and paste it
again except for this line I oops
I want turn 90 degrees and then I want
to turn 90 degrees and go straight one
more time so let's run this bad boy and
check it out let's see what happens okay
and boom we have gotten a square so if
this was your code and you copied this
and you went over to clever programmer
comm or you went to YouTube my youtube
channel and paste it below that would be
exactly what you would need to do okay
so simple go to Python for beginners and
simply go turtle in one go and you can
paste the code right here okay back to
what we're talking about
whoops haha the video actually started
so let's talk a little bit about
variables variables are very simple it
just allows you to store information
somewhere instead of having to say oh
yeah my friend with the white skin or
you know he has this length hair and his
nails are this long and he's dis tall
instead of saying all of that we store
all that information in his name so we
just say John or Bob or whoever right
that's exactly how variables are instead
of saying all these things at once
or having to remember them you just
store it in a variable and then you just
you know recall that variable and that's
it so something really simple I can say
Bob right is five years old he is 68
inches tall and wears brown suits okay
now if I say Bob you can see Bob or if I
say X is equal to some big number good
luck trying to remember that number but
it's pretty easy to remember X right so
you can say X and you can say X plus 10
or you can say X minus X and you should
get back zero
anyways that's variables are very simple
on the left-hand side you put what you
want to store information into and on
the right-hand side you put what you
want to store in there okay that's it
about variables I'll see you guys in the
next video where we talk about strings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
