to fun fun functions alright so let's
talk about that alright so what we have
done so far has been really cool we
figured out how to draw a square and we
figured out how to write it as a Python
script so when we run it it all runs at
the same time instead of running it here
one by one we also learn about variables
and strings so in here the thing that's
a variable is my turtle right and then
we keep using that variable over and
over again let me ask you a simple
question in this program right here is
there a single string that we're using
anywhere yes or no what do you think 3 2
1 mmm there isn't any strings that we're
using here okay what we are using here
are integers and integers are just whole
numbers from negative infinity to
positive infinity right so you have
negative you could have 190 but if you
have 90 point - that's not your that's
not an integer right that's something
else which we will discuss but up to
this point I think that we are this
naturally leads us to functions so let's
talk about that notice that when this
part of the code runs what it does right
this part of the code I want you to just
kind of memorize it for now you're not
going to really understand what it means
until we get to object-oriented
programming but I want you to just focus
on this part and what does this part do
so let me simply run the code and let's
see what that part does once we run it
and it goes and it draws a square right
so this part of the code draws the
square okay that's cool what if we want
it to make um whenever we want to make a
square right
it seems like we would have to copy this
code and write it again so for example
let's say my turtle dot forward 100 and
let's see what happens I'm going to save
it and I'm going to run it okay so I'm
going to move it forward and now I'm
going to try to like draw another square
so I'm just going to copy paste that
code oh cool
kind of looks like glasses or something
right so let's go back so this is a
square and this part is a square right
so every time we have to draw a square
we have to copy this whole bunch of code
and write it again and again every time
well think about this when we had back
when we we're using variables did we
have to remember all of these numbers no
we just stored it in X so I'm going to
teach you guys a trick where you can
take this entire block of code and kind
of give it a name like a variable name
almost but it's a little bit different
and when you assign something to a block
of code it's called a it puts it enough
you put it in a function okay so here
it's all going to make sense so I'm
gonna remove this up at the top Oh a
quick thing just in case you guys don't
know what this is this is called a
comment okay anything that you write
with a hashtag in front of it you're
telling Python to ignore that part okay
I don't want you guys to get confused by
that okay so for example if I write hi
here it'll just ignore it but if I write
hi here it'll give me like an error or
something so hashtag means I'm putting a
comment and it's only for humans to read
so now let's turn it into a function so
I'm going to say d EF that means like
define and we're going to define some
function so what does this thing do
it draws a square right so I think it
would maybe make sense if we call this
function of square and whenever you
create a function you have to put open
closed parentheses after it just like
that and put a colon okay and now
everything that you want part everything
that you want to make part of that
function you have to indent it so what
I'm going to do is go here hit tab go
here hit tab go here hit tab whoops and
then ah you can also just highlight that
part of the code that you want to move
and just hit tab all at once okay I'll
move it for you now let's see what
happens when we run this code so I'm
using the shortcut to run the code hmm
that's weird
it's not really moving anywhere right
think to yourself why is that happening
okay let me tell you this if I want it
um Bob or let's say X to be this number
right and I want it to make X spit out
that number right print that number out
to the screen well if I define X to be
something that's not the part that does
the spitting out that's just me defining
what exits right but the part that does
the spitting out is when I actually say
X and hit enter and it does something so
if I do banana is uh you know yellow
then if I want to say the yellow part
right I would actually have to say
banana then it spits out yellow just
like that me defining a function doesn't
call the function doesn't actually use
the function so I actually have to call
the function or use the function to make
it do something and make it you know
like spit it out pretty much so here I'm
gonna say square okay so like if you
were born and somebody gave you gave you
the name Jimmy that's them giving you a
name they're not calling you Jimmy
they're not telling you to come over
Jimmy they're just giving you a name
label onto you then later when they want
to call you they go hey Jimmy and you're
like what's up right like Jimmy come
here and then you respond to them okay
so just like that we gave this function
a name square and here we're calling it
so now let's see what happens so I'm
going to run this look at that right it
made a square well what does that mean
what if we want it to do that same thing
where we move forward a hundred and we
wanted to make another square so let's
say I put this line move forward a 100
and then I want to make another square
how would I make another square should I
copy all this code and then paste it
right here no the trick is that I just
call that function again that makes a
square right so let me run it okay
how cool is that so why do we create
functions hopefully it's clear to you we
create a function so we can just reuse
that code over and over again without
having to write all of that stuff again
and again and again okay to make it a
little bit cooler another thing I'll
show you about functions in the next
video is how we can give arguments to
functions okay or parameters so until
then I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
