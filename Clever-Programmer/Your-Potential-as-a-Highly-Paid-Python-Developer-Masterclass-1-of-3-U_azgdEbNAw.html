what's in your head,
turn it into a website or an app
that could solve the problems of hundreds,
thousands of people,
while getting paid what
you deserve doing it,
and waking up to work because you want to,
and not because you have to,
then you've come to the right place.
I'm going to show you
how you can learn Python
in record time
and get your first paycheck
and get that first client
in less than three months.
Whether you're still in high school,
or you're thinking of retiring,
or you think you're not smart enough,
or you don't have enough money,
or whatever it is,
pay attention to this because
this video has the potential
to change your life.
Because I'm gonna share
with you my story of
how I was a terrible
community college student
with a 2.0 GPA,
and in the community
college I made $104,000
in one year.
And keep in mind,
this was after only spending
90 days learning to code.
And then I got my first
client who paid me 20k,
and then that year I
went on to make $104,000.
And I'll share that story with you.
Before we continue,
I've gotta warn you that
not paying attention to any of this stuff
is the difference between
why there are people
building cool apps like
Instagram, YouTube, Reddit,
making six figures while doing it,
making an impact in the world,
while others are working
their nine to five,
paper shuffling,
soul crushing jobs that they hate,
and are only making enough from those jobs
to support their families
and pay their bills.
This is the reason why there are people
who are practically
invincible to unemployment,
have endless streams of clients,
and they have the power to
both hire and fire the people
that they're working with,
while others are shooting
out hundreds of resumes
knowing deep down that none
of them are even getting read.
They also know that
they're not in the position
to accept the job that they want.
They're not in the position
to get that dream job.
So they'll accept any crappy opportunity
that comes their way,
and they also know and accept their fate
of being overworked and underpaid.
So in this video, I'll
be showing you exactly
how much money you can be making
as a web developer
and somebody that makes apps.
And I'll also share with you
which programming language
should you choose that's the easiest,
most profitable,
and most popular.
And I'll also be sharing with you
what kind of job market there is
for the job that you're
gonna be having, all right.
And how all of this can benefit you.
Whether you choose to be a freelancer,
a full-time developer,
or maybe you just want to
do this as a side hustle.
The reason why I've taken the time
to put this class together for you okay
is because I have gotten sick
of seeing countless people
trying to learn coding
and make money from it
and that keep failing to do that.
Because the traditional path is all about
whether it's coding boot camps,
or colleges,
or online training resources,
they're all designed to just
take money out of your pocket.
But none of them are designed to put money
back in your pocket.
My goal really with this
Profitable Programmer Master Class
is to teach you only those
practical skills you need
to become a profitable programmer
and just skip out on all the theory
and all the fluff and the
fat that you don't need.
Hi, I'm Rafeh Qazi,
the founder of Clever Programmer,
and the creator of your Profitable
Programmer Master Class.
At this point on our YouTube channel,
we have over 3.5 million viewers,
and we have over hundreds
of thousand students
enrolled in our coding programs.
The success and the explosive
growth of this channel,
or my success as a Python freelancer
is not because of how smart I am
or how much money I had or whatever.
Because pretty soon I'll tell you
exactly how not smart I am.
Instead the story is about
how I discovered this system.
And this system was what
helped me get my success.
And after years of refining it,
I've realized,
especially with the growth
of Clever Programmer,
that this system works
even better for others.
Take my student, Denis
Murphy, for example,
who worked as a IT
desktop support engineer.
And before taking this course,
he started with zero coding skills.
Afterwards, he became
a Python web developer
in just a few months.
And he even put together
this Python portfolio app
made with Python.
Or take Robert Jomar who's a
freshman at Harvard University.
And before taking my course,
he had very little coding skills.
He just dabbled a little bit
here and there with apps.
But after this course,
he says that it's so much easier now
for him to make apps with Python.
Or Afrin Kirkman who was a web developer
and before taking this
course had basic skills.
And then after this course,
she said she had one of her
most proud moments in life
where she made a app
with Python from scratch
and her colleagues were
actually using it at work.
But before we get into
this amazing system,
I'm gonna share with
you how I got started.
'Cause I know at this point
you might be wondering that.
Kinda how it started for everybody,
or most people, how it does.
Go to college,
I wanted to get a job,
maybe a promotion, or another promotion,
retire and then maybe die.
And while I was going to college,
what do most people do
especially if you're from
a country like Pakistan
and you have that genetic
predisposition to things like IT
and your parents tell you to do that,
I wanted to go the route of IT.
And I ended up getting
my CCNA certification.
It took me months of effort to get it.
And I discovered it in college.
And okay, I'm gonna just
work hard and get it.
So I got my Cisco Certified
Networking Associate.
That's what I became.
And it's a very profitable thing
if you get in this field.
You can make a lot of money.
Except, I absolutely
hated it with my guts.
And that was actually when I realized
I didn't want to do computer networking.
So I'm like all right,
process of elimination.
Not computer networking.
So let's try to now do something else.
And then, kind of randomly,
I was doing other things
and I stumbled upon
computer programming,
software development.
And what I ended up finding out
was that it was really about
taking what was in your head.
And I could take something
that's absolutely
in my brain
and give it life.
Like put it out into the world.
And it's not just like
it's on a piece of paper.
Like it's literally out there.
And other people can use it.
And it's instantly scalable.
And all of a sudden they
can put it on their phones.
And all of a sudden they
can use it on websites.
And it just blew my mind.
So, like in the start my mind was blown.
And I'm thinking this is so fun to do.
And there are people who
actually pay you to do this?
So my initial impression of coding was,
did I just find a glitch in life?
Did I kind of find a loophole
that nobody else has found?
That's honestly what got me
really excited about coding.
And I'm like okay,
this is what I want to be doing.
And then I also realized that this
is something that pays well.
So I could be earning
a really high income,
six figure average salary.
I learned that I could be doing this
and traveling the world.
And for me, those were some
of the most important things,
and basically had the freedom
to work from where I want
when I want.
However, I wish it was that smooth.
Because what started happening was
even though I wanted to get a job,
I started realizing that this thing
is a little bit harder than it looks.
And in fact, it's quite a bit harder
than sometimes it looks.
And I found myself just
bashing my head against a wall.
I would look at all of these
online coding tutorials,
these different resources,
edX, Udacity, Courser,
Udemy, Treehouse,
da-da-da-da-da.
I could go down the list all day.
But my biggest problem
that was happening was
I didn't find myself making progress.
And when I say progress,
I don't mean I wasn't able
to do those coding challenges and stuff,
even though they were kinda hard.
After a while, you can
pass them and stuff.
But I wasn't making progress in terms of
nobody was teaching me how
could I do this to solve
real world problems from those courses.
And be making money from this,
make a living out of it,
support my family with it,
support myself with it.
And that kind of thing, that
wasn't happening for me, okay.
So that's where I was stuck
and wasn't making any progress.
And maybe you can kind of
relate to that, you know,
whether it's the coding
part is hard for you,
maybe it's you are not able to make money
and you've been spending time.
Or maybe you have no idea what coding is
and you've never written a line of code.
That's totally fine too, okay.
This class,
this master class is for you as well.
So moving on,
I find my mentor.
At the time, I don't know
it's gonna be my mentor.
But I found him from like meetup groups.
I met him at Braintree.
And then I met him at PS1.
These are these places in Chicago.
You don't have to worry about them.
But that's where I met Nick.
And Nick pretty much
changed the game for me.
Okay, he changed everything for me.
And he helped me take this path
that could help me become a programmer,
a Python developer in months
instead of years.
And he started showing
me the difference between
a programmer that works for 30 years
and goes on to make $30 an hour
versus a programmer
that works three months
and makes $100 an hour.
And hint, hint,
I did end up becoming that programmer
that made $100 an hour
and then did that in three months.
And I'm gonna tell you that story.
So, Nick showed me that
you don't need degrees
and like years of experience.
And you don't need some certifications.
As long as you can go out,
find people with burning
real-world problems,
give them real-world
solutions to those problems,
people paying you is not a question.
And that was kind of a
revolutionary thing for me.
And that's when I realized that
holy crap,
making money and becoming
a successful developer,
only 15% of it comes from actually coding,
and 85% of it comes from
just your personal
skills, your likeability,
and the soft skills.
And that's the easy part.
And that was like one of the
biggest epiphanies I had.
And Nick showed me that.
And then what ended up happening was
he started telling me
how to put myself out there to land jobs.
And I ended up getting
a call from this place
who ended up becoming my first client.
I get a call
and these guys are like,
hey, is this Qazi.
And I'm on the phone and I'm like yes,
this is Qazi.
I have no idea who it is.
I've just gotten back from school.
Again, Oakton Community College.
Doesn't really sound like Harvard does it?
And again, I'm this 2.0 GPA student.
And I've only spent about a
month coding at this point.
Pick up the phone and I'm
like yes, this is him.
And they go, okay Qazi,
we saw your ad.
And we are interested in working with you
except you know,
the things that we're
building have to do with
building a portal,
and building an online database,
and a software that can really do
customer relationship management.
Is that something you can do?
And at this point I have
the phone in my hand
and I'm going.
Hell no, this is not something I can do
because I've only learned
the very basics, okay.
I barely know anything in coding.
It was just like some of the stuff
that I've learned online.
But I keep saying yes I can do
to everything they're saying.
We get off the call,
and I'm panicking.
So I call my mentor and I go,
what the hell did I get myself into?
And is this something I can even do?
And the rate that those guys
were giving me for this job
was $100 an hour.
My mentor said here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you the exact roadmap
of what you need to do
so you can be doing this job.
And two months from now,
you will be able to do this job,
if you follow this exact roadmap.
So I called these people
up and I said okay,
let me get back to you
and I'm gonna continue working
and learning these things
and then hopefully we can work together.
I followed that exact roadmap.
I worked really hard.
And on the third month mark,
I called them.
I ended up landing this same client
and we worked.
We went on to work.
And over the course of two months,
a little bit less than two months,
they invoiced me $20,765.
Keep in mind, I'm a 20 year old
Oakton Community College
student at this point.
And this was the most
unbelievable experience for me.
And you know, another amazing thing
that I forgot to tell you is that
while I was building this app for them
and while I was coding for them
and building this customer
relationship management system,
when I was in,
I was doing a lot of this
when I was in California
'cause my nephew had his birthday
and he was just born at this time.
And while I was waiting
in the hospital line,
usually that's like the most
boring thing to be waiting at.
It's horrible right.
You're like ah, you're just waiting.
You don't know what's gonna happen.
You have to wait like 10 hours.
And while I was waiting there,
I was coding and working on this app.
And I was having fun.
And I remember thinking
I would be paying somebody to
work on a project like this,
'cause this is so amazing.
And not only did I not have
to pay out of my own pocket,
not only that I was doing it for free.
But I was actually getting paid to do it.
And I was making $100 an hour
working as a Python freelancer.
This was the most unbelievable
experience for me.
But this story is not about me.
I just wanted to share this with you
so you can see kind of what's possible.
But what this video is really about
is your Python potential, okay.
And we're gonna figure
out what you can be doing
with programming.
So let's start off with why
we even choose this programming language
and what your Python potential is okay.
So come here and kind of
let's get into it all right.
This is one of my favorite parts.
I'm pretty excited.
So let's go.
Okay, so your Python potential.
Let's move on.
Why are we choosing this
programming language?
I like to say that we're choosing this
for three main reasons.
Python is the easiest
programming language.
It's one of the most paid
programming languages.
And it's one of the most
popular programming languages.
I want to pick something that
you can get started in fast,
that you can improve in fast, get results,
and start getting real, practical
jobs as fast as possible.
Look at this.
$117,000 you can be making.
And this is average salary
for a Python developer.
And again, why can't you
be on this higher end?
You totally can.
You can be making $142k, $150k.
It also depends what
location you're staying at.
But this is the average.
So that's a pretty good number, okay.
Python web developers.
Web developers,
we're gonna go deeper into
why I'm talking about web developers
and why I'm pushing web development, okay.
So we're gonna talk about that.
So before we continue further,
you know that Python is highly paid.
Let me tell you the things
that are built with Python.
Okay, it's gonna blow
your mind, all right.
Instagram was built off of Python.
You know the same app that's gonna have
the billions of new users every year?
Instagram.
Reddit was built off of Python.
YouTube, where you go to
watch your favorite cat videos
and programming videos and my
channel, Clever Programmer,
built off of Python.
Okay, Spotify is built off of Python.
Quora is built off of Python.
Dropbox is built off of Python.
If your mind hasn't been blown yet,
I don't know when it's gonna be blown.
Let's move forward.
All right, and hopefully this moves.
All right, Python is also one
of the most popular languages.
This is according to Coding Dojo,
one of the best coding
boot camps that exists.
And look it says top nine
in-demand languages.
Okay, most in-demand languages.
And you can see Python is right over here.
All right, let's move on.
Now why is Python easy?
Okay, Python is the easiest language.
And the best proof of that
is look at where all the top
introductory courses in
computer science departments
are changing to.
Python, look at that.
This should tell you that it's easy
because they're using it to
teach introductory courses now.
Another thing this should tell you is that
this is where the demand is.
And all these top universities
like Princeton, Harvard,
they're seeing that the whole
world is going towards Python.
So they're starting to train
people in Python, okay.
And here's what I'm gonna tell you.
For the people who are like oh
there's too much commodity now,
there are too many Python developers.
Here's what I'm gonna tell you.
More competition means it's more hot,
means it's more good,
means there's more opportunity.
Okay, that's what more competition means.
All right, let's move on.
Now there are different fields
you can go into Python, okay.
So I'm gonna just touch
on that for a little bit.
Even though we're gonna be
focusing on web development,
there are different fields.
There are a lot of them.
But the two main ones I'm
gonna focus on is data science
and web development.
Let's start off with data science.
So data science is really,
you know, your robotics,
your Google self-drivings cars,
that's data science.
Things like when you go on Amazon right,
and you see these recommendation
things that pop up,
and it kind of like knows you
better than your own wife knows you.
And you're like how did they
know what product I wanted
or what thing I ran out of?
When you go on Netflix the
recommendation things that pop up
which movie to watch,
that's kind of your data science stuff.
However, the con of data science,
the reason why we're not gonna
be focusing on this is that
you do need years of job experience.
You do need masters or PHD
degrees most of the times.
And you do need certifications.
So data science has a lot
of prerequisites which
I don't know about you, but I don't have.
And so maybe if you have all of them,
good place to go.
But you know,
the reason why I want to focus on starting
with web development is
because you can also then later
go and focus in on data science, okay.
And Python web developer.
What do they do?
What is their job outlook
and all that, okay?
So again, look at all these things
that are built off of Python.
This shows you that only the opportunity
for becoming a web developer is growing.
Because all of these
platforms are growing.
So you know at least you're
gonna be getting jobs here.
And look at how everything
is going to software.
Even the checkout and go,
the scan and go in Walmart is
replacing all the people there.
So everything is switching to software.
Your phones, your iPhones,
your Androids,
your computers,
the iMac that I'm using.
Every single thing is
switching to software.
So it only makes sense that it's growing
and everything is going to the web.
Look at all these big companies.
And again, all these are made with Python.
So there is a huge job
market opportunity here
that you could take advantage of
and absolutely crush in, okay.
So, I hope you're excited because now
what we're gonna be transitioning into
is your Python earning
potential calculator.
All right, why this is gonna be so awesome
is because we're gonna find out together
how much you're gonna be earning
as a Python freelancer.
All right, again if you
want to go full time,
and you want to do this as a side hustle,
you can still follow along
and learn from these same principles.
But I'm focusing on the Python freelancer.
And you can use this
to basically figure out
your own earning potential, all right.
So now we're gonna switch over to that.
Follow me over here.
All right, let's switch over.
Okay, so let's say you want to figure out
how much money you could
be making with Python.
All right guys, I'm excited about this.
So if you're watching this,
I hope you're excited.
'Cause this is really doable you guys.
All right so,
your Python earning potential calculator.
I've put only about four clients in here
because that might take
you some time to get
all the way up to four clients.
But this will give you a way
to play around with the numbers
and see what works for you.
Okay so for example,
let's say that you have
one client at the cheapest
Python freelancer rate you can imagine.
$50 an hour, okay.
And I'll show you later on
that this is a low rate,
average Python freelancer,
charges $150 and hour.
So we're gonna calculate
it with that later.
But let's say you're a beginner,
you're not confident with your skills.
This is the first client
you get in let's say
two to three months, okay.
If you work for 10 hours every week,
just 10 hours.
Not 40 hours, not 100 hours.
You work 10 hours.
Weekly you're making,
you're pocketing $500.
And again, keep in mind that for Python
you can be working remotely, all right.
You can be working from anywhere you want.
So it doesn't matter
what country you're in.
You could still be earning this rate.
All right, so let's say
weekly income is 500.
That means your monthly income is $2,000.
Wouldn't getting $2,000 every single month
be really nice?
Because I know it would be nice for me.
It would pay for my Netflix.
It would pay for my Hulu subscription.
It would pay for my rent.
It would pay for my office space,
maybe equipments every month,
phone bill.
Everything that's kind of annoying.
If you're making extra
income of $2,000 a month,
that's freaking great.
And is $24,000 a year
extra on the side bad?
You could use this to
maybe start a startup.
Maybe you could start a business.
Maybe you could put this in a 401k.
Maybe you could open up
a Charles Schwab account
and put it in there.
I mean the possibilities
with what you could be doing
with this money are endless.
Now, let's get a little
bit more ambitious, right.
We started off as something
maybe a little bit more realistic.
But let's go to you know what
is really easily possible.
And let's say you're hitting $100 an hour
with one client.
Okay, that's $4,000 from
just one client, okay.
And again, the average
Python freelancer rate
is $150 an hour.
So with one client with
only 10 hours of work,
you could be looking
to make $6,000 income.
And again, the types of
projects you could be doing
are very, very different.
For example, when I was
working with a company,
I was working making
a customer relationship management system.
It sounds complicated.
But it's really not
once you get the layout
and the roadmap of how it works, okay.
So basically I built something
that handled their invoicing,
that handled their accounting.
And all the labor hours that
that company was spending,
they were spending about
50 to 100 hours a week,
like labor hours,
with their employees
to manually do and write
down all that stuff
and figure out their taxes
and accounting and all that.
I automated it.
So I saved them thousands of hours
of paying their employees per
year 'cause I automated this.
The company was saving
200 to $500,000 a year
because of that.
So do you think they have a problem
having me create something in two months,
pay me 20k for it
and then be pocketing 300 to 500
extra thousand dollars every year?
Of course not.
So that's why thinking kind of like
the business and soft skills is important
and I'm gonna be showing
you guys those things
as we go along, okay.
Now imagine what happens if you have,
so even with one client,
on 10 hours a week client,
you're making $72,000 a year.
I mean this is crazy.
Let's say you add in another client, okay.
You're hitting $144,000 dollars.
Okay, which is.
You know, I know it sounds
like a really big number.
But it's really, really, really doable.
And again, if you're not
confident in your skills
and you want to go with $50
for the first few people,
you're still making $48,000 a year, okay.
And I get it.
Maybe some of you are like oh,
but we can't just work with
those one or two clients
for the entire year.
That's why I'm gonna
also be showing you guys
that it's important how you can have
a stream of clients coming.
Okay, and as a Python freelancer today,
the opportunities of getting
work is endless, okay.
Just even look at a simple
website like Upwork.com.
The opportunities to get
Python jobs are endless there.
And you could be getting clients
back to back, to back to back.
And the beauty about
having clients is that
you have the potential
to hire and fire them.
So they can't just treat you like crap.
They have to give you respect.
You work with the clients you want.
And maybe you have a client
that's paying you 50.
You have another one that's paying you 150
and treating you with respect,
client two is not as fun.
You could just cut them off if you want.
You can say it was great working with you,
but I'm putting in my one week, two weeks,
can't be doing this anymore, okay.
You can choose to do that if you want to.
And that's the freedom that's amazing.
You could be working
from anywhere you want.
You could be waking up to
work because you want to,
not because you have to.
Right, and here's what
I've done for you, okay.
Here's what I've done for you.
And I want you to take this
and take full advantage of it okay.
This is super exciting.
So do this.
I've made this sheet
and I've made it so you could use this,
your Python earning
potential calculator as well.
Now in the video,
below or above, somewhere.
Hopefully below,
I've put together this worksheet for you.
You can click the link
and go to this worksheet
and steal this worksheet.
But here's the important thing.
You have to make a copy, okay.
So let me show you how
you can make a copy.
So here I have put a note, make a copy.
'Cause otherwise you can't edit it.
So go to file,
and then what you want
to do is say make a copy.
Or you can download it and
then make changes to it.
But I would just suggest do make a copy
and then make changes to it.
And then you could playing
around with this worksheet.
And here's what I want you to do.
I want you to tell me
in the comments below
what your earning potential looks like
and what your monthly
income goals look like.
So for example,
you could say your monthly income goal
is only $2,000 a month.
Or maybe your monthly income
goal is $3,000 a month.
So just put down what
hourly rate you're charging,
you want to, you would like to charge,
and what monthly income you're looking at.
Do that
and before I let you go for this video,
I do want to tell you of something
very, very, very amazing and important.
Part two of this master class,
what you don't want to miss
is absolutely unbelievable.
In that class,
what we're gonna be doing is
we're gonna be going through
and building your profitable
programmer portfolio.
Okay, this is gonna be absolutely amazing.
And it's gonna be done for you.
And I'm gonna walk you
through how to create it,
how easy it is, okay.
And this is a portfolio
you can literally steal
from the next part of
this training series.
And you can use this portfolio
even for what you're doing right now.
So let's say you're in some IT field
or your sys admin.
You can use this portfolio
to get a better job
or just represent who you are
and sell yourself better
and what you're doing.
Or I'm gonna show you in the next video
how you can be using this portfolio
to build apps with programming and Python
and then start to just plug and chug them
in this portfolio, okay.
This portfolio is ready to go.
And I think that's gonna
be really exciting.
And in the next video,
I'll be showing you the difference between
the profitable programmer
and the traditional programmer.
And I'll be showing you
what my mentor showed me
that changed my life, okay.
So your potential is amazing.
You're gonna be crushing it,
especially with this job market
and how much demand there
is for a Python developer
and a Python freelancer.
I'm excited for you.
You have the power to
change not only your life
but your entire family's life.
And you have the power
to change the lifestyle
that you have right now
and for those of you around you.
Put your earning potential
in the comments below.
And I've also put a
downloadable worksheet for you
to help you figure out
your Python lifestyle.
Okay, your Python developer lifestyle.
So the answers to that worksheet,
I want you to also put in
the comments section below.
That's it for this video
and I'm gonna see you in the
next master class part two.
