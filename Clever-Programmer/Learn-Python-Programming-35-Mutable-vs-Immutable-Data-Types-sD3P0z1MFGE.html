data types versus immutable data types
essentially to mutate or mutability or
mutable essentially means something that
can change they will use this
terminology and computer programming
world to confuse the hell out of you but
essentially it's just telling you that
something can change and in and
immutable just means something that
cannot change okay so for example I
don't know some things might be
immutable like I might consider maybe my
glass is immutable they're really hard
to change and they're I mean it's really
hard to change something about it and
that is just what it is right and maybe
my keys might be a little bit more
mutable like I can add things to my
keychain and I can take things away from
my keychain right so that might be an
example of something that's immutable
versus something that might be
potentially mutable you know your wallet
you can change things you can add things
to it you can take things out but maybe
from a cup it's a little bit harder I
might almost consider it an immutable
thing if you could put something in it
but these are examples are just to give
you some kind of intuition as to how
these things work but in the real world
you know you have you're doing data
analysis on a lot of sensitive
information you want to store that as a
tuple where it's harder to change it or
if pairs of things go together like for
example your name and your email address
that's something that goes together as a
pair then maybe you could put that you
can create a list that contains tuples
inside of it so the first element of
that list could be a tuple containing my
name and my email address and then the
second element in that list could be
your name and your email address and so
on and so forth
and and the reason why there are tuple
is because you can't
things out from it really easily or you
can you can't add things to it really
easily so generally stick with a list
until you can figure out when to use
both of them and then start using tuples
but for now play around with tuple a
little bit figure it out get a sense of
it okay in the next video we're going to
talk about another data type you tell me
this time okay you that whether is it a
mutable data type or an immutable data
type okay by leaving that in the
comments alright guys that's it for this
video and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
