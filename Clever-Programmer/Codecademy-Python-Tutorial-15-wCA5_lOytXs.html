clever programmer calm and you are
watching KOAT Khadem e part 15 I'm
running out of creative things to do so
I'm just now calling it as it is part 15
um yeah so today has been a pretty good
day it's been pretty productive it's a
nice Sunday morning hopefully you are
having a good time as well
wherever you are in the world and
watching this I hope you're just relaxed
and focused and you can enjoy this as
well as learn enjoyment and learning at
the same time oh right that's what a
university professor would say but not
me I think those two things go hand in
hand and I think it's almost impossible
to truly learn something without
actually enjoying it because when you
enjoy it
you experiment on all of the whys and
all of the fundamental basic
understanding of a certain concept and
until you question the basics of
something you won't truly understand it
and the only way you'll question those
things is if you like it so much that
you are playing around with it your
brain will wander and you'll naturally
ask those questions right and then you
pick up those concepts and learn those
things so while you're watching these
videos you guys are actually getting a
lot better than 99.9% of the people who
are taking this course kind of just
brain-dead and following the
instructions on the left hand side
because trust me that doesn't help you
and almost everybody that I know
personally who's taken this they just go
for some reason I just took this Co
Academy course and I don't remember any
of it
well that's because you were working on
muscle memory then your actual memory
and understanding okay
so true memory the reason why you won't
forget these things is if you truly
understand that cool let's just take a
look at where we are and where we need
to go so I'm going to go back to course
page and we are at 50% completion good
job if you made it this far like
actually go and pat yourself on the back
you know spree
then and breathe out and relax yeah just
relax because we're doing amazing and we
are making a lot of progress so we're
more than halfway done on unit seven
lists and functions and then we're going
to go onto battleship that's going to be
a really fun part so let's get to it all
right let's continue moving on printing
out item by item in a function or sorry
printing out a list item by item in a
function so what does this mean let's
give it a try what they're saying is
we're going through each item and
printing out that item now I'm going to
show you a simple way and then I'm going
to show you the way they're doing it
okay so let's do it the simple way first
I will say for item in n print item
right so n is this list right here and
item first time going through is going
to be three is going to be three right
here it's going to print three and spit
it out to the screen right so I think
you already know that then item is going
to be five then item is going to be
seven you got that part of the loop
right that's the easier and much nicer
way to do it but the way they're going
to show you is more computer science E
and it applies to other languages than
just Python so it's a very common way to
do it in Java and C C++ that's how they
do loops there most of the times okay so
that's how they're showing you okay so
what they're doing is I'll actually call
this index instead of I and then we'll
abbreviate it later to I so it makes
more sense so here's how this loop works
let's break it down step by step so
first of all I'm going to comment out
these lines and I'm going to go here
okay what is this part and what does
that mean and what the heck is range
right range essentially creates a list
on the fly so let me show you in Python
two
okay you can use the terminal or you can
use your idle so let's use the idle
because if you install Python you might
have this idle right here so I'm going
to create you can also just do it on
this website that I have up there
rappelled it okay you can do it anywhere
you want I'm just showing you in
multiple places so you know that you
have different options range of five
let's see what that gives us
it basically created a list on the fly
so instead of having to do creating a
list like 0 1 2 3 4
you can just say range of 5 how will you
create a list of 10 elements you would
say a range of 10 but quick quiz of your
understanding of range if I do range of
10 well 10 exists in the list or not if
you said no good job it'll actually be
from 0 to 9 so what you give range is up
to but not including that point that's
how a lot of the things work in Python
but how are they passing disfunction
range to arguments they're passing this
function to arguments you see that comma
so they're passing it to arguments so
here's how it actually works range takes
in a start argument and a stop argument
okay and so I can say start at 1 and go
up to 11 which means go up to but not
including 11 this part 1 it says include
1 okay so start from 1 and go up to 10
is how I would read it so here we start
from 1 go up to 10 so if I wanted to
make a loop that ran 11 or however many
times that is right I can say for I in
range um
right for item in range 1 through 11
print item
you see that boo it goes one two three
four five six seven eight and same way I
can do five through 11 if I want it okay
so pretty simple you saw it looping
through and goes five six seven eight
nine ten and done essentially what it
really is is that range is nothing
really that special this part just
evaluates to an actual list five six
seven eight nine and ten okay that's the
part I want you to understand it's not
some magical thing that part actually
evaluates to an own data structure
called the list and then item just keeps
becoming each item in that list range
all it does is creates a list on the fly
okay so here's how they're looping four
index in range so let's create some
lists like how they have it and is equal
to 3 comma 5 comma 7 right and now I say
4 index in range 0 comma Len of n Len of
n is just a cool way of saying 3 but we
don't want to hard code 3 because what
if it was a list of a different size so
we're going to use the Len function on n
Len short for length actually tells you
how long the list n is and here it will
count all the elements in the list n
well how many elements is the list and
half 3 so this part effectively just
evaluates to 3 okay so for index and
range 0 to 3 in your head imagine this
part that turns into 0 1
- got it that's what that part actually
turns into okay so actually I'm going to
just write the loop with that zero one
and two and I'm going to say print and
of index and you'll see what happens so
what did it do let's apply this code
right here
zero one two okay and let's do this
and let's run it let's see what it
actually does it prints out three five
seven it printed out each item in the
list right what we wrote is the
equivalent of for item in n print item
both of those are equivalent you'll see
three five seven and then three five
seven being printed again three five
seven that's our first for loop this one
here and our second for loop gives us
three five seven as well so they're both
equivalent just going to leave that here
for notes and I'm going to come down
here so what is this part actually doing
well index the first time is zero
what's the end of zero the zeroth
element of n that's three so this part
actually evaluates to a three okay
what's so next time you loop through and
of one end of one is just a second
element so it's five and then that's why
you have three and five and then at the
end you have seven and so n of 2 right
because this is a two and of two
evaluates to a seven and then you get
back seven out right there okay so this
is just your looping and you're getting
access to that element in the list by
using its index so you're using its
position to access that element rather
than access that element directly right
in our loop from line six to seven item
is directly the element
three and it's directly the element 5
but index is actually the position so if
I did range how they wrote it was range
Len of um n right this whole part in our
case evaluates to 0 comma 1 comma 2 but
now I'm going to leave it like this and
you'll see that it actually just prints
out what we said earlier 3 5 7 because
it's actually 0 it's a list 0 1 2 right
it starts from 0 and goes up to 3 and
then same thing so here we're in using
index to get access to the element here
we're getting ax to the element access
to the element directly ok so just in
case sometimes you want to know the
position this is a better way and if you
just want access to the element directly
without having to know what position
it's at just do you know get access to
that item directly rather than doing a
range ok hopefully that makes sense and
let's move on and so instead of the
whole variable index they're just using
I so that's what you're going to see
that's why there's an eye a lot of
people just go with some mysterious I
you know you can call it whatever you
want it's an arbitrary looping variable
however by convention if you're getting
the index you just say by I because such
a common operation so we have to create
a function called print list now so
we're going to define a function called
print list and it's going to take in
some lists so I'm just going to say LST
and for I in range 0 through and you
don't have to say 0 because it starts
from 0 so I'm just going to say range of
and
friend for I'm sorry not n because in
this function I'm defining a list here
LST of I and that should be good if I
give this function a list they'll figure
out what to do so let's try it here now
I'm going to run this and you're going
to see it's gonna not going to do
anything because we're defining a
function and we're not calling it so I'm
going to call print list and I'm going
to give it that list end that we created
at the top and let's see what happens
and it just at that three five seven now
if I change the end to anything else
it's going to figure out what to do and
it's going to print out line by line
every element in that list okay so it's
a smart function let's hit save and
submit the body of your function should
not contain any references to n so I
think I have to delete this it looks
like you either didn't call print okay I
should just read the instructions right
I'm trying to get ahead of myself here
to define a function called print list
that has one argument X okay so they
want me to call it X terrible variable
naming but that's okay inside that
function print out each element one by
one use the existing code as a scaffold
then call your function with the
argument n so what we did in the repple
pretty much print list and I'm going to
pass it or list n right and how it works
is three five seven gets passed here for
n it goes to the definition of function
passes three five seven right there this
X turns into three five seven
Len of three five seven turns to three
range of three turns into zero comma 1
comma two I the first time you're
looping is 0 and at X of 0 X is that
list so zeroth element of that list is
three and then it loops again and we
have and we have one so you get X of one
well X is simply that list three five
and seven so X of one is actually five
right it's this list right here and it
prints out five and then the same way
and it works for seven as well okay just
want to give you an idea of what's
happening let's go next list modifying
each element in a list in a function so
here they're taking each element and
just modifying you
modifying each element okay so what
they're effectively doing and this is a
nice reason to use it is they're just
doubling each element by two so I will
get the index right so if the list has
ten elements this range is going to turn
into zero through nine giving you the
position of each of those elements it's
going to be zero one two three four five
nine that's going to give you the
position of each element then you can
keep pulling out each element like that
and then on line four what you're saying
is hey the new value of that element
should be what that element was times
two so you're doubling you're looping
through and getting access to each
element and then doubling it okay so
let's run it on the thing three five
seven print double lists so I have to
put parentheses here Python three double
list is not defined okay don't forget to
return your new list return n and this
function should be called double list
okay so I'm going to say define double
list it takes in nope right here let's
see if it works
inconsistent use of tabs and spaces so
sometimes tabs and spaces act funny it's
better to use spaces rather than tabs so
four spaces is the convention and it
just doubled that list you see this list
was three five seven and now three times
to give you six five times to give you
ten and seven times to give you 14 so
that list effectively has been doubled
let's just go through that algorithm and
how it works oh we gave three five seven
to the function double List it put three
five seven right up here it did Len of
three five seven it parentheses right so
you got to go inner and outer so the
first thing that happens
is the land of three five seven well a
line of three five seven is three so now
this range goes from zero to three that
just means zero one and two it goes zero
up to but not including three so you get
zero one and two the first time this I
loop through it's actually zero zero
reality like gary vaynerchuck you have
the new end of zero so it's saying the
new this guy right here right it's in
the process of being defined the new guy
in the 0th position of that list or this
list right here is actually what that
guy was so three times two so now this
guy is actually six so this part
effectively changes to a six I'm sorry
then it goes or sorry not the outer part
okay the inner part that's important to
remember because this is different than
the function argument so six then it
goes through the loop again it goes one
now it's everywhere it goes n of 1 n of
1 times 2 so n of 1 well that's five in
our case and five times two gives us a
10 so now it turns this guy into a 10
right that's 10 and then it goes for the
second position and it goes n of 2 is n
of 2 times 2 and if 2 evaluates to 7 and
7 times 2 gives you 14 so this part
turns to 14 and we have created the list
the loop goes and sees that it it went
through 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 so this loop has ended
now it goes to the next statement which
is return n and n is 6 10 and 14 at this
point it returns that so this call gets
evaluated to 6 10 and 4 and then it gets
sent to the print function and print
function simply spits it out to the
screen which is why you see right here
if you didn't use the print function it
would
get printed out to the screen cool okay
let's move on or sorry let's see it
actually what they're telling us to do
so they want us to create a function
define double lists it takes in a single
argument X multiplies each Amba two and
returns that list use the existing code
as a scaffold so they're saying use this
existing code as a scaffold meaning as
an example or building blocks so I'm
going to say X of I times two
oh I'm being cool right instead of using
the long hand notation and doing X is
equal to X of I times 2 I'm going to
Beach I'm going to choose to be a cool
guy and I'm just going to say X sub I
times equals two that's shorthand for
increment me right if you do this that's
not going to do anything so you got to
make sure that you put the equal sign
there as well and then I'm going to
return the actual list X so let's give
this bad boy a try list index out of
range
why did okay obviously for I in range I
will set zero to L of Len of X okay that
should be good yeah there you go
the reason why I got that list index out
of range err instead of I is undefined
is actually a complicated thing it has
to do with how closures work so I'm not
going to get into that but you know look
into that if you're interested start
next lesson passing or range into a
function so you can also pass a range
into a function that just means passing
a list into the function okay
effectively you're telling it maybe how
many times to run
so range works like this if you give it
one argument that just means stop at
this point and if by default stop start
at zero if you give it this argument if
you give it two arguments it
automatically assumes the first argument
is a start and the second argument is a
stop if you give it three arguments it
assumes the first is a start second is a
stop up to but not including type of
stop and then it assumes that the last
part is step so I can say a range of 0
through 100 or let's say 101 that means
that that's going to go up like
including 100 but not 101 obviously and
I'm going to say step by one and I'm
going to print this out to the screen
well now you get okay this is Python 3
so I have to call a list function on
this so I'm not going to do it here it's
going to make things slightly more okay
you know what I'm just gonna do it there
just to show you guys but I'm gonna do
it in idle to keep things simple and how
Python 2 works so I'm going to call
range of 0 comma 1 o 1 comma 1 and you
can see that it's created a list from 0
to 100 that's a total of 101 elements
and it steps by 1 so if I do step by 2
now you get all the even numbers pretty
cool right so you get all the even
numbers and you can if you're if you're
thinking like you're like feeling kind
of like Aristotle you can go hmm what is
the sum of all the even numbers from 0
to 100 well how can you do that simple
just call the some function on that
range and that gives you the sum of all
the even numbers from 0 to 100 right
it's not cool okay if you did 3 you get
the idea right now you get every third
number okay so it's kind of nice how it
works
and if you wanted to get the odd numbers
well you can set start from 1 and then
step by 2 and now you'll get all the odd
numbers so 1 3 5 7 9 11 all up to 99 and
if you wanted to get their sum you do
the same trick so effectively all range
does is create a list the first argument
to start the second one is stop and the
third one is step you can also step by
well in this case you can't step by a
negative number but I'll show you guys
certain things you can do let's see if
we can create it backwards what do you
think will happen if I actually change
the numbers right what happens then
right so here if I go go from 101 all
the way to 2 but step backwards by 2
that's what you get so it steps
backwards and it goes 101 99-97 and so
on and so forth okay so if you're if
you're younger or you get in punishment
medieval-style and they go right from 0
to 100 simply open a Python do this and
then send it in not like it's the thing
anymore but hey back in the day would
have helped you cool in all cases the
range function returns the list this is
the most important part to remember guys
it returns a list okay just understand
whenever you see range don't leave it
like that in your mind because going to
complicate you understand that it turns
into a list which is a very familiar
data structure in our minds right when
we worked with it quite a bit each item
increases by step if omitted started to
falls to 0 and step defaults to 1 okay
on line 6 yeah step defaults to 1
because it steps by one element by
default remember
when we weren't passing in the step
argument is just going up by one every
time so if we set a range of 0 through
11 and we go 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 but
if we pass in step then it will change
the amount of steps it takes all right
on line 6 replace the blank with the
range that returns the list containing 0
1 2 so I'm going to pass in range 0 to 3
right this evaluates to 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 it's the
same thing as putting that in but it's
just in a cooler way so now we're
passing it in a list of 3 elements first
being 0 second being one third be 2 and
then what it does is it passes that in
right here right so it goes 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 and
everywhere it sees X it's essentially 0
1 &amp;amp; 2 Len of 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 will give us 3 0 2
3 will give us again 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 X of 4 I
write is first times 0 that's 0 that's 0
that says make the first element in the
list X equal to what it was and then
times 2 so here our list originally was
actually just 0 0 times 2 this gives you
0 so that stays at 0 but one will become
2 &amp;amp; 2 will become 4 so at the end it
will return a list like this ok make
make sure to keep making it a habit of
stepping through algorithms kind of like
I'm doing here trust me will make you so
much better and the reason why you
should do this practice over and over
again so your brain doesn't have to
think of really menial tasks like these
small tasks and spend time processing it
because it'll stop you from thinking
about bigger ideas right if you're
trying to develop an app or you're
trying to build something bigger
you don't want to get bogged down by
very simple things like computational
algorithmic basic steps o X goes and
so second X of 2 will give me the third
element no it'll give me the second
element you don't want to be confused by
such basic things so practice this so
much that your brain gets DS instantly
so you can focus on hmm should I use a
recursive algorithm here or should I use
this what arguments is my function going
to depend on you want to be able to
think it you want to relieve your brain
to think at a higher level that's the
reason why you should practice it ok and
that's why you shouldn't take pride in
oh I'm just getting to 100 percent
completion yes you should take pride in
I'm really turning this out and really
learning the fundamentals ok cool start
next lesson iterating over a list in a
function ok so I think this video has
went on for a little bit so I'm going to
stop right here I keep forgetting to say
but I'm gonna say it I find those
youtubers annoying but I think I'm gonna
say it because it helps me reach more
people so please if you guys like the
video you know just give it a little
thumbs up takes two seconds and if you
really enjoyed and you want to see
future videos please subscribe down
