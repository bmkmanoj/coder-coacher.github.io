clever programmer comm and today
something super exciting just happened
and I wanted to share that with you guys
as soon as I found out so as you guys
know at clever programmer we have
training courses tutorials projects
exercises and all that great stuff and
we have over three plus thousand
students enrolled at the clever
programmer school pretty much coding
program whatever you want to call it but
what's something even more exciting that
happened is that the service that I was
using now released an app so what you
guys can do now is if you're taking all
the courses you can also now take them
on the app so let me just show you so if
you are enrolled in my course the clever
programmer calm download the app called
teachable and here's how it works so I'm
gonna open it up and once you open up
you'll see your school and you'll see
all the courses you are enrolled in so
let's say that you see the learn Python
picker course for beginners and you're
enrolled in that simply click it and
look at how gorgeously it just pops open
all those things for you you can scroll
down write whatever it's all simple but
their app is super fast so let's say we
go to our hello world video and you can
see that are already opened up and then
I'm gonna hit the play button to play
the video and then it kind of plays it
like right away right so let me kind of
X out of that and once you're done
watching your lesson you can hit
complete and continue and then it marks
that is complete and star see on the
next one or if there's a lesson that
you're kind of stuck on you want to come
back to later for example just hit skip
okay and again look at how fast it kind
of deals with all those things right and
you're just going through all of these
videos so this is great you're on the go
you need to follow the tutorials follow
the courses boom done and then same
thing with if you're enrolled in any of
my other courses right my code Academy
Python walkthrough course for example
loads the same way click it and then
boom you start watching everything
alright guys I just wanted to share that
with you I thought
was so cool comment below if you are
taking the course or about to and think
this was cool this is valuable again
this app is for free completely scald
teachable and go ahead download it it's
for iOS and I'm sorry if you watch the
video until now just to find that out
but for now it's only for iOS and
probably soon they'll release it for
Android held under system so thank you
guys so much for watching as always I
love every single one of you and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
