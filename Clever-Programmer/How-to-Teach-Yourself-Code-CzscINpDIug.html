of the doubt because I don't think that
you're stupid looking up something like
how to teach yourself to code there are
million resources I'm sure you were able
to find some but that's also exactly the
problem because there is an overwhelming
amount of information out there I'm
gonna guide you through all of the stuff
that's not good versus the stuff that's
actually really useful that's what's
going to be covered in the video today
hey guys what's up this is Kylie from
clever programmer comm let's talk about
how to teach yourself code now teaching
yourself how to code is very difficult
the number of resources out there is
actually just totally overbearing and
overwhelming you have like a myriad of
resources as soon as you search for
anything related to code code Kadim
EECOM pops up udacity.com pops up course
Ericom pops up a Dexcom pops up and oh
my god
team tree house team tree house comm
pops up so you really have a million
resources out there where you can
actually go and learn computer
programming so I guess you don't need to
watch this video anymore because she
gave you all the resources I'm just
kidding the point is that even with all
of these resources you want to narrow
down your learning because a very common
problem that people face is actually
something called a learning bench which
is great because that's something that I
always do I'm like I want to learn this
and I want to learn that there's like so
many different programming languages out
there there are so many different
resources I want to be enrolled in all
of them I want to be subscribed to all
the podcasts and all the blog posts and
just kind of have a firehose have it be
directed at my brain to the point where
even if it's not making sense I would
try to keep going but my point here is
to kind of guide you through all of that
now at this point you might be wondering
who is
this guy and why should I follow his
advice I am somebody who has actually
been through a lot of these so what I
want to do is kind of cut through the
crap and get you the right information
so you can get started without being
overwhelmed by not the number of options
if you guys look up code Academy Python
my videos ranked number one so I have
been through code Kadim II as a matter
of fact I've been through it all I have
certifications from Coursera university
or Coursera the MOOC on udacity.com
I've completed the cs50 course on EDX
and I have dabbled a little bit in team
treehouse and I have done a bunch of
other stuff on like so many more
websites related to computer programming
I also happen to be one of the top
instructors for computer programming at
take lessons with over 30 testimonials
but let's get done with this boring part
I have been through it and I want to
kind of help you out narrow your path
focus your learning so you can spend
less time researching and more time
actually learning okay so before I kind
of give you a good solution to a lot of
these problems I want to discuss some
common problems that exist so number one
is almost all of other courses out there
or boring as hell they're made by
somebody who's like sitting behind the
screen with a screen cast and they're
just like sitting there and talking
about something and they don't treat you
like you're you're a human being
but computer programming courses while
I'm sorry guys I take that back
because this guy he doesn't even know
the meaning of born all right so I'm
super excited okay guys let's let's
check it out all right let's let's check
out let's check out this course okay
let's do it
damn did you guys see that intro did you
guys see that intro what let's let's
check it out again let's check it out
again both healthy or programming
language damn boy thank you that was
smooth
that was reals why I want my students to
learn the are programming language over
the years I have learned and taught to
great many computer languages including
Fortran basic Pascal SAS SPS or I hope
you you guys kind of get a sense of what
I was talking about um anyways no videos
like these for you guys yes huh one
hundred and twenty thousand views with
five hundred and thirty-nine like what
hundred and twenty thousand views you
guys what that's unbelievable
you want somebody to talk to you guide
you and make you go through that process
because especially when you're starting
out that's what you need I know that
because that's what I needed when I was
starting out I needed somebody there to
kind of almost almost be there
physically but that's impossible if
you're trying to do it through the
internet but there are ways somebody can
connect with you and one good way is
that there's a human being treating you
like a human being and not just hiding
behind a screen cast and speaking to you
in a very monotonous and boring home so
that is one common problem in a lot of
these courses number two
these do not center around beginners
okay so a lot of these courses will be
called 101 even in courses in college
are called 101 a lot of the times but
they don't scale gradually the scale is
kind of like broken it's almost like a
stepwise function in mathematics which
means that the lines aren't like
connected and there
a gradual increase is kind of crazy it's
like you know it's like exponential
difficulty scale so that say their
center around beginners but they take
really a lot of things for granted and
skip over a lot of little steps which
leave you frustrated and sometimes you
think that you're dumb because again I
know because I felt really stupid taking
a lot of these either bla like following
these blog guides or following these
videos I would think hey maybe I'm just
really stupid and those things that
they're taking for granted or they're
taking it for granted for a good reason
and I should have just known it in the
first place but it turns out that that's
not really true this should teach you
those things because there's no other
way you would have learned them and this
shouldn't assume that specially when
you're starting out so that's one
problem taking things for granted now I
want to talk about problem number three
feedback is slow as hell okay
so in most of these courses that you're
taking you get stuck in a problem or you
want to try out some new idea that you
came up with but where do you get
feedback for it well the best solution
that you come up with after a lot of
contemplation is hmm maybe I'll just
post it in the forum's so then you start
thinking about an intelligent way to put
together the question so then you can
post it in the forums before you know it
a half an hour is passed while you're
trying to compose this brilliant
question because after all you don't
want those snarky intelligent people on
the internet laughing at you do you so
you do the next best thing is you tell
yourself wow this has taken me way too
long and what the heck was I even doing
thinking about posting a question and
the forum's in the first place forget it
so you give up and ultimately you skip
that part of the course and you move on
well what happens when you skip that
part of the course and move on you are
missing a fundamental
piece of understanding everything that
you learn after this is going to be much
weaker and is going to basically not
build itself on top of what you
previously learn and therefore the new
knowledge is really not going to be any
knowledge at all
and you're going to start getting very
confused with the more advanced concepts
because in the middle your knowledge is
very weak and ultimately what ends up
happening you actually quit the entire
course okay guys and this is the horn
Tooting section what does that mean well
it just simply means that I want to toot
my own horn something I don't like to do
very much but hey what it's called for
you got to do it right you got to step
up to the occasion and you got a toot
your horn I took all of those things
into account the the feedback being slow
the courses being extremely boring the
lessons not being catered towards
beginners and I decided to build
something that resolves all those
problems so I'm going to show you guys
just a little bit of a sneak peek into
my own course I I've created my own
coding school called clever programmer
and I want you to just take a look at it
and see what you think
all right so I want to give you a little
sneak peek of my website so you go to
clever programmer com
okay now let's say you go to the learn
Python course you have the entire
curriculum in front of you okay
so you can do exercises you can go
projects or you can go step by step
linearly how I have put it together for
you so let's say you go to lesson zero
right it's a little bit slower because
I'm doing a screencast here so for two
questions why are you so beautiful and
what the heck was I just talking about
today we're gonna learn how to install
Python in less than five minutes so
let's get started all right super cool
cool guy with the cool intro let's just
walk in for a little bit
super dope but that's not what's
important what's important is that when
I'm talking about coding and Python and
stuff like that right let's say that I'm
doing five plus five is ten ten times
twenty is 200 you could be like right
here and you can actually go five plus
five okay and for example hit print put
print around it and run and you can
actually see on the right hand side it
says ten okay you can do the same thing
for ten times twenty ten times twenty
boom you see that right there so you get
to code live with me while watching how
cool is that right you don't need
anything installed and you don't even
need to leave that space where the video
is you can actually be doing that at the
same time right just talking and you
should prob talking in your excellent
code and if you type in five so super
cool then you can go and leave a comment
below or whatever right that's pretty
obvious but now what isn't obvious is
let's say that you're watching this part
and you are stuck you're like hey what
is that thing that you just opened with
the black screen I don't know what that
is you know that's kind of confusing me
and so you just click this button and
you go hey what's that black thing with
green letters right you're truly
confused and I go well that's just the
terminal silly so that's so simple right
but it gives you that immediate feedback
and it ends up being one of the most
powerful tools and I have as of now this
feature was implemented fairly recently
but even up until now I've seen some
tremendous benefits of this with
students and I'm getting countless
feedback from student and telling me how
much they love this feature and how much
it's helping them okay so check it out
test us out
maybe this feature could be helpful to
you as well
okay so that's a little bit of a sneak
peek of my website hopefully you guys
found this to be an official and
enlightening and awesome and the two
Hornung list goes on these courses are
centered around beginners so I actually
start teaching you visually I use a tool
called turtle which is a module and it
actually builds things graphically as we
learn them so when I'm showing you the
process of looping over we're actually
making a circle out of squares this way
you're not like oh your answer was
supposed to be eighty-seven point six
nine nine nine two this way if your
turtle isn't making a circle out of
squares then you automatically know that
your code is wrong so you're getting
some fast feedback now the another most
important thing I want to share with you
is three feedback being extremely fast
you see that blue button at the bottom
right corner click that and you can
speak to me directly like we're text
messaging like we're best buddies okay I
try to make it as simple as possible you
can almost think of it like a mentor
being alongside you as you're learning
so this is a very powerful tool that you
guys can leverage so you learn what you
need when you need okay because that's
key so I want you guys to sign up for
the learn Python course if you're
interested go to the school check it out
okay so let's say that your goal is not
to learn Python let's say your goal is
not to learn anything that is on my
website or you simply don't like me
whatever the reason may be I want to
offer you something valuable I want to
give you good resources and good places
to get started off with maybe your the
choice of what you're learning is
different so if you want to start off
with let's say web development you want
to do things on the front end you want
to do things on the back end
and you want to do stuff with HTML or
CSS or JavaScript why are you even here
you should be at free code camp okay
free code camp is an unbelievable place
to go to for learning all web
development stuff web development go to
free code camp they will help you out
that will help you build projects that
will help you build portfolios they are
absolutely great
okay back-end development and if you are
starting out again my website is going
to be a really good resource for you
because Python can be used for the
backend okay and it's a good language to
start off with and if you guys haven't
seen my video what programming language
should I learn first
you guys should view that because it'll
help you give an overall view of what
what's something that you should start
off with and he'll tell you also about
other programming languages and their
benefits so hopefully that gives you a
little bit of a better view of how to go
about it okay now I want to mention a
few resources for you guys Coursera is a
pretty good resource okay but my list my
order of the resources that are
recommending them in is if there's
something on Udacity you should go to
Udacity first because Udacity honestly
has the best introductory courses why
they're very high quality production
okay and uh they are very clear and to
the point but they're not rigorous so
they give you a little taste of what's
to come
and what you can do so you can start
learning about those things in Udacity
and then you can take the next level of
that course say it Coursera where things
are a little bit more rigorous so
Coursera you have a lot of deadlines you
have courses it's a little bit more
academic
okay but not like school because school
just focuses on regurgitation and doing
well on quizzes but it doesn't care
about you remembering these things and
retaining this information actually
using this to get employed okay so
Coursera's that's not what I mean when I
say academic for Coursera okay what I
just mean is that Coursera
is a little bit more structured after
Coursera something even more rigorous
but again something a very valuable
resource is EDX so if you want to just
take it right to the next level from the
get-go and you want to have quizzes and
grades and instructors and all of that
and a lot of rigor go to EDX okay that
website has pre rigorous courses they're
very intense but you will come out
pretty good but again I want to
emphasize that you want to make sure
you're having fun the entire time you're
coding because that's the number one
factor in getting anybody good at
something you want to make sure you're
having fun while you're doing it
because eventually you will quit if you
don't like anybody who's rational won't
do those kinds of crazy things you have
to have fun in a way where it's
irrational right Steve Jobs said
something along those lines
um because those guys wouldn't be doing
what they did if they didn't find it fun
okay so with Udacity Coursera and EDX
out of the way there are some other
resources that are pretty cool like team
treehouses another resource that you can
go to but I cannot personally recommend
it because I haven't used team treehouse
anyways guys I appreciate you
every single one of you please if you
would so wish to remain on YouTube go
ahead and check out my Python tutorial
go ahead and check out some recent stuff
that's been going on and make sure to
subscribe to the damn channel and forth
if you want to enroll here's the link
