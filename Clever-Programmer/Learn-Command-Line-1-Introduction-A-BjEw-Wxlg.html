clever programmer calm so the day has
come
unfortunately I've been trying to
protect you guys from learning about
this one thing for a long time now we've
been doing our programming tutorials on
Python we've been making some other fun
videos but you guys have to learn one of
the most amazing things you can learn
computer programming and actually one of
the most important and fundamental
things it's called the command line okay
so you guys have to actually learn this
no matter how much you try to avoid it
so I have thought about and try to put
together different ways of how you can
learn it and I have found the best
resource for you guys to learn this okay
because I know this can be a little bit
dry but once you start getting a little
bit of hang of it it's probably the most
fun thing because it gives you some
magical powers you can essentially do
things around your entire computer
without leaving the keyboard and one
window you can delete things you can
download things you can distribute
things throughout your entire computer
you can have processes that can save
things for you automatically
you can run automated tasks like putting
something into your computer and then it
sends it to some other place
automatically for you that you have done
so it does give you some tremendous
power without it you actually won't even
be able to do things like web
development or software development so
let's jump right into it and start
learning about the command line so this
resource you can see up at the top it's
the link is this Web da MIT edu slash
blah blah blah I'll put that in the
description below so you guys can go to
it directly but let's just jump into it
and start playing around with it okay so
I do want you guys to play around with
this game first and get a hang of it and
then when you start actually learning
the command line things will make a lot
of sense and you'll be kind of ready to
go right from the start so
okay let's see what kind of options is
giving us okay it says look at your
surroundings with the command LS so the
command LS in the Linux command line or
whatever actually really stands you know
I forget what it stands for but
essentially it's for listing files or
listing things so you get to see where
you are okay so if you are currently in
the directory like user slash whatever
slash Kazi and maybe you have documents
or whatever around you LS is the way you
actually look around okay so let's go
ahead and type that in so I typed in LS
and you can see it's showing me some
different locations around me it's
showing me this green land with the big
building so what can we do with this it
says here are your locations Western
forests northern meadow MIT and then you
have some items like welcome letter okay
so what can we do to this what can we do
with this information so to move to a
new location you can do CD location so
that's the equivalent of actually moving
into a directory CD stands for change
directory so let's change our directory
okay so let's go into maybe the Western
forest and I want to see what's there
let's go CD western forest and now in
command line you don't actually have to
complete the whole command if you're
partway right with what you're trying to
do you can just hit tab and it will
autocomplete it for you so I just did
CDW E and I just hit tab and it
auto-completed it for me another reason
maman does website is because if you
have Windows you are going to run into
some terminal and command line problems
this avoids that so when you're learning
it you're not being distracted by
anything and then you can download
something called git bash that's GI T
bash you can download that and then play
around with the same command line that
essentially dub Linux or Mac books or
Ubuntu they offer you okay so let's keep
going
CD western force so now I'm in the
western forest I
don't see anything I'm kind of blind so
every time I move into a new location
the first thing I should try to do is
maybe look around right that's what you
do when you enter a new room so let's do
that let's hit LS again without even
thinking I want to get into this rectory
he'll hit LS so you've moved into
Western forests you enter and travel
deep into the forest
eventually the path leads to a clearing
with the large impressive building a
sign on it reads spell-casting Academy
the elite school of magic all right so
we look around and we see some trees we
see this big building in the back what
what is that all about maybe I want to
go explore that so here I have
spell-casting Academy that's a location
I can go to and I have some items sign
and back sign hmm how can I read these
items okay so for example if I actually
opened up my terminal right let's let's
just do this live so let me open up my
terminal no thank you I don't need any
updates right now and you can see I have
a lot of stuff around me right anaconda
application sea line projects desktop
and all this right so if I want to
actually change into one of these
directories I can do CD documents and
that will take me to that directory but
notice I don't see what files are in
documents so to do that well what
command can I actually hit to look
around me if you've been following along
so far you will know that the command is
LS so I will do LS and hit enter and I
can look around me I see Adobe I see
chess tastic I see clever programmer I
see the directory Final Cut Pro and to
show you guys this in real life kind of
what it looks like is let me open up my
finder here and let me go to documents
where is documents documents right there
and you can see adobe is the first one
right and now we see that right there
then we got chess tastic we see that
clever programmer Final Cut Pro and you
guys get the idea so we're actually
changing directories changing things
kind of right from within the terminal
okay and then later I'll show you guys
how to do things like run your Python
script right from the terminal but right
now I'm just trying to get you guys the
idea and make you guys comfortable with
it
okay so that's how LS is working right
in your command line okay
command line terminal I will be
interchangeably using these terms so
don't get confused I'm essentially
saying the same thing okay now how do I
read something right so what if we have
something to read like for example
products underscore export one that does
not look like a directory that looks
like a file so how would I read that
well I think I can do less do products
on export and hit numbers and yes see it
anyways so it is a binary file so it
doesn't make sense to actually see it
but you can see that if you do less I'll
show you so less is essentially for
showing you the contents of the file so
if you get some txt file with some text
in it you can actually take a peek in it
without getting inside of it so if we
want to look at our items sign and back
signs perhaps we can use the less
command so less sign hit tab to
autocomplete don't type it all in
because you will make a mistake or a
typo and also because you're lazy and
you don't want to type that much right I
know I am so let's hit less sign and we
see this spell casting Academy the elite
sign is elite school of magic today only
free introductory lessons novice is
welcome okay cool let's read about back
sign if you ever want to go directly
home just type CD with the squiggly or
just plain old CD and you'll get back
home getting back home might be more
getting back might be more difficult
though hmm
so let's see right now I'm in this
forest right but initially when we
started we were in some other location
where we could have gone to Western
forests right so right now we're going
to rest Western force how can we go back
well let's hit CD and let's see if it
takes us back say del s and we
can see that we're back now let's do the
same thing in our terminal so we make
sure that what we're learning in this
play environment is actually in tune
with our actual environment in our
computer so let's hit you can see that
I'm in this directory documents this
probably is not my home directory as a
matter of fact it's not so let me hit CD
and let's just go back to our home
directory so anytime I'm lost and I'm
too deep in some directory I can always
hit CD and get back home ok so now if I
look I'm back home alright
well there's one more cool thing so at
the top they introduce the command
called PWD and that command shows you
where you are so whenever you are lost
and you want to know exactly what your
location is what your address is you can
hit PWD it's the equivalent of going on
to Google and looking up where am i
right now
ok that's what your pwe D is and how you
read it is actually print working
directory so if I open up my terminal
again and I do PWD you can see tells me
I'm in slash users slash s tastic well
that's my home directory if I go back to
documents hit tab come here if I do PWD
you can see it goes slash user slash
just astok slash documents ok so maybe
you guys are getting more of the idea so
I wanted to introduce you guys with the
LS command that's the one you always use
like without even thinking I wanted to
introduce you to the CD command the
change directory command so you can
actually move back and forth leave a
room and come back to our room and then
I wanted to tell you PWD which is
essentially where are you ok so that's
it for this video and in the next video
I'll show you guys how you can actually
run your own scripts alright guys I'll
see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
