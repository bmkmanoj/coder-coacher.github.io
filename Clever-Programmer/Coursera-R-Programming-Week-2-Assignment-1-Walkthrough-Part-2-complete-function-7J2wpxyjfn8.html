clever programmer calm where we learn to
code smarter today we're going to be
talking about Coursera week to
assignment one part two where we will
learn to complete the complete function
okay
so before we get started the most
important thing to understand is the
problem itself okay
so first let's make sure we understand
what it's saying when I was going
through this course a while ago it was
confusing to me what the problems were
saying most of the times and because I
took less time to think of what the
problem was actually saying I ended up
spending more time coding incorrectly so
I will try to break down what the
problem means we have here part to write
a function that reads a directory full
of files I'm sure you guys have read it
so I'm not going to read it word for
word but essentially what we're trying
to do is we're trying to get a write of
function it read a directory okay so we
have like a bucket full of files now
there are a lot of files in there
specifically there are 332 files okay if
you have downloaded the folder called
spec data you have 332 files in there we
need to run through each of them so
let's look at what it looks like for
example I have a week two here right and
I have my spec data and the files that i
download it look like this each file has
it's basically comma separated files
okay if I open it up in Excel it looks
like nice tables in reality it's all
separated by commas okay just if I could
show you what it looks like this is what
it looks like you see two thousand three
two thousand three one one comma and a
comma and a comma one and that gets
rendered as a nice little table
right here and if I open it up in Excel
it would look the same way I just want
to open an excel because Excel will open
it slower so here's what you have right
now what they want you to do is count
the number of complete cases you have
three hundred and thirty two of these
files okay all with different amounts of
data all of them talking about sulphate
and nitrate right or at least most of
them let's go down yep I think all of
them talk about sulphate and nitrate
what is a complete case first of all a
complete case is a case where all of the
data in that given row is completed okay
for example the first row you have na na
which means non you know I forgot what
the a stands for essentially you don't
have any data there so you have this in
as incomplete this is incomplete so this
row is not a complete case now let's
come to the second row is this for a
complete case nope
let's come down to the third row is this
one a complete case nope let's keep
going down here we see our first
complete case we have 5.99 we got 0.42
eight and we have four i D
one wise ID one probably because it's
the first file so they just decided to
make it ID one okay so we got five point
nine nine zero point four two eight
again we have another complete case
right over here four point six eight one
point zero four right those are all the
complete cases now if we were to go by
hand and count all of these complete
cases well what would be the answer what
would we get how many complete cases are
there and how we need to show the answer
is also important so here oops I should
actually keep that open that looks good
now if I go an example output of what is
supposed to give us so if we write our
function
called complete and if we run it and we
give it like okay run on this directory
spec data and I want you to run for just
the first file okay I only want you to
run one time and for the first file it
should run through it should tell you
that the file id was one and it should
also tell you that the number of
complete cases found were 117 this
column is confusing it's called nobs it
should really just be called complete
cases I think they did that maybe to
throw you off
unless nobs has some kind of definition
though I'm unaware of so it should give
you a column with ID and a column with a
column saying knobs and now there should
be the number of complete cases for that
given file so for example for the second
file you have thousand forty one
complete cases for the fourth file you
have 474 complete cases okay so
hopefully we understand what the problem
is asking us notice also how they pass
it right they said look for the second
filed and look for the fourth file then
look for the eighth file ten and twelve
that's why you got a search for two four
eight ten and twelve now we don't know
how this function is working but we do
see how this function is supposed to
work okay so now we're going to worry
about the actual implementation details
and see how we implement it so let's go
over to our console and our okay so
first thing we want to do is we want to
get right we want to get let's bring
this right over here
first thing we want to do is we want to
get all of these files we want to have
them somewhere so then we can run
through them okay so first thing you
need to do is check where you are
currently I bet a lot of people if
you're new to programming specially
you're probably in some wrong directory
and you're just like racking your brain
what the heck do I do but you're most
likely in the wrong directory and unable
to pull the file so make sure that
you're in the right directory so for
example
my get WD told me where I currently am
okay so let's just follow this path so
it says I'm in users which is like all
the way back here alright so at the
bottom left you see users right and now
I'm in Macintosh HD users then it says
go to rah face so I'm going to click on
Rafi then it says go to Dropbox so I'm
gonna go to Dropbox wherever it is where
are you Dropbox here it is now I'm gonna
go down to where it says github and then
it says Coursera so I'm going to find
where a Coursera is found it says our
programming found that and that's where
we are but we should go even further we
should go in week two so we're actually
right in the same directory as this
folder called spec data so what I'm
gonna do here is I'm going to say set WD
and it takes a directory as an argument
since I'm already all the way here I can
just give it a relative directory okay
so the difference between an absolute
path and a relative path is that if I'm
already here I can just say like spec
data instead of having to say slash
users okay instead of having to say
slash users slash Rafi slash Dropbox
slash all the way up to our programming
and then spec data I can just say spec
data right now because I'm already there
it's almost like saying if I'm here and
some things to my right I can just say
to my right but if I was in another
country I can't just say to my right I
would have to give the absolute path
right after you get the longitude and
the latitude or like specific Google map
type of directions a the directories and
our computers work very similar way
because they're made by humans the
programming is done by humans that's
what I mean ok so I'm going to set my
directory to spec data actually it's not
giving me a match so hopefully oh sorry
weak - right
hit tab because then it will give you a
match so I'm gonna say I'm going to set
my directory to that now at the top here
in the console you see it says Dropbox /
github / Coursera / our programming /
week - the squiggly here just means a
slash user slash Rafi so this part here
is my home so that's actually defined by
that little squiggly there at least in
Mac and you know Mac OS okay so if I did
get WD now I should see that I'm in week
2 that's good now I can do LS to see
what's around me ok it's kind of like
I'm looking around so if I look around I
have all these things like file list
plus functions so let me just check if
that matches what I found in my finder
or in your Windows is like your Windows
Explorer or whatever um is there file
list near me somewhere or any of these
things a data um none of that is there
but OLS is mostly telling is it telling
me my local variables or something
because it's not showing me anything in
here um okay so LS is in this case I
think showing me something like my
variables or something it's not
necessarily showing me everything that's
in here which is what LS does on your
terminal but regardless of that we know
there were in the right place right we
have weak data we have week two and we
have week two right here so we know
we're in the correct place and then if
we go into speck data we'll go to all
these files so now we want to create a
list of all those files okay so that way
we have access to them and then we can
like maybe loop through it or something
and first of all let's take one file and
see what we need to do to get all the
complete cases cool so
let's take I can do file lists or I can
do like let's say read CSV and I can
give it a file name so I can say back
data and I can give it this file zero
zero one dot CSV so I'm saying hey I
know I'm in week two which is like this
whole directory right here right with
all these things
and then I'm saying I'll go to spec data
and then grab this file and read it and
it's a CSV right you see that
so I said zero zero one dot CSV so let's
see what happens when I read this file
it basically reads the entire file
however I didn't save it to a variable
so it's kind of lost
so I let's just say I hate the variable
X I'll never ever use it I hate those
one letter variables I try to avoid them
almost all programmers try to avoid them
because they just create a world very
convoluted world so avoid one letter
variables at all costs name them
something even if it slows you down get
in the habit of naming meaningful
variable names it'll save you in the
long run okay let me do data and let me
see what it gives me essentially you can
see here that it gave me that file right
it gave me that file so if I look at the
last record 2006 1231 right let's scroll
all the way down 2006 1231 we have na
and a and then I have one at the end
there right there right so we are
actually able to read the actual file
that's great now how do we get the
number of cases that are all complete
well um so we know that data right is
that file so let's do this thing
call complete cases on data and let's
run it okay so here what it gives us is
a boolean vector boolean vector just
means something it's like a list or a
vector and at each element its
containing false and true each place is
containing a true that's where the
actual value that's where it's a
complete case so for example in this row
here right I think this is 289 so this
is 290 in road 291 if you look you
should have a row where all of the cases
are complete that's what the complete
that case is function does it looks for
each row that's complete so everywhere
in our table right of 14 that file has 4
14 1441 records so everywhere it saw
that it was a complete case it put it
true and everywhere it saw that it
wasn't a complete case it put a false
now if you know a little bit more you
know that true is really one right it's
like a secret one and false is a zero
using that knowledge we can simply sum
up this vector right if you had some
vector and you did some of some vector
like 5 comma 4 you would get its sum
just like that this whole thing even
though it looks huge and complicated
it's the same vector as C 5 comma 4 so
if you call a sum on it it'll sum up all
of the ones
once it's sum up sums up all of the ones
you essentially have your complete cases
so let's do a call some on this right
because this whole thing once it gets
evaluated it turns into that giant
vector with 1441 values so I'm just
going to call some on that once it gets
a value to that and you get 117 and if
we go back and you look once
when they ran it on their first file
that indeed got back 117 complete
completely observed cases okay so we
know we're on the right path we know our
logic is correct now there are some more
implementation details that you have to
worry about we have to make it so it
loops through and does all those files
maybe at the same time right how can we
do that whenever you think of something
that requires repetition you think you
should think of loops they're very
helpful the idea is the same we need
this thing to happen over and over again
loops more specifically in our case for
loops is what we're going to be looking
for so we want to be able to go through
each of these files now for us to be
able to go through each of these files
we need to have each of these files on
hand so let's create a variable call
like file list and store all these files
in there so I'm going to show you first
of all there's this method called list
add files and it essentially lists all
the files in a given directory so how it
works is it takes a path and then it
takes a um write it does full names and
it also takes a pattern okay so let's
break it down one step at a time so
first of all let's keep pattern in there
and let's put path in there okay so I'm
going to show you guys what it does okay
now again I'm in week two so I need to
go into spec data and then I need to
pull out something so I'm gonna say spec
data that's the file I want you to go to
that's a folder I want you to go to and
in that folder I want you to list all of
the files okay just to check again what
I'm talking about
I'm telling it hey I want you to go into
this folder spec data and give me all of
the files
put them in a vector for me cool and I'm
going to hit run okay so if I do file
lists and I do this let's call the
function length on file list you can see
that the length is 332 which matches the
length of this right there are 332 files
in here so great we got all of the files
now what's the point of pattern why
should we use pattern well it's a good
idea to use pattern because you pad with
pattern you specify what kind of files
you want so just in case you had some
other files like I don't know dot MOV
file in here like a movie file an HTML
file and bunch other crap it would
ignore all of the other files then
simply look for all the files that have
CSV appended to them so that's why we
want to use pattern like in our case
here and here it doesn't make a
difference we'll still get the same file
list but you want to use it just to be
more correct and especially if you want
to run it on something other than this
you know project that we're doing okay
so that's all great but we still can
access the complete file because we
don't have um we don't have the complete
path so it's great that we have the
entire ABI file name but it would be
better if we had the entire path like
the absolute path to each of these files
that way we can refer to them from any
directory and it would work all the time
ok we need anywhere and refer to them
what I mean is right now to work with
them our directory would have to be this
folder called spec data and then it
wouldn't work because it'll be like oh
yeah I know where 183 is and I know
water 184 and 185 is but like let's say
you were in our programming folder so
like this folder here and you said look
or 3:10 if you like there is no 310 I
don't see it anywhere so you know or if
you were even in week 2 and not inspect
it and you said look for 310 it would
have no idea where it is you would have
to be inspected oh so let's try to get
the full name of the full path name so
let's do full dot names is equal to true
it's false by default oh yeah true is
all caps right and now let's do file
list and you can see their full path so
in this case relative to wherever you
were it gave you the full path to them
how to get to them from where you are so
that's really helpful because if your
program is running wherever it is it'll
give you the full path from that
location all the way it understood that
we're currently in the folder week two
so the path that we need the full path
is spec data and that ok cool so it
doesn't give you absolute path but it
gives you like a relative full path ok
so this is really good news for us we
have gotten all of the data that we need
right now like let's say that I wanted
to read one of these files I can do read
dot CSV and I can do file list of let's
break it down file list of one will give
me the first file file list of two would
give me the second file so I can just do
read that CSV file list of like let's
say 1 and it reads that file and like on
that I can say give me the number of
complete cases and then on that I can
call a function sum ok so here I'm
calling read CSV on the first file which
is spec data slash yours your one CSV
right I call read dot CSV on that so now
it read all of that once it reads all of
that I want to call the complete cases
function so it creates that boolean
vector with true and false and once it
does all that I'd say call the function
sum on that boolean vector and then it
sums up all of the
and gives me back that there were 117
cases which were complete 117 rows which
were complete okay nice right that's
really cool we were able to do that now
this part remains the same what's the
only thing that changes every single
time it's just that right that's the
thing that needs to change every single
time the rest of the code remains the
same so we should replace that with a
variable the very definition of variable
is something that changes right so you
know the word varies so in this case one
should not be a constant hard-coded you
see how I broke this part down into its
little pieces right it's really a bunch
of problems combined together and the
main problem happens when you try to
tackle all of it at once right the
biggest problem I see people doing is
distort the code here in this part right
away don't start writing a script right
away when you have no idea what's going
on languages like R and Python are
absolutely amazing for this very reason
because they let you they have something
called an interactive terminal so you
get to have immediate feedback for
everything that you do no matter how
stupid it is you get to try it out here
and check it and see if it works
so you experiment your ideas here and
you try things here and once they work
then you go and try to write a script
that summarizes your thought process in
a succinct manner that's what a script
is all right so don't be trying to write
a script right away do this here solve
the problem in the terminal for at least
one or two cases and then you can
summarize that right in the script
anyways let's keep going so you saw I
created file list right created that
vector essentially then access the first
guy which is the path so this unwind it
right it unwound as a path so you know
this value got put in for that
value right there then read that this
week a call on that so on and so forth
so what we want to do is we want to
essentially run for all of these right
we want to be able to run for every
single one of these guys okay how do we
do that that's what we need to figure
out okay now another thing that could
change on us is the number of files they
want so they give us a variable like ID
which a user can put in right whatever
they want that thing to be so they can
ask for ten files or three files or only
the second and fourth and the seventh
file so we need a function that has like
a way to take care of that as well so
let's let's talk about that okay so
let's start I think we're at a good
point to start coding this up because we
have some idea on how to start summing
these up now another thing is that as we
sum these up we need to store it
somewhere right so let's just do one
example in the terminal and then we'll
go and do more examples we'll do more of
the coding up at the top so I'm going to
create like thing called knobs and
create a numeric vector so I'm
specifying hey you're a vector and you
can only have numbers in yourself okay
so that's really what it is just a
numeric vector all right so we have
knobs now every single time we get a
value we need to remember it yeah so
every single time we get the number of
complete cases because we need to
remember it we need to store it in a
list that's listed really good for that
so because otherwise you're going to
forget you're going to get hundred and
seventeen then the next time you're
going to run on the second file you're
going to get a thousand cases completed
maybe but you forgot about 117 and by
the time you get to the 332nd file
you've forgotten about the previous 231
files and only will spit out the result
of the 332nd file that's
not what you want to do so how we can do
this is up there we wrote this line
right that essentially gives you the
number of observed cases in the first
file well let's do this let's say Nobbs
is what if in the new knobs is going to
be is going to be a vector of what knobs
previously was which is an empty vector
and we're going to concatenate that with
this line up here which evaluates 217
right we want to actually do this 117
but that just hard codes it for only one
of the values that's not what we want so
let's go redefine knobs
now we make it a little bit more
abstract that works for all cases right
so let's go to where we're saying this
117 part this part really rolls right
this part unone wines in 217 and now if
I show you what knobs is whoops
you get 117 now we need to do the same
thing for the second file right and
knobs is now a thousand forty one what
did what happen this is essentially just
saying again knobs what now just
previously was which was 117 after this
line that we did here and then we just
concatenate the next complete case some
of the second file and if we just you
know run this again and replace this
with the three then run it again replace
it with the four run it again replace it
with the five six seven a and if we do
that maybe 332 times you should
essentially get back something that
looks like that 117,000 41 to 43 these
are the number of completely observed
cases in file one which is 117 file two
which is thousand 41 file 3 just turned
43 so on and so forth
great now we have a very repetitive
process that we've broken this down into
what does that sound like
sounds like a for loop let's do it so
let's define a function complete right
which is dependent on what path you give
it let's say that the path initially is
own we can say it's empty
right we can just say that the initial
path is um is empty optional argument
right optional argument then for the
second one what do we need right for
this function so actually a better name
for this would be directory because
we're depending on what directory the
user gives us right so we can just
remove that so first of all we need a
directory from the other person
unexpected end of argument should be
like this okay once we they gave us
their directory so for example we expect
them to put something like spec data
right as their first argument or respect
week to slash spec data or our
programming slash week to slash spec
data or something like that so that's
what we're expecting in directory now
what are we expecting in here well here
we're expecting an ID right which in
this case we can make it um right so if
they don't give us anything we're gonna
assume to just run through every single
file so these are your keyword arguments
which is if somebody doesn't give you
something some argument for this then by
default it's going to make ID equal to a
vector of 1 to 332
right ID is equal to 1 to 3 32 if I do
ID you get back boom right that whole
thing there you see okay great so we
have those things down that's good now
let's create our file list that we
create initially we're going to use that
function list that files it's dependent
on the path path is going to be the
directory the user passes it directory
is we're assuming again it's a string
now what else do we need we need a
pattern right a pattern so we're looking
for we're telling it look only for CSV
files in here so nothing else and again
we want to make our functions as less
error-prone as possible we don't want
the user to be really annoyed and our
function make mistakes we want it to be
like the user try to runs the function
and it just works magically ok and then
last thing is we want the full names to
be true ok great so now that creates our
list of files after we're done creating
our list of files we need to um
instantiate or initialize our knobs
variable to be a numeric vector all
numeric is doing is just saying hey
you're going to be a vector that only
contains numbers the reason why we're
creating a vector so we don't forget any
of the values as we run through the loop
we're storing it in this numeric vector
as we go along the files now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to write a loop
remember we're talking about a loop so
I'm going to set for I in ID and all it
does is it just runs through right
that's what a loop does it just runs
through every single value in the vector
so for example if you have 1 colon 3 3 2
right this essentially looks something
like I'm just
you know create a Python looking vector
here it looks like this right so the
first time I is going to be one dot dot
dot just to specify that it goes all the
way up to 332 first time I is going to
be one then I is going to be two that I
is going to be three demands gonna be
four okay so hopefully that part of the
loop is clear so I'm going to say for I
and I don't need to make this I I can
call it literally whatever I want as
long as I stay consistent but that would
be a very inconvenient variable name so
we'll stick with I I just don't want you
to think that I has some kind of magic
in it um yes I need to close that write
this on line eight the squiggly bracket
matches the squiggly bracket on line one
so that's important now as we go through
the loop that's essentially the eye part
is just that part where it says six
right here three right here right we
just want to increment that every single
time three four five six seven eight
that's RI it just gets incremented every
time and as you can see in our loop
that's going to be incrementing every
single time so let's create a variable
called data and say that we're going to
access file list of I and then we're
going to read it okay so here we create
our vector of files then we read
starting from the first file and we
store that data in data right and now
what we want to do is we want to say
nabs what knab's was
concatenated with some of complete cases
on that file data okay so this part just
does what we talked about right here
that's all that part is doing okay
except read that CSV part we just call
it the data in our more nicer and more
readable function and that's it we're
pretty much done right we got that whole
thing and last thing I want to show you
is if I do
knobs down here right we have one two
three four five six seven eight files we
got 117 complete cases for the first
1041 cases for the second one 243 cases
for the third one and 494 cases for the
fourth one we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 files
so if I do ID is equal to 1 colon 8 and
I do data frame right and I do knobs
just give it knobs it's going to create
a data frame with knobs and if I do data
frame ID common knobs you can see that
it creates a data frame with the first
column being all IDs and the second
column being all the complete cases so
it tells you the first file has one
complete K sorry 117 complete cases and
it tells you the seventh file has 440 to
complete cases ignore the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 on the left hand side that has nothing
to do with the ID is just a coincidence
that the file names begin with 1 but
imagine I wanted the files to begin from
v 1 and onwards then you had a 5 here
going up to some other number and you
would not and you would still have a 1
here so these are these have nothing to
do with what the ID and
abs are okay so essentially by the end
of this we have that vector that
contains all of the values that now just
supposed to contain all the complete
cases and we have all the IDS which user
gives us so it's really quite simple at
this point we can just simply say data
frame ID common knobs okay and that's up
that should be our function so are we
doing something funky here let's see
what is it complaining about unexpected
that in that unexpected
oh it was just some silly error here but
now I read this fine another one I would
tell you guys to do is always check that
box source on save so then that way you
don't have to press command enter here
and do you know for example you would
have to do this button source or you
would have to do whatever with source on
save if I just save it it sources it
right here which means that now I can
call this function complete and my
console knows about it as well so now I
want to call this function and use it
because I got it right here so I'm going
to say complete and it's telling me what
arguments it takes because I defined it
up at the top so it tells me it takes
directory and give an ID so I'm going to
say mmm
take directory it's back data and then
that's all I give it right it asks for a
directory not for a specific file name
so I'm going to leave it at that and
then for ID I'm going to say hey I'll
give you the ID one so I only want you
to run for the first one and boom look
at that magic right that's beautiful it
gave us what we needed now I'm going to
say I'll give you one and two and it
made it for one and two and I'm going to
say I'm going to give you one and five
and it gave us one in five what happens
when I give this thing one in five
well ID is essentially right this part
here gets read as a vector right how I
think of vectors because I come from
Python is it like this right says it has
two values 1 comma 5 so we have ID of 1
ID is really 1 comma 5 this list here
this whole thing gets turned into all of
the files so we have all of the files I
the first time is 1 so using 1 this gets
me the first file from
my list okay first file is translates to
it translates to read dot sorry not read
CSV but 0 0 1 dot CSV and also spec data
that's what it turns into
so data reads that then data is
essentially that entire table which is
that entire file spec data slash zero
one dot CSV with the nitrate and the
sulfate and the ID and the date then I
call the complete cases function on it
and it tells me how many complete it
gives me a boolean factor for all of the
complete cases and then I simply call
some on that boolean vector so all the
truths are essentially ones it sums them
all up gives me back 117 which is what I
get down here and knobs initially was an
empty vector and so it goes knobs is now
an empty vector concatenated with 117
empty vector concatenated 117 well you
simply have 117 right after this loop
part and then the loop happens again and
now this part that was I is now 5 so it
goes down here it pulls out it says file
list of I since I is 5 this part
evaluates to this part evaluates to read
dot C at all sorry I keep doing that
spec data slash 0 v dot CSV
it reads v file from the vector right
this vector has all of the file so the
fifth element gives you the fifth file
and data is now the entire table
sulphate nitrate of that fifth file
right here
call complete cases on it gives us a
boolean vector called sum on it gives us
the sum of all of those true values we
concatenate that to what this was this
was essentially a hundred and
17 right and so once we concatenate this
part because it evaluates is something
like 1041 now essentially nobs becomes
1041 so it keeps going like that and so
here you have 117 and 1041 being knobs
and ID is 1 comma 5 so you have two
values of ID and you have two values and
knobs that's a perfect situation for a
data frame and you can simply call a
data frame and since they both have
equal number of values you get a
beautiful-looking data frame right here
id-1 id2 Knapp's 117 dabs 1041 okay
hopefully running through that algorithm
broke it down and you now know exactly
how that thing works in painful amount
of detail so I love this right there was
a lot of hard work a lot of brainpower
the first time we went through it once
it's done it's just like I just I only
worry about using it nothing else so
let's say I only want it up to 220
whatever files it's going to take a
second to run and it gives me back this
so now let's go one good thing to do is
test it against their test cases so
let's go do complete spec data and run
it on one one 117 is what we should get
let's check and we indeed match up
against theirs now let's run their
second unit test you should get back to
1041 and like 8 192 let's just check and
we do get 8 192 and all of the other
same values now let's try creating a
list of numbers that goes backwards so
this vector goes from 30 to 25 right so
it's actually 5 it goes 30 29 28 27 26
25 CSV files backwards and it gives you
that data frame so 27 should have 338 in
front of it
27 does have 338 let's run their last
unit
just to be exhaustive three and two
forty-three and we indeed have three and
two forty-three here hopefully you guys
have a complete understanding of how the
complete function now works in this
programming assignment in Coursera
this is Kazi thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
