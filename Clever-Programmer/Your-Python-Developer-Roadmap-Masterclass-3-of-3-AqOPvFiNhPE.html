create apps and land your first clan
with Python in less than 90 days and get
that first paycheck and the founder of
clever programmer calm welcome to part
three of my brand new series the
profitable programmer masterclass in
this video I'm going to literally give
you the road map that has helped me go
from zero to landing my first client in
less than 90 days and I'm gonna share
that with you so you too can go from
absolute zero coding skills knowing
nothing about programming not having
written a line of code to in less than
90 days getting that first client and
getting that first paycheck all right
before I continue guys I just want to
say thank you so much for all the
engagement we have had over a thousand
comments absolutely amazing stuff we
have people sharing what their Python
earning potential is we have people
sharing what their lifestyle with Python
and as a developer and a freelancer
could look like whether they want to be
site hustlers freelancers were full-time
developers we have people sharing with
us their dreams and their hopes of what
kind of company they want to work on or
what kind of project they want to build
or what kind of app don't want to make
we have people sharing how much money
they want to be earning every single
month every single year and we have
people sharing what that could mean for
them and for their families and how it
could provide that security that they've
always wanted alright by now you have
seen why Python is the best choice for
programming because ultimately coding is
all about taking that idea that's in
your head and bringing it out to life so
the specific language you choose is just
a tool but Python makes the most
business sense and here's why if you
have watched the previous videos you
would know this because it's the most
paid it's one of the easiest coding
languages and it's one of the most
popular and only growing according to
Forbes Python is the number one
programming language of 2017 and by 2020
it will have beaten all other languages
as well it's actually such an important
language that if you go on Google's main
page it's actually one of their minimum
requirements
and as you already know platforms like
Instagram Spotify reddit YouTube these
were all built off of Python you also
saw why most programmers never really
make any money and it's because they
focus too much on the coding part too
much on the technical part whereas they
don't work on solving those burning
problems that big companies are happy to
pay for and remember 85% of your
financial success actually comes from
your personal likability and your
business skills and only 15% of it comes
from your technical skills so by this
point if you haven't watched the first
and second video of this profitable
program or master class make sure you
pause this one and go do that right now
alright so by now you're probably
feeling pretty overwhelmed your head is
just bouncing all over the place with
all this knowledge that you have and
you're like Kazi I know what being a
Python freelancer will do for me and
will do for my family
Kazi I also know that it will give me
the freedom that I've always wanted it
will make me happy it will help me
impact the world and it will help me and
do things because I want to and not
because I have to but kazi how do I go
from all this knowledge to becoming that
highly paid Python freelancers how do I
actually get those clients when do I
know I am ready to start charging money
for this when do I know I'm ready from
the zero coding skills that complete
beginner if any of those things you're
wondering right now you are in luck
because in this video that's exactly
what's going to be covered I'm gonna be
giving you a full-on roadmap how to go
from a complete beginner to becoming a
successful and highly paid Python
freelancer and I'll also be giving you
my proven system and I call it the
Python client getting blueprint and I'm
gonna be giving you all of those things
right here in this video
and as a matter of fact I've made this a
downloadable thing so you can actually
go to the bottom and click download and
get it right now but I've got to warn
you if you download this right now and
you start jumping around from place to
place none of it will actually make
sense so make sure that you follow and
watch this video all the way through
because then when you get to that part
everything will make sense and this part
is so vital and so important yet this is
something that's completely overlooked
by any other online course any other
online training program any college any
coding boot camp look at Udacity look at
treat team treehouse look at EDX look at
Coursera I mean the list goes on and on
they teach you theory but where's the
practicality they take money out of your
pocket to get you into that course but
when do they put that money back into
your pocket all right now look any time
you're trying to learn these things on
your own it can be pretty complicated
trust me I know because I've been there
I remember trying to learn a lot of web
development stuff on my own so I would
Google things and I would come across
terms like HTML CSS JavaScript Python
Django sequel databases ORM and
apparently this said I need to know all
of this to put together apps and much
more and that would have my head really
like spinning and I feel that this might
be happening to you as well but one of
the most important things you're gonna
find out from this video is that in that
roadmap I'm gonna be giving you I'm
gonna tell you exactly where to spend
your time and most importantly you're
gonna learn where not to waste your time
because believe it or not most of your
time and our time gets wasted looking at
irrelevant things and that's the reason
that's one of the biggest reasons why
people spend so many years right like I
said you can have these developer
different developers have spent 30
years and make $30 an hour versus you
have developers who spend three months
and make $100 an hour and that's exactly
what I'm gonna be helping you do in this
video so don't skip watch it all the way
through and let's jump right into it all
right so this is the most exciting part
of this video and we're gonna get into
the meat of this right now okay so the
first thing that you need to do is I'm
gonna be showing you everything from a
50,000 foot overview so you understand
what's going on and you're not left
behind you know in the weeds and the
thick of thins or whatever you get my
point I want to show you everything from
a bird's eye perspective so you can see
clearly what's going on okay so the
first thing I'm gonna tell you about is
fundamentals of Python all right that's
the most important thing now these are
all your one on one 101 tutorials on all
these online websites but the thing that
I want you to be careful about here is
that everything that you're learning all
the basics you're learning should be in
a way where you know you're gonna be
building an app later okay so these
basics should be taught to you in that
way not just learning some weird math
exercises that aren't gonna help you in
any way so you want to make sure that
you're learning about app building as
you're learning Python very important
now let's move on to the next steps and
I just want to say that all these steps
I'm gonna touch briefly except for the
last one where we're going to
freelancing and I'm gonna reveal to you
something very awesome and we're gonna
go in-depth on that so let's move on to
point number two and point two we're
gonna talk about web development with
Python now this is the next phase after
you have mastered the fundamentals of
Python you get into web development this
is where if you can build one or two
apps with Python let's say using a
framework like Jing or flask which you
might not not know anything about right
now but again in your journey as you
make progress you will learn about these
and if you can make a simple blogging
app with this that's good enough or a
to-do list app in Python using a
framework like that
that's good enough to get started this
is a third stage and the optional one
and honestly this is the best and my
ultimate secret and something that you
don't have to do but it will accelerate
your progress by years and help you
become that developer in months instead
of spending all those years okay so this
is coaching okay that's what step three
is and in this stage once you're past
fundamentals of Python and web
development you want to look for clients
you can coach and these are people who
have no idea what programming is but
want to learn and you will be the best
coach because it's more relatable with
them when you're coaching them because
you don't have 30 years of experience
and you know exactly how they think so
they're more likely to actually even
hire you and you can be looking to make
easily one to two thousand dollars a
month or more doing this so one benefit
obviously is you get money while you're
doing this but the big benefit of this
is you are earning while you're learning
because the best way to learn something
is to teach it and it accelerates that
progress okay that you would it would
take you a long time so I would strongly
recommend step 3 coaching but again if
you don't want to do it no problem jump
to step 4 here's what step 4 is step
four is freelancing I know this is the
part you are here for and so for this I
prepared something very special for you
and I'm gonna reveal to you my Python
client getting blueprint that I put
together and we're gonna switch over to
the screen okay we're gonna stop this
camera stuff let me switch over to the
screen and in there I'll show you how
this works and walk you through it okay
so be excited have some notes with you
so you take them down but don't worry I
have made this downloadable for you in
the profitable program or roadmap I put
this there for you okay so don't panic
but take notes watch pay attention and
I'll see you on my screen right now
let's jump into the Python client
getting blueprint first is your client
attraction stage you find somebody with
a burning problem in our case in our
scenario we're gonna be trying to find
somebody with a burning
problem maybe it just means that it's a
problem that's solvable with Python even
if they don't explicitly state they need
a Python developer maybe they just say
something like oh I just need to make
this app that needs to do something ok
and you'll have to identify that once
you do that you have to come up with a
way to solve it and again before I go
any further I'm gonna be revealing this
whole thing as we go along and this
stage is really designed to help you
stand out from all those other needy
freelancers who literally apply to
hundreds of different jobs and get none
of them whereas I want you to be that
sniper who applies that one job and
blends it all right so here's the
process for it you find somebody you
come up with a way to solve it so you
come up with some kind of solution
then you reach out to that client not
just hey this is John and I thought your
project was interesting you want to give
me a call not like that but I want you
to do is give them a solution like
propose to them something so just come
up with a an idea and send them back if
they like that idea
that general idea that only took you
maybe half an hour or an hour to put
together they're gonna reach back to you
and then what you have to do is research
a little bit more ok we're on this stage
now research a little bit more scheduled
and then you get on that damn call ok
that's a call or you're gonna start
working with them now we move on to our
next stage and this is the land the
client stage so this is gonna be another
one of those really important stages
because we go from now just reaching out
to them and getting on that first call
to actually sending out our invoice and
getting paid ok so here's how it works
step one of this is you have to qualify
that client now what does that mean
qualifying means
you first figure out did they even have
the money to pay you or are they the
types of clients you actually want to be
working with or are they the type of
people who are gonna overworked
underpaid you know steal like basically
just take advantage for you all right so
that's what we really have to figure out
here so let's keep going okay so you
qualify these guys and you figure out
what their budget is what they're like
and whether or not you're gonna like
working with them or hating yourself
so we do this by sending them a
questionnaire or a little quiz that they
can solve or do on their own all right
now moving on to the next thing once you
do that and you like this client here's
what you're gonna do you're gonna shoot
over a project mock up plus proposal so
a project mock up meaning that instead
of writing any code yet you kind of just
draw certain things and go here's where
I expect the login button to go here's
where I expect maybe the portal to go
here's where I expect the tab that says
my music to go in the app so you're just
basically drawing this out before you
start coding and investing any time in
it and you send this over to them to
kind of just make sure that you both are
on the same page now this middle stage
over here the seven-day proposal stage
now this is optional because if they
just follow up with you right away then
boom you're done but if they don't which
happens a lot of the times you have the
seven-day proposal follow up and you
follow up with them pretty much every
few days and you send out an email or
two the seven-day proposal follow up is
optional now the next stage is sending
the project agreement plus signing the
NDA NDA is your non-disclosure agreement
all right this is where you sign send
the project agreement and you sign your
non-disclosure agreement okay after this
stage is your send project invoice or
you charge hourly this is where most of
the Python
freelancers get screwed over I was
actually even talking to a pretty expert
level developer and they told me that he
wasn't sending an invoice until he did
most of the project that's really bad
and I don't want you to do that okay if
you get to the part where you're working
with the client they should be paying
you before you get started for the full
thing or agreeing on an hourly rate with
you or just flat-out or at least paying
you quarter or half of the money to show
they're serious and this way you don't
waste your time they don't waste their
time you both know you're serious and
you move on this is the most important
one so don't skip this one okay let's
move on to the next one the Python app
building stage so this is where the
party is happening all right now you are
not only did you find the party but now
you are actually at the party this is
where the most fun stuff happens okay so
let's check it out here the first step
is map out what's needed so what kind of
technologies you need to be using to do
this job you know what kind of
frameworks in Python you need to be
using maybe it's Python maybe instead of
flask you know which is a web framework
maybe you need to be using Django these
are again things you'll learn and
they're not that hard as you make
progress in your journey but this is the
step where you write down exactly the
stuff that that's needed the
requirements step 2
plain English before you write any code
this is where most people waste their
time and are underpaid and overworked
write in plain English or in the
language of your choice your mother
tongue exactly what you expect each
thing to do so you know again where the
log in goes where is the database where
is all this stuff stored like for
Domino's when they're doing that Pizza
app where exactly is the pizza going to
be viewed where exactly can you click
to edit the order where exactly can you
click to delete an order on Spotify
where exactly can you go to add the
music to the playlist all right so this
you have to write down everything in
plain English before you start coding
next step is you have to confirm your
assumptions with your client
so or the stuff that you wrote in plain
English is that correct if not then you
have to go back to the drawing board and
make sure that you actually understand
what the heck it is that you need to do
and you get that figure it out and then
send it back to the client but if the
assumptions are confirmed
now you move on and you get to another
fun part which is actually start coding
and building that app up ok this way
you're not going to be wasting your time
and you know exactly what you need to be
doing so you start coding it up you
start taking all these amazing ideas
that are literally buried in your head
and you're putting them out into the
world this is where all that creativity
that you have is now coming out alright
so this is a part that I honestly like
the most and you'll enjoy it the most as
well but what happens once you code it
up you send it and do digits accept it
they just go boom you're done this is
the best thing ever and yeah now let's
let's pay you or let's end this
unfortunately what happens actually most
of the times is that they give you some
feedback and they're like this is not
exactly what we wanted or maybe we need
some new features so you code and then
you send and then you get some feedback
you code so this stage over here it's
not just a one step process it's kind of
a little back and forth it's like a
little cycle that's why you see that
little cycle thing that I've put
together for you and after all of this
is over and once the app has been
finalized and it's done now this is also
another really fun part so it's the once
it's all over stage and this is where
the after party takes place so you
parting words with client how to end it
what kind of contract if any have to
send to basically end the whole thing
and then after you have those parting
words with your client and you guys part
ways and you shake hands and the project
is done and they're happy with that you
confirm that now we get to another
awesome stage which is called project
stacking so here you go to your
portfolio okay and if you watch the
previous video I've literally handed you
the profitable programmer portfolio and
in your my work section you take the app
that you just built with your client and
you just plug and chug it in the my work
section this is where you show off the
work that you did okay and make sure
that in the agreement you sent earlier
okay in the agreement you sent earlier
you mentioned that you're gonna be
putting this on your website because if
you don't do that because of
non-disclosure agreements a lot of
Python freelancers can't even show the
work that they have done for other
people and that's the worst and that's
why also they don't get the jobs that
they deserve because when you look at
their work it doesn't show any work even
though they have a lot of experience and
they're really good because in their
agreements what they have is that they
can't show the clients app that they
build and they can't put it on their
portfolio so make sure you have that in
your agreement so project stacking you
want to put that project in your
portfolio without showing all the code
or anything like that okay
that's still the IP intellectual
property of your client now let's move
on and here's another fun part you now
you call your client and you get that
you collect that testimonial or that
review alright and once you do that you
save it somewhere and maybe a Google Doc
doesn't really matter and after this we
get to another fun stage which is called
proof stacking and in this stage what
you're gonna be doing is essentially all
that proof that they're giving you all
those reviews are going to give they're
going to be giving you you go back to
the profitable programmer portfolio that
I gave you in the previous video and you
put all the testimonials and the
reviews right there maybe even next to
the my works actually know where you are
putting those apps okay so this is the
entire Python Kline gating blueprint I'm
gonna zoom out so you can kind of see
all of it in one go I have made this
available for you in the in below this
video where you could just literally
download this and steal my Python client
getting blueprint and use it to get
clients once you get to that stage
hopefully this was awesome for you and
we're gonna cut this screencast now we
have covered a lot today okay we I went
from learning about the profitable
programmer roadmap to all the stages you
need from zero coding skills to
freelancing and how do you find a client
who how do you start working with the
client to what do you do when you're
making that app and then ultimately how
to close it okay so we went through all
of this stuff together I thought it was
really cool I thought it was really fun
I hope you were excited and now just
imagine no matter where you are in your
journey just think about isn't it easy
now looking at all of this and you can
see how everything works and it's tied
together you can see where you are as a
beginner and what milestones you need to
hit to stop being that beginner to
becoming a web developer and then to
going on to freelancing and exactly what
you need to do now contrast that with
college and you have no idea what you're
doing or contrast that with some online
course or some coding bootcamp and they
just tell you just believe in the
process and trust the system and give us
15 or 50 or $100,000 accumulate loans
cross your fingers and maybe you'll get
a job and guess what most people don't
even get jobs when they come out of
those places or when they go through
those online trainings and tutorials so
wasn't that refreshing alright well
that's that here's what I want you to do
at this point okay here's how you can
boost your success rate of becoming the
pint
freelancer that Python developer being
able to take those ideas and bringing
them into life and getting paid what you
deserve doing them by 65% boosting that
success rate right here's how you can do
it share this video with at least one
friend or family member that
accountability if they join you on this
journey of you becoming a freelancer
your success rate will be boosted by 65%
and here's what I want you to do I want
you to also comment below on this video
and after seeing that H doesn't matter
whether you're old or young you can
still be a Python developer and after
finding out your earning potential after
finding out that intelligence and having
the perfect 4.0 GPA doesn't matter after
finding out and seeing the profitable
programmer portfolio that I revealed in
the part 2 of this profitable programmer
masterclass and after having that
roadmap from going from zero to becoming
that freelancer that gets paid top
dollar and seeing all of this and having
me bust all those limiting beliefs tell
me at this point what is your excuse and
with that said I want to invite you to a
very special event okay this webinar is
gonna blow your mind okay if you thought
all of these videos were awesome wait
till you see this webinar and on this
webinar I'm gonna be going into what's
holding you back so we're gonna have
that Q&amp;amp;A section where you and I okay
get to talk one-on-one personally and
that's gonna be at the end of the
webinar and in the start I'm gonna be
opening up my new course all right this
course is called the profitable
programmer how to create apps and land
your first client with Python in less
than 90 days and get that first paycheck
I'm gonna be covering exactly what's
gonna be in this course all the amazing
stuff that's gonna be covered in this
course and I'm gonna have that Q&amp;amp;A
section at the end so any questions you
have we cover them you're invited to
this webinar make sure that below this
video or somewhere
did you click a button and register for
this webinar because I want to see you
there okay make sure you are there I
would love to have you with all of that
said you have unlimited potential my
friend especially after seeing all this
you have literally years a head start on
anybody else you know the secrets that
most developers and most people who have
been working in this industry for
literally 10 20 30 years they don't even
know you have the potential to become
that developer in months instead of
years you have that potential to change
not only your life but literally your
family's lives or maybe even your
friends around you now you've tapped
into that old unlimited potential your
Python potential I'm excited for you and
I cannot wait to see you in the webinar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
