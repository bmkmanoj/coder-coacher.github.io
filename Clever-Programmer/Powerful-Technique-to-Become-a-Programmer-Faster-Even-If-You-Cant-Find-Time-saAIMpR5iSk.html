and some simple things I'll tell you now
is it's just as easy to sit while you're
eating food and watch stranger things or
I don't know I forget what other shows
are there sweet suits I always say house
of court suits or office Game of Thrones
yes thank you there we go
it's just as easy to sit there and watch
that as eating food and just watching
something on Python and it you don't
have to make it feel like it's some kind
of thing that you have to do and if you
don't do it it's like homework
assignment it's like work just think of
it like oh cool like sweet I get to
learn this and right after I'm done
eating food you know what I'm just gonna
put together something for my friends
it's gonna be hilarious it's gonna be an
insult generator and it's gonna be
hosted on here Okuda in Roku which lets
you put your websites online and you
could be like they could just go to it
and type in and you know type in
whatever or type in their name and it
automatically generates an insult or
maybe it automatically generates a
compliment so they go to your little
Python app that you made and they type
in you know raffia Kazi my name is Rafa
kasi and it says Rafa cause you are
awesome and then and if somebody else
types it in you know cluck CEO or
Mustapha types it and it goes most of it
says most of what you are great or must
have for you rock but if you want to
create an insult generator it could be
like most of what you suck most of your
horrible and it could just be hilarious
so have fun and have these ideas that
make you have fun with it and then
you'll improve at the same time having
fun and then you'll improve a lot faster
it's like how animals learn they don't
sit there like the tiger dad is not
going like has a whiteboard and this is
how you run this is how you hunt they
just let the kids run around and have
fun and then figure out how to do all
that same way if you kind of learn
football soccer or basketball instead of
having a teacher sit there on a
chalkboard teaching you theory for also
long just go out and kick the damn
soccer ball have some fun with it try to
do some tricks and mess up try to shoot
shoot it in the hoop and mess up its who
cares if you're four
is off who cares if you suck at dancing
practice it improve and then when you
watch the video you're like oh I'm
connecting the dots it's fun and I could
be building things as I go along I could
be taking Tings things from my head and
putting them out there into the real
world that people could use that people
could share and could not only be fun
little games for my friends and family
and for myself and inside jokes which is
awesome but could also be something that
could make an impact in the world could
also be something that makes me money it
could also be something that gets me
that job to have always wanted and could
also be something that becomes my way of
being able to travel and wake up
whenever I want to and work from
wherever I want to I just had a talk
with one of the students from my older
courses Opie courses his name is nazar
Molly and he told me that he's a cg
generalist freelancer and the reason why
he loves freelancing for example is that
he doesn't have to do a - he doesn't
have to do a commute that saves him two
hours so one cool thing is he can wake
up and boom be at work so he's never
late another cool thing is that he's a
father and he gets to spend time with
his little daughter he gets to see his
daughter grow up
he doesn't have to miss those moments
with his daughter those special moments
and that's invaluable I don't know about
you but I can't put a price on it and
that's what I mean when I talk about a
rich life it's not just money but it's
other things involved in there and then
he went on to make $1200 using Python in
four hours so after he took my course he
built this thing that he could use to
automate these graphics all right and he
was telling me that it took the team in
Brazil seven days to do this and it took
him four hours to do the same thing and
he charged the same as that entire
Brazilian team charged and he pocketed
$1,200 and got it done in four hours so
think about that somebody who works as a
as a graphic artist or you know somebody
who's working on creating animations and
graphics and videos gets
to use Python to automate it so even
whatever you're currently doing you
could use it and it could be practical I
could help you boost your income even if
you love your job it could help you get
that promotion maybe you're not ready to
just leave your job and jump into Python
which I get can be scary I had I read
this comment by this girl I forget her
name but basically she said I have a job
I'm a single mom I have to take care of
my son and have to take care of myself
so I can't just leave my job but I want
to use Python to earn that side income
you could be doing the same thing I get
it some of us have a lot of
responsibilities and we can't just jump
the ship and burn the bridges and storm
the boats we have to go one by one so
why not integrate Python into your life
to become more valuable at your job
maybe get a raise if you can't do that
maybe do some side projects on the
weekends and if you put in 10 hours at
$50 an hour in one or two days you're
bringing in two thousand dollars extra
that's twenty four thousand dollars
extra per year if you add on another
client or you increase your rate all of
a sudden you're bringing in three or
four thousand dollars extra per month
and now you could start to maybe think
about changing from your current job and
going Python you know all the way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
