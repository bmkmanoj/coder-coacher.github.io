command line tutorial let's learn how to
rename things
so essentially you can see I have that
folder called playground or what if I
didn't like it being called playground
what if I wanted to be called not
playground or clever program or
something like that right you're just
sitting there you get those urges you
just want to call things clever
programmer for no reason so let's just
do that let's call it whatever we want
so the command is actually called M V M
V so I'm gonna do M V and I'll explain
to you more how that command works but
for now let's just use it for this so
I'm gonna say M V playground oh I got to
get out of playground now I'm in
documents remember I do the dot dot to
get out of it or CD dot dot I farm on
Windows using git bash so I am out of it
now if I do LS I should see playground
right there so Emily takes in two
arguments the first argument is the file
and then the second argument you give it
and the arguments are determined by the
spaces is what I want to name it so I
want essentially what I'm saying is
change the name of playground too and I
want to change it to not playground
anymore hit enter and you see that it
just changed all of a sudden to not
playground anymore okay that's it for
this video very simple go ahead and
practice renaming files you can rename
or sorry folders you can rename files
the same way alright so go ahead and
practice that in the next video we will
cover how to move files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
