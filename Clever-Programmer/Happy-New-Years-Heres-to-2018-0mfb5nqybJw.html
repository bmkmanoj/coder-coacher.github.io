clever programmer calm super excited to
have you here I just want to wish you a
very very very Happy New Year's we are
today's December 31st and actually a few
hours from now it's gonna be the New
Year's by the time we're watching it it
might already have passed here's what I
want to say to you you have all the time
in the world to work and be productive
and do stuff on your to-do list right
now don't worry about that make sure to
take some time out just either spend
with your family friends thank the
people who are close to you and if
you're gonna go out and party tonight or
whatever make sure you go and do that
and have fun
it is the day that's just yours enjoy it
and go into the New Year's with just a
fresh and clean mindset you're gonna
start work and you're gonna start your
school you're gonna start your job
you're gonna run down your to-do list
next year alright 2018 so just do that
start with the clear mind and do things
that you love I also hope that you're
liking this new setup we've put together
and we're gonna be using this from now
on I actually just moved to California a
few days ago got this new place it's
really really cool and I'm what I'm
trying to do is surround myself with
people who are actually more successful
than I am and I'm trying to learn a lot
from them you know they say if you're
the smartest guy in the room then get
out of the room so going into the new
year make it your goal to be surrounded
by people who could mentor you in life
and take you to that next level become
friends with those people as well okay
and cut out the people who are negative
in your life alright who are not giving
you anything extra they're not adding
any value they don't really believe in
you they say they do they call
themselves your friend but anytime you
have a good idea or something you want
to do they just make fun of you and drag
you down so please make sure that you're
surrounding yourself with people who
only help you go up that's it thank you
guys so much for watching
this is Kazi as always I love your faces
and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
