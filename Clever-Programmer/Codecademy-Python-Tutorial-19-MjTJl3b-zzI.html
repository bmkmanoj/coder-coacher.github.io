clever programmer calm and welcome to
another episode of code Academy this is
code Academy Python tutorial part 19
alright so let's get started last time
we left off on let's just double check
where we left off so we did um it's not
cheating debugging you win danger not
again so we have made it all the way to
test run we're almost getting completed
with our game okay so let's go here and
run it let's see what happens so it says
make sure you play it a couple of times
and try different kinds of incorrect
guesses this is a great time to stop and
do some serious debugging so I encourage
you guys to try to debug this on your
own as well meaning run it and try a
bunch of different inputs and see what
it what it gives you okay and the next
step we'll move on and look at how to
give the user for a guesses to find the
Battleship thoroughly test your game
make sure you try a variety of different
guesses and look for any errors in the
syntax or logic of your program so what
we'll do is we'll copy all this code
we'll come over here and we'll run it it
tells us that the code is wrong which it
is because in Python 3 you need to put
parentheses after print print again
another print that's wrong hopefully
every other print is right let's check
it out raw input is not defined because
in Python 2 again it's not raw input
it's just input it's easier right you
don't have to say raw input every time
let's see what other errors are there
let's run it ok cool the game ran and it
goes you miss my battleship you miss my
battleship I don't like this part right
it says you miss my battleship twice
however that's good that's right because
we did miss the battleship the
battleship was located in for two
and we took a turn in column 4 Row 4 in
column 4 which is right over here right
it's the absolute last one just to let
you know it's Rosie Row Row 1 Row 2 Row
3 Row 4 column 0 column 1 column 2
column 3 and column 4 so we have missed
the ship what do we do well we simply
guess again however it should be
reducing the number of guesses to
eventually you run out of guesses right
after 4 guesses you should run out so
try to go ahead and make that part of
the game a hint I'll give you is if
things are repeating it sounds like a
loop so you may have to put the entire
thing in some kind of a loop one
suggestion on how to do that is um
indent everything and then like do like
a while loop or like a for loop um okay
that's just and maybe if while guesses
is less than or equal to 4 run the game
run the entire logic of the game and
then maybe decrement the number of
guesses every single time you run
through the loop right so if you haven't
guessed correctly it a decrement set by
one for example it should be like
guesses minus equals 1 or a guesses is
equal to guesses minus 1 right this
means you're decrement and guesses by 1
okay so this is the case here but it
says you miss my battleship twice and it
also marks the spot X which is good
which is fine so it either looks like we
don't need this or it looks like we
don't need the
block right there okay so I think I'm
gonna go ahead and remove this else
statement here and just move these back
and let's check it out and let's see
what happens
whoops
let's see if this logic is correct
or if it's false okay we miss the
battleship it says you miss the
battleship and it gave us an X so we ran
the game one time and we guessed
something wrong
it gave us perfectly the answer that it
should give us you miss my battleship
and it marked that X that spot with the
next now let's try guessing something
off the board okay
we guessed off the board but it gave us
an answer that perhaps we did not want
which is saying list index out of error
line 32 gave us the error so this means
that when we guess off of the board that
check needs to run before it starts
indexing it here on line 32 so what it
did is it did five five and it goes
there's no such list as there's no such
row as board five so it just pooped out
right over here and gave us an error
which means that we should stop the
program before it gets to that line so
I'm gonna put that part here and I'm
gonna put this part um here okay so
check if you guess correctly and if you
did I say congratulations you sank my
battleship check if you guess within the
boundaries and if you did I said oops
that's not even if you did guess outside
of the boundaries that oops that's not
even in the ocean uh so I'm going to say
else if okay now check if you've already
guessed at that spot and then lastly
just go you miss my battleship and Mark
that spot with an X okay so I'm just
gonna write little comments above here
to help you you know a lot of times
don't just think in code because they'll
confuse you right you'll be like
gasps row equal equal ship row and guess
coal equal equal ship coal and again
confusing if you have to think like that
every single time of course the first
few times you have to go through your
code you have to like really strain and
squint your eyes and see what's actually
happening but then make a note for
yourself so then when you're thinking
about it and you want to go through it
quicker you can just really quickly know
in English what it's doing so that's
what I'm going to do this checks if you
guessed correctly right that if
condition this checks if you guessed
within the 5x5 grid this checks if you
have already guessed in that location
this tells you you tells you you missed
and it marks that spot as X okay so in
English you know what each of these if
statements and these conditions are
doing now let's run our code and let's
see what happens for for it says you
missed my battleship which is what it
should do plus guess by five it says
oops that's not even in the ocean and
this time notice that the entire program
did not poop out and gave us a giant red
error freaking out the users and making
them run away making your friends jump
off and attack you because there's a lot
of red on the screen right sometimes it
can make you red is not a pleasant color
to look at a lot of the times so avoid
getting attacked by friends and and
don't freak out your users okay so
that's why we catch that condition on
line 35 before it goes to line 39 and
tries to index it and give given error
the program effectively tells you this
and stops right here okay all right so
we have checked it enough times let's
simply go next you sunk my battleship
play it Sam you can successfully make
one guess in battleship but we'd like
our game to allow the player to make up
to four guesses before they lose okay so
here they are showing you a loop and add
a for loop that repeats guessing and
checking part of your game for four
turns like the example above at the
beginning of each iteration indent
everything that should be repeated okay
now the important part is to think about
what is something that needs to be
repeated so from without thinking about
coding and everything just think about
logically what is something that has to
be repeated what should the user be
allowed to repeat for example do we need
to create the board over and over again
probably not so this part of the code
where you create the board over and over
again should not be repeated do you need
to hide the ship over and over again
every turn
no you just hide the ship once so the
part where you set the randomness over
here right you figure out randomly where
to place that you don't need to worry
about that part Lenna board it should be
like this actually so this part does not
need to be in the loop should the user
be allowed to guess over and over again
yes this should this print statement
should not be here should be above here
okay should the user be allowed to guess
row and gets column again and again yes
that should right also after every guess
should we check if the guess is correct
yes we should should we check after
every guess that it's within the
boundaries yes we should should we check
every guess that it's all that location
has already been been guessed at yes we
should
and should we after every guess
should we if the user miss should we let
them know you missed and mark that spot
as X yes we should this means that this
entire part of the code needs to be in a
loop because it needs to happen over and
over again so what I'll say is for turn
in range for
okay this means and instead of saying
for turn and range for I don't like that
I think while loop is hmm let me think
about this both of them will work but I
don't want it to run for four times only
even if you guess like I I don't want it
to run four times only for four times
even if you guess outside of the
boundaries I think that if you guess
outside of the boundaries it should just
not counted and let you move again so I
would like to propose a while loop let's
see later how they do it but I would
like to propose a while loop so I'll say
I'll create a variable called guesses
and I set it to zero and then I will say
that while guesses is less than four
keep playing this game and when should
you decrement a guess here the game
should just end so I will say break
right just break out of the loop the
game is over so break is a command that
would do it or what I can just do is
make guesses is equal to four or
something here so that way when the loop
happens again it'll say four is less
than four and this will give you a false
and then the loop won't run so those are
two ways to do it I'll put this in
comments and I'll just put a break here
because it's a little easier to read I
don't encourage putting breaks a lot in
code because usually when you're relying
too much on this kind of thing like
break usually it means that there's
something wrong with your logic okay and
there is definitely a better way to
overcome that so if don't use break as a
crutch all the time the only reason I'm
using it here is because you guys
haven't practiced enough with functions
and all of this this game should really
be a function so instead of
us printing this part out we should be
returning it and then return
automatically ends the program or that
function and therefore you don't need to
write a break but since we are just
printing out congratulations you sank my
ship I'm just going to put a break here
okay because we're not dealing with
functions here because outside of a
function return' does not work okay just
for you curious people if I did return
it would say return outside of a
function okay and if I did define some
of a comma B or let's not call functions
some because some is a predefined thing
so let's say some of numbs a comma B
return this does not give you an error
because return is inside of a function
anyways let's keep going so all right
now let's go down here
should I debt or should I increase the
number of guesses here no because I want
the user to just play again without any
penalties if they guess outside of the
range okay but I do want to let them
know oops that's not even in the ocean
all right let's go here if you've
already guessed in that location should
the turn be taken from you no you should
just be allowed to guess somewhere else
because that would be knowing if you've
already guessed in that spot and then
you guess there again and it takes
another turn but if you miss the
battleship then definitely one turn
should be counted that turn should be
counted so here I can simply say guesses
plus equals one which is a shorthand
notation for incrementing the number of
guesses or I can say guess this is equal
two guesses plus one and if I run this
you will see so it says you guessed that
one already
right constantly so stopping us we
already know the answer so but I won't
guess two one
for now I'll just get guessed three and
one it says you miss my battleship if I
said three one it says you guess that
one already three one is right here and
if I say four four is going to say
you've guessed that one already
four four now let's do four three oh I'm
sorry
that doesn't even make sense it's out of
the index so it should have given us an
error
okay so ARP what did we do wrong here
mmm this should be an or not an end
that's wrong
yes that should definitely be an orc
because only one of these has to be true
because what happened here is it went
forty three and four um or actually yeah
only one of these has to be false okay
so let's run it again if I try forty
three and four now it should not give me
an error okay so um in that one both of
them have to be false in this one only
one of them has to be false so that's
why you have an or which is helpful and
then it goes in here and then checks it
and prints it out okay okay I'll guess
for for if I guess for for again it says
you guess that already for for is right
there whoops
right there I can do four three I can do
for two I can do for one and you can see
that I've guessed four tries and now the
program has stopped running
automatically so great we are really
close now at the end I would just want
to say something like hey if guess is
you know something like just checks it
guesses is four then I want you to say
that hey the game is over and you never
guessed it anything correctly and you
suck now that would be evil I don't want
to say that but I can definitely say hey
you guess it incorrectly and you've run
out of turn something simple right there
right if guess is is equal to four print
game is over
you have run out of turns okay so if we
play this game now and I go for oh I'm
sorry
for so this is time it didn't give me an
error right it goes oops it's not even
in the ocean which means I just get to
play again that's nice
4 4 4 3 4 2 4 1 and it goes game is over
you have run out of turns I think that's
a complete game but let's see what they
say add a four loop at the beginning of
each iteration print turn turn plus 1 to
let the player know what turn they're on
okay so they're having us do this in a
really odd way I would say and okay
let's keep going through it so let's put
it all of this in a loop okay what are
the parts that we want in a loop hmm we
definitely don't want it randomized
every time we do we don't want it to
have print the answer every single time
um okay they're also giving a nice
little note everything from here should
go on in your for loop right so we
should say for turn in range for and
effectively what they want to do is just
print out the turn you're on that should
be the last part of the statement the
entire code here so wow this is okay so
I so should say print
what should a print turn plus one okay
which means that
um the first time it's zero so you don't
want it to see to tell you term zero
that doesn't make sense so it's whatever
turn its on it just should increment it
by one as simple as that because this
range here right turn is going to be
going through this range first time turn
is going to be zero then it's going to
be one that's going to be two then it's
going to be three what you want it to
say the first time it prints out is one
two three and then four that's why
you're just adding that plus one okay um
boy no let's keep going your code looks
a bit off check the hint if you need
help
um invalid literal for int with base ten
where what line is a code error coming
from line 31 hmm what is the Oh because
I gave it an empty thing so it gave me
an error okay
four three four four four three and okay
that worked but clearly you can see that
the game is flawed it did not stop you
and say hey you guess that one already
game over if someone runs out of guesses
without winning right now the game just
X's it would be nice to let them know
why so we'll want to put it under the
else that counts for misses so I don't
like how their logic is laid out I like
my logic much better much much much
easier to read it's not like nested
else's underneath each other right hoon
who nests an if statement who nests yeah
like an its if statement under and else
which is under an if what the heck yeah
this is weird
okay so we'll want to put it under the
else that accounts for misses what is
the else that accounts for misses so
this is the else that I see that
accounts for misses right right here
just in case you guys got confused with
this line it just means if guess Row is
between 0 and 4 and then this part means
if guests column is between 0 &amp;amp; 4 and
or here right which is the same thing as
gets road not in range five or just call
not in range five but my way of writing
it is better and more readable and you
guys should follow that rather than this
weird of scoot obscure way okay hmm
we'll want to print the message no
matter what the cause of the mess we'll
want to put it under the else that
accounts for misses since our return
variable starts at zero and goes to
three we will want to end the game when
turn equals three okay that makes sense
add an if statement that checks if the
user is out of guesses okay
so put it under the else at a counselor
mrs. put it after the if else if LF else
statement is a check for the reason the
player miss we want game over to print
regardless of the reason if turn equals
three print game over okay simple enough
if turn equal equal three print game
over right so let's play the game again
it's two and four if I guess it
obviously the game ends I found it but I
won't do that out two for four then I
will say for three and then I'll say for
two and analysis if for one and it says
game over right there okay
simple start next lesson almost there we
can play battleship but you'll notice
that when you win if you haven't already
guessed four times the program asks you
to enter another guess what we rather
have happen is for the program to end
it's no fun guessing if you know you've
already sunk the ship so what is
happening currently is even if you got
it right the program keeps running
however in ours you can see that we put
a break here so if we guess that for
three the program ends right are ours
the one we made together is way more
intelligent and more readable okay we'd
out but what we rather have is okay we
can ask we can use a command break to
get out of a for loop hmm you can call
me mystic mech right um add a break the
wind conditions loop after a win okay
add a break under the wind condition hmm
would it where's the wind condition when
condition is right here and add a break
right break boom done just hard to read
because it's like so congested and they
don't let you like what I want to be
able to do is squeeze the code and give
it more width so you can read the code
properly it's kind of annoying how it is
because the lines are running across and
all kinds of weird stuff okay so now if
you guess correctly it says
congratulations you sunk my battleship
to your battle stations congratulations
you have finally Hobbes all right let me
read that again I messed it up you have
a fully functional battleship game play
it a couple of times and get your
friends to try it out too don't forget
to go back and remove the debugging
output that gives away the location so
what does that mean where are we
printing it out delete line 23 and 24
right because you don't want them to
know where the hidden ship is you may
want to take some time to clean up and
document your code as well again guys we
did it beautifully look at that we
documented our code dis checks if you
guess correctly this checks blah blah
blah this checks blah blah and here we
can say this checks if you have run out
of guesses so this means that you have
documented your code and we've cleaned
it up so this is a version that you guys
should use let's say share um and then
let's do I'm gonna copy that I'm going
to share let's save it
I guess you can get it at that link but
let me see what happens if i refresh um
or I go yeah so I guess if I don't
change this exact link you should be
able to get access to this very link
now let me check if oh whoops let me
check if that one 2 is still a link
that's there okay beautiful enjoy the
full game is right there for your use
and you can run it right here in this
repli'd enjoy kids now enjoy clever
programmers or call you cuz you're one
person when you're gonna be playing it
so enjoy clever programmer very smart
for using this link it will live on
all right when you are done playing
battleship and are ready to move on
click Save and submit code save and
submit code okay we guessed it wrong
let's see if we can win against them oh
I'm sorry I guess they're wrong Oh - it
didn't give me an error so that's okay
no I missed the ship so these are my
guesses X X X X but looks like I missed
the ship one fun feature you should add
at the end which may be at the end once
the game is over reveal the position
where it was stored I think that's a
little bit more fun to be honest extra
credit you can also add on to your
battleship program pro at battleship
program to make it more complex and fun
to play here are some ideas for
enhancements maybe you can think of some
more make multiple battleships you'll
need to be careful because you need to
make sure that you don't place
battleships on top of each other on the
game board you'll also want to make sure
that you balance the size of the board
with the number of ships so the game is
still challenging and fun to play so 0.1
multiple battleships what if I can hide
three or four battleships right that
will be fun
so right now it's a 5x5 grid if you put
25 ships well it's not going to be very
hard to play right 5 where did I get 25
from 5x5 that gives you 25 that means
that on the grid there are 25 squares so
if you pick 25 ships now the game is
going to be real easy because every
guess is going to guess a ship and sink
it down so what they're saying is that
hey if you want to pick more ships then
maybe have a bigger board so it's still
challenging got it cool point to make
battleships of different sizes this is
trickier than it sounds so maybe a
battleship can um you know row column
two and two and a row column three or
yeah - row - and maybe column I'm
confusing you guys let's just look at a
board so you can have a ship hidden here
and here you know it couldn't be a ship
of length 2 so it can be in row 0 column
2 and Row 1 column um - okay you can
have a vertical ship or you can have a
horizontal ship that is placed this way
maybe it can be of length 3 maybe you
can have multiple ships of different
sizes in real battleship one of your
ships is pretty long like five or four
spaces other ones are three and some are
like one so that would make the game
more fun but also a lot more challenging
right a lot different more difficult
kind of code need to be vertically or
horizontally touching and you'll need to
make sure you don't accidentally place
part of a ship off of the side of the
board meaning you don't place a ship
like here and then like - one square to
the right of it which doesn't exist make
your game a two-player game so make it a
two-player game and that's another thing
that you can do and so basically both
people maybe get to put a ship and then
one guy takes a turn and then
the guy takes a turn so on and so forth
use functions to allow your games to
have more features like rematches
statistics and more cool so you get
allow you can click like rematch on the
game starts again and then it prints our
statistics like you know Johnny ship
synched Bob's my names are terrible but
ok johnny synched Bob's ships right
Johnny sink three of Bob ships in like
the last two games and Bob ship sinks
seven of Johnny ships in the last two
games or whatever and who won how many
games and you know what's the average
games that this person is won against
him whatever you guys get the idea some
of these options will be eased you have
to recover loops in the next lesson
think about coming back to battleship
after a few more lessons and see what
other changes you can make so great job
so far everybody I'm going to save and
submit we have gotten the badge
battleship let's hit next we've finished
this course let's go back to the course
page if you guys are interested I leave
in the comments below maybe if you want
to see how to make that battleship game
and then we can definitely walk through
it and make it but it's extra credit so
I'm going to skip it for now and we're
gonna go on to loops loops are amazing
you guys know I already love them
and they allow they want you to do
specifically loops here while loops for
loops and then they're going to give us
a lot more practice so that's going to
be a tremendous amount of fun great job
everybody for making it here so far if
you like this video please go like it
and otherwise and also subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already other
than that this is code Academy Python
part 19 and I will see you in the next
video code Khadem a Python tutorial
number 20 alright everybody take care
and I'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
