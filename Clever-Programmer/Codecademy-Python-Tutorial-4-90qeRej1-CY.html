to another part of code Academy this is
going to be part 4 so we're going to
start that in just a little bit but
hopefully you guys have had something to
eat
maybe you have a coffee with you right
now because as we get into this it's
gonna get a little bit longer
right so and you want to be able to sit
through it and maybe even go for a
little bit longer so hopefully you feel
full and you're not tired and we'll
we'll get going through this thing
alright
and a lot of you since I'm recording
this in August of 2016 a lot of you are
probably going to college so this is a
good time to work with courses like
these and follow these types of
tutorials so you can also get a head
start in your computer science classes
where at least know what's to come if
you are going to take computer science
class later on sorry that took way too
long let's jump right into it
Python 19% boom okay so we're going to
break it down we've finally entered the
pig latin translator now let's take a
look let's take what we have learned so
far and write a pig latin translator
great sounds good let's see how Pig
Latin works whether you move the first
letter of the word to the end and add a
so Python becomes Y Python a so we took
this P we added it to the end so it
became Y thon P and then we added a wide
to it okay so that's what piglet is so
the first thing before you start coding
is really understand make sure you
understand in English what they're
telling you to do okay because I
remember when I was doing this pig latin
thing a long time ago I didn't grow up
in America so I didn't that was I didn't
know what Pig Latin was so I started
coding right away and it turned out that
I ended up doing some kind of stupid
solution that didn't work out at the end
and I ended up wasting my time because I
didn't
understand the problem itself so half
the battle is understanding the problem
so let's go and do let me give you
something like pig okay
what would you convert it to if you said
it would convert to G PI P a Y you're
correct okay so once again I turned it
backwards and added a Y okay cool so it
sounds simple enough let's work through
it so say we have something like I don't
know I have bananas right what I want to
be able to do is put that take that B
and put it all the way to the end right
and then add an a Y to whatever it is so
let's say I you know I take that bananas
and again it's going to be a na na s B
followed by a Y right so just so we have
a written example maybe we can even put
it in our multi-line comment block or we
don't have to be that fancy we can just
use our single line comments just to
show us how this program actually works
so they say step one ask the user to
input a word in English so we are going
to say user input is equal to raw input
right and please enter your word here so
raw input what does it do it takes out a
prompt it makes your programs really fun
right it takes out a prompt and it lets
the user put in whatever word they want
to put in and whatever word they put in
your variable user input will become
that so I'm going to copy this and
I will show you how this actually works
so let me open up Python I do this thing
so I can activate Python 2 because
that's what they use but you don't need
to worry about it if you have a Mac you
can just type in Python I'm going to do
user underscore input is equal to R I
input right and it tells me please enter
your word here so I'll type in Bobby all
right and now if I look at what user
input is it's going to tell me Bobby so
that makes my programs fun because it
waits for the user to type something in
and then it runs it cool all right make
sure the user entered a valid word so we
have to make sure that it is a word
right it's not they didn't put in
something random so they didn't put in I
don't know nothing like just an empty
string convert the word from English to
pig latin okay so whatever the user
inputs we're going to take the first
letter and put it all of at the end okay
how would we do that
hmm well we can try to do some string
slicing okay we can say last letter
let's first try it in the terminal okay
so let's say user input is Bobby right
I'm not going to press ENTER because
it's already Bobby so if I put in user
input you can see it's Bobby
hmm so what do I do now okay let's take
the let's take the first letter and save
it and we'll call it last letter and
what we're going to do is we're going to
take user input and we're going to take
its first spot okay user inputs first
spot is actually B
okay now if you look at the last letter
it's going to be telling us what the
first spot is the reason why I'm calling
it the last letter is because I'm going
to later move it and make it the last
letter okay now we want to keep the a B
part right o BBY so we would like to
keep this part this is something we can
do using string slicing and Python so I
can say that
give me user input from 0 to 5 if I say
0 to 6 it's going to still give me all
the way up to the end which is boppy if
I said give me 0 to 3 you can see that
it gives me the first 3 letters okay or
if I leave it blank it actually gives me
from 0 all the way to the end okay so
what I want to do is I don't want the
first letter because I've already saved
it so I'm going to do one and just hit
enter here and you can see that it's
showing me oh BBY that's great we want
this plus the first letter we saved so
we can do last letter ok so now we're
getting the first all of the first
letters except for the very first one
and we're getting the first one to be at
the end now all we need to do is just
add an A why at the end ok so I can
simply go plus a why
okay and it want the oneness to do that
in short casing so we'll do that in
short casing and that's really our
algorithm now we just need to summarize
our steps and that's our algorithm for
Pig Latin okay for those of you who are
like what the heck is this thing that
Kazi is using my name is kaze just in
case you guys didn't know I'm using the
terminal to run my commands
interactively if you have an idol you
can use an idol or you can go to that
website I showed you rappelled IT and do
all your stuff here okay fine Python go
to languages fine Python and simply do
everything that I was doing but you can
do it here I just like to use the
terminal so we're going to summarize our
steps right we said we're going to save
the last letter so we're going to say
last letter is equal to user inputs
first letter and now we're going to say
let's see what we set here pretty much
that thing there so we're going to say
user input so whatever the user actually
input in the start plus and we want
whatever the user input from one all the
way to the end plus last letter
so we're I can attach on the last letter
plus a Y and we want to make sure we
type in print and that's it can we
convert the word from English to pig
latin okay double checking not sure what
they mean by the second step because we
can get pretty advanced on that but
let's just see okay
let's cross our fingers hit save and
submit let's see what it says let's do
what's example two gave us
let's do Python just like this right
beautiful next lesson we did it guys
boom move on ahoy or should I say ahoy
eh I get it they're doing some pig latin
stuff there
now let's warm up by printing a welcome
message for our translator users please
print the phrase pig latin okay
so they want us to print the phrase pig
latin hmm where to be
pig latin I'm not sure what they want us
to know you it looks like you printed
please enter your word here okay so in
here they want us to do Pig Latin Pig
Latin
okay that's weird but sure input next we
need to ask the user for input so you
see there you're going to use raw input
here in the above example raw input
accepts a string prints it and then
waits for the user to type something and
press Enter right so it waits for people
whenever you do wrong input look if I
did Ryan put here it waits for a person
to type in something blah blah blah blah
but whatever I just typed got wasted
because I didn't use a variable to store
it now I can never use that information
again it's gone right so if I wanted to
save that information I can do X is
equal to raw input and I can type in
that same garbage that I typed last time
now when I type in X you can see that
it's showing me that value now whenever
I type in X I'm getting the stuff that
the user input but it's not very
intuitive right when I run raw input
well if you use somebody else's program
and it was using a line like raw input
and then
you know let you type in whatever you
want you could just be looking at the
screen and going what the heck does he
want me to type he or she well that's
why we put in something in raw input
that tells the user what you are
expected to type okay so please enter
your favorite food right now when you
see the value of raw input and you're
the user using it not the person who
coded it right you're just using this
app or one of your users is using this
app that you created and now they can
read it and go oh I see what you're
saying please enter your favorite food
sure I'll enter my favorite food
whatever right I love Thai fried rice so
much so I'll type that probably cool in
the interpreter Python will ask blah
blah online for use raw input enter word
to ask the user to enter word save the
results of Ryan put in a variable called
original okay we will create a variable
like original and use raw input enter a
word boom
okay enter word hello
cool check yourself wait how many things
do we have here okay cool
all right now we need to ensure that the
user actually type something so here
they're checking if the length of the
string is greater than zero
how that works
is length of something gives you what
the length of that thing is so this
whole thing turns into a number and so
if the length of a string is greater
than zero well that's not an empty
string anymore
that means the user actually typed in
something so we essentially want to make
sure if it's greater than zero that will
tell us that the user typed in something
okay
length of nothing is going to give you
zero okay so that's why we're going to
use an if-else conditional block like
this now write an if statement that
verifies as the string has characters
add an if statement that checks if that
length of original variable is greater
than zero
don't forget the colon if the string
actually has characters in it print the
user's word otherwise an else statement
please print empty cool simple simple
enough okay again anytime you feel like
you want to take on a challenge on your
own while you're watching this video
pause the video and try it on your own
first and then watch me do it because it
always looks really easy if I'm doing
something but if you don't know it then
it's going to be really hard okay
but practice working on it on your own
then if you fail come wash this and pick
up things from it okay all right so if
length of Ridge '''l is greater than
zero then print original else print
empty
so I'm used to using Python 3 to always
see me putting parentheses around the
print because print as a function hello
cool start next lesson now the one is to
check dot is alpha so this is a function
to check if something is I believe non
letter characters so you have to make
sure that it's contained it returns
false that it has non letter characters
ok so some weird symbols or something
let's make sure the word user enters
contains only alphabetical characters
which means boom right so on and so
forth use n to the second condition so
basically what they want us to do is
come join these two statements with an
end or these two conditions so this
whole thing is called a condition okay
now we're going to use an end to join
another condition so we're going to say
doubt original is alpha okay not alpha
and that should be good right mmm it
looks like your code does not print when
original is only made of Oh alpha is
really for alphabetical characters so we
do want it to be right okay
cool start next lesson so here you want
to do and original is alpha boom pop
quiz when you finish one part of your
program it's important to test it so we
are going to write some kind of tests
for this take some time to test your
current code try some inputs I should
pass that and some that should fail
enter some strings that contain non
alphabetical characters and an empty
string okay so we're going to try to
test this thing now I'm going to try
something that's not as string so I'm
just going to hit enter
okay it said empty very smart I'm going
to hit X I'm going to try it again I
really want to try to break this thing
right I'm going to do numbers hit enter
it's that empty that's wrong I should
not say empty you should say something
like those were not alphabetical
characters but that's okay for now okay
now we can get to start translating Pig
Glenn let's review the rules for
translation you move the first letter of
the word to the end and then append the
suffix a something that I realized a
little while ago I went ahead of myself
and solve the entire Pig Latin I think
that we were not supposed to do that
till later because I was wondering I'm
like didn't even show you guys raw input
so hmm but it's okay because you guys
are ahead of the curve now no worries
we'll keep going alright so we know the
rules we discussed it in detail let's
create a variable to hold our
translation suffix create a variable
name Pyg and set it equal to the suffix
a y own variable name Pyg this suffix a
y okay
word up let's simplify things by making
the letters in our word word lowercase
so we're going to first take the thing
and we're going to make it lowercase so
we're going to go original is equal to
original dot lower okay so essentially
you just make it lower or how I like to
do it is dot lower right there as soon
as we get it much better
all right you can see first letter
second letter third letter so on and so
forth
creates a variable called word that
holds the lowercase conversion of
original so effectively what that does
is if somebody puts in something in all
caps it's going to turn everything into
a small letters create a new variable
called first that holds word of zero the
first letter word so you can see how I
did it earlier
now I'm doing it pretty much the same
way so we're going to go okay even
though I like to do it like this I
cannot because they want me to create a
variable called word so word is just
original but lowercase and first is
words first letter so we're saving that
first letter because we want to move it
all the way to the end cool
save and cement start next lesson now
that we have a first letter stored we
need to add both the letter and the
string stored in Pyg to the end of the
original string remember how to
concatenate strings together basically
it's adding strings together okay
concatenate is a big word all it means
is string plus another string that's it
they're showing an example greeting name
greeting plus name that would give you
hello dy okay so on a new line after you
created the first variable create a new
variable called new word and set it
equal to the concatenation of first of
word first and Pyg okay so let's go here
because I want it to check our thing is
the word so we're going to create a new
word and it's basically concatenation of
word plus um first plus Pyg this should
not beat the whole thing but let's give
it a try
cool all right well done now we have the
first letter showing up both at the
beginning and near the end that's great
but the problem is it's showing a both
at the beginning and near the end we
only wanted to show near the end not the
beginning right that's not the part we
care about cool first we create a
variable s and give it the string
charlie
all right okay
let's do that next we use the first
letter of Charlie okay so they created
they're just showing you here I don't
think I need to actually write it down
so they created Charlie they used s of 0
to get the first letter of Charlie
that's see right there and then they use
1 through 4 to effectively get H a R of
Charlie ok
set new word equal to the slice from the
first index all the way to the end of
new word use 1 : Len of new word to do
this cool set new word equal to the
slice for the first index all the way
use so what they want us to do is do
this okay so new word is now equal to 1
Len you okay mm okay let up new word is
just a trick that they're using which is
to get the length of the actual work so
however long new word is Len of new word
will essentially get that number so if
it's four letters combined with a Y
turns into six now a line of new word is
going to give you six so this hole will
turn this whole thing will turn into one
:
six okay your code did not run to end
see the console window for the message
what is the error mmm syntax error
that's weird
where is the syntax error I do not see
it
I'm pretty sure the colon is fine there
is no syntax error here what okay let me
try this line in my terminal hmm
interesting
syntax error what is going on here oh
I'm being silly
okay you have to index a existing thing
right like you can't just eggs you can
just index nothing so you can't just do
one : for that doesn't make sense you
have to do one column for of let's say
this word and now they'll equal to
something like Y T H right for means up
to but not including so it's actually up
until 3 so we have to actually index in
your word the reason why I keep these is
so you can see that people can make
mistakes right
I can easily edit this part out but I
will not because a lot of us go through
this thinking process and I don't want
you to think that I'm some kind of like
immortal being right just because I have
a little bit of head start than you
might have in computer programming so we
all go through some silly mistakes even
programmers and professional software
developers so it's okay to just be like
okay I made a mistake moving on it's not
a big deal okay hello
cool easy testing testing is this thing
on so I think after this I'm going to
end this part of the tutorial because
pig latin is going to be over and we'll
start the next part yeah you should have
a fully functioning pig latin translator
test your code thoroughly to be sure
everything is working smoothly you'll
also want to make sure any print
statements you were using to help debug
now might be a good time to add some
comments to make sure your code is clean
commented and fully functional is just
as important as writing it in the first
place okay so we have this a thing that
we added the end right there Pyg we put
the first letter right before the a Y
which is how we're supposed to do it we
put that word there and then effectively
on line 13 what we're doing is we're
just removing the first letter that's
all we're doing there's nothing special
about that line there
not some other brilliant stuff that
we're doing so if I gave you a new word
if I said it's equal to like let's say Y
what was it why things like withe on P a
why right except our new word is like
this after line 12 so what our line 14
does is essentially now right let me
comment this out now new word is equal
equal so it's essentially mmm why okay
that's what it does it says take this
word start from the letter 1 position 1
and go all the way at the end
that's it typing in len new word here is
the same thing as not typing in anything
here which is a lot easier but they just
I don't want to be fancy or something
but cool let's type in Python and we
should get back ok we never type in a
print statement but if we did new word
would be Python let's just do it just in
case
print new word right what's the point of
writing our program when it doesn't even
print anything so we want to make sure
that we see that beautiful thing print
it beautiful hit next we are done with
that section we are on to functions
congratulations for everybody that made
it here any questions comments concerns
put it down in the YouTube section below
or if you you're seeing this video on my
website
clever programmer make sure you comment
down there below so yeah ask feel free
to ask any questions other than that I
will see you in code Academy part 5 take
care and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
