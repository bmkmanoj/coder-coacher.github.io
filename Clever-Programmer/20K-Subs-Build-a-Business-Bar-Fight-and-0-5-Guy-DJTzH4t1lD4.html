programmer calm and you are going to be
finding out kind of a lot of stuff
that's been going on recently so sorry
i've been gone for a while I think it's
been six days now since I last uploaded
video but today I just wanted to kind of
fill you guys in on a lot of the things
that are going on so in this video we're
going to talk about first of all 20 case
subs okay thank you for that a fight
that broke out at a bar where I went to
watch UFC fight so it's kind of like
recursion I started an investment
account I have to talk about that with
you guys because I think you can find a
lot of value from it and the 0.5% guys
struck again yeah so lots of crazy stuff
going to be covered in this one so I
hope you stay with me alright so let's
start off with the 20k subs oh my
goodness thank you guys so much I mean
this is crazy like I at this point when
I see that like 20,000 subscribers I
literally don't even know how to react I
don't know when you guys join me along
my journey I don't know when you joined
some of you guys were there when the
channel literally just started some of
you guys are here already but just a
little back storage all of this before
my youtube channel even got started I
mean it was like there was a point where
obviously didn't exist right there was
nothing called clever programmer I was
just a college student and I was having
this idea of putting clever programmer
together I was going to johnson mrs.
book called soft skills yeah call soft
skills for software developers for
whatever
and he talks about like how to put a
youtube channel together and whatever
and I thought that was great and so I
kind of you know got started on this
whole idea and literally every single
day would look something like this I
would wake up at like 530 a.m. in the
morning I would go to lift at ymca I
would get done lifting and then I would
run like a maniac to my train because
every time I was just in the nick of
time to catch my train to for college I
would ya catch the train at like 9am or
ATM i would go to school and while i was
there i was thinking about how am I
gonna put this channel together I would
be thinking about the videos and
planning it out and then like my math
teacher whatever she'd be like what are
you working on there and I obviously
wouldn't show her and then she's like
you know maybe you should be paying
attention in class so she would
generally upset at me but I was just
focusing on all of this and then as soon
as I would you know kind of do my whole
day at college then I would come back
and i would spend a lot of time working
so whether it was working with clients
or working on a software project on my
own but after I got done with my job
after I got done with school I would
have this mapped out plan of exactly
what videos I was going to be making so
in the start it was like the Codecademy
videos and I would kind of just get
started right on that so as soon as
though so I like at seven p.m. or 6pm oh
just get started and boom boom boom I've
just bust out all these videos and like
okay I'm done for the day and then I
would upload the video I would fill out
the entire description I would do
keyword research I would tag these
videos I mean there's so much that goes
behind a completed video that you might
see even this video right now is
probably you know the I don't script
anything but like I record
you know I edited now my workflow is
much tighter because I've just improved
but before it was kind of crazy I was
figuring a lot of this stuff out you
know when's the best time to put
something up on YouTube is anybody even
going to watch it or they gonna hate it
so tons of things but how you know I was
focused that was my goal it was produced
at least one video every single day and
that's what I did every single day woke
up at five-thirty went to the gym went
to college went to work came back I
didn't care if I was tired I didn't care
if I had a headache I did not care if I
felt like I would just bust out
content because I had it planned and I'm
like boom boom boom this is what I'm
going to be doing so I would make these
videos whatever they were going to be
about was already researched before
because remember motivation willpower is
extremely limited so limited resource so
you want to not have to depend on it you
should try to get motivation get
willpower and then build a system that
keeps you going even when the little
power and the motivation runs out and
any time you have to do thinking you're
spending your motivation and low power
think of it like a door you have to
exert energy to open the door right but
to keep it open you can just put that
little door stopper and then that's your
system that just keeps it right there so
in the start I was producing no videos
no content most people produce only one
video month most people only produce one
video a week nobody was producing one
video a day right and so I'm like okay
I'm going to motivate the hell out of
myself to go 10 x and then build a
system which was my schedule was so
specific like the night before I
wouldn't just think about oh I'm gonna
do this at 5am I'm gonna do this 8am the
924 i was literally step-by-step plan
out exactly how my day would go I would
visualize my day so clearly that it was
everything so for example remember like
came
go to the wake up at 530am but it's
going to take a little bit of time so
540 am I'm going to be completely out of
bed getting ready 555 am I should be
done by taking a shower and I should be
getting breakfast at then from 555 am
2605 am I'm going to get in my car from
605 a.m. to 635 am I'm going to get to
the gym 635 a.m. to seven a.m. or seven
or eight a.m. or whatever I'm going to
be lifting and for each of those time
slots what exercise I was going to be
doing I mean I had all the way like so
much brutal detail of what my date was
going to look like that when i would get
ahead of what I was doing I would be
super happy I'm like yes I got a lead on
this so I should just keep going now and
also I never had to actually think and
make a decision because whenever you
have to make a decision like should I
hang out with my friend or should I
write this paper I guess I'll just hang
out in the front but when I would look
at my counter I'm what I got a distance
this is this like dude I'm sorry I can't
hang out right now but I can hang out a
9pm like guilt-free hanging out right
that's what you want to be able to do so
with my friends that's how it would deal
with it that's what even gave me the
ability to say no people were like wow
you're such a strong leader like person
you must be like perfect I'm like no I
just have this system that helps me so
again that kept me on track kept me
producing all this content and the
system and being very methodical about
it was what kept me going and then
obviously the willpower and the
motivation helps rights i was listening
to gary v grant cardone every day 10 x
10 x maybe like let's go let's go let's
go now when I make a video within one
minute there will be a comment saying
first or second or there will be like
hundreds of people that have already
viewed it you know you guys are already
I mean you guys are providing so much
support at this point that it's
impossible for me to quit like I'm going
to keep going forever
but in the start I would have 0 views
totally person like literally if i
refresh the page view too many times I
would skew the data you know like 10 of
those views was was me essentially so if
I did get one unique view that would
account for nothing so even refreshing
the page would completely destroy my
data so i wouldn't even refresh my page
or view my video over and over again
comb and I could really skew my skew my
views but and each video was really hard
and took a lot of time so like when I
was working on these and I saw no
results it was hard to keep going right
like okay I'm going to make a video
today i'm going to make a video today
and i'm going to make a video today and
i'm gonna this is such an awesome video
that i spent so long planning out and
executing and editing and publishing and
tagging and rekey we're researching and
everything and then I go and look at the
video all i hear is cricket's nobody's
there nobody's watching it I don't have
a single comment appreciating it is
acknowledging this but because I had a
system because I was like I'm not going
to complain till I have 100 videos I
just kept going you know it just kept
going i would get discouraged at kind of
like man nobody's responding nobody's
you know paying attention to this I kept
going and then eventually started paying
off like some video started getting
thousands of years like my Coursera
videos started getting traffic and
people were like oh my god you helped me
so much or all my god younger with this
so much so that was you know those would
be those would give me the fuel to keep
going but you know I take away from this
is for you guys is sometimes you do
things that are right that you're you
know you're supposed to be doing that
are extremely difficult to do but you
don't see the results for a while it
could be bodybuilding you're trying to
body build and your aesthetics are just
not showing
up your chest is not how you want it to
be the six-packs haven't showed up it
could be trying to lose weight you're
working really hard but your belly fat
is just not going away it could be in a
relationship you've worked so hard
you've been through so many fights but
it's just not panning out to what you
wanted it to be that understanding is
not there you guys keep having those
conflicts the crazy thing is that just
on the other side of all that failure
just on the other side of all that
failure right when you get a cross on
top and pass that hill of failure lies
success if you look at my you know if
you look at my channeled history it's
like dead dead dead dead dead dead dead
that failure failure failure Oh a little
bit of audience may be two people five
people use it back to failure failure
failure failure of getting one sub two
subs a day one sub what subscribers
right I would look at this every day and
I was like oh man but was not much with
your subs one substitute subs failure
after failure and then eventually boom a
huge spike comes up but to everybody
else everybody who knew me all my
friends are like oh my god like or the
people who are actually looking from the
outside and you know who just
superficially know your acquaintance so
it's not your real friends like your
your facebook friends like oh my god
overnight success see it is possible
check out my boy kazi you know he just
made it it is possible anything is
possible um you know overnight success
well blah yeah maybe to them it was an
overnight success right they didn't see
the six months of work waking up at
530am to make freaking videos the one
video that i have that had 175,000 views
right now it's called what programming
language should i learn first and it
ranks first out of like a million videos
do you know who I made it for I made it
for one friend his name is Daniel
Magnus's last name but he's my facebook
friend literally that video is made for
him he asked me a question he said hey
I'm trying to figure out what language
should i learn first I told them hey
look it's 940 p.m. right now i'm going
to bed because at 10pm i was trying to
sleep and i wake up at 530am I'm like
hey look I'm trying to go to bed but as
soon as I wake up the first thing I'll
do for you as I'll make this video and
he's like whoa are you serious I'm like
yeah I'm like I can't answer your
question right now but I'll do it in the
morning and that's what i did i woke up
that video was made at 530am and i spent
probably one and a half hour recording
it like scripting it writing and coming
up with the idea and then I started
recording it and then you know editing
involved with all of that few hours so
the overall it took me maybe six to ten
hours of hard work planning and all of
that but i woke up at 530am and that's
not what other people see right nobody
knows that not a lot of people know that
so if you're going to a lot of hard
things you're doing to get some results
and you're not getting people who are
motivating you you're not getting people
who are cheering for you you don't have
people who believe in you you don't have
people who support you that's okay like
I've been there I was in that situation
up until now so don't don't really feel
bad about those things and don't let
those things make you quit I have quick
to like I used to have a channel called
chest tastic it has its that 50
subscribers great potential if I if I
look at it now I know I can easily make
it go to 20,000 subs or more but it just
stopped at 50 subs because I quit I was
like all those thoughts in my head about
failure the fear of failure fear of you
know it's not panning out well whatever
I mean I put an effort but it wasn't
consistent effort I didn't have a system
and then I'd the motivation and the
willpower juices end up running out
but with this channel it's different and
for you I'm telling you if its weight
lifting or try and keep the body fat off
or you're working on a YouTube channel
or you're trying to build an online
business or a brick-and-mortar business
whatever kind of business or whatever
thing that you're trying to do in real
life right even like a relationship
success is right on the other side of
failure okay and nobody's there when
you're failing trust me nobody's there
when you're failing but every single
person is there when you succeed before
when I was going through this hustle and
all of that I know what these people
were saying when I wasn't paying it like
not in front of me Jose look at this guy
like posting every day about how hard is
working blah blah you know not focusing
on this other stuff like I know he's
going to be a failure essentially is
what they're saying in their head but
now everybody's coming out of the
woodworks and it's like congratulations
i knew it i knew you would make it I've
always believed in you blah blah blah
really really you weren't there when i
was starting this all out right and
that's how you might feel in whatever
you're doing focus on persisting if it's
coding and you have to practice
programming every single freaking dane
it's not the sexiest thing in the world
it's a lot of pain and you have to go to
go through it I'm telling you you're
doing the right thing if you're doing
the hard work for building your body or
going through and working on your
relationship like is it worth it or not
worth it it's worth it put in that work
okay nothing is going to come to you
without putting in the work there's no
such thing as you know yes grass is
always greener on the other side but
it's not you haven't seen the times that
those people have mowed their lawns
called in the laborers to make it look
damn beautiful or did it themselves
everything takes work so please believe
in your dreams even if it's something
crazy you know
follow through with it so again that's a
little bit of my story where how
everything is you know happened so far
thank you for the 20,000 subscribers
it's really unbelievable you know I was
running around my entire freaking house
when I got when I you get 5 subscribers
per day I used to compare myself to this
one channel called a concept and also
one of my other competitors at the time
coding tutorials 360 who I hated arm why
do I do this like everybody thinks
please don't talk I start talking
about coding tutorials to sixties the
channel is great ok like I said
something about engineer truth in a
funny way and everybody lost their minds
I'm joking I'm literally joking ok if
you don't understand that if you don't
understand me you shouldn't be listening
to me all right I'm literally kidding
engineer truth is a great channel coding
tutorials 360 is a great channel she's
not that out of the way because
everything's called out of control on
the internet when I was starting my
channel i looked at coding tutorials 360
and i was like i could make better
videos but i wanted to i had to side you
have doing Codecademy three Codecademy
videos and i was like oh I'm going to
walk everybody through and it's going to
be great but then my heart broke when I
found out there was already a pretty big
channel that was doing it at the time I
think code into tortoise or 60 had 10k
subs or 11 case hubs 11,000 subs like
wow that's crazy and it broke my heart
because I'm like somebody's already done
my idea so I can't do it but not true
I'm like forget it i'm just going to go
ahead and do it anyways and that's
exactly what I did I went ahead I kept
persisting doing it and every time I
would try to compare myself to how many
subscribers he was getting / dancing is
getting 30 or 60 or something like that
and I was getting to and then it started
getting five and then I started getting
10 and I was like gasps and then I
remembered the day there was one guy got
37 I literally went crazy I was running
around my entire house I called my
friend a call
brother in California like oh my god
she's got 37 subscribers like this is
the craziest freaking day of my life
like and for me it's always about the
implications it's not about literally
that I got 37 subs it was holy crap this
is real if i could get 37 today than
tomorrow maybe i could get more like
this is crazy um but after the 37 oh
it's 137 p.m. that's kind of funny but
after the 37 subs I went back to having
10 15 20 subs per day but eventually my
Chancellor are getting bigger and bigger
and my growth started getting bigger and
bigger and then I started hitting
numbers that channels with 150 down
subscribers for hitting like I'm talking
you know hundred clubs per day like 150
subs per day 200 subs per day and I'm
happy to say that at this point my
channel has overtaken coding tutorials
360 it happened a few weeks ago and now
I think we're way ahead of him and we're
only going forward I don't know why I
don't like his I don't like his
tutorials because I think there was a
time when i started watching them and
they just weren't personable and I just
didn't like the monotony I'm the way of
speaking just personally meet Craig and
I was like I constantly found the same
problem like these people aren't
speaking to human beings like human
beings they have a very weird way of
talking to people they're all in their
heads making these tutorials so I wanted
to make these tutorials from a
perspective of like I want to be right
there with you and I understand you and
I do because I went through the same
problems alright this is a long video so
I don't know how to talk about the other
things but i'll try to make them short
i'll talk about my investment with
charles schwab in another video but i'll
talk about the UFC so just two days ago
i went with my friend and we went to
watch UFC I think 2009 with tyron
woodley and
god I forgot his name I can't believe it
I love him but tyron woodley vs Steve
Steve evil okay I'm going to look it up
I'm getting really pissed off tyron
woodley vs. Stephen Thompson that's
right I'm not going to tell you the
result of the fight but it was a pretty
great fight and while that was happening
we were at the bar and we were watching
this fight all of a sudden we started
hearing some crazy yelling and whatever
going on in the back of what the hell's
going on so we look back there's a guy
and he's literally going like this okay
you're not gonna believe it he's going
he's talking to somebody and he's like
oh you know huh and it makes it to me to
us it looks like he's saying I'm okay
I'm okay suicide and as he's saying that
this guy's literally bleeding from his
forehead like there's blood gushing out
and we're looking at him or what what
the hell's going on like he seems like
he's so normal blood gushing out and
there's this other crazy gun truck I'm
like veins are popping out and then we
started over hearing more and then all
the bouncers started walking towards
these guys whoa so we're like to
going on here like going on here like
what's going on and basically the guy
who got hit in the head like this guy
cracked out bottle and broke it in his
forehead because allegedly the guy with
the who got hit with a broken bottle
slaps other guy and the other guy got so
mad that he broke a bottle so I guess
don't get into crazy fights you know it
doesn't matter if you're bigger or
stronger somebody has they can pull a
knife on out on you hurt you or somebody
you know is it really worth it you know
so sometimes it sucks it will hurt your
ego um to not end up getting into a
fight but it might save you and your
family a lot of trouble if you just go
okay I'm not going to actually be the
first one to initiate it because I never
know what this guy's got right we got
all kinds of psychos going around
nowadays and yeah so pretty crazy story
huh but I'm going to tell you guys about
the 0.5% guys striking against so if you
guys didn't watch the video watch it's
called ideas versus execution and I tell
you the story about this guy who wanted
to make me work for him as a full-time
partner for 0.5 percent basically he
wanted to just tell me the idea and just
go to freaking sleep and make me work on
everything and it shares 0.5 percent of
the profits with me that was his whole
idea okay and there are a bunch of
people like that that email me every day
and I'm going to start putting these
people on blast because they deserve it
I mean they deserve it they're horrible
people anyways so now yet 0.5% guy
strikes again so I want to tell you guys
about part two of that story and then
also the investment want in the next
video so thank you for sticking with me
up to this point you guys are my real
people everybody else has exited they're
just a fake wannabe clever programmers
y'all are the real deal thank you for
sticking through if you stuck through
comments below I'm going to talk to you
and say beautiful that you made it up
until this point some crazy new changes
are happening at clever programmer I
think I'm going to be taking the olp
course off the market and only for
specific group of people so I'm going to
tell you guys a little bit about that
too that's going to be a little bit
crazy it's probably going to be
happening this month so if you're on the
fence about that course great course you
make full on applications if you're on
the fence I would suggest to hop off the
fence and probably join that course now
because once I take it off I'm going to
go into phase of doing more market
research turning it into a better'n
ultimate product for you guys and then
when I open it up again the price is
going to be higher and nobody's going to
get the same price again so for those
two or three months
you know what you don't have access to
it you also won't be able to create any
ant so if you're on the fence I suggest
take a look into it other than that I
love your guys's faces off thank you
guys so much for watching this video and
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
