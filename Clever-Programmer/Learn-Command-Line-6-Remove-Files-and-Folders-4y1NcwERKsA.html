command line tutorial so what if we want
to remove a file that's where I told you
guys we're going to pick back up so
let's jump into that so remember how we
created playground we're going to remove
that from here and then I will have you
go and practice that so removing is a
very simple command it's just our m ok r
m that's it followed by it takes in an
argument so you pass it what you want it
to delete so we can say RM playground ok
and it says RM playground is a directory
so you can't necessarily remove
directories in one go I'll teach you a
trick for that as well that it's a
little bit more advanced but you need to
pass it a switch dash are for now just
do it without kind of really thinking
about it but later on I'll show you guys
up how it actually works ok so I I did
RM dash our playground it goes examined
files in directory I said yes and then
it goes remove playground I said yes y
means yes and essentially removed it
it's not there anymore notice playground
is gone how cool is that I didn't do
anything it was just magic I don't have
to touch the GUI it just took care took
care of it for me well now let's bring
playground back so i'm gonna do mkdir
playground and we should have it back
and in playground let's just add a file
alright let's add a new file so
what would be the fastest way to add a
file here playground new file okay kind
of don't worry about how i did that so
much because whoops don't need that one
don't need that one I just needed to
create this file here that just says
some example whatever we don't care what
it actually is we just care it's a file
it could have been a movie it could have
been a picture a JPG file a PNG file dot
MOV file it really doesn't matter I just
needed to create a file I have again I
have some other shortcuts set up for my
sublime text to open and I essentially
am saying open sublime text so st here
in the current directory which is the
one period i explained to you guys in
the last video two periods as parent
directory so a previous directory but
what i want to show you after creating
this file is how to remove the file well
that's just simple as RM example oh I'm
sorry I have to so currently i'm in
documents i need to go into playground
so once i'm in playground when i hit LS
I'll see example that py which is right
here example that py and I'm going to do
RM playground or sorry example and when
I hit tab remember to hit tab and
autocomplete and I'm going to hit enter
let's see what happens it goes remove
example that py I'm gonna say yes and it
removed it and be careful be very
careful when you're using these remove
commands because if you remove something
it's gone forever it's not going to go
into your recycling bin where it's going
to stay for 30 days and let you delete
it and clean it up out of there or
retrieve it later it's just wiped off of
your hard drive right away so when you
are using RM these commands just
make sure that you know what you're
doing when you're running these commands
now when you do RM it might not ask you
like are you sure you want to delete I
have set it to that so I can't delete
anything by mistake but regardless just
be careful when you're running this
command okay that's how you remove files
and that's how you remove folders that's
it for this video I'll show you perhaps
in the next video how we can rename
files and folders okay I'll see you
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
