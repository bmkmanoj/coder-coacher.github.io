you doing this fine morning we left off
at infinite loops oh where are my
manners
this is cozy from clever programmer calm
and you are watching code Kadim e python
tutorial number 21 okay awesome
now that we got out of the way how are
you doing hopefully you're doing it
awesome we back to where we were
supposed to be we aren't part 5 infinite
loops okay we just finished talking
about infinite loops infinite loops was
this concept of horrible destruction and
your code running forever I shown you
that my browser just crashed and that
was terrible and it can cause problems
in your computers too
however it's fun you can do that to your
friends right the open up their
terminals write an infinite loop and
then watch them struggle but don't do
that to maybe you're really close that
may be to only a really close friends
not your acquaintances so we found out
what's wrong with infinite loops and
what are some common errors that can
cause it for example not paying
attention to if this is a less than sign
or greater than sign right not paying
attention to whether you're incrementing
it and decrementing it that can cause a
problem right for example if you want to
go if you want to go less less less less
less to meet your condition let's say
you got to get all the way down to 0 and
you're currently at 10 you want to keep
going and reaching 0 so you want to
decrement right go down to 0 but if you
get confused and you write a plus 1
there and you keep going 10 11 12 13 14
and so on and so forth now you're going
in the wrong direction you're going to
run an infinite loop okay let's click
start next lesson break so here we're
going to talk about breaks breaks
generally avoid them okay my advice to
you
generally means bad logic you didn't
account for something can 99.99% of the
times be avoided with the right logic
however it's a simpler way to let you
break out of things right it's sometimes
useful if you really need to use it
break is a one-line statement that means
exit the current loop so yeah it just by
it just forces the loop to end without
relying on some kind of logic it just
goes break okay so here what we're
saying if I'm reading this code is a
wall true which means just run forever
there's nothing that can change this
true right you it's not a variable you
can't say right you can't go true is
true is equal to false that won't work
it's kind of like saying 5 is equal to
false you can't assign to these things
and it'll just keep running forever ok
so actually let me check if I'm what I'm
saying is actually true yeah so it's a
key word you can't assign to a keyword
okay now what happens in this loop well
we print count count is 0 the first time
then we increment count by one and then
we check hey is count greater than or
equal to 10 meaning is cap 10 or 10 11
12 13 all up to infinity it goes no
that's not the case because count is
zero the first time right so it's zero
and this condition evaluates to false
which is why this part of the loop up
but this part of this condition does not
run if it did run I'll exit the loop
eventually count keeps getting
incremented we get it to be nine
eventually count as ten it prints out 10
to the screen it says 10 is equal to 10
plus 1 which makes count 11 count is now
11 just just recall that plus equals is
the same thing as count plus 1 okay
that's how you should try to write it
for now and here we're saying if 11 is
greater than or equal to 10 this is a
true statement we break and we end the
loop okay that's what that means
so first create a blah blah blah the
simplest way is shown using an if
statement you define the stopping
condition so here's our stopping
condition but do notice we still have a
stopping condition that we're using here
right and inside the if you write break
meaning exit the loop break just means
exit the loop the difference here is
that this loop is guaranteed to run at
least once so this is a way you can
guarantee to run a loop at least once
kind of like a do-while loop in java or
c c++ because remember sometimes your
loop might not run at all right like if
you had a condition while count is
greater than 10
what if count was a hundred your loop
will not run so if you wanted your loop
to run definitely at least one time for
whatever reason then this would be the
way to go about it I still don't like it
you should try to avoid it see what the
break does feel free to mess around with
it but make sure you don't cause an
infinite loop click Save and submit code
when you're ready to continue let's save
and submit
so we've figured out what it does while
slash else so you can combine an else
statement with the while loop this is
actually something for some reason I
recently learned because it's pretty
esoteric at least I don't see it much
being used and I was solving a problem
programming problem and I saw that you
can combine an else statement with a
while loop you can also combine an else
statement with a for loop just like um
you can combine else with the if
statement so how does how that works is
if the one condition is ever false and
you break out of the loop then you just
run the else part okay
so let's check it out and how it works
so we're gonna just run it a few times
sometimes before you even read it if you
know generally it's a good idea to try
to walk through it before you run it but
sometimes just run it and see what it
does and then you can start to get an
idea of it all the print statements
right these are Python two print
statements I'm converting it to Python 3
so we can run it properly let's check it
out print another print statement okay
hopefully all right lucky numbers three
numbers will be generated if one of them
is a five you lose one three six none of
them was a five - four - we win - one
two six we win four one four we win jeez
it's number five huh okay sorry
so we finally lost how does this work
okay so let's come down to the part
where it says while and in the else part
okay so if count is not less than three
right if this statement ever evaluates
to a false right then what happens
what if count is currently not less than
three but three itself that means the
loop has already run how many times
three times right I think they do that
in German or something or when they ask
for drinks or whatever they go like this
like give me three drinks I don't know
to do that somewhere correct me I'm a
little geographically challenged so okay
so zero one and two is effectively runs
three times so if the while the count
ever gets to three from zero that means
it's run three times already
and then it goes while three is less
than three three is not less than three
that evaluates to a false so then it
sends you to the poor it says you win
okay so here's our works if we randomly
generate a number between one and five
rent into the function R and int right
here Rand int it does not include the
end point so it goes from the start up
to but not including the last part for
example if I copy this code and I opened
up my Python terminal doesn't matter 2.7
Python 3.4 it does not matter and I just
run this right so I import the random
module that people wrote while getting
your relationships destroyed in eating
ramen noodle and hundreds and thousands
of hours you just stole their code by
writing in one line oh um the other way
random ran in does included Rand range
does not include it okay so you'll never
get a six if I do two here you'll never
get a two you'll just get a one forever
so ran into actually does include it
what I should like to learn my Python
right I don't understand it so again
these are one of those things I'm glad
these keep these things get caught on
camera and I won't edit them out because
this is so common right they asked in
Stein how many feet are in a mile and he
goes I don't know and he says I don't
care because I don't want to use my
brain to memorize a bunch of irrelevant
facts I want to use it to think so here
I don't want to just memorize everything
usually what programmers do is even
programmers who program every day you
know oh and we do it as a job
will if almost always go and look it up
some documentation just to make sure
that what they're doing they're doing it
correctly okay so these things
not everybody has them memorized so
that's why you refer to the
documentation in just double check so
anyways this will guess a number from
one to six including one and six then it
gets printed out if that number that was
guessed was five then it goes you lose
and it breaks out of the loop and
everything stops if this end then at
after all of that it just increments
count by one okay so if
obviously this if condition hasn't run
if count ever gets incremented by one
obviously the if condition hasn't run
because if it had the loop would have
been over and you would have never
gotten to line 14 then it goes again
generates a number if it was not 5 then
it increments by 1 if it was not 5 again
it will increment count by one
eventually when count is first time
count is zero then it's 1 then it's 2
and if it hasn't met this if condition
and it hasn't evaluate to true for the
first 3 times of the loop then you this
part evaluates to a false and you get to
the else part of the loop and it says
you went okay so let's go back and just
run it so we made sure we understood it
then just run it and go okay we're ever
done your own while else so now we write
our own now you should be able to make a
game similar to the one in the last
exercise the code from the last exercise
is below so you guess guess guess if you
don't guess correctly you lose
eventually after a certain number of
times and you do guess is equal to int
wrong input which means that I take your
input and I convert it to a string right
so here
right and said if I did int it won't
actually show you but if I do let's say
user is equal to this and I say five and
I do type of user so what type of what
was the type of the answer and if I just
print out user will show you that it's
five and it says the type is int but if
I don't wrap it in integer function then
what it shows you effectively is if I do
user it shows you that it's a string
five right and if I do type of user and
it's a string type not an integer type
which is why you need to wrap it into an
integer function remember raw input
turns user input into a string we use
int to make it a number again okay so
that's essentially what's going on there
use a while loop to get the user to let
the user keep guessing so long as
guesses left is greater than zero so
while is greater than zero
keep running which means that we're
probably going to be decrementing it
every single time right just to think
about it it guesses left is 3 next time
guesses left is 2 then it's 1 then it's
0 meet some kind of condition and then
loop should stop ask the user for their
guests just like the example above if
they guess correctly print break
da-da-da-da-da let's start coding this
up so we're going to say while guesses
left is greater than 0 and I'm just
going to write this part right here for
now left minus equal 1 sometimes I just
write this part right away so I know my
loop will stop at some point because I
do know I want to make it stop and I
don't want an infinite loop so I write
my breaking condition right away and
then I'll like most of the times write
my code in between that so I'll write my
code for example now here because I know
I'm safe and my loop will stop okay so
use oh all right ask the user for their
guess I also a guess is equal to int raw
input and I will say please enter
your guess this little space is nice so
user can type when the user is about to
type their cursor is blinking
where my cursor is right now but if I
didn't have the space their cursor would
be where my cursor is right now that
would look weird I also put the colon
here because sometimes people will do
this and it's weird when it says please
enter your guess end of sentence and
you're typing right there it's a little
confusing so colon makes more sense it's
a better user interface to parentheses
to close off the rhein put function
parentheses and then the second
parentheses to close off the integer int
function parentheses okay if they guess
correctly print you in okay so if s is
equal equal to the random number that
was generated then print you win okay
and then break out of the loop okay else
print you lose okay so this part what
happens it keeps running and then once
the wild condition evaluates still once
the wild condition evaluates to false it
prints out this part let's step through
the code line by line guess is this so
the user gets to type in something once
that user types in something it goes hey
let me see if your guest managed to nab
a random number that I picked from 1 to
10 inclusive so let's say the random
number was 5 so it goes let's see if you
put in 3 is that equal to 5 nope
so it does not break out of the loop and
it also does not say you win so we keep
going you get to guess again and it
decrements guess is left by 1 so guesses
left initially was 3 then the next time
will be 2 it goes here asks for the user
input you put in a guess it checks if
your guess was equal to the random
number which again was probably 5 right
we're not changing random number
time we picked it to be five initially
and it stays as five the entire time the
only thing is changing is guesses now
let's say you guessed four so this part
evaluates to false it does not run the
that block here it goes to line thirteen
decrements guess is left by one so now
guess is left goes from two to one
eventually when guess is left is zero
zero is not strictly greater than zero
that evaluates to a false which means we
go to the else part and you know none of
this block of code runs we go to the
else part just as you lose okay so that
is it for that let's check it out please
enter your guess we'll say three oh look
at that I guess correctly the first time
so the random number was actually three
I had a one out of ten chance or sorry
one two three one two three yeah yeah
I'm not going to count it I do know it's
actually 10 so I have one out of ten
chance to guess it right and I did all
right now for loops so we just ended the
section on wild loops that's great so I
think a perfect thing to do here is
actually just end this video because we
have completed a while loop section this
way you get to practice some while loops
and the comments below you can also put
some while loops that you have made like
actually put them down there and I'll
comment and I'll tell you if they're
wrong or if they're right or if they're
cool and they'll also give other people
an idea of what to do okay that way you
guys can collaborate right here and if
you yeah so we're going to continue for
the next one so this is it this is Kazi
from clever programmer calm if you
enjoyed the video please give it a
thumbs up subscribe make sure to
subscribe so you can keep getting these
amazing videos other than that I will
see you in the next video code Academy
