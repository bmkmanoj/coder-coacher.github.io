clever programmer comm and today i'm
coming at you with a pro tip in this
video i want to show you guys the beauty
of something called format and all the
cool kids are using it so let's just get
started here's how it works i will say
something and like a quote or a string
with the two quotation marks around it
and i will pass in dot format and if i
said five here's what it will do this
squiggly brackets that you see it's
using that as a placeholder and in place
of that ill put in whatever i pass to
the format method so if I pass in five
you'll say hello world five if I pass in
ten it'll pass in ten so a cool example
of this would be if I wanted to do count
from one to ten and I wanted to say the
word count and then I wanted to say one
after it so for example I wanted
something to look like this and then in
the next one to look like this well
whoops I'm sorry to look like this okay
so I can do that very easily I can write
a for loop that starts from one and
let's say it goes all the way up to
eleven
it goes up to but not including eleven
however it does start from one which
means it'll print one and it will go up
to ten but not 11
all right let's hit this guy here and I
will say print I or I'm sorry print
count because that's something I want to
show and I want to put that right there
the squiggly brackets and I can say doc
format hmm and from that I can put I
because that's our variable we're
incrementing by and I'm gonna hit enter
a few times and you can see count one
count to count three count four count
five all up to ten how beautiful does
that look pretty damn beautiful how can
you use it well if you're making a game
like battleships or something else you
can use this to format your code instead
of those % placeholders or
instead of doing something like hello
world plus one and then you realize it
gives you an error because you can't
combine a number with the string so you
got a pass STR around it which is again
something that's ugly then you're like
oh it's still not formatted correctly so
you got to put this space after it and
it's it's a whole mess instead use the
format way look at how gorgeous that is
first of all look at that and it just
works right I don't know where I got
those syntax or front but it works
that's it for this video I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
