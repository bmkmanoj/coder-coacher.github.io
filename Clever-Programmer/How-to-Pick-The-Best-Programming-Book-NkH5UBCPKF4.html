yeah puck that is a good book I am
a fan of this to be honest because it
goes through like building actual
projects - I mean learn Python the hard
way does as well but I'm a fan of I
don't know I'm just a fan of this you
create these games and stuff and I like
it you know I kind of nerd out on this
book a little bit you create like tennis
simulations and here's just a rule of
thumb with books I talked with my good
friend Ben marks he works at Google and
he writes code and Python every single
day and he was telling me that when you
are using Python or sorry when you are
learning coding and you're trying to
learn it from a book one of the best
things to do is just go to a book with a
lot of exercise and my friend um Jude
said the same thing okay um Jude is one
of the founding engineers at code
Academy and if any of you guys have used
repple it or have seen me use repli'd
repl i.t um Jude was the founder of it
okay so um Jude also says find books
that just have a lot of exercises in
them so if you're gonna get a Python or
coding book just pick it up and just go
through it and just see how many
exercises it has and if it looks like
you're working on a lot of hands-on
exercises and projects then you're in a
good place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
