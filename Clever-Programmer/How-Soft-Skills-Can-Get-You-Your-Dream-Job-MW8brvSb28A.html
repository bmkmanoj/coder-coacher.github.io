clever programmer comm and today i want
to talk to you guys about soft skills
and why you might need them now I know
that a lot of people want to just focus
on one thing and get really good at it I
mean don't get me wrong I was I have
been pretty much my whole life been that
way you know I started in chess and went
crazy in chess played for a long time
and now I'm in the top 1% in the world
but you know so I got really technical
into it and then same thing with
computer programming once I discovered
programming I just started going crazy
into it like I would be up 6 a.m. 7 a.m.
every single day and get very little
sleep and just focused on learning it
and getting better at it and acquiring
better skills but one of the things that
has benefited me the most so far has
been developing soft skills and the
reason why I say this is because like
personally I'm a college student but I
have gotten jobs and I have worked with
clients where I have charged way more
and I mean way more than some experts
who have been working in the field for
30 years and literally know a billion
times more than I do
so the point is you know I'm not saying
this so I'm trying to like brag or
anything but what I'm trying to tell you
guys is don't just focus on improving
your skill in whatever field it is that
you're working in also focus on
improving your skill set your no unag
oshi a ssin people skills you know make
sure people like you because one of the
top reasons why people get promoted or
the top like the easiest ways to get
promoted and stuff is for people to like
you because when they're having a
meeting a lot of the times people are
not sitting there and being like you
know I think we should promote John or
we should promote Sharleen because she's
this you know she's so skilled sometimes
when people are sitting emotions are
involved so they'll just be like you
know I really liked Sharleen and she's
good at her job
or I really like John and he's really
good at it at his job
so it really stems from people liking
you and I'll put you in Better Place's
now negotiation right just the first
thing that I mentioned it's something
that in the United States especially
people almost look down upon like nobody
works on their negotiation skills like
and I felt like this as well I almost
felt like negotiation was kind of like
equivalent to haggling in a supermarket
but that's really not true negotiation
is a key skill to develop in your in
your life and use it to your advantage
because think about it in the interview
that you're having at a job that you're
gonna be working on for potentially the
next five years one year ten years
however long if you negotiate
incorrectly the money that you would
have made in the first year you're now
going to make in five years so you just
add it on four more years because you
couldn't use those 15 minutes that you
got to sit down for an interview wisely
so even if you're just starting out in
computer programming great learn skills
but before you get that first job please
make sure you work on your soft skills
and improve them that'll help you with
your negotiation it'll help you with
people at the job liking you which will
help you with promotions and more than
that it'll help you with potentially
being able to get into upper management
okay
nobody wants a leader that they don't
like I know plenty of really good
programmers really skilled at what they
do and this is again not just relating
to programming I mean computer
networking you know people who are in in
any political field whatever it may be
that you're in right if you just focus
on getting good at it there's plenty of
people that are really skilled at what
they do but they don't make enough money
right and at the end of the day no
matter how satisfying our job is we are
doing it to make money and money allows
us to spend more times with our family
spend more time with our friends because
realistically I mean let's be real if
you already had all the money that you
needed you wouldn't be doing a job no
matter how much you love it
right I mean you might still do
something that you love but you probably
wouldn't be doing that job you might run
your own business right so at the end of
the day we are doing a job for money in
return
right so don't you want to get good at
that right don't you want to get more
skilled at those things so really focus
on improving those and please take the
time out do yourself a favor take the
time out to learn about negotiation
skills improve them okay I'll put some
links for you guys below these blog
posts are not written by me but I've
read these and these have helped me
tremendously you guys can read some
books as well maybe I'll find some books
and put them in the links below but yeah
I just want to take out some time and
just talk with you guys for a second
all right guys this is Kazi I'm signing
out peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
