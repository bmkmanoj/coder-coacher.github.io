have a wife and she needs time to and of
course she does but also keep in mind
people like Gary Vaynerchuk or people
like Grant Cardone
also have a wife but they're run like
multiple businesses there are multi
millionaires they change the lives of
millions of people they work non-stop
yet they still find the time to keep up
with their health they still spend
quality time with their children and to
still spend quality time with their
family so don't lie to yourself that you
don't have time I'm not gonna lie to
myself that I don't have time we mess up
but we just need to be honest with why
we're making those mistakes okay that's
where your real change is gonna come
from if you can't look at yourself in
the mirror and be honest with yourself
don't expect anybody else to change your
life I can't change your life that
person next to you can't change your
life and if you're not gonna be honest
with yourself you can't change your life
either so start from there start from
being honest with yourself exactly where
you are in your relationship in your
career in your life your friends near
you write your girlfriend/boyfriend
your wife husband whatever start there
and just go through the list and see
what level each of those things are at
are you happy making the money or making
every year are you happy being able to
just go from paycheck to paycheck
are you happy doing things in a way
that's average where you know you could
be doing better if you're not then there
are things that need to change and to
start that change you need to start by
being honest with yourself okay because
if you make excuses and if you let
yourself off the hook and you say things
like oh but I have this
so that needs time too while that is
true you have those 24 hours if you
juice them and you melt them you can get
a lot done all right you can get a lot
done like I'm gonna tell you from my
personal experience and I'm not amazing
or anything I am you know I was a dumb
college kid and now I'm just a kid who's
trying to run clever programmer and make
sure you guys get massive value out of
it but when I was building clever
programmer you know this is the fastest
channel to go from zero to a hundred
thousand subscribers for coding ever how
did that happen
was was there magic involved no I was
spending like hundreds of hours a week I
was still spending time with my family I
still kept up with my friends you guys
still see my friends in my Instagram
Facebook stories on snapchat and even on
YouTube and even on my live streams from
time to time I still kept up with my
family I still kept up with my friends I
still had a job I was doing I was a
coaching students for programming and
chess and video editing and all kinds of
stuff and students from 20 years of age
to 60 years of age students who were
going to kindergarten to students who
were 45 years old and doing their PhD
program for analytics and needed to use
Python for machine learning I was also
playing chess competitively at the time
and going to tournaments I was also
going to ping pong tournaments at the
same time I was building this channel
like a maniac okay I was also in a
relationship at that time I was also
going to the gym I was also getting
really good sleep and now we have a
full-on company what started as a dream
just a hope and dream and aspirations
and I was like maybe you know one day
people will look at the
and get value out of it maybe clever
programmer will be able to provide value
to other people maybe I can help
somebody who's not just me and a lot of
these things that I learned I can share
this with other people because I was I
don't want to hold this to myself
because I thought what's the point of
being alive if you can't provide value
to others and if others don't know about
you and what started as a dream a year
ago right now we have hundreds of
thousands of students on our YouTube we
have millions of people of viewers on
YouTube
we have a lot of people on an Instagram
Facebook and we have over hundreds
hundreds of thousands of students who've
went through our coding courses and
people have gotten jobs people have gone
promoted at their work people have
gotten internships for you know as
Python Django people have who are web
developers have saved their company over
$23,000 people have become Python web
developers and now even have clients
people have done things there was a
person who is a freelancer CG generalist
and after taking my course he was able
to do something that was taking the
other team in Brazil seven days to do he
was able to automate it with Python in
four hours and made $1,200
all right so all of this stuff happening
and getting people results and making
sure to be there with my students and
always being there with you guys and
listening to you guys and responding to
your emails and your comments and
whatever things you guys have in your
live chat and providing free content for
a full year non-stop day in and day out
every Monday at 11:00 a.m. you would get
a video there were weeks where I was
making seven videos a week for you guys
without asking for a cent
I still made time for all of those
things right and I'm not even close to
somebody like you know all these other
people I'm sure they're people who are
on this livestream who work way more
than I do and are way way way way more
productive but I'm just sharing from my
personal experience that it's possible
to make that time it's possible to have
that time for yourself 24 hours is way
more than enough in a day but you just
need to be true and honest to yourself
look yourself in the mirror and go
exactly where you are don't lie don't
bullshit yourself don't hang out with
people who just make you feel
comfortable because I'm telling you
they're not your true friends they're
just there to make you feel comfortable
and that's it you want people who give
you a reality check who are your cool
friends and support you and make joke
around and have fun but at the same time
push you in the right direction and if
you have that and you reverse engineer
your way to be motivated and to be
passionate and instead of listening to
music you listen to books and while
you're driving or while you're driving
driving and when you're watching Netflix
replacing that what learning and getting
online trainings whether it's on more
motivation or self-development or coding
work on yourself alright be honest with
yourself and you'll see yourself
improving and trust me you don't need 24
hours in a day 24 hours in a day is more
than enough time to help you achieve
your dreams alright but you just have to
start by being honest with yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
