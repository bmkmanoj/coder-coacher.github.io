gave us on the left hand side so
basically they go through pretty much
all the comments that I've already
mentioned but some of the important
things that you see down here below are
like make sure that you have h1 tag that
actually says hello world so let's just
give that a try right how would we do
that see if you can figure out how a way
how to do that and by the way this is
the first challenge free code camp so if
you guys want to try some free code can
stuff go ahead and do that so let's say
h1 tag right and I do hello world like
so I actually don't need to put that in
strings I'm too used to Python and then
just close that h1 tag right there and
then that should be it so that makes our
thing look pretty cool let's say run
tests and enter it says you have
completed it code long and prosper great
submit and go to my next challenge so
awesome let's try our next challenge now
what what are we doing here or the next
few challenges we'll build an html5 app
that would look something like this
that's pretty cool you got your title at
the top left top right you got your logo
or what not your avatar middle you got a
picture
some nice buttons here to delete update
or like multiple choice ting selection
box cat your URL and a submit button
nice so let's see what they want us to
do here create an h2 element so let's
add an h2 element and let's change this
to h2 let's make this I don't know
clever programmer that's our h2 element
make sure your h2 has a closing tag it
does your h2 element should have the
text cat photo app Oh sad news guys it
actually has to be called cat photo
and let's just hit this right over here
and it says your h1 should have the text
hello world Oh what am i doing I'm going
backwards guys h1 hello world let's
close that h1 tag this should be good
now let's hit run test and enter and it
is done all right guys that's it for
this video I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
