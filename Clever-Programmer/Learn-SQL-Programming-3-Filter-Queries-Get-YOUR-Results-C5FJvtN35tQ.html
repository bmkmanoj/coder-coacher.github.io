clever programmer calm welcome back to
sequel part 3 so we're going to jump
through and run through this bad boy so
this is queries with constraints part 2
as title loop there is essentially the
where stuff but more advanced so let's
go through it ok alright so up until now
hopefully you've watched part 1 which is
important why this stuff matters and
once you wrap your mind around why this
stuff matters then the learning kind of
comes from that and the enjoyment and
learning comes from that as well alright
find all the Toy Story movies ok
so that's probably not going to be that
hard I want to find everything about any
movie that's Toy Story so I can try to
filter by John Lasseter but bug's life
also has John Lasseter try to filter
filter by year but years are different
try to filter by length length is
different or so well you guys think
about it think about it before I say any
solution how would I filter it how would
I filter it so it finds a common pattern
between this and the common pattern
between this without being extremely
specific and saying something like
select title from movies where title
equal equal Toy Story and title equal
equal Toy Story 2 so without being a
painfully verbose let's keep it really
really simple ok and let's try to find a
pattern here that will allow us to
capture all of that all right so let's
jump in and see ok so a lot of the times
which have to be use for that is
something called wild cards ok which is
probably what they're going to talk
about here I don't have to use a
specific word wild card but that's
really what it is
let's see if they use well you have to
actually do wild car card pattern
matching so okay so the one that we're
probably looking for is something like
an asterisk which they're not showing
here I think I can say like okay so I
can use this word like all right check
it out this is going to be really cool
what do I have to select I have to
select only the title since you have to
find all the Toy Story titles we are
going to do select star for now from
movies where title like and here the do
wild card matching so if you do the %
and you put anything in between it it
will just look for that so for example
80 is called in sensitive case matching
so here 80 or attic or bats or cat
anything has 80 in it either at the end
or at the beginning or in the middle
okay so we're title like um percent toy
um
story because we're looking for Toy
Story 1 Toy Story 2 twist sorry 3 so
we're going to say just look for this
and then that's it so it almost reads
like English select everything from
movies where the title is like Toy Story
right right
but generally how you'll write it is
just break it down and separate lines so
it's easy to kind of Reason through it
and read through it okay let's reset
let's try the second one you try it and
then I'm going to do it as well so then
you follow along and look at my solution
okay no cheating
you don't deserve to cheat unless you
know how to do it so pause please then
actively learn and then you can come and
see solutions it's a good idea to learn
like that find all the movies directed
by John Lasseter so how are we going to
do that think about it okay pause if you
got it
um okay good I'm gonna go through it I'm
just going to kind of speak it and then
and I'm going to like format it so okay
select all the movies so I'm going to
select all the movies from movies where
director and I can say like and I'm
going to say John Lasseter okay so it's
selected all the movies where that's the
director perfect let's reset again find
all the movies and director not directed
by John Lasseter okay so select here's
the hack I'm going to do for this one
from movies where director like John
Lasseter okay and check up the heck and
just negate the whole thing and then it
gives you the opposite that's it boom
done alright find all the wall-e movies
so for example you might have wall G or
wall-e or yeah that's it so I think I
can do it the same way I can select
everything from you know and then go
down select everything from movies where
movie like over sorry title like wall to
percent like that okay and I don't need
a percent behind that I can just say
wall and then whatever match is that
whatever random stuff afterwards is fine
I can also do this and then do the %
here okay all of those work okay guys we
are done with exercise 3 great job so
far
keep trying to do it on your own and
then also then check in with the video
because I'll cover a lot of the
peripheral stuff that goes around it for
example I'll do some right now here you
have like if not like you have in and
not in so for example how I would use in
here is I can say we're title in wall
e comma wall G that also works okay so
that's an example okay guys thank you
for watching awesome I'll see you in
part four I think that's what it should
be and we're going to cover more stuff
so this is it for this video and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
