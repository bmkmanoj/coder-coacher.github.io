frameworks Jango and flask like I've
mentioned cure my recommendations flask
is pretty simple but the problem is that
okay let's just talk about quickly what
a framework is so if you were to do web
development Python you would have to
pull out your hair
not because of Python Python is awesome
but because web development you'd have
to write all your own code but if you
use a framework with Python like flask
the benefit of that is that it does all
the big heavy lifting for you that you
don't have to worry about anymore so
creating servers and making things go
online on a website
okay make other people be able to see
your website it's super easy you can do
it with just a few lines of code flask
is super light weight again as I'm
talking write these things down flask is
pretty lightweight and it's cool but the
problem is because it's too lightweight
sometimes it's you have to write a lot
of code to make things work whereas
Django is a little bit more advanced
looking and can be confusing sometimes
but it's what we call batteries included
and it comes with a lot of libraries a
lot of big things juicy meaty things
built in there so think of it like bunch
of developers who gave up and had
sleepless nights God probably divorces
because it works so hard and like got
huge eye bags writing all this code and
creating this amazing thing for you and
now you could just steal it with just a
few lines of code and use it okay so
think of it think of Django like that
and you could build things pretty
quickly
okay so web development django
developers make about a hundred and ten
thousand dollars a year jingle is my
more preferred framework it's a little
bit advanced but if it's taught to you
the right way you can pick it up fast
and then you don't have to look back
django is my preferred way to go write
that down
second best text editors or coding
editors for pi
so there are a lot of them there is
sublime text there is at hum and then
there is pycharm sublime text and atom
you can use interchangeably sublime text
that annoying thing is it keeps asking
for purchase whereas atom is completely
free so you guys can just download atom
to write your code in pie chart is my
personal favorite IDE or let's just
simplify and say coding editor it's my
favorite but I would recommend you guys
to get into PyCharm around the second or
third month mark of your coding because
it is a little bit more technical and it
is a little bit more advanced and in the
start it might confuse you more than it
helps you because of how big it is but
again is just a few practical things you
need to know and then boom boom boom
you're all caught up alright so for
someone who wants to enter into web dev
what would you advise them Jango seems
challenging with their setups and admin
Django is honestly pretty simple to get
started with just the starting part is
sometimes tricky but once you get past a
little bit of starting time it's pretty
easy to build things up really fast with
Django so again I'm a huge fan of Django
but if you have extra time in your life
learn a little bit of flask maybe spend
a week learning flask and that will show
you the things you need to be doing with
web development and how you're doing
them because you're gonna be writing
each line of code yourself you'll get a
good grasp of what the heck is going on
and then when you do them in Django
you'll just be like oh it's just like
this thing I did in Flast except it's
easier now and it won't confuse you okay
so that's really it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
