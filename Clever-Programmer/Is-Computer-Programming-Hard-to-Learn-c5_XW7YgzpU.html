clubber programmer not common in this
video we're going to answer the question
of computer programming hard to learn so
let's jump right into it okay so I get
this question a lot computer programing
hard to learn well I would kind of flip
it back on to you and say hey tell me
one thing that you think is worth doing
that can actually make you money that
can actually make you happy that can
satisfy you that's not hard right so if
you go back in your life search your
memory vault you will find that almost
everything that's worthwhile is actually
hard right so with computer programming
it's no different I'm not going to lie
to you and say that it's somehow like
you'll learn it instantly but here are a
few things I will say to you it's not
harder than any other field that you
want to get good at first of all another
thing I want to add is I want to kind of
jump right into busting myths okay so
some of the most handicapping myths that
will stop you from actually getting good
at computer programming are number one
do I need to be a math genius to
actually get good at computer
programming and I'm going to bust this
one right out right away
okay the answer is no you do not need to
be some kind of math genius to get good
at computer programming all right
programming does not require any kind of
like you don't need to know some
differential equation you don't need to
have taken some calculus okay there are
people who have written all that code
for you that you can actually kind of
just use for yourself and make your life
a lot easier
okay so let's cut that one out right
away because it stops 90% of the people
for pursuing this field probably the
number one growing fields right now in
the world as people we work actually
harder to find excuses to not do
something rather than to find excuses to
do something
and this particular one being a math
genius or a math wizard happens to be
one of those one myth number two is it
too late for me to start learning
computer programming is it too late it
wasn't too late for Jeff Bezos to start
Amazon it wasn't too late for William
Boeing and it certainly wasn't too late
for Hugo Boss this is another one of
those myths that people use to kind of
stop themselves from achieving their
dreams achieving their goals and
avoiding their fear of failure the quick
answer to that is no it's not too late
to learn computer programming from my
experience I have taught students of who
are age 7 who learns and also of age 65
and older who have actually learned and
that's just from me right the people
that I work with now you reach out to
thousands of other people who are
learning online in today's day and age
and thousands of them are actually a lot
older and this started and they've
become great at computer programming and
you don't always they're not like two
different companies you can work at all
all right they're not just Dropbox and
Google there are many other companies
and independent contractor work that you
can do as a software developer so if you
develop a certain skills let's say it's
creating apps creating a web apps if
it's helping solve somebody's problem
there's somebody that you can actually
work with and charge so that's how I
would answer that question okay it's not
too late for you to start learning
computer programming I have a few videos
that talk about what programming
language you can start off with first
that can help you kind of decide okay
where do you kind of start all right I
have a video that will show you what
kind of resources you can use to help
you learn computer for
they can learn it faster alright go
ahead and watch those if you're
interested in pursuing this but those
were some of the most handicapping myths
that I could think of that I wanted to
kind of tell you that don't fall for
them okay
don't let your excuses drive your
behavior don't let your fear of failure
stop you from achieving your goal okay
computer programming is an awesome field
and I think in today's day and age
everybody should be doing it and no
matter what field you're in you can
actually use it to help you that's one
of the things I cover in why you should
learn code video as well okay that's it
guys for me this is Kazi I'm signing out
I love every single one of you and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
