clever programmer comm and you are
watching KOAT Adam II Python tutorial 17
alright cool
get excited because just to show you
where we're at you know I'm sure you
already know and you're just waiting for
this part but we're at 50 about 50
something percent and we are currently
at battleship now just a little bit of
an aside something really oh well not
really but a little sad happen I so I
recorded this video that's why we're at
36 percent of battleship I recorded that
video there's about 30 minutes long
however it got deleted so we're just
going to go through it again alright but
I'm just going to focus on making it
even better this time so you guys are
going to get the best of everything so
just ignore the 36 percent imagine that
it's zero percent so we're going to go
to part one you see all those tick marks
ignore those we're going to start from
part one okay welcome to battleship
because that's where you guys are and I
care more about that rather than where I
am at okay so in this project we will
build a game called battleship how does
this game work well this game works very
simply um it's basically like a 5x5 grid
and you got to hide your ship somewhere
and then other people try to shoot at it
and if they guess correct they get to
hit and sink your ship okay just in case
you've never played it so let me show
you an example of it on the board so
I've already copied this from my
previous video and we're going to
demonstrate a board a 5x5 board using a
Python list within lists okay so this is
a big list that contains these five rows
here okay so this is representing kind
of like a 5x5 how this list looks in
reality is like this just so you guys
are not confused
um it's actually like this okay there
are no spaces anywhere else like you can
even assign it to a variable but I want
to make it look nice and look in that
way because it's hard to read otherwise
what's going on okay for human beings
not for computers for computers it's
still the same thing
and effectively let's say I hit my ship
at our row 3 right this is let's say row
2 because this is row 0 and let's say
this is row 1 and this is row 2 and this
is column 2 this is column 0 column 1
and column 2 so let's say I hit my ship
in row 2 column 2 you would go here and
let's say you took a guess and you guess
that I had my ship here and you hit that
spot you probably have 10 guesses or
something like that oh actually it says
right here the player will have 10
guesses to try to sink the ship and if
you guess that spot then you get to hit
my ship and sink it but I'm not going to
let you do that I'm going to try to hide
my ship really well I'm okay at this
game not really I suck okay so to build
this game we will use our knowledge of
lists right here I'm reading
conditionals and functions in Python
basically what they're showing you is
hey with what we've learned so far we're
going to use that to create something
more powerful something even something
really good so that's why we're working
on a project we're effectively taking
the knowledge that we have and putting
it to some use practical thing so to
speak okay all right so I'm going to
save and submit and start next lesson
okay getting our feet wet the first
thing we need to do is to set up the
game board so it's initially it was like
that the only reason you saw it
completed was because I've completed it
earlier so what I'm going to do is hit
reset code and simply it says create a
variable board and set it to equal an
empty list so what I alluded to earlier
in this part right here welcome to
battleship so right before this what I
alluded to was a board right that has
five by five so that's effectively what
we're going to be doing so board but
initially we started off with an empty
list start next lesson now it says make
a list what is this part over here right
what is this showing me well all this
does is it puts together a list with
just let's say you have one oh well
it'll just make a list with five O's
okay you see that right here makes a
list with five O's so what we want is we
want to create a board if you want to
create a grid we need this to happen
five times so we need to create five
different lists with O's in them and and
store that in a list of lists okay so
for example it should kind of look like
this but we need all of this to be one
thing and tied together so we need to
put all of this in just one list okay
effectively we're going to see how we do
that they're going to show us so I'm
going to say save in okay so here create
a five by five grid what they're doing
here is just that so let's paste this
code let's run it and let's do print
board okay so what's going on here oh
I'm sorry we have to reset this code but
here's how I went about it okay I'm
going to do this live for now I don't
care about this variable I'm not going
to use it so I'm just going to name it
underscore you can name it I you can
name it whatever you want but if I never
if there's ever a time I'm not using the
looping variable I write an underscore
and that's how you're supposed to do it
according to Python conventions or the
pep eight that's something you guys are
going to learn about later there's a
whole thing on styling your code so
right now just focus on writing code but
later you want to focus on how to write
clean code that other people can read
and it's easy to understand even for
yourself when you come back Leigh
rather than a bunch of junk for example
sure you can say a is equal to 5 and X
is equal to 5 on the same line but
that's annoying to read and know Python
ist's will in like this and they'll yell
at you for it
so much better is just that it's easier
to read ok so I'm going to do 4 blank in
range and I'm going to do range of 5 so
I want this loop to run 5 times right
range 0 to 5 will effectively create
that list up to 5 but not including 5
this is the reason why it will loop
through five times this underscore is
going to be 0 the first time then 1 then
2 then 3 then 4 you get the idea but
we're not going to be using that
underscore that's why I named it
underscore and I'm going to say print o
times 5 okay well what is this gonna do
you're gonna see I'm sorry actually yep
so you see that right there it just
printed it out and making it oh every
time right so let's go back to how the
code was and all I did was just that
except I added an append to it all right
so all they want us to do is use range
to loop okay so I'm going to use range
to loop from 0 to 5 and I'll simply say
that to board right append that so
now we're going to have a list
containing five lists inside of it okay
because remember this creates a list so
we're going to keep going through the
loop and creating lists inside of that
and you effectively have that board that
we were talking about how did this work
well underscore was zero the first time
and then we came down here not like we
need this zero at all and we just simply
appended this list right there to the
board like that then we looped again and
underscore was one next time and then we
appended this list right over here to
the board then we loop through it again
and then we simply appended right this
part of Ally weights to this part of
valuates to this and we simply appended
that to the board and effectively what
ends up happening what ends up happening
at the end of it is that board is equal
to let me just make it clear whoops
okay ultimately board is equal to this
thing that we were talking about earlier
and this just showed us how to create a
five by five board like that okay so
this thing here is the same thing right
that thing up there above my head in the
terminal right here is the same as what
the board is I just spaced it out nicer
so as a human being you could synthesize
that information in an easier way and
just tell right off the bat that's five
rows rather than really squinting your
eyes here and going okay there's a comma
right here so this whole part is the
first element this whole part is the
second element this whole part is the
third element and so on and so forth
okay hopefully that makes sense so we're
gonna simply I think copy paste the code
and that should be good enough and then
we should just print I don't know if we
have to print board inside the loop use
a pen a list containing five zeros to
board just like in the example above
note that it's owes not zero so actually
it's an O and I do have a no I just said
zero for no reason and we'll just print
it for fun to see what it looks like
okay right there start next check it
twice so again I'm going to reset the
code use the print command to display
the contents of the board okay great job
now that we have built our board let's
show it off throughout our game we'll
want to print the game board so the
player can see which locations that they
have already guessed regularly printing
the board will help us debug our program
so when we're creating this program
constantly printing out the board will
help us identify if there are
potentially any errors or if we're
messing up with our logic somewhere
right it'll visually just show us
however the easiest way to print the
board would be to have Python display it
for us using the print command let's
give that a try and see what the results
look like is this useful way to print
our board for battleships so when we
create a board using this algorithm
right here the simple loop that keeps
a list of OHS to the board and
essentially creating five rows let's
look at it is this look nice
heck no it looks hideous right it looks
really really bad
you have to squint your eyes to see the
commas to see the rows where anything is
and if you're playing a game here nobody
would want to play your game if you were
showing this to your friends they would
not be your friends anymore bad things
would happen right your family would be
like we don't like this guy anymore so
you want to make it in a way so it is
easy on the eyes right your friends have
fun when they're trying this out and
even you yourself could have fun and be
proud of showing them something cool so
let's go back here and let's try to make
this better so when it prints it out it
does not look like this it looks a lot
better all right so let's go
save and submit code and let's start
next lesson and I'm simply gonna reset
the code okay so now we're going to
create custom print now we can see the
contents of our list but clearly it
would be easier to play the game if we
could print the board out like a grid
with each row on its own line first
delete your print statement that's what
it tells us to do then define a function
name print board and with a single
argument board inside the function write
a for loop that iterates through each
row and print that out to the screen
call your function on board okay like
that let's take it and try it out and
let's see what happens alright so how
did this happen we got 5 rows and we
didn't get the outer list we just got
the 5 inner rows how did that happen
let's talk about it really quickly here
we created the board you already know
how we did that here we already created
this thing that gives us
essentially that okay so this loop alone
creates all of that but how did we do it
so we printed it out really nicely well
let me show you so this was bored right
that's what we created
oops that's what we created and what
happened was we're bored was we got that
part right there right
so we basically passed that board to our
function call right here now it went to
the definition of the function with the
same board and how what does that
function tell us to do
well that function tells us that for
each row in there right so what is row
let's actually bring that up so it's a
little bit easier to read what's going
on still not really easy but so what is
happening right we have that board right
there and we have that board right here
so the first time we go through the loop
the row is actually this thing here and
then we say print that and it outputs
this row right over here okay
then the next time we go through the
loop row is simply this row out of that
list so row becomes that guy and we say
print that guy and that's how you get
the second row okay I'm going to remove
that giant board because it's confusing
so I'm going to just step you through it
then the third time we go through
remember it's this board that we passed
into our function row iterates over this
list and the next time it's the third
element in the list then rows the fourth
element and then finally row is the
fifth element in that list and it prints
it out line by line this way you don't
get to see the outer list kind of cool
and let's save and submit and we got
each row cool let's start next lesson
now printing pretty we're getting pretty
close to a playable board but wouldn't
it be nice to get rid of those quote
marks and commas restoring our data as a
list but the player doesn't need to know
that and check that out
isn't that amazing right over here
look what they're showing you this is
exactly what I was showing you guys in
the last video so you can call me mystic
Mac because I predict these things right
that's what Conor McGregor would say so
you know I'll take credit where it's due
so yeah that feels pretty good
we were we were trying this part out
right here earlier right and they're
showing us this now so you're gonna see
how this was useful and literally it was
these examples that I was showing as
well one was with an empty space in
between and then another one I showed
was with four hyphens but they have
three hyphens here and I was talking
about creating a game and showing it
nice and here they are creating
battleships and showing it that's okay
I didn't check this earlier but I am
going through it now and I saw that they
have it so let's keep going through it
okay how does this work well we have
this list ABCD if we call this join
weird thing if we call join with that
space on this list letters well what it
does is it gives you back a space B
space C space D it joined every letter
with a space in between that's what this
is saying hey join every letter in the
list with the space in between that's
the space in between and this part is
saying join every letter with three
hyphens in between whereas so you can
see a three hyphens b3 - C and three
hyphens and D so we want to turn each
row into oh and nothing else okay
simple let's go in here
and let's try let's try bored of zero
right if we did bored of zero what will
we get we should get back the first
element in the board which is that guy
right there what was the error list
indices must be integers or slices not
tuple what is it saying oh we didn't put
commas here right so that's what here we
go
so the 0th element will give you that
guy this the first element will give you
that guy second element will give you
that guy so okay now let's call dot join
on that list so all those are together
all those are together if I called join
on the entire board you'll get an error
because you can put strings together but
you can't put list together right you're
passing it the entire board so what it's
trying to do is put all of these guys
together separated by a space that
doesn't make sense it's trying to do
this
like literally all these guys with the
space that makes no sense
Oh what does that think well I don't
know so it's not a strength so you can't
do arbitrary operations to that okay so
we are going to essentially do the same
thing so for zero we're going to join it
by spaces and then for one we're going
to join it by spaces and for two we're
going to join it by spaces and for three
we're going to join it by spaces and so
on and so forth forth all right let's
let's do just that for row in board for
um let's see I'm getting each row and
four I can say numbers in row I can say
join numbers set print and let's run it
let's see what happens okay
is that what we wanted no so let's go
back and debug and let's see what
happens so for row and board let's first
print row let's take it one step at a
time instead of doing two loops right
away so you can see that we get these
guys right over here so we're getting
one row at a time
well let's try this let's do dot join on
that row let's try that let's see what
happens and there we go
right we got the row and then we just
simply joined each row and that's it and
then we just loop through and did that
for every single list in the list board
this is called a two-dimensional array
it's a little advanced concept but you
guys are getting access to it right now
that's called a grid and that's a 2d
array or a 2d list okay array in other
languages it just means a list in Python
okay
so that is why it's called 2d is because
you have lists within lists and for
another reason that I'll show you that
you can access things by row and column
okay for instance if you wanted to
access that X right there right how
would you do it you would you would see
what row it's in so 0 1 2 3 and what
column it sends you'd go 0 1 2 3 it's in
third row and third column and the basic
idea is row comma column will give you
um the item you are looking for in a 2d
list okay or a grid okay this is
important note write it down or write it
down my hand write it down in your
Evernote or whatever thing you use
because that's important so for example
I can do board of three row and three
column and I can print it out and you
will see that I get back that X right
this X right there so if I comment out
these guys and if I change that X to
something else you can see that I get
that something else okay how does that
work well board three this row will get
me this entire list and now inside of
this entire list I have to access the
zero one two third index so right this
essentially that whole thing is this
right here and to get hidden from that I
just have to do three okay so I can just
do that right here they're equivalent
a
all right cool all right so let's try
that okay uh we should just do that to
our function okay so we're going to go
in here go in here and just just do that
to our function cool so now we get a
nice board and remember we don't need to
show the person right it says here we're
starting we're storing our data as a
list but the player doesn't need to know
that
remember the player doesn't need to know
that you're storing it as a list you
want to show it to them in a nice user
friendly way
imagine if on your iphone every time you
have to put a number and you saw some
kind of dictionary you don't see any
dictionary in you know right even though
when you're storing numbers in your
iPhone it's storing it in a dictionary
like a key value pair but you don't see
a squiggly and then only after that
squiggly you can put your name right
just to recall dictionary is worth like
this key comma value so it's not like
you have to write your name exactly
right here and then put it as a string
right you as a matter of fact don't even
know what's going on in the back end and
do you just get to do stuff from a nice
user interface and then on the back end
it knows it's a dictionary on the back
end it knows it's the list same idea is
working here effectively okay we are
creating a list for the back end but
your user doesn't need to know that and
it doesn't look boring and annoying to
the user anymore it looks nice it looks
easy it's easy on the eyes I see the
five by five really cool okay let's
start next lesson reset code and let's
check out what they're talking about
here so they're talking about random
that's awesome again same thing is going
on here right from random import Rand
int again
you guys from like import that import
magical command again these people right
they were staying up late at night
eating ramen noodle writing this code
right they're probably lost friends
while they were working on these giant
projects and they you know their their
relationships got destroyed but they did
they gave us no sacrifices for us and if
we don't understand this import command
we're letting all of these amazing
brilliant coders sacrifices go in vain
you guys so understand how import works
because import will change your life and
why it's so important is you're getting
to use geniuses code right people who
are really smart and wrote brilliant
code and wrote these really useful
libraries you get to just say import and
now you can use all of their code
without having to know how that code
works cool so effectively what we're
doing here is that from random module
we're importing a function called Rand
int which is random integer what it does
is you give it a range and it's
inclusive on both ends and it picks a
point what does that mean if you give it
zero and one it could pick zero and it
could pick one both okay
it's not that it goes up to but not
including the one like how we're used to
in a lot of Python things so just to
show you how this works I'm again I
could use ripple it to show you but I
also want to use other things so you
know that you can use multiple things
for this and I have examples up there
but I'll show you right down here from
random import ran and and effectively I
can do Rand int 0 to 6 and I can keep
running it yeah and you see that you got
6 indeed and you got 0 and you got
numbers in between you got 2 2 1 1 4
every time you get it generates a number
ran
whoops so it could be the same number or
it could be a different number okay it's
it's random it's pretty random so why is
that important well check it out that's
what we're going to use right this is
says hi excellent now let's hide our
battleship in a random location on the
board since we have a two dimensional
list remember we talked about the 2d
list right before this we'll use two
variables to store the ship's location
ship row and ship column you remember I
showed you list row column that's the
trick we're going to use to store our
hidden variable so let's say that we had
that board that we created earlier
you're right a few times this board
right here ooh
not X's I want all of those to be
strings so let's somehow bring that code
back that generates that board okay so
that creates the board I don't need this
for now five four okay all right so what
did we do we imported the random ran
into phones from random module and we
initialize board to be an empty list
then we went ahead and constructed the
board which is the five by five grid
with five O's in each row and now we're
just going to print out that board so
you can see that right over here this is
a five by five grid just trust me and
I've already shown you multiple times so
well what we want to do is we want to be
able to place or hit an item in there or
let the computer pick a hidden item in
there and then we have to guess where it
is okay so how do we do that well check
it out
what I can do is I can place hidden item
and then print board after that and
you'll see the difference between the
two fours okay I'm going to do new line
new line so it separates it out and now
I will do board of row two and column
three and I'm going to set it equal to
hidden so the O in Row two Row two is
right here and column three is right
over here it's going to set this right
here to hidden the word hidden and
you're going to see the difference so
that's the top board right this is line
ten printing out the board that we
constructed the regular board this
prints out two new lines that's why
there's a little segregation there and
then this part here prints out the board
and you can see two three is actually
hidden well these numbers that are
generated by ourselves here two and
three we need these to be generated
randomly okay so we're going to use
effectively what we can do is use Rand
int here directly to generate a number
between zero and four and including zero
and four this means that it generates
five numbers right zero one two three
four that's five numbers if you put five
here that would be wrong because you
can't possibly go to row six you
understand because we're gonna start
from row zero when we're in this
indexing so we can do that here and we
can do Rand and of zero comma four here
as well well each time this is going to
be generating some number from zero to
four and each time this is going to be
generating a number between zero and
four so let's check it out now hidden is
going to be in a different position
every time right hidden is here now
hidden is here now let's check where
hidden is it hidden is right over here
okay but to make this code a little bit
cleaner what we're going to do is we're
going to assign those variables okay so
I'm going to say
random row equals Rand int 0 comma 4 and
I'm going to say a random column is
equal to R and n 0 comma 4 and here I'm
simply going to say a random row and
here I'm simply going to say random
column ok and every time I print it out
you can see that hidden right here is in
a different location effectively every
time so you want it the computer to be
automatically able to pick where hidden
is so when you're playing and you guess
that location you can sink the ship so
we're not going to have it actually say
hidden because then obviously you know
where it is but I'm just showing you for
now how random works and how changing
things in a 2d list works okay so all of
that is great but what if the board is a
different size it's not a 5 by 5 grid
it's a 6 by 6 rid or whatever how do you
know instead of 4 what to put there well
how are we getting this 4 and how can we
programmatically get it every time well
just get the length of what the board is
right and this should give you five
because there are five elements in the
list board right element 1 element 2
element 3 element 4 and element 5 so
lengths of bore should evaluate to 5 but
remember putting 5 here would be
incorrect and the reason is because now
Rand int is giving you numbers from 0 to
5 including 0 and 5 and that's six total
options and you can never go to row 6 or
column 6 for that matter so well we're
going to do is lend board minus 1 and
Len board minus 1 right and this should
give us what we want
effectively ok every time you'll see
hidden changing every time right hidden
is changing cool let's go back define
two new functions random run random cold
that take eat that each take board is
input
okay they just want us to define it as a
function so random row board and a
return random integer between 0 and Len
of board minus 1 and effectively random
Col board that takes in board and
returns random integer between 0 and Len
of board minus 1 okay that's where they
got Len of board minus 1 call each
function on board so now we're going to
call each function on board and we're
going to say
we're gonna say random I was just
reading just in case I've missed
anything in their instructions but it
doesn't look like it
random row pass it the board that we
created this is the board that we
created up here okay these four lines
effectively are three lines of code we
construct the entire board for the game
and I'm going to do that I need one
parenthesis okay cool
and we can see what this is doing join
print right here we got to make sure
that we do print so what is that
effectively doing these functions just
return an integer okay if you give them
board they just return it return an
integer so we give it a board we give it
that five by five grid each containing
five each list containing 500s strings
and then what it does is it takes that
board it returns its length minus one
which in this case would be zero to four
and that's simply evaluates to some
random integer like let's say two and so
this part might just evaluate to two and
this part might evaluate to some number
like zero for column and it might be
some zeros column and that way we have
our random row and a random column and
then we can later use it for whatever
reason okay so for this part I'm going
to stop it right here and we're going to
continue in our next video so please if
you haven't yet please subscribe like
the video or if you could please share
it with whoever you know or maybe don't
share that's maybe your secret of
getting better at programming whatever
the case may be
this is Kazi from clever programmer comm
you just finished watching part 17 I
will see you in code Kadim e python
