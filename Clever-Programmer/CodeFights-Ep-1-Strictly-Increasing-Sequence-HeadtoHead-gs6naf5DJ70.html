clever programmer calm where you learn
to code smarter in this video what I
want to talk about is something super
awesome so I want to start it I wanted
to start a new series and I've been
thinking about doing this for quite some
time
and basically I'm gonna go on code fight
calm and just fight a bunch of people
okay what does that mean well code
fights calm or code fight calm is the
website where you go and challenge other
people to programming challenges and
then you both are given a time and so
whoever does it faster and with less
bugs wins they try to keep their
problems pretty simple they're not too
hard so it's mostly just having fun
another reason why I want to do this is
because I play chess a lot so in chess
it's really useful to watch a
professional player play these really
short games two-minute five-minute games
and by watching you just will get to
learn a lot so I'm hoping that you get
to watch me like play against other
people and see how I do I might lose I
might win who knows but you'll be
learning kind of how to think about code
and how to make it play for you and
maybe you can go on this website and
play for yourself too
alright so other than that let's get
started we're gonna make this pretty
damn fun so let's go here whoops so many
tabs man I think it's called code fights
calm hopefully I'm right yes code fights
calm here we go so I just got a bunch of
points for some reason and can I change
my name let me change it to clever
programmer there we go
all right so whatever I don't care I can
keep my name the same let's see
improve and challenge your coding skills
while unlocking our cave map mmm that
sounds like a lot of fun but what I want
to do is head to head let's do it baby
let's do it let's fight so we're gonna
fight against a random opponent and I'm
gonna try to rip them to shreds or her
but that doesn't sound nice that's not
what's gonna happen okay I'm probably
gonna lose okay so I'm gonna try to talk
through it a little bit but if I can't
I'll try to talk through it through it
later so at the bottom you can see that
I have 52 seconds it's incredibly not
smart to skip these time you you should
just use this time to think about and
read through this problem before you get
started because if you skip this time
then you'd have to understand the
problem in the round and you'll lose a
lot of time so I've already lost 30
seconds talking you guys let's figure it
out consider an arithmetic expression in
the form of a hashtag B is equal to C
check whether it's possible to replace a
hashtag with one of the four signs to
obtain a correct expression this is a
pretty difficult problem arithmetic
expression ABC is true we can replace
hashtag with a plus sign to obtain two
three equals five okay so basically it
should be like a question mark a B gives
you C okay that's what it should say a
question like B gives you C so what
operator can you put in this question
mark that'll give you back the result
okay so let's see they're giving us some
time here and they have some test
results at the bottom that we can also
run against and check if our answer is
correct or not so let's figure it out
okay what is it saying let's write some
stuff down my comment was there and I
was a problem but
if I do float here or not there but if I
do float here I know that it should be
correct okay all right so we got this
one right and I got a hundred points on
this so let's move on I am going to say
that okay let's just rate it up it was
really I forgot that you can't do
comments comments count as a source code
line which is kind of annoying okay so
given length of triangle size check if
it is I sauces isosceles hmm we should
get some music in here right but I'm not
gonna worry about that right now cuz on
my chest channel I ended up getting some
copyright issues so we're gonna stay
away from music for a second but in the
next videos will probably have music
okay so I have sides 4 3 2 the output
should be isosceles triangle size is
equal to false 5 3 5 the output should
be that how is isosceles triangle
described I think it's if the two sides
are equal and one is different right so
I basically have to check that what I
have to check I have to basically check
that I have 3 inputs and what should I
say or should I say about it an
isosceles triangle you have to have two
sides equal and one side different okay
so let me just read my test cases just
to make sure that that's right Falls
true okay so what code do I write to
make sure that that is the case hmm
so if I sort them the net should mean
how does sort get is it sort does it
sort here let's just shake if sort a
sort the dot sort path it sorts it in an
ascending order or descending order so I
just want to double check that let's
call this X and call or sorry what am i
doing X is equal to this list and then
let's sort X and let's call X and let's
see what it does and okay when you call
sort on a list it essentially puts in an
ascending order the dot sort method so
if it's an ascending order then I know
that either the first two are equal and
the last one is different or the last
two are equal and the first one is
different
can I call unique elements and get back
if my number of unique elements is 2
right if I have 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 the other guy is
at score 200 so he's winning right now
but let's just go through this and let's
see maybe we'll win so if I call unique
elements I should get back three unique
elements right if I call set on it now
what if I call set on this right I get
back to unique elements and in the case
that I get two unique elements then I
know it's an isosceles triangle because
two sides are the same and one side is
different that's what two unique
elements would mean so I think I am just
going to you know I don't even need that
sort line that they have up at the top
I'll say if the length of calling set on
sides is equal to two then essentially
give me true I actually don't need any
of this code
you just write a one line solution and
that should work right I can essentially
remove all this code and I can say a
return Len of sort or sorry what was it
again Len of set of the size is equal to
two and that should return true or false
yeah so I said but basically you can see
it's whining that it needs to be exactly
that line those amount of lines okay fun
problem and I'm gonna give it a thumbs
up good job guy sounds good okay now we
are on round three and the score is
equal so far so he has 200 and I have
200 and we are on round three so let's
let's check it out
so what do I want to do here I want to
check if it's increasing sequence if it
is I return true if it isn't then I
return false how would I check if
something is an increasing sequence so
here this is strictly increasing
sequence 1 is less than 3 which is less
than 8 here 2 is not less than 2 so we
just stop and we return false
right because 2 is not less than 2 and
here 2 is less than 3 so this is fine
but this part is not fine so essentially
I need to write something like a bubble
sort if you guys know what that is
you'll be on the same page as me but if
you don't essentially I want to go I
want to do pairwise iteration and I want
to check each of them against each other
ok so let's go and write something like
that I want to go check each of them at
the same time and check if the previous
one is smaller than the next one if it
isn't and then I just want to return
false okay so I'm gonna look I'm gonna
write a little bit of fancy
fancy-schmancy code here so I want to
save previous comma next in
a sequence starting from one all of it
at the end no that would be no no it
should be actually all the way up to the
end but excluding the last one and then
I wanna says sequence from one to all
the way to the end and then I want to
say so my previous is gonna be the
previous guy next one's gonna be the
next guy in the list and I want to just
go and check them against each other
if previous right if I if not purchaser
if previous is not less than next then
return false and if you make it past all
those checks I want you to return true
okay so this is going to work and you
can see that I passed all of those and
I'll hit submit so I got five hundred
points he's at two hundred I got three
hundred points for the last one and I
got done before him as you can see I
will go in a little bit more death depth
and explain it this was great
required knowledge bubble sort type of
stuff like pairwise iteration right and
I'll hit next and so okay I won why did
I win well it'll go over and explain it
okay so check it out I got a beautiful
badge on my trainee for twenty ones so
you can play me okay I'm not mean I'm
not gonna be mean I'll like right nice
responses to you and tell you where you
could have done better or hey you might
just come and crush me who knows let's
share this on where should we share it
let's share it on Google we did
something cool right let's just share it
oh I have to write my own comment look
at that beautiful coffee drinker all
right let's get out of here
next and close beautiful that's awesome
so why did I win because he took 27
minutes to complete it and I took 11
minutes so I'm going to explain the last
bit to you guys and if I remember I will
simply put it in as a note note for you
that you can actually look at so the
last problem was checked if things are
an increasing sequence right so check
strictly increasing sequence so what did
I write here this cryptic looking code
well here's how this works
okay here's how this function works
first of all you have to understand how
zip works zip runs through two lists at
the same time that's what I like about
lists so let's say that you have a list
called 1 2 3 4 5 or let's just make it
look something different ok let's just
say something like this 15 5 7 and that
ok
let's call this list prices and then you
have a list called fruits and let's
let's call it banana
we have Apple pretty expense expense of
Apple 15 dollars we have another thing
for $5 Kiwi we got strawberry for $7 and
then we have apricot running out of
fruits here so this maps to like banana
this maps to this right like they're in
this each position like zero position
matches zero position first matches
first so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
run through both of these lists and
print out banana and its price at the
same time how am I gonna do that I'll
just do this I'll say a price comma
fruit in
and I will say the list prices and then
the list fruits and I will say a print
price , fruit right so I'll hit run and
you can see that it prints the price and
it prints the fruit okay
and it iterates through both of the
lists at the same time so that's what's
nice about zip right it'll it's the 0th
index of the list that starts with 10
and then it's at the 0th index of fruits
at index 0 and so the first time we
iterate through the list price becomes
10 fruit becomes banana and the string
banana I'm just lazy to put quotes
around it but fruit is banana ok I'll
just put it and price is 10 okay and
that's why you get this out there so
that's what zip does it allows you to
iterate to through two things so what
did I do was this part here and why is
this so nice here's what it does okay so
I want to check it strictly increasing
sequence and I'll actually leave this
here for you guys like as notes or
something so I'll just say price comma
fruit how to use zip function and now
let's talk about it okay so for what was
that okay so here let's say you have
numbers and you have them like this one
five six and then let's say you have
four okay and what you want to do is go
through it and say that this is not in
an in strictly increasing sequence right
because you can see that it's not one
five six four this is not higher than
six so this is not in a strictly
increasing sequence right so not a
strictly increasing sequence
so what do I want to do I want to
iterate through this and just check each
of these I want to check one against
five and see if one is less than five if
it is I want to go on to the next
iteration I want to check five against
six if five is less than six then I want
to move on then I want to check six
against four if six is less than four I
want to move on however in this case six
is not less than four
I want the iteration to stop and I want
it to return false at this point when
we're running the function so how do I
iterate through this in a nice way
well you can use all kinds of indices
and stuff and if you write this in C C++
you're gonna have some like ugly code
but it'll work but you have to do a
bunch of funky stuff but in Python you
can have some really elegant pythonic
ways to run through this essentially
it's called pairwise iteration right so
I'm doing I'm iterating pairwise so I
want to do 1 5 then 5 6 then 6 4 it's
almost like a design pattern it's
something that you have to do quite a
bit so it's good to understand how
pairwise iteration works so what I did
with this sequence of up to negative 1
and sequence starting from 1 to the end
is this I take this list and what a
sequence of 1 sequence of 1 or sequence
of up to negative 1 is this that ok
so that's that list and then what
sequence of 1 to the end right 1 all the
way to the end it's it's this it's
whoops I want to start from this 2 5 6 4
now if I iterate through this list you
can see that I have 1 comma Phi 1 and 5
right here so zip will allow me to get 1
and 5 at the same time then you can see
that the next pairwise iteration is
right here 5 &amp;amp; 6 zip will allow me to
look at 5 &amp;amp; 6 at the same time it'll be
at the index 1 and both of those lists
and then at the end I want to go through
the pair 6 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 6 &amp;amp; 4 is right there so
by constructing the
using zip on it I get to iterate through
both of them at the same time okay and
then I can like check if so and then I
just label them so previous here right
if I'm if I'm zipping through this right
if this is like this if I'm zipping
through here previous is going to be one
and next is going to be five and then I
just checked previous against next as
you can see here so I say is previous
less than next and I say if previous is
not less than next then I want you to
return false and stop right there okay
and essentially that means if previous
is equal to or greater than and that
would imply that we don't have a
strictly increasing sequence so you can
see that's what I do here and then I
return false and so yeah if I did
previous right if I had if not previous
less than next what would this mean okay
so I iterate through it first time I
have this being one and I have this
being five right one from here and five
from here I'm iterating through both of
the lists at the same time using the zip
function it's one less than five yes it
is so not true gives you false so we
don't execute line six you know return
false statement then we go back in the
for loop then previous becomes five next
becomes six so this is five and next is
six whoops it's five less than six yet
is yes it is so not of that gives you
false and this whole thing your values
so false which means that you don't
execute the block the body of the if
statement and then we run through it one
more time and previous becomes six and
next becomes four and six is less than
four is false right so
false calling not on false gives you
true this whole thing evaluates to a
true and then ultimately it executes the
body of the if condition and you get
back false who okay so that's what it
was that's what my code was doing I'm
just gonna leave these comments I don't
how useful these are but I'll just leave
it
that's essentially what my code was
doing and it was able to get a list and
check if it was a strictly increasing
sequence alright so hopefully you guys
enjoyed it if you loved it or you liked
it comment or subscribe or like or share
whatever you got to do have any
questions post them up there I'm really
crazy about this I love responding to
every single person I mean I would even
like go to the point of you know just
helping you out like tell you what code
to write and you know really help you
out so I don't want you to be stuck talk
to me okay if you're ever stuck I am
here for you that's what I do I love
doing this I absolutely love coding
there's probably nothing more than
coding gotta love right now
I like jiu-jitsu but I like coding more
so yeah hopefully this makes sense if it
hurts your brain that's totally fine
especially this paralyzed iteration
thing it would kind of suck
understanding it at first you do we like
oh my god my brain hurts but once you
get it it's so nice it's so nice you
guys you're gonna you're gonna love it
you're gonna enjoy it a lot these are
the type of questions that coding
interviews are gonna ask you if you're
going to a coding bootcamp or you're
trying to get a coding job they're gonna
ask you these kind of questions so it's
good to get exposure to them in a
playful way right you're not reading it
from a book I mean look at how fun it
was we went online we competed against
some random person and we had time
constraints and then we beat them and it
was awesome and now we're just talking
about it it's much better to do it like
this rather than being forced to have it
shoved down your throat you know because
you're trying to cram it in
to get your new job or something so by
making it fun and play you'll actually
learn it rather than learn it in school
or some academic setting where you're
not having fun okay so this is helpful
for you if you're a college student if
you're thinking of changing careers or
if you are or even in high school or
younger you know this is just helpful to
you this is gonna make you a better
coder and all of that stuff okay all
right guys I love you guys so much I'll
try to put this in I'll try to put this
let me name it right now code fight
session one okay for a clever programmer
and I'll save this for you guys and I'll
put it in the links in the youtube link
or if you're watching it on my website
clever programmer calm and you guys can
watch it and enjoy all right bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
