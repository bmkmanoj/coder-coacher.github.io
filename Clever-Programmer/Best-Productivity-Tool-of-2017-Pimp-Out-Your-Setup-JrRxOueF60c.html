clever programmer calm so up until now I
have been teaching you guys about coding
command lines Python object-oriented
stuff in Python and everything has been
related to coding besides some vlogs and
life advice of course I love to give
life advice but today I wanted to share
something different with you guys what I
thought would be really important for
you guys is some productivity apps so
that's what we're gonna talk about in
today's segment we are going to hone in
on one particular productivity app and I
think that this is by far the best
productivity app of I don't know 2017
and 2016 and probably the previous years
as well however one disclaimer this is
for Mac but if you see how the app works
maybe you can get something very similar
in Windows as well so we're gonna talk
about this and see how this app works so
this app that I want to talk about today
is called Alfred few things that are
really awesome about Alfred that I think
are already kind of built into Windows
is the search functionality because
while I like spotlight of Mac's the
annoying thing is that sometimes it
comes in the way when I'm doing math or
it's a little bit slow when it comes to
finding things and it's not as
intelligent but with Alfred it finds
things very fast so for example and I
find pycharm P o py and then it just
comes up like it just comes up pretty
much instantly like as soon as I hit P
and then it starts to rank the apps
based on how you use them so the more
you use an app too quickly the quicker
it would find it so if you use QuickTime
Player all the time then next time you
put Q it wouldn't put the quack app in
front of you it would put the QuickTime
app in front of you so same thing with
my software that I use for coding is
called pycharm now while this is great a
few other things that are really
important about this is because it
doesn't look for all the things at the
same time like your folders and your
files instead it'll just by default look
for
apps that's its secret sauce that's what
makes it so fast now if you want to look
for a file or a folder just simply type
in F before and then after that type in
what you're looking for so now you can
search up contacts or you could search
up folders like documents or downloads
and it does a very fast job of finding
those as well plus it can do a ton more
but the cool feature about this is the
my favorite feature about this is
something called the clipboard now when
you copy things around the internet you
want to be able to paste them at some
point but what happens when you copy two
things can you go back and paste that
first thing that you had initially
copied not really so what do you have to
do you have to go back get that thing
and then paste it now maybe you have a
clipboard manager great however what if
you need to go back and I mean really
back in time to pull out something so
let me give you a very quick example my
website right it's called clever
programmer comm and if you see my theme
and you see that orange color at the top
that's a specific color that's the
branded color of the website so I need
to use this color when I'm making new
kind of graphics or new kind of I don't
know webpage templates or whatever I
need to keep the brand consistent there
is something called a hex code for each
color it's essentially a six digit code
that uniquely identifies any particular
color well I'm not gonna waste my time
trying to memorize that so instead I use
my clipboard to kind of save that
information for me and then later I can
retrieve it at any point let me give you
an example so I pop open my clipboard
and it has all my previous things right
in here so you can see for example it
has my links and you can see that if
it's a chrome link it has a chrome icon
right there and if it's a zoom link it
has a zoom icon right there it's
searchable you can navigate through it
but more importantly it has its own
search functionality up at the top so
now if I type in let's say I'm looking
for my color code right let me open up
my
let's see color picker app and maybe
I'll go color picker and then in here if
I want to put that code and get that
orange I'll open up my clipboard and I
will simply do actually let's type it
into the search bar hashtag and you can
see that it came up okay and if I type
in F and then it comes up again so there
it is that's my color let's go to prove
that that's the color that we were
looking for and I will simply go back to
my color picker extension on my Chrome
and if I put that color in - the hashtag
symbol at the end you can see you can
see that it gives me that same exact
orange nothing different so that's just
one example of it another example of it
another reason why I use it a lot is for
pasting things that I need to use
repeatedly so it could be an email
template but for me one thing that I
need to paste pretty like kind of like
all the time is this so let me give you
an example let's go to stack edit dot IO
this is like my handy text editor that I
use from time to time because I think
word document kinda looks ugly and I
don't like to even in Mac's word
documents I don't like to write in there
I use my own kind of things so if I go
in here and I kind of let's just delete
all this for now okay if I do this equal
equal equal thing my all my safe stuff
for my YouTube comes and so then I just
put that into my YouTube channels
description right away so if you
actually look at my description that's
how I do it instead of having to save it
somewhere particular or then have to go
look it up later I don't have to do that
my clipboard manager does that and the
shortcut to that is command shift V and
I think you can get something similar
like that on Windows but what you're
looking for what you need to search up
if you're on Windows is something called
a clipboard manager but if you are on a
Mac you should have Alfred it's faster
than spotlight it's better and again it
allows you to do math without kind of
opening it up all the way and blocking
your view so
that is another very cool reason for it
and then there are some crazy things you
can do you can create workflows you can
create snippets that automatically
expand so other few benefits I love
about this Alfred app that just are so
amazing so let's say that you go to your
video right and you're trying to respond
to a hate comment no I'm kidding you're
just trying to respond to somebody's
comment right and you just click like
let's say reply so many times you're
trying to write something and then what
happens like you try to reply or
something breaks and you refresh and
then everything is lost
so you wrote this whole like a reply to
this person but everything is lost
because of some stupid refresh or
whatever so one thing I like to do which
is practically like essentially how I
save things is I just go command a
command C command a command C like as
I'm writing things I'll just do a
command a command C and then just keep
writing okay so what's the point of that
we'll check it out it's in my clipboard
forever and that way I never lose
anything so the so this ends up being
very handy cuz trust me so many times
you'll be in a forum or you'll be
somewhere and you'll write stuff like
even emails sometimes and you'll just
lose them but this is essentially a way
of just copying things that you won't
lose like for example this person says
not to be nitpicky but English is
relatively hard to learn well that's a
good point maybe let me just copy that
and maybe let me just copy something
else and so later when I go somewhere
outside of here I have everything so
that's essentially my way of just going
crazy and just saving whatever I need
and then later on whenever I need to use
it
I'll have it forever and more
importantly searchable so I can be like
oh I can't find it but what if it was
like not to be nitpicky right so it
seriously just improves your workflow
and it's so useful for coding cuz you
have those beautiful one-liners or you
have that beautiful piece of code that's
working and that's doing everything but
you want to not change a few things
about it and add new things but you're
not sure if it's gonna break everything
that was what you had done in the past
so if you keep copying as you go and if
you even change something now you can
just always have whatever data that you
need so those are a few key things I
constantly use it for in my day-to-day
stuff that is probably the most
productive app software and I wanted to
tell you guys about it so then you can
use it and increase your speed and
especially if you're coding all the time
you have to copy like two or three
different things you don't want to lose
it you want to keep track of it so then
you can just go to the next place and
copy-paste them and have a history of
what you've copied pasted this app
Alfred goes back three months of time ok
so if I showed you how I set it up so if
you get this app you can set it up the
same way okay so if you open up Alfred
I've saved my command space thing to
open up my Alfred menu for searching and
in the features you can see it has a ton
of features right like um one password
system terminal shell the common when I
use our calculator and probably
clipboard I don't even use contacts that
much but in here what I've saved the
hotkey to instead of doing command V to
paste I just did command shift V and
that's one more modifier key but then it
opens up my entire clipboard and then I
just go through what I need and I go
ahead and paste it I set it to save
three months things and then it just
saves them so you can be doing things
for a very long time and then have this
like save things for you from the past
and it just not having this is a huge
pain in the ass I cannot imagine going
back to that time when I didn't have
this so honestly the reason why I was
inspired to make this video was because
I got to use my brother's MacBook Pro
and while it was a lot better than mine
I felt just so restricted I couldn't get
anything done at least at the speed that
I am used to getting things done and
simply by not having
clipboard and Alfred so that's it for
this video hopefully this will help you
find a good clipboard manager improve
your productivity improve your workflow
and therefore your thought process and
your coding skills and all of that stuff
alright guys that's it for this video
love you guys so much and I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
