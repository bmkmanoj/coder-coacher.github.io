about response ability and if we break
this word down right it's essentially
response ability so what does that mean
well it means your ability to respond to
a situation it means to transcend
circumstance or the things that are
happening to you that you think are
making you act a certain way the things
that are making you dependent on your
actions or rather your reactions all
right so with responsibility you have to
take things in your control it
essentially gives you a way to respond
to your situation rather than being a
byproduct of your situation now these
things are very important I don't care
if it has to do with computer
programming or you're trying to learn
about finances you're trying to become a
business consultant whatever it is this
is something that's very important for
you to understand there's so many people
that try not to take responsibility for
their actions they blame others and they
react to everything if the weather is
bad while they're gonna not go to the
gym or they are not going to be
productive they're going to let the
weather decide their mood their levels
of productivity there are levels of work
and if you think about companies that
are trying to hire you they're looking
for problem solvers they're looking for
people who can come up with solutions to
solve things they're not looking for
problems and by reacting to things and
by not being response able you're not
gonna be able to provide solutions
you're not going to be autonomous you're
not going to be self functioning and
nobody wants to work with people who
can't function on their own you know the
people who always have a question about
everything and won't go out of their way
to research it even if they knew how to
because well it's simpler to just ask
rather than to actually conduct their
own thorough research before asking a
question right so within your lives if
there's one thing you can focus on right
now to improve this is probably the most
powerful thing you can improve in your
life start taking responsibility for
things even for things that potentially
are not your fault especially if you're
working on a team if some one person
makes a mistake they love to say it
wasn't them if somebody makes a mistake
they go oh yeah that guy made a mistake
right that guy made a mistake they won't
take it as we made a mistake or if they
do something good they'll be like oh
yeah you know we did this but that was
my idea
instead of that was our idea and we did
it
so learn to take responsibility learn to
stand up for heed the people you're with
and practice those things
it's going to be very valuable and if
you won't see the power of it now in
your life maybe if it's helping you with
your relationships or if it's helping
you with how you are with your friends
or your levels of popularity or whatever
if it's not helping you a dozer you
don't care about those you will see that
disability will definitely transmute
itself into its monetary equivalents
what do I mean by that well what I mean
by that is money so if the other things
aren't that important to you then
remember that this high levels of
responsibility will make you more
employable more attractive for job
opportunities and more attractive for
promotions as well okay that's my
message for today take responsibility</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
