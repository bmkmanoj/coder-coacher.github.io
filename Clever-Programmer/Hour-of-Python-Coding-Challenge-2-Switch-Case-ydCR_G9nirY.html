from clever programmer calm welcome back
so we did the lowercase and uppercase
challenge let's jump into the Swiss
switch-case challenge and like I said to
some of you guys some of you guys have
actually already solved it it's a great
job on that perfect our mic is up and
running okay so how are we going to do
this challenge well first of all let's
understand what the actual problem is so
the problem says if I gave you something
like I don't know h-e-l-l-o GL and all
caps if I gave you any letter just give
me the opposite casing of it if I give
you a small H
give me a capital H if I give you a
small capital II give me a small e and
if I gave you a word with like small
followed by big give me big followed by
small ok I think it makes sense to
here's some examples so it says like if
I call switch case function on arg an
exclamation mark return to me
small a capital r capital g exclamation
mark okay so let's think about how we
are going to do this there is a built in
method but I challenge you to try to do
it without the built-in method okay some
of you guys have already solved using to
build built-in Python methods a good job
on that ok so how can we go about this
well let's think about it right
obviously I want you to actively try the
side if you're on my website you can
code right below this video without
having to open up your own command line
so what I would say is like hey I would
like to create a new string and I want
to just be emptying the start and then
what I'll do is also for a letter and
string so basically a loop through the
string that I'm given so if I'm given
hello I want to like loop through the H
and the E and the L and L and O and what
I want to do is as I'm looping through
if I see the H I want to check if it's
in lowercase if it is then I want to
uppercase it and throw it in the new
string if the H is in lowercase then I
want our sorry fit the H is already in
the uppercase then I want to lowercase
it and throw it in
new string makes sense so let's give
that a try for letter and string if
letter dot there's a method that
actually detects if something is lower
or upper the method is actually called
is lower that's for checking something
is lower is lower than what I want to do
is new string plus equals letter dot
upper okay else new string plus equals
letter dot lower and that should do the
trick let's hit the play button let's
see what we get and for arrgh
we got something oh yeah we have to
return the new string the one that we
created okay and it looks beautiful so
we have Arg capital a small our small G
and we're getting back small a capital R
capital G and for trinket you can see
that it's switch cased the trinket as
well perfectly and if you want to take
your time walk through this code do that
because you know this one is not so
trivial I went through it fast but it's
this one is not so simple you know walk
through this and just notice how I loop
through this and when I say a loop you
know I just want you guys to be clear
what I mean by that so I'm going to open
this up my command line here and just
for a letter in hello print letter and
you'll see that the first loop gave me H
the next loop gave me e to the next look
after that eme L and basically what I'm
doing is I want to say is lower and I
should get five crews back because
they're all lower and if I do the same
thing and I call that upper is upper it
just says false false false false
so using that boolean logic that if and
else type of logic I was able to detect
if it was lower and if it was I just
per case it and threw it back remember
what we learned in our lower case
challenge and then if it was lower case
and made I made it upper case and I
threw it back in the new string from
what we learned in the upper case
challenge well that's it guys for this
video thank you guys so much for
watching and as always I love you guys
so much and I'll see you in the next
