clever programmer calm today I wanted to
talk to you guys about college this is
for college students this could be very
very helpful to you and it could
potentially save your grade save you
from dropping out of university or save
you from some really crazy stuff so let
me share my experience with you I had a
tremendously tough last two weeks it had
to do with a lot of family stuff that
was going on and it had a tremendous
impact on my college for those of you
guys who don't know I am a full time
college student at the University of
Illinois at the University of Chicago a
UIC and essentially I was you know I
kind of missed all the last two weeks so
it had a lot of the big final projects
and you know I ended up just getting
zeros on those and it had some finals in
there and I messed some of those and I
was in a lot of trouble and I was pretty
much at the point where I was like okay
if I have to withdraw from the
University or getting in you know what's
a call that you just would draw that you
know I would kind of have to do that or
fail my courses and I was I was
beginning to accept that as a reality
but then I discovered something pretty
amazing and this is something I didn't
know and maybe a lot of you guys don't
know so I want to share this with you
even if you're not in college it's good
if you know this because you can share
it with somebody who does go to college
this is something that's called
incomplete okay
so if you are a college student and
you've had some crazy circumstances
happen to you
you can at the end of the semester sign
up or fill out a form for incomplete
some teachers will allow you to do that
and what that essentially means is they
will make a deal with you where they
give you an extended
time to cover your material I could they
give you up to a year but you could do
it in less than that you could do it the
next day there is a little bit of a
procedure but they'll help ya your
counselor will help you out but it could
potentially save you from a failing
grade affecting your FAFSA or your
financial aid affecting your next
semester and a lot of people I know you
know they once they think they're
failing like me they won't even try to
pursue and do something better they'll
sometimes give up because of the
bureaucratic system and you have to jump
through a lot of Hoops and when I have
to do that I'm just like whatever like
sometimes when I get a ticket and
there's so much stuff I have to do just
to contest it I would just rather pay it
off because I don't want to deal with
the trouble of contesting it just like
that I know a lot of college students
who don't want to go through the hoops
and so they just won't even do it but
I'm telling you if you sign up for
incomplete and a lot of teachers will
let you do that it can save their grade
if you are in some kind of trouble in
the last few weeks or whatever okay so
don't give up hope that said guys I just
want to share a short important message
with you guys thank you guys for
watching take care I love every single
one of you I'll see you in the next
video oh and also check out some recent
videos check out some tutorials make
sure to subscribe and all that I gotta
say that I have to take care of bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
