clever programmer calm let's jump on and
talk about tuples okay this is something
we did not discuss in our data types yet
and we need to cover this concept so
remember when we had lists and you can
add things to list and delete things
from lists and lists are super nice so
you know list would be something like
groceries and if you said okay let me
turn on this one thing so it does not
keep bothering you guys okay all right
there we go
now remember list was like groceries and
you might have a banana and Apple
groceries that's funny
apricot okay well with tuples you can
use them a very similar way you could
have let's let's make it something that
you can't change for example or you know
Social Security numbers I mean you could
use whatever you want but I just wanted
to use this one and it could be some
number here it could be another number
right there and then another number
right here okay so this here is actually
called a tuple why is it call that
nobody knows but it's wrapped in
parentheses and the main difference
between a list and a tuple is that you
can add things to a list and delete
things from a list but to a tuple you
can't change it you can't add things to
a tuple or take things out from a tuple
so that's really the key difference I'm
going to go down
and show you ok groceries we can do dot
append cheese cheese okay and if I print
out groceries here okay and you'll see
the results at the Pope this round a
different file you can see the results
right there it says apricot banana apple
and cheese because I just added cheese
to it and it shows that you don't have a
method like dot a pen for tuples so it
can you can do that for them okay this
was just a very basic example of this
why would you need to use a tuple well
if you were working with data that you
really never want change like maybe you
were storing people's passwords you
never want to you want to store them
like this because maybe that's something
you might now want to change right or at
least you might want to make it really
difficult for people to change
even people who are programming those
websites for you or if you're
programming a website like that yourself
it's really quickly let me show you
where you can actually find this code so
I'm going to actually push this code up
for you guys okay let's see here add
learn whoops
Python
okay so you guys can actually go to
github.com okay and look up my username
so maybe a clever programmer and one
thing you can do is go to users and
follow me okay but if you can't follow
me just look for a clever program or
underscore stuff this repository go to
this repository right here and you will
see learn Python okay there's the link
if you want to go directly github.com
slash clever program or slash clever
program or underscore stuff and then
there you'll see something called learn
Python go in there
click tuples and you can actually see
the code right there and that's where I
will let me make it a little bit bigger
so you guys can see it better this is
where I will try to add the code for you
guys from here on out and you guys can
just go ahead and check everything right
on there okay hopefully that clarifies
everything alright that's it in the next
video perhaps we're going to cover a
little bit more about mutable versus
immutable data types so I'll see you
guys there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
