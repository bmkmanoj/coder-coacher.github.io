mentioned we're gonna do fine length of
string but what's better for you guys is
if we do another problem that's pretty
similar so you you guys can test out
your own skills as well just in case you
got stuck on the even number problem
right so let's see if you can write code
that can give you an answer for the if
it's the number is odd okay so this
problem is called check for odd numbers
alright so here I have write a function
is odd that takes in a number and
returns true if it's odd otherwise false
so it's pretty much the opposite of
finding an even number solution so with
the even number problem if I gave you
two it should return false right
Iram sorry should return true but for
them oops so real loud so same thing
should happen for this one except when I
give you three it should say true
otherwise false now I'm going to go over
the solution this problem just in case
you haven't tried this on your own the
link is below to the problem and to the
solution so if you're on watching this
on YouTube go ahead and try it on your
own if you're on my website clever
programmer calm everything should be
a-okay anyways then so let's get started
I have some function it's called is odd
that's the first step to get correct and
you can check how it works you at the
bottom so again you can just go ahead
and kind of cheat you see the function
is called odd it takes in one input so
you can kind of go like okay is odd hmm
my input is some number and what can I
do if that number what does it mean for
a number to be odd right what does it
mean for a number to be an odd number
well all it means is that it's not
divisible by two right so for example if
I gave you 12 right is it divisible by
two yes it is you get back true but if
what if I give you 13 is that divisible
by two
no because 2 goes all the 12 and then
there's a one spillover or remainder so
here you have false but we just want to
flip the results
meaning this should give you false and
this should give you true for the
solution to this problem so let's go if
number divisible by 2 is not equal to 0
then I want to say give me true
otherwise give me false ok let's check
if the solution work so i'm going to
uncomment this part and let's go and run
it and it says your code is correct so
that's good
let's try giving it you know is odd
let's try giving it to 3 it says true
and what if I give it to
it should say false ok cool and now if
you want to try the bonus challenge on
your own pause the video go try it
otherwise I'm going to go over the
answer right now so here's the bonus way
of doing it return number divisible by
or mod 2 does not give you the remainder
0 ok so it's like the opposite of the
even number function so there you go
that's your one-liner right you're
cheeky one-liner ok guys that's it for
this video I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
