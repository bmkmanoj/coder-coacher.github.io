this is Kazi from clever programmer calm
first of all do you guys think that my
barbershop kind of butchered my hair if
you think my hair sucks could you please
comment that below so I could show my
barber alright anyways um what I wanted
to talk about today was your circle of
influence the 5 people around you and
there's a reason why they say that
you're the average of your five people
around you more than that justice
testicle II shown that you're not only
just like hand-waving Lee the average of
five people around you in a way that you
can't quantify there's actually a way to
quantify this to even your income is the
average of the five people around you
and that's generally true so with the
people that you're around you need to be
careful with who you spend your time
with and again I'm not saying you need
to stop hanging out with your brother or
your best friend or whatever right
that's okay you can have those people in
your life but there are certain people
who you spend time with they'll actually
motivate you to go to the next level
they'll actually want you to do things
that can help you achieve better things
and improve your goals personally you
know I spent a lot of time with my
family and it's awesome every time I
spend time with them it's great but it's
never something that makes me want to
achieve more goals because you know not
everybody wants to talk about business
or not everybody wants to talk about
achieving more goals I mean sometimes
it's okay to just relax and have fun and
there's nothing wrong with that but I've
surrounded myself at this point with
friends who are always continuously
pushing me while I'm pushing them to
achieve their goals so you know a lot of
my friends are into fitness or they want
to
learn maybe some kind of martial arts
and I'm constantly pushing them to
achieve that goal and I genuinely think
that people who care about you that's
what they should be doing instead of
being okay with you sitting on your ass
because sometimes inside it makes them
feel okay about themselves right and
even if they're not trying to
intentionally do that generally people
want you to get to their level just so
they're comfortable even if they have no
ill intention or they don't want to do
any harm to you or whatever right but
it's something that you need to
understand on how people psychology
works whatever stage of life people are
people are comfortable at that's where
they'll want you to go so somebody who
is behind you somebody who is not at the
level that you're trying to get at
they'll only bring you down to their
level you need to surround yourself with
people who are up at the top or who are
where you want to go and again they
don't have to be fake people you don't
have to kiss ass to be their friend
right that you can genuinely find people
who are your good friends and are maybe
even one step ahead of you and what
happens then is that they want to pull
you to their level because that's what's
comfortable for them and they want you
to get at the higher level of success
and that gives you a way to motivate
yourself and get to the next challenge
you know those are some dangerous words
when people try to make themselves feel
content people will say I'm happy living
the life that I'm living I'm living the
dream my life is absolutely perfect come
on sometimes you have to take a break
I'm always busy so I have to come home
and relax really you have to watch 40
hours of TV you know they've proven
statistically they've shown that
Americans watch 40 hours of TV every
week every week I mean that's an insane
amount of time watching TV I became top
1% in the world for my chess rating and
you know how I did it
I literally replaced watching a TV show
with watching a chest tutorials that
took my skill to the next level like I
would literally come home and when I
would be eating food that's generally
when I would watch TV and all I did was
just replace TV with watching a chess
tutorial and I watched something that
was fun for me for you it could be
something else maybe you like arts and
crafts watch a tutorial on Photoshop
watch a tutorial on arts and crafts I
don't know whatever it is for you and by
changing my surrounding of a video
helped me improve my level now changing
your surrounding of actual people around
you can 10x that can go 10 times that
so that can tremendously help you get to
your goals so you know sometimes you
have to think of it consciously and it
doesn't feel natural and I get that but
it's okay like you have to consciously
look around you for people who are more
successful than you or at least were a
few steps ahead of you and I know it
doesn't feel comfortable being around
them because then you feel like a
failure but that's good because you
should try to make yourself feel lower
so you can get to the next level don't
let it hurt your self esteem right like
that's your way of getting to the next
level it's like picking up a dumbbell
that you can't lift being like holy
like that's the level I want to get to
that's how you should try to treat it so
have a few people that you can follow
and replace certain things like if you
watch TV shows you can watch them that's
totally fine but if you're eating and
you realize that's a pattern every day
watch something that you enjoy it
doesn't have to be the most boring to
death tutorial watch something that's
actually maybe a little bit fun but it
has to do with what you're learning or
what you want to learn and improve at so
it could be like a fun livestream of
some person you watch doing Photoshop or
playing a video game if you want to get
better at video games and whatever it is
for you right I watch in Jitsu videos
cuz I love jiu-jitsu and I love martial
arts so I'll watch in Jitsu training
instead of or like jiu-jitsu fighters
fighting and I'll be picking up
techniques while I'm eating so I'm
enjoying but I'm also picking up new
techniques
so change the things around you in a
comfortable way where it's not like you
have to pull your teeth to make those
things work but sort of noticing each
thing and start changing them so change
your habit of the people you hang out
with right if all they do is just
nothing that's not a person you want to
spend a lot of your time with if you're
watching too many TV shows that are
nothing replace that with the tutorial
if you're listening to music all the
time I mean music doesn't achieve
anything great for you if it helps you
focus and do something productive great
but I know a lot of people just listen
to music for the hell of it and I did so
I did that and I still do that but if
you just replace your music with like
listening to audiobooks that's another
one of those life hacks that can change
your life so your friends around you be
more conscious of them still be you know
bros with your bros or if you have your
girlfriend's that you're really good
with you know for your ladies out there
if you have your friends who you're
really tight with I'm not saying to
leave any of them I'm just saying be
more conscious of adding some new people
into your circle of friends that are
ahead of you so it makes you want to get
at that level make yourself a little bit
uncomfortable change your habits of what
your watch change your habits of what
you listen to in a very simple way and
it will have a dramatic impact in your
life all right that's it I'm out and I
love you guys so much leave a comment on
my haircut guys come on seriously tell
me you help me out here okay I wanna
make sure that I you know I don't look
horrible all right I love you guys I'll
see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
