clever programmer calm and we just kind
of got a new setup so I wanted to just
point that out so we can get started and
move past it because we want to get to
the cool stuff so now today I want to
give you guys your first lecture on
object-oriented programming so if you
guys are taking this course I suggest I
highly suggest you guys take it on my
website
clever programmer calm because you guys
will have a full learning management
system there which means that it will
tell you what percent of your course is
complete and where you left off the last
time so if you forget and you're picking
it back up it'll start you from right
there think of it like Netflix but for
your career
so bench friendly and no regrets that's
a perspective I want you to take on it
alright so we here we will also have a
lot of exercises perhaps some extra
notes and a wonderful community so take
advantage of that and if you're taking
it on my youtube channel that's great
but here it actually might be great her
okay that is one of the most famous and
amazing ways to program and it's
different than functional programming
which is kind of what you guys have been
doing you know you make a function that
does something and that works and it's
great but I want to also show you
object-oriented programming and that how
maybe that can be useful for you okay
takes a little bit to wrap your mind
around it but I'm going to give you guys
a little sneak peek at it a little
example and then what I'm going to do is
show you guys where you guys can start
accessing this code from here on out
okay I'm going to make you guys some
adults and how-to show you the real
place to access this code from so up
until now I've been giving you a link
like repl IT which is rappelled on it or
perhaps some other form of link but now
I'm going to show you guys github I'm
going to introduce you to your new and
most powerful technology
and I'm going to show you how you can go
and just take a look at this code and
it'll start all being in one place okay
it's going to be like one home for all
the code so let's take one thing at a
time and just start off with
object-oriented programming so how does
it work well a quick example I can give
you is in Python you need to create
something called a class okay so we are
going to create a class and that class
could be called student okay now let's
come down and the first thing whenever
you make that classes you need to define
your initialization method so how do we
do that it's a little finicky if this is
your first time seeing it but don't
worry about it
now give me something right like what
does student start with so like let's
say that all the students in the world
no matter what course they're taking no
matter what class they're in what are
some things that are common among
students you can't say they're all
taking a computer science course that
wouldn't make sense because somebody
might be taking a biology course or
whatnot but there are a few things all
students have in common
hmm maybe they have a name right so if
they have a name we're going to put that
in our initialization or init method in
in classes in object-oriented
programming what looks like functions
are really methods okay so this method
called init will have something call it
with some a name okay this self part
here that's we just put that always
don't worry about kind of how it works
it'll be very clear to you in the future
okay but for now just remember when you
open up that method write self so all
students have a name right what is
something else that all students might
have in like let's say a college class
or a university class perhaps they have
a grade right so let's put grade here
and for that let's just
leave it at that keep it real simple now
what we can do is we're going to say
self dot name is equal to name and solve
grade is equal to great these things are
going to be really funny looking right
now because it's all new but I promise
I'll start making sense okay so how do
we deal with this data now I'm going to
create a new student okay we we can call
the student kitty and I will say that
the student it's going to be from a
student class okay
and for the self part we're not going to
put anything there alright we are going
to put her name because remember this
classes takes two methods right student
class takes uhm this but the
initialization method takes two
arguments name and grade so we gotta
give a name and a grade so maybe we can
give her the name Kitty and um we can
give her the grade I don't know she
sounds like a B student no I'm kidding
we're just gonna give her a B grade
maybe she she could be a really good
student and now we'll have another
student named Daniel and we're gonna
initialize him using the student class
as well and we're going to give him the
name Danielle and we're going to give
him the grid of I don't know eighty okay
now we've created these guys but how do
we access their data so now you'll see
that there's an easy way to access this
data where it's all concise and nicely
packed and packaged together that's
really the point of object-oriented
programming so instead of having like a
variable like kitty and kitty named and
kitty grade we have all that information
packed inside of kitty and instead of
having all separate variables for Daniel
we have all that information packed
inside of Daniel and let me give you an
example so let's say I want to get
Kitty's name I can just do Kitty dot
name
thanks to this self name part this self
part is the kitty part okay
if I want to get Daniels name I can do
Daniel dot name and now let me show you
what I mean so I'm going to say print
I'm going to wrap these in print me go
around here and I'm going to simply run
this and at the bottom hopefully you see
Kitty and you see Danielle being printed
now what if I wanted to get their grades
well I could just do print Kitty grade
and hopefully you guessed it by this
point Kitty um Daniel dot grade okay
hopefully that made sense as hopefully
you see a little bit of how it's working
and as I add more attributes I am I can
add like self dot age is equal to age
and here I can pass that in as a
possible parameter age and so what this
means is that you have to actually pass
an age otherwise you can actually
initialize those um those guys like
Kitty and Daniel you can initialize
those objects so I know that's why it's
given me a little error so I got a pass
in an age let's say some age okay let's
say thirty years old and we can say for
Daniel fifteen years old and I can even
print out their ages the same way Kitty
age print Daniel age and when I run it
you can see that 85 and 80 which are the
grades right and then thirty is the kid
eh and then 15 is the Daniel age okay so
that is just a little sneak peek of how
object-oriented programming works I'll
let us show you how you can use it to
actually do some really powerful stuff
like you know the turtle module I was
showing you earlier we're going to build
a GUI where we can play around with the
turtle module that we were using earlier
okay so I'll show you guys some powerful
things but for now I'm going to show you
where you guys can access this code so
I'm going to do some magic here and this
is going to basically put the code for
you guys online right from my computer
because I don't worry about this part so
much I will
have a course where I explain to you
guys how you guys can do this too so I'm
going to say pushing new contents of
course clever programmer students and
I'm going to say good push and then I'm
going to go on github.com and here's
where you guys can actually access this
you can go on github.com look for a
repository called clever programmer
underscore stuff and in there
I have put together an object-oriented
programming folder which is opie and
then the lesson one that we were
actually working on you can click there
and you can actually look at all of that
code okay how cool is that
so it's going to be now the home of all
of our code at clever programmer okay
you guys will be able to go and access
it from right there I want you to do me
a favor once you come up here hit that
little nice star okay because I barely
ever get stars on my github repositories
and by having this I can make people
think that I'm a cool programmer okay
but in fact I'm I'm just hacking and
tricking the system so that's it guys
for this first video hope you guys
enjoyed it hope you guys are excited for
more I love you guys I appreciate you
and I cannot wait to see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
