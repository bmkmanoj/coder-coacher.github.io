problem alright so I just clicked this
part that says check for even number
divisibility again if you're on YouTube
you're going to have the problem notes
below and the solution notes below as
well so no need to worry but this is on
on clever programmer comm so let's keep
going you can write a function or sorry
the problem says write a function is
even that takes in a number and returns
true if it's even otherwise it returns
false okay so before you watch the
solution take a stab at it and try to do
this problem okay
and after you're done trying and you're
pulling out your hair you're like oh I
can't do it come to wash the solution
okay I've given you some hints here as
well so think about what does it mean
for a number to be divisible by another
number right so what does it mean let's
let's test it out a little bit so if I
have 10 and I want to check if it's
divisible by two well what does it mean
to be divisible it means remainder is
what right if I do ten divided by two
what's my remainder there right so my
remainder here will be none because two
goes perfectly into ten and there's a
way to check for remainders okay so for
example let's let's check if 3 goes into
12 right so if my remainder is zero then
that means 12 is divisible by 3 right
I can also try it like this 12 divisible
by 3 and see if this gives me true or
false if it gives me true well then 12
is divisible by 3 if it gives me false
then 12 isn't divisible by 3 okay so
that's your hint I've given you your
example here as well and written format
and then I have a bonus challenge for
you which says if I give you a number
and you check that it's you know if it's
even
and your function checks is even so that
for that function the challenge that I
gave you is see if you can write it in
one line of code okay but don't try that
first try to do it with some if-else
statement so it's going to get you to do
some FL cygnus okay now let's go over
the solution so the first thing i want
to do is write what's my function name
is even okay it says right there is even
another thing that you can do to trick
the system is if you look at my test
notes below well it kind of tells you
what the function is called and how its
expecting to use the function it's this
is how the function is going to be used
right you're going to say is even and
pass in a number and either it will give
you a true or it'll give you a false so
I have test cases here written for you
if your function runs correctly all
these test cases are going to give you a
big thumbs up and the screen is going to
print out your code is correct
all right so let's say that I give this
you know some number and basically what
do I do if number is divisible by two
right that's how you check if it's
divisible by two if you just do this
that will tell it well that'll give you
the remainder so this will evaluate to
zero okay but you want something to
evaluate either true or false okay so
number mod two should give you zero this
means that number should be divisible by
two that's what it means to be even
right two should be able to go inside of
that number return true else return
false right if two does not go inside of
that number perfectly then I should get
back false so like if I tested I don't
know thirteen divisible by two check if
it's divisible it says false well I can
even check out what's left over two goes
all the way into twelve and then one
spills over and you get a remainder of
one hence thirteen is an odd Nam
not an even number just in case you
don't know what I'd and even numbers are
zero two four six eight ten are all
evens and then one three five seven up
to infinity are all odds you can have
negative and positive odds or negative
and positive evens all right I also have
the notes on my website for you guys to
help you so remember how to it tells you
how to write a function it tells you
where to put the colons it tells you to
return things and it gives you an
example of the add to function as well
so let's test it out I'm going to
comment out line 43 and I'm going to run
this and if it prints out your code is
correct then our code is correct
otherwise it's wrong okay good it says
your code is correct now I'm going to go
over the bonus challenge okay
so define bonus challenge kind of or
actually I can just do it right here
because you guys can pause the video and
stuff right so you guys can go back in
time as well return and what do I want
to do number divisible by two is equal
to zero and that's it you don't have to
do if you don't have to do else it does
it all in one go well what happens here
if the number is divisible by zero if
the number is divisible by two will give
you true if it's divisible if it's not
divisible by two gives your false so you
don't need to check if this then true
otherwise false it kind of does that for
you so that's your one-liner okay
hopefully this video was helpful for you
and you learn something in the next
video we're going to find out how to
find the length of a string so that's a
problem that is going to be really cool
and you will be able to try it out check
out the show notes below so you can
practice this and also try to solve this
problem the check for even numbers
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
