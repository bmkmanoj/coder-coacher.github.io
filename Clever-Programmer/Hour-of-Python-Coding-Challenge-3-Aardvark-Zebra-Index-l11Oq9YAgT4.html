from clever programmer comm we did the
challenge of switch case the switch case
challenge challenge last time and before
that we did the lower case in the upper
case so now let's move on to the next
challenge this one has a little bit of a
crazy name it's called aardvark zebra
index challenge so let's jump right into
it and check it out what's going on and
one fun fact while I was recording this
video got deleted so we're doing it
again but this gives us a chance to do
it a little bit better alright so let's
jump right into it
so basically what they're saying is like
hey look strings or just like lists in
Python so if I gave you a list of like
apple banana you could index I'd buy
that list by zero and get back Apple
just like a string you can do the same
thing if I gave you a string hello and
if you index it by 0 you get the zeroth
character which is H if you index it by
1 you get e if your index it by 2 you
get L so on and so forth alright so
using that knowledge what we're going to
do is we're going to code up the
solution this problem now some of you
saw the solution was already there
because of the previous video but not to
worry I just removed it what I want you
to do is actively try to do this
challenge so if you're on my website and
you're going through this blog post it's
going to end clever programmer calm and
it's also in the link description below
you could do this challenge right below
the video and you don't even have to
open up Python on your computer but if
you are doing it on your computer that's
totally fine let's jump through this
thing and let's see how we get this done
so the problem basically says if you're
given a string and if it starts with a
the letter A then it should say aardvark
and if I give you anything that doesn't
start with an A you should throw me back
zebra so if I gave you argh you should
tell me
hey aardvark and if I gave you back
something that said something like
shrink it you should say zebra alright
so we have this function and it's called
aardvark how will
we make that work so we'll use a simple
if statement give it a try actively
engaged and learning this process guys
so try this coding challenge right below
this video if you're on my website if
string of zero right the first character
of the string and in Python zero means
first okay in human language basically
if string of zero is an a then what I
want you to do is return aardvark
alright otherwise I want you to return
zebra okay now when I run it you can see
that given argh right here it gave us
back aardvark which matches our result
on line five and give and shrink it it
gave us back zebra which matches our
results from line six in line seven
right line six is showing you what if
you wrote aardvark trinket like this it
should give you back zebra so our
results are matching the test cases that
they gave us that's it for this
challenge it was really simple thank you
guys for watching as always I love you
guys so much and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
