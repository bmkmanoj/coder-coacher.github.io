clever programmer common in this video
we're gonna talk about when should you
move on to learn your second programming
language so without any of that other
 let's jump right into it
so this question is actually inspired by
the prime on my youtube channel and
essentially he wants to know how does
one test himself or herself if he or she
has become an expert in Python so
meaning when do I move on to another
language and when do I know I've become
an expert in Python here's how I would
answer that question this question it
kind of frustrates me and I'm gonna tell
you why it's almost like saying hey once
I learn English
and I become an expert in English what
language should I learn next well if you
came to America and you learned English
to get here maybe your next step is to
look for a job using English maybe it
wouldn't make sense for you to just
randomly learn different languages right
or if you went to China and learnt
Chinese it doesn't really make sense for
you to learn more languages like after
you got done learning Chinese like you
use your put your Chinese to use so in
this case once you learn Python put your
Python to use build projects build apps
that should be your next goal building
real things using Python the only time
you learn newer languages is when you
need to for example if you can't do like
for example you can't do front-end web
development with Python so that's the
time you do need to learn about
JavaScript but I would say first learn
about Python and then when you need to
go and learn about JavaScript and if
you're putting together a website don't
learn HTML till you start putting
together the website then yes go ahead
and learn HTML almost like if you were
conducting business in another country
it would make a lot of sense for you to
then start learning that language at
that time because that's gonna be the
most valuable for you that's gonna be
the biggest return on your investment
how does one know that they became an
expert in Python you don't it's like you
spend your whole life doing it you can
call yourself an expert it's just like
how do you become an expert in English I
mean there's no like one set time it
just takes you a lot of time you build
projects with it you
do things with English you've been
expert in English I consider myself
maybe an expert in English I have 140
different videos but other people might
think otherwise maybe people think you
need a PhD to become an expert in
English right so maybe people think you
need to be the best-selling author to be
an expert in English there's no real
definition here to become an expert
build things with it become an authority
like have a portfolio that shows what
you've built with Python you're an
expert you don't need to spend 50 years
if you have multiple apps multiple
things that you've built with Python
you're an expert okay so yeah I get this
question a lot
when should I learn my second
programming language when do I become an
expert like dude you're you learn Python
to do stuff with it right the point is
not to just learn Python and then just
like run away and run like that's not
the point of programming the point of
programming is not to learn a specific
language it's sexually understand the
programming concepts behind it that's
what you should be investing your time
in
hopefully I nailed this question for you
guys what I want to do since we started
this ask Kazi segment I know on YouTube
Q and Q won by a landslide but on the
Twitter platform and on snapchat asked
cause II dominated another reason why I
didn't choose to go with Q and Q I'm
sorry I kind of had to make like a
little call here at the end of the day I
did take your suggestions into account I
had trouble sleeping trust me I was like
thinking about what you guys had said
but ask Ozzie is like askgaryvee and
then there's some other ask shows too
and it's also great for hash tagging how
are you gonna do Q and Q with an
ampersand also what the heck does Q and
Q have in mean questions and Kazi that
doesn't make sense so I'm sorry I
decided to go to ask cause ear out and
usually what I'm gonna do is the top
voted comment I'm gonna generally try to
answer that in the following videos so
if you have a question like a burning
question this is your time to ask it I
will try to go through multiple
questions and if the comments are
top-voted I'm gonna answer them but if
there's
goofy and completely dumb and top-voted
I don't know I might still answer them
but you know I'll just kind of have to
like check and see how they are okay
guys that's it I love your faces off
thank you guys for watching so much this
was episode 3 of ask Ozzie and I can't
wait to see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
