clever programmer calm where you learn
to code smarter now we are probably
going to start the infamous series on
series series series yeah on learn
JavaScript on code Academy okay this is
probably going to be the best series on
learning JavaScript special in kill
Academy so you know just enjoy and
you'll also learn so let's let's jump
right into it
what is JavaScript about and what does
it want us to do so a very quick
overview javascript lets you do all the
cool stuff on the web web what's
happening to my English when you click
on things it like open them up all the
graphical interfaces all the beautiful
user interface almost all of it is done
by JavaScript so at the end of the day
JavaScript is what makes the internet
run especially now it is that's the
that's the technology that we use for
all the front end especially so let's go
ahead and click on introduction to
JavaScript and we'll get started
if you check all of these guys all of
this stuff is locked it wants you to
upgrade it and but other things are
there so for example function scope rays
and loops and you know you guys know my
style what I do is if for those of you
who are new basically what I do is if
I'm trying to explain something I'll
open up another terminal or I'll go on
this website called repl IT repple dot
it where I'll show you the code as we're
coding it okay so why don't we just get
started so let's click introduction to
JavaScript let's go alright welcome to
learn JavaScript we got our first
achievement that's always good
javascript is the most widely used
programming language on the web and is
used on most websites including this one
so that's kind of
what I was saying start by the end of
this course you'll have a strong
foundation in JavaScript you'll be able
to write full-fledged programs make each
T ml and CSS dynamic and write
impressive web applications and if you
follow this course with me you will also
not be bored and probably have a lot of
fun alright I can't stand boring
programming guys so I'm trying to cure
that myself
this unit has two parts learn the
building blocks of JavaScript do some
fun stuff with those parts cool hit next
to begin let's get started so here we
see that we have three variables one is
called um okay one is called my string
and we set that to undefined my number
is also we set it to undefined and
another variable my boolean we set it to
undefined VAR is nothing in itself
that's basically you just saying like
hey that's gonna be my variable okay so
again let me have my good buddy
rippled IT open so when we go over this
stuff you know I can show you guys that
everything that we're talking about
directly so for example I can say var X
is equal to 5 and then I can say
console.log X this is just saying
console to log X is just saying hey show
me X on the right hand side of the
screen so as you can see it showed you 5
and our variable X we use that there and
we use it here one of my favorite
variables for those of you guys who
might be new here is banana so we're
going to use banana I hate looking at X
and most programming you'll almost never
be writing things like X and stuff other
programmers are going to be like what's
wrong with this guy he's writing all
this cryptic stuff or XI right so let's
focus on calling them something other
than X and put
our life into them and varnish is
necessary to announce a variable that's
really what's happening here cool
now do not edit the code under this line
what are they doing here they're simply
saying your name is whatever this was
here your lucky number okay what does
this do this plus sign this plus
business that they have going on let's
check it out
all right let's check it out we're going
to take their oh my number we're going
to put it here all right console.log
okay so we're not going to make it
undefined that's kind of nonsense we're
gonna make it like four and if I hit run
here you can see how it works
essentially what we're doing is we're
combining this number four with this
little thing in the quotes okay so in
programming what the thing that in
quotes we call it a string and we're
just basically making the string bigger
so if we just wrote it like this that
would give you an error which is what
you can see on the left side it says hey
there's a some kind of error going on
you can just do some quotation followed
by some other thing like a variable if
you want to combine the two you use a
plus sign to combine the two okay the
things in quote you're basically saying
give me exactly that thing which is why
on the right hand side you see lucky
number which is above me probably um or
sorry the exact string lucky number with
a colon my number is the thing that
comes from our variable up at the top at
line one that we defined so lucky number
exactly that plus our variable that we
created which is four in this case add
it together and boom we get lucky number
is equal to four another thing that I
want to tell you guys about you know
when you are following my program is
I'll have all of these notes available
for you so as a matter of fact I'm going
to hit save on this it has created a
link already and I will share this link
with you guys so it's going to be called
clever programmer JavaScript code
Academy one alright so you guys can then
enjoy and use this as well to learn all
right
those notes are going to be in the
description and the link below ok so
they're just saying blah blah blah blah
blah I already broke all of this down
for you except for a boolean so we're
going to talk about that in one second
but as you can see here string or any
groupings of texts and things within the
quotes so here when they say name they
literally want exactly name they don't
want the variable name that might be
four or five they are trying to say it
give me exactly the word name with a
colon and space after it so whenever you
want something to be very exact you use
string because that's the that's the
thing that you want you don't want
anything else
number okay any number including numbers
with decimals without quotes is a number
so for example just for your practice
right what is that
versus what is that okay on line five
this is um this thing here okay is a
quote this thing here is a number okay
that's the difference there so I'll put
this here for you guys
string
and then this guy at the bottom this is
the number okay without the quotes so
what does that mean well what's the
benefit of this if you try doing four
minus four you're gonna get back
something that probably doesn't make
sense
or I might be surprised in JavaScript so
yet JavaScript I am surprised
it's able to subtract subtract subtract
subtract strings but you can't do that
in most of their languages you would
have to do four minus four like that
okay usually you can't compare and
subtract strings but javascript is being
really smart and it's going hey don't
worry I know what you mean
I'll do I'll do the right thing for you
okay twenty three point four two is also
a number all right now let's move on to
boolean boolean is something like true
or false
all right so if you say true or false
that's your boolean the reason why these
are going to be important is you can say
hey if Johnny clean the dishes is true
then display you can play xbox 360 now
Johnny or if Johnny clean the dishes is
equal to false then maybe you can
console that log or printout or whatever
like no you can't play xbox 360 or
whatever all right so true and false is
the heart of programming this is the
zero and one or whatever way you hear of
it I like the true or false way more
than just as you're one way so that's
really essentially what that is okay and
those are your boolean values anything
that a value is to true or false okay
it's for less than four is that true or
false what do you think it's false
okay four is not less than four so this
is your boolean kind of logic did
I don't know did your broker or your
color or your employee work more than 40
hours if so paid them overtime
okay so again you're gonna have maybe
you know let's define a variable called
overtime and we can set that to 40 hours
and we can say yeah so let's see we can
have a variable Bob hours and we can say
that he worked 41 hours and then we can
go down here and check hey did but our
Bob's working hours greater than the
overtime hours let's see what it says
and you can see on the right-hand side
it's that's true so if this is true then
maybe we pay Bob overtime okay all right
so the stuff that I've shown you guys is
you know I'm kind of jumping the gun and
showing you guys the stuff that's going
to happen next so a lot of the stuff
that they're going to show next I'm
already showing you guys so if I ever go
on tangent it's it's a helpful tangent
it's well sometimes it might not be but
most of the times it will be all right
now let's see what they're talking about
here are their instructions so in the
code editor there are three variables we
will learn about variables in the next
lesson again I already covered this
right so you guys kind of know what a
variable is replace each variables value
with each corresponding type okay so for
my string they want us to put something
that's a string so let's say Bob like
that okay for my number let's actually
put in a number so we'll say 7 and for
my boolean we'll put in a boolean and
remember what boolean's are there's
something that are either true or false
in this case we'll just put in false
okay on line 1 there's a variable name
my string so replace undefined with a
string your name so sure we can
you know put in my name or something all
right and we don't really need the hints
let's just run it let's see what happens
see what it says it's running it it's
running it mmm
it's running it for a little bit longer
than expected I'm worried if I'm stuck
in the infamous codecademy loop Oh looks
like I'm not so did I win did I pass
everything okay so as you can see the
first thing is done the second thing is
done the third thing is done fourth
thing is done so I think we're good
and on the right-hand side you can see
that it says name is Rafa Kazi lucky
number seven right this is what line
eight is doing it's combining the word
lucky number with my number and then on
line nine you can also see that it's
combining good joke with this so it was
a joke good false was the lucky what's
the lucky number seven my name is Rafa
cozy cool and we can't do much
programming with our knowledge of types
right now so let's build something cool
let's learn how to ask JavaScript to
talk to us
woo how will JavaScript talk to us to do
this we need to do two things a way to
ask JavaScript to talk and to something
for JavaScript to say okay we can ask
JavaScript to print words to the consult
with this line of code you guys are
already pros at this and about has shown
you this but I'm just gonna put that
right here and at the bottom you're
gonna see that it says your message here
so that's essentially what that does
let's go back in human speak this is
saying hey console please print log this
thing inside the parentheses bye thanks
they're funny
I like their jokes cheeky
by writing this line we have also solved
a second thing we need something for
JavaScript is say we can put a string
number boolean or any other data type
inside the parenthesis of a console dot
log again you saw that we were putting
less than signs we were putting true and
false putting pretty much anything
between the console dot log function
that prints out your thing used consoles
a lot to log a string of your favorite
pizza topping okay so we can say console
dot log and for our favorite pizza
topping I don't know let's say jalapeno
I really like jalapenos
so I put that we had to put the
semicolon that's something you would as
well get used to Jah javascript is
really smart even if you don't put the
semicolon it'll know what you're talking
about but there are certain cases where
you're going to run into really weird
errors later on in your life that might
cost you millions of dollars so there
are all kinds of horrific stories about
not putting semicolons in JavaScript so
don't let JavaScript smartness fool you
into not putting semicolons go ahead and
do that anyways all right let's run this
bad boy and let's see what we get we get
back jalapeno fun fact we can log
multiple things at once by separating
them with commas so we can say how
opinions and/or jalapeno and we could
say pineapple so by doing this you can
have it print out multiple things as you
can see here all right cool
yes awesome I don't know all right let's
hit next and the last thing we're going
to leave this off at is do some math and
we're going to leave it off there all
right so it's telling you that you can
do some basic math okay you can do
things like adding subtracting
multiplying dividing okay you want to be
that cool
in the class that extremely cool kid
right that does math not on his
calculator but on his laptop sure that
won't make you cool but um in the world
of people who program that'll definitely
give you some bonus points so
essentially I can say five minus three
and it'll show you on the right hand
side I can say five times 25 also the
log I don't know 25 divided by five
let's see what we get five point divided
by five point two we get some weird big
number here right so all your calculator
stuff JavaScript can handle it for you
let's see what it says these all work my
guests uh-huh okay so constant log at
3.5 to your age so let's do that so I'm
going to say 3.5 plus my age is 22 and
that looks good inside another console
log take the current year and subtract
so I'm going to say consult log and I'm
going to take the current year so 2016 -
1969 that should give me the difference
between 2016 and 1969 probably a lot of
years so it's been Oh
that'll give you the number of years
it's been since the moon has light oh
this is we landed on the moon so we
landed on the moon in 1969 they want us
to create another console to log that
does 65 by 240 so okay console dot log
divide 65 by 240 so just like that
another console dot log then multiply
the full answer from sir
three by 100 so I guess what I can do is
I can do 65 divided by 40 times 100 okay
and I can put this guy in parenthesis
just to say do this operation first and
then multiply that result by 100
that's a percent of the Sun that is made
up of helium assuming we could stand on
the Sun we'd all sound like Chipmunks oh
that's pretty cool so 27 percent of the
Sun is made up of helium fun facts okay
guys so you saw JavaScript lets us do
some for now we went through some really
basic things but you can see that we're
going to be building up to some really
great and epic things right we are even
going to be able to build our own games
with JavaScript if code Kadim e doesn't
cover it and they want to make money off
of you guys but having all these pro
versions then after the code cat
intercourse is done I will make up some
projects with JavaScript that you guys
can follow along and do without having
to pay a single cent all right guys I
love you guys I appreciate you guys if
this is your first time please subscribe
to the channel if it's not your first
time and you haven't subscribed
subscribe like the video you'll see many
more coming like this shortly take care
guys I'll see you in the next video
