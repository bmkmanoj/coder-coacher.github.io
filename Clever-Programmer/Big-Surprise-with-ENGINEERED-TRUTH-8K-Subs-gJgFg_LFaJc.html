clever programmer calm first of all I
just wanted to say thank you so much for
freaking eight thousand subscribers this
is unbelievable I don't even know how
fast for going and the craziest crap
happened I just cannot believe that this
has happened and I just wanted to share
this with you guys the second I found it
so i was watching engineer truth which
is a awesome channel you guys should
definitely watch it too he's sitting
just over 150,000 subscribers and he
said how much money does a youtuber with
hundred fifty thousand subscribers make
so I was like sure let's go and find out
because as you guys know I started my
youtube channel pretty recently about a
few months ago and I wanted to see what
the heck is going on and how much money
does a youtuber make with over 150,000
subscribers those cool videos watching
it and then this happened yes you value
titles you look at popular videos it's
how did you do so how to code and how to
prepare for Dominic okay so I saw this
and I called over my friend Tenzin and I
was like dude check this out this is
crazy because where he says how to teach
yourself code that's exactly the title
of my video so we were both looking at
this and we thought that was a really
crazy coincidence because his video at
the top one it says how to teach
yourself code and the second one is how
to prepare for a job interview so seeing
the first one I was like that's crazy
because one of my videos has the same
title and then I kept watching and then
this happened those two titles have very
strong SEO value and if you type in
those keywords that how those titles in
to youtube I they believe my videos are
number one at this time though of course
it could always change okay see you my
morning okay I get it that you gotta
have these SEO friendly titles but how
did you get your your video to be number
one oh my god do you guys see that do
you guys see that so I saw this and a
totally freaking blew my mind I was like
what I mean that is a pretty big title
how to teach yourself code but more
more than that well it's so crazy is
that I pop up third so I was I mean I
don't even know what to say it was
blowing my mind so here's what I want
you guys to do I left him a comment at
the top and I want you to go and I just
want you to smash that like button
that's what I want you to do whoo it's
kind of really funny but we're making it
guys we're about to catch up to engineer
truth but let's see what happens maybe
we'll do some kind of partnership video
like interview video or something he
truly has an awesome channel go and
check it out I just wanted to thank you
guys for a thousand subscribers and
we're only going up and we have a strong
community but more than that I wanted to
share this with you guys because this
was just so exciting so crazy that it
just kind of came out of nowhere and I
was just totally randomly watching this
video and came across this so thank you
guys so much i love you guys take care
and as always i'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
