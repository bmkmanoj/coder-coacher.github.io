clever programmer calm and I got a great
question I think by Marcos ailment I
really hope I didn't which earlier name
but he asked me one of my previous
videos I can't seem to find a specific
comment but the question goes how do I
stop procrastination and that's what
this video is going to answer so let's
jump right into it
procrastination is a big problem for
everybody including me including you and
including the whole world out there
procrastination is something that just
exists now there are many techniques and
things that you can watch on TED talks
and wherever else that talk about some
little hack that you can do to avoid
procrastination but honestly I think
it's something that exists and you can't
make it go away here's one ultimate hack
that I use to avoid procrastination and
I can tell you this works here's a hack
fall in love with what you do okay
absolutely become passionate about what
you're doing if you develop if you have
fun when you're coding and you're
enjoying everything that you're doing in
the app that you're building which is
why I focus so much on 80% fun and 20%
focus on learning new skills and what I
mean by 80% fun is take the code take
just knowledge that you've learned about
coding and have 80% fun with it build
your own things with it break things
with it go like nothing is gonna happen
go crazy right and that's a fun part
that I'm talking about and another 20%
is just like constantly learning new
skills the fun part is gonna help you
cement that knowledge and build that
passion when you build that passion
there's no such thing as procrastination
you know why here's the secret that is
your procrastination the coating that is
your ultimate procrastination when you
actually want to slack off that's what
you do like the other day I was with my
friend I was like hey man we should go
play snooker that'd be really cool but
then you know what we did we actually
ended up procrastinating the snooker
playing because we were gonna actually
enjoy creating YouTube videos more
helping develop the business more clever
programmer and we were gonna code that's
now my procrastination like that's what
I do during procrastination instead of
scrolling through Facebook and blah blah
that's how much passion and love I've
developed for it over time that's what I
want to do when that's like my guilty
pleasure at this point right
like if you're about to make out with
another girl or another guy what do you
have you ever had the problem for crass
nation no you haven't you know why
because there's something you want to do
so damn bad right you can't
procrastinate that just like that if you
develop a passion about something you
can't procrastinate that that's how I'm
gonna answer this question and leave it
that again thank you guys for watching
this I love your faces off this is a
Scaasi episode - thank you guys so much
for watching I love you and I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
