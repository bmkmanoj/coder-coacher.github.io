this video i want to show you how you
can actually create a new folder and the
reason why I want to keep these videos
like short little nuggets is because I
want you to try these things out as you
go please do not just sit and watch this
and learn this whether you're doing it
for school or whether you're doing it
for your personal enjoyment or for your
job whatever it is actively be a part of
this because it'll all seem so easy so
obvious you'll be like died all makes
sense but then you'll sit there and your
face will be blank and your mind will
just be going numb so I don't want that
to happen to you please follow along all
right pause this video right now follow
along or have my video on one screen or
like half of the screen on the other
half actually have your command line
open and follow this so in this video I
promise you I'm going to show you a
creole folder so let's do that so I have
this playground folder okay what if I
deleted it so I'm just going to go ahead
and delete it it's gone and i'm going to
simply create a folder so let me hit CD
because CD takes me back home or you can
do CD squiggly and i will hit LS and i
will go to CD documents and then I'll
see PWD and I am right here right that's
what's around me if I hit a less you see
all those things around me ok I want to
create a new folder let's call this
folder playground how do I do it mkay
dir essentially it stands for make
directory ok so MK der make directory
and I think that should work in git bash
if you're on Windows and MK dirt
followed by the folder that you want so
what do you want to name it so we're
going to name it playground so I'm going
to hit enter and i will hit and you can
see it's right there how cool is that ok
i'm going to give you a little sneak
peek of a bit again i'm going to delete
it and i'm going to do MK der or i can
just hit up on my keyboard remember you
can recall you
or last commands by just hitting up and
so I'm going to hit up and pay attention
to that side at the top pay attention to
that ok you're going to see playground
pop-up right there all right three two
one boom took a little bit longer than
three two one but you get the points
right there so look at that I didn't
even actually have to do anything it was
like magic I just got to do it right
from the keyboard right from the command
line ok so these are just some shortcuts
you'll see that it'll keep on adding
more and more value to your programming
skills as you learn more of the command
line ok so that's it for this video
practice this right now and i'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
