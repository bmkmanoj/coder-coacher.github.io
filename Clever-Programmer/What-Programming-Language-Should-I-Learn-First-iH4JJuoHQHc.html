clever programmer comm and today I would
like to answer the question of what
programming language should I learn
first now there are a ton of programming
languages for you to choose from you
have Python you have C you get C++ you
have sequel you have c-sharp you have
Java swift and the list goes on forever
however my point is not to sit you in
overwhelm you with the number of
languages that exist but it's important
for you to understand first of all why
the languages might exist and second of
all which language should you start off
with first right which is actually the
most important question for you
especially if you're watching this video
and you want to know which language to
pick okay so if today a human being
walked up to me who did not know the
concept of language right let's say you
walked up to me and he knew no languages
whatsoever what language would I like to
get him started off with and I'd be like
hmm definitely not Japanese right that's
one language I probably wouldn't want to
start them off with simply because it's
a little complicated a little bit more
complicated than say Spanish or English
which are you know on the language
difficulty spectrum they're on they're
on level one but at the same time if you
think about this human language like
English and Spanish you can't say that
just because they're simpler doesn't
mean that they're very powerful they're
also spoken pretty worldwide and a lot
of people understand them so even even
though they're simple they're still
pretty powerful now let's transition
that over to computer programming what
language should I start off with well to
answer that question I would say start
off with the simplest language right
definitely do not get started off with a
really complicated language because
here's the fact okay
if you do not know the concept of
language at all right and and I'm not
saying you're a baby where you're near a
plasticity is so high they can just pick
up anything let's say you're an adult
and you just don't know the concept of
languages you want to definitely start
off with the easiest language because
once you learn the concept of language
as a human being it's a way to express
your emotions and ideas to other people
once you learn that at it's very core
you can transfer over to another
language like say Japanese and go how do
you say banana in Japanese how do you
say this in Japanese at least you can
look it up you have the tools to
actually look that up and learn
something in reference to another thing
so in terms of computer programming if
you know the simplest language then when
you go over to another complicated
language you can just go how do I do
this thing that I do in this other
language that I know in this language
that I'm trying to learn okay so your
research process becomes a lot simpler
and the ideas are all the same you guys
like for example the emotions that
American people or Italian people or
Spanish people express people in Japan
or China express the same emotions right
the tool that they use the language
syntax the specificity of each language
might defer but at the edits very core
we're still trying to express emotions
of sadness happiness cherish hopefulness
whatever right computer programming
languages you are trying to express
ideas to a computer so it can translate
it for you right it's a really smart
friend that is right there who's
listening to you you just need to speak
to him okay now I want to talk about
what languages maybe you should not
start off with I would recommend that
you not start off with C or C++ or C
sharp pretty much any if to see
languages and the reason is because
there's some tactical difficulty level
is much much higher so you have to worry
about each little tiny detail or what
you're saying to a computer will make no
sense whatsoever
so not only are
you bogged down by the conceptual
difficulty when you're first learning
computer programming
you also bogged down by the sting
tactical difficulty you know which is
literally how you're typing something it
needs a curly brace it needs this it
needs that like embellishments right um
almost like if you're writing English in
your first learning and if you don't
write comma or period or something like
you're just not going to get understood
at all by another person that would be
very frustrating to you if English was
your first language because you'd be
like this is so like I don't know
whether my problem lies in the fact that
I'm speaking my idea is correct the way
I'm expressing it or am I having some
kind of grammatical error so start with
something that's can just focus on the
conceptual stuff first okay so start
with something that has a syntactical
difficulty that's lower understand the
concepts right
in computer programming you have a
concept of looping over things so if
it's one task that you want to do over
and over again that's called the loop
well if you learn what a loop is in one
language you can very easily go to
another language and apply the same loop
if you learn what an if condition is if
this then that right if Johnny worked
over 40 hours Johnny gets paid overtime
that idea if you can learn to express it
in one language you can very easily
express it in another so my
recommendation to you guys there are a
lot of languages to learn but my
recommendation to you guys would be to
start off of the language Python okay
and Python there's a reason why it's the
top growing one of the top growing
languages in the world and if you look
at most of the top universities they're
actually making that the introduction
language and the reason why they're
doing that is because of how elegant and
simple it is now don't get its
simplicity confuse with maybe that it
can't do more remember Google Dropbox
Pinterest reddit Instagram and I can go
on but those were all built off of
Python okay even BitTorrent so all of
these things were actually built off of
Python YouTube was built off of Python a
surrogate grin I think that's who
actually said it the the person who
founded Google pretty much he said
Python where we can see where we must
which means we want to use the C
programming language where we have to
and pro Python programming language
where we can okay now in terms of the
languages and where they work so like
let's say you learn the language Python
right and you start off with that
language now you can always branch out
and go to other languages once you
understand the conceptual difficulty and
the conceptual stuff you can translate
that over to any other language now
python is a powerful language that
allows you to do pretty much anything
that you want it's also important
understand some of the differences
between why you should pick another
language okay
now let's talk about maybe once you're
at a level of certain proficiency and
you want to transition over another
language why would you want to choose
between different languages and work
with one rather than the other in
reality you're working with a lot of
languages at the same time okay
now the reason why you want to pick one
language or another is because of its
benefits for example if you want to do a
lot of stuff related to web development
like front-end
or nice graphics show and you click on
something and things respond really fast
that is called JavaScript that's the
beauty and magic of JavaScript where you
click on things and then drag down and
drop down menus and all this really
fancy stuff that you see on the web
that's done by JavaScript so for that
you want to learn JavaScript should you
start off with JavaScript maybe I would
still say you start off with Python then
transition over to JavaScript just to
give you an example I worked on a
project that was 30 hours long it's
called agile directions
I might just even link it below so you
guys actually can click it and check it
out I did not know a single letter of
JavaScript but since I knew Python so
well I just
went on I would go online and just look
up how to do things that I would do in
Python how to do them in JavaScript and
I was able to bust out that entire giant
project in two days okay so yeah now web
languages you have JavaScript for data
science and a lot of data analytical
stuff and scientific stuff and even
things like building responsive websites
Python can help you python brings you
tremendous amount of power and it makes
it very easy to do really complicated
things why you might want to learn C or
C++ maybe based on the speed that you
need C is really known for its
efficiency so you might want to learn
those languages if you're working in say
you're doing an algorithmic trading
where you have to make each trade within
a nanosecond you're making thousands of
trades in nanoseconds right you need
something that's really freaking fast so
C might actually be a really good idea
or C++ so linus torvalds hates the plus
plus he loves C so that's why I keep
saying C first um so that's why Java
probably one of the same reasons video
game design very popular powerful
language Android applications Java is
very powerful
okay guys hopefully that gives you a
little bit of an overview about
different languages and why you should
pick one of them I would say start off
with a very simple language Python would
be my go-to choice for you and other
than that thank you guys for watching
this I love every single one of you do
me a favor subscribe so you can get more
information like this
I have bunch of other videos on
tutorials that you can watch to start
learning Python today take care I will
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
