oriented programming course in Python in
this video we are going to continue what
we were doing and what we're going to
create is something called a bookmark
app so remember in the last video I
talked about we're going to have a frame
with buttons and then when you click
them maybe it'll take you somewhere so
let's call it the bookmark app and I've
created a file up there if you can see
that and so far let's just see what we
have just so we can refresh in our
memory where we're at so essentially
it's this app when we run it and if I
hit 10 it does nothing if I had doorbell
it detects and it says you rang the
doorbell and it essentially runs this
function that we wrote on line 5 cool
now what we want to do is we want to see
if you can try to do this so like pause
the video see if you can create a button
that detects something else okay if you
haven't done that from the last video so
let's go ahead and do this now so I'm
going to create a new one and
essentially what my button is going to
do is it's going to take me to the
clever programmer dot-com website it's
going to open up a new tab and take me
there so first of all what I have to do
is I have to go at the top and import
the web browser library so essentially
we're stealing code from people who
spent hundreds of hours writing it by
using the import magical command and
we're going to leverage the web browser
code and it's going to make our lives
very easy and essential is going to do
is just say web browser that open new
tab and this function takes in a URL so
we're going to give it a URL we're just
going to type it in here
HTTP clever program or comm for you you
can have this button be whatever you
want okay and I'm going to say yeah that
looks pretty good to me I'm going to add
this as button to bind and I'm going to
bind this to the left click as well of
the mouse and left click short key of
the mouse is this button essentially
right here it's button
- one and now I'm going to attach this
button to the second function that we
just wrote so this function is going to
be called clique CP this function should
really be called open CP so I'm going to
give it a better name I'm going to say
open CP okay all right that looks good
to me
and now instead of the text on it saying
ten let's call it clever programmer and
now let's run this code let's run it and
as you can see it just created a new
frame um like it added the new button
called clever programmer and if I click
it in my Chrome it should open a new tab
that says clever programmer so let's
give it a try I'm going to click it and
indeed it did open up clever programmer
so that's pretty cool now what if I
wanted to add another button that maybe
takes me to the blog page so see if you
can add that pause this video see if you
can add that right now again if you're
not pausing this and doing this on your
own and really deviating away from the
examples I'm just giving you if you're
just really only copying the code you're
not going to retain any information
that's what happens when people take
Codecademy they're not able to retain
that information it just gets lost
because you might just copy what they
have and then not do anything on your
own so the more the farther away you go
from my examples the better you'll
become think of my examples as just an
implication of what you can do and then
take that and run with it
so what I'll tell you is that think of
it as your assignment ok take what I've
currently given you already in the video
and use it to create something cool and
add that in the comments below so other
people can check out what you have done
and it might give them new ideas as well
so you know kind of surprised me and
everybody else here
okay so that's what this does now I'm
going to create that blog button okay
so first of all I'm just going to create
the function open or let's just call it
CP blog takes in an event and we're
going to say opens new tab and
essentially what it does is it does here
let's make our code a little bit better
so I'm going to take this guy and I'm
going to say URL is equal to that guy
and here I'm just going to replace this
with URL and here what I'm going to do
is I'm just a URL plus and I'm just
going to add blog to it okay so it's
going to take this URL here and all it's
going to do is it's going to just add
blog in front of it that's it so this
one I'm reusing my code if I keep having
to create new tabs I don't have to write
that entire URL over and over again I
can do it in a simple way let's go down
here I'm going to create the third label
so I'm going to say C label is equal to
Tk label text is equal to oops
blog we can call this home C label dot
grid let's go column two on this guy and
let's stay in row zero and then we can
say button 3 is equal to button window
add that in the window the text for this
should be CP blog and button 3 for grid
let's put that in column I think we can
put this button in column two and for
row let's keep the wrote one
and now let's go ahead and bind this guy
to the left click of the mouse and now
we're going to throw in the function CP
blog and let's give this a try
so I got to end my previous session okay
so I just ran my code and you can see I
have doorbell which if I click it just
says door Bo if I click clever
programmer it will take me to the home
page and for the blog if I click this
button it should open up the blog so let
me click this and let's see what happens
and there you go it just took me to the
clever programmer blog page so if you
want to learn how to do this and a lot
more like for example creating this game
of pong or creating a calculator from
scratch and creating apps on your own
using Python so you connect your Python
coding knowledge to actually creating
apps and you want to learn more about
this I've put a link together for you
below so you can actually click and just
put in your first name in your email
address and I'll send you five free
exclusive pieces of content from the
learn Python object-oriented programming
course ok there's no cost to you and in
that course I'll show you how you can do
these things by yourself alright so go
ahead and put your email address and
your first name in there and I'll see
you on the other side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
