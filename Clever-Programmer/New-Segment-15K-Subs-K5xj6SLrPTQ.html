clever programmer com I'm sorry I've
been kind of a way I have been working
on a few special things regarding with
clever programmer and those will be
released pretty soon and i will share
them with you guys also there was too
much time being spent on improving the
quality of the videos and doing a lot of
work on the editing but then one thing
that I realized was if I try to do that
then what happens is I can't make a
video for you guys every day but every
day you guys have really important
questions that you're asking me and so I
can't answer them if I keep up at that
level so i think that i decided to work
in a compromise where I do try to work
on some videos and make them really good
but then I also want to kind of have
this heart-to-heart with you guys so I'm
sorry these videos might not some of
these videos might not have like editing
maybe won't have music but I just want
to make sure that in these videos I
could provide you value answer your
questions another interesting thing that
I wanted to start and I need your guy's
help to do that is a question segment
okay so like a question and answer I
want to get your questions and give you
immediate answers to them so we have a
few two choices that I was thinking
about so we can either have the segment
called ask kazi so if you think it
should be called ask kazi comment below
say something like ask cause II and the
second option is called Q and Q which is
questions for kazi so if you think it
should be questions for cause your Q and
Q comment that below I will personally
read every single comment though I'm
sorry sometimes I can't respond to all
of them also thank you guys so much for
fifteen thousand subscribers we're
building such a strong community it's
really growing so fast and so I'm trying
to work as hard as I can to make sure
that I can provide you guys
with the best quality content and that
you guys also find a lot of value and I
want to work together on this with you
guys because there is no clever
programmer without you guys so thank you
guys for being here I just wanted to
keep you updated and again I love every
single one of you and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
