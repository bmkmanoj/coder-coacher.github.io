clever programmer calm and you're
watching code Khadem e part 11 okay so
without any further ado let's get
started
also see what I did there I was
referencing 11 from movie or the show
stranger things that sucks if you don't
if you didn't get it because I was
wondering about how I'm going to solve
this problem of counting past more than
10 fingers and that was a solution that
came to my head I thought it was pretty
witty if you liked it comment on it
alright
a day at the supermarket we're at 84% so
let's keep going okay stocking out now
you need to compute bill function to
take the stock inventory and something
okay I'm not going to read that too much
reading make the bill function two
changes to your computer bill well
actually let's read it function to take
the stock slash inventory of a
particular item into account when
computing the cost ultimately if an item
isn't in stock then it shouldn't be
included in the total you can't buy or
sell what you don't have totally makes
sense make the following changes to your
compute bill function let's do that
while you loop through each item of food
only add the price of the item to total
if the item stock count is greater than
zero so I'm going to say for item in
food and I'm going to say if let's
create a variable here called price or
sorry
umm-hmm we don't have to actually create
a variable we can just say if stock of
that item is greater than zero then this
part happens so I hit tapped and that
that you can also just do this simply
backspace all over to the colon hit
enter
and it will do that for you don't forget
your colons after every for loop
definition and if statement you have a
colon all right because that's kind of
like defines the things that your
indenting under that and that becomes a
block of that code right so if this
function you don't indent anything
underneath it now it's not um the total
is actually not part of the de f it's
actually going to give you an error in
this case so you want to make sure that
it's indented so you're saying these
pieces of code they go together there's
a block of code okay
so if the item stock is greater than
zero that's the only time we actually
increment the cost of total by the
prices the price of the item that
totally makes sense because you can sell
you don't have so right it would not
make sense if we went to Apple which had
a stock of zero but you went up and
looked up the prices and incrementing
the prices of total by two right that
would not make much sense so that's why
you want to have this check here and
that way if you get Apple right you get
Apple right here this part evaluates to
zero and that therefore this part right
here does not turn into Apple and
evaluate two prices of Apple which is
two and you get back to and then this
turns into two right so that checks that
if statement that we wrote that creates
a check that stops that from happening
if the item is in stock and after you
add the price of the total subtract one
from the items count now think about it
if we're trying to compute the bill in
our customer or let's say that you own a
restaurant right and I come to your
restaurant in your restaurant as
tremendously extravagant foods such as a
banana
Apple orange and pear so let's say you
sell me one of those things so you go
sir
for your entree we have two bananas and
for your appetizer or whatever or your
dessert we have two oranges
well after you compute the costs of the
bill you would still have six bananas
left you would now have four bananas
left and you wouldn't have 32 oranges
left you gave me two oranges so now you
have 32 minus 2 so you have 30 oranges
left so you have to take that into
account so in this case on line 22 when
we increment the price we should also
what's the opposite of increment
decrement we should decrement the stock
so we should decrement the quantity of
that food in our stock dictionary does
that make sense okay if it doesn't over
what we'll do right now so what we're
going to do is I'm going to say um that
items value what are we decrementing
we're decrementing the value of those
items right so if we have banana wearing
a decrement its value well to change the
value we need to access it using the
dictionaries key so here I'm going to
use a dictionary stock and then I'm
going to use the key item to access the
6 and I'm going to say minus equal 1
which is the same as saying is equal to
stock of item minus 1 got it and let's
just go to an example because examples
are awesome and something that
professors and professors and teachers
of such courses love not to give they're
like theoretically you understand all of
this in your head but it's not as easy
to understand
all in your head and I bet you that they
didn't either that trouble with it but
for some reason they take pride in the
theater the theoretic nests of all of
this right the conceptualization of all
of this so we should stay away from that
work on tangible examples so you can get
this okay so let me give you a basic
tangible example here let's take that
shopping list the same list right but
I'm gonna actually take that exact list
it's easy for you to see what's going on
I'm going to pretend like I'm calling
the compute bill function here I'm going
to pass in that particular dictionary or
I'm sorry the list banana orange Apple
so let's go here that list is going to
get passed to food now we come to total
and what's going to happen is for item
in food well food is just that list that
we passed in and for item it's going to
be banana the first time it's gonna say
if the stock of the banana right this is
going to be replaced by banana this part
is going to evaluate to what what is
this part going to evaluate to it's
really good to run through your code
tangibly with actual examples so you can
follow and see how the algorithm is
actually working stock of banana is
going to give you the value 6
right so dictionary stock key banana
this is going to give you 6 is 6 greater
than 0 yes it is this part goes boom it
evaluates to true we get to line 22 now
our total is incremented by the price of
that item so this turns into banana
because remember we're looping through
and item was bananas
everywhere we see item it's now banana
right now on line 22 prices of banana
evaluates to what 4 right if we look in
our prices dictionary now total is
incremented by 4 total is at 4 stock of
banana is decremented by 1 so what that
effectively means is now in our stock we
have 6 minus 1 which is 5 5 bananas left
ok then the loop happens again this time
it's orange right this time it's orange
and it goes hey if stock of the item is
greater than 0 so our item is orange and
stock of orange is actually 32 this
statement is 32 is greater than 0 this
is true so what happens here this is
incremented by the price of the item
right so what's the price of an orange
this part gets evaluated to the price of
the orange which is 1.5 so now we have
5.5 up here
and this part also gets orange right
here this part is evaluated to stock of
orange again 32 32 minus 1 so stock of
items value should now be set to 31 so
it goes all the way up to stocks and set
this to 31 and it goes on one more time
but as you can see I'm not going to go
through the code of what happens but you
can effectively see that once it gets to
Apple it realizes that the stock of that
item which is Apple is 0 this part gets
evaluated to 0 is greater than 0 this
turns into false well I actually did end
up going through the code and the lines
22 and 23 do not execute because if
condition is false and ultimately also
the for loop goes back it goes back to
the for loop it realizes that was the
last one so the for loop ends it comes
to the last line return total which in
our case is 5 point 5 that's the answer
we should get now
we have ran through it in our head which
is what we should always do but now what
we're going to do is run through it in
our rep politey and we're going to print
out what it does oh I didn't define what
stocks and prices this so it's going to
go crazy it's gonna be like what are you
talking about I have no idea you're a
crazy person get away from me okay you
saw we got five point five right that's
what I had written down so yeah run
through the algorithms in your head
first and then once your head is
exploding in your life all my muscles
are being flexed of my brain that means
that you're learning that means that
you're actually improving that's the
only time you're improving a lot of the
times and conceptual things like
programming when your brain muscles are
stretching and they're kind of hurting
and you know it's almost like they're
growing you're growing new muscles so
that's it for stalking out hold on stock
doesn't look quite right make sure the
UM call bill make sure to not call
compute bill since that changes okay so
I'm calling the function here and I
should not be calling okay
so we are done oh man we got some kind
of achievement but I skipped it so
hooray we got some achievement and if
you're watching the video maybe you can
pause it at that exact frame and see
what the achievement was and let me know
in the comments I have no idea what it
was and I'm sad that I missed it okay
we're almost done with the day at the
supermarket let's check it out save and
submit congratulations we have finished
that course a day at the supermarket we
have earned a new badge let's go back to
the course page
we're done with 42% of it that's really
good news
as you can see rock papers and scissors
and this is really funny because
somebody in the comments write fail bug
he's our very loyal fan fail bug asked
what project I should work on and just
instinctively with what we've done I
told him right at the top of my head
work on rock-paper-scissors and that
tells you how good of a teacher I am
because that's exactly what they're
asking you write rock papers and
scissors I don't like to brag but hey
I'm going to take credit when it's due
so even you know these people with
millions of users and all these
professional curriculum developers even
them they're like yep Rock Paper
Scissors is the next step so sure if you
want to pay go ahead and click upgrade
now and try it but what I would
recommend honestly is you can start
working on it in repple dot it which is
a really simple way to do it or you can
download some kind of Python installer
which I'll cover in videos once
Codecademy series is over so you can do
it right there and then you can paste it
in the comments and I'll help you out if
you get stuck ok so next part is a
pretty big part where student becomes
the teacher I'm gonna keep that as its
own separate video probably which is why
you can see that unit 6 is an entity in
itself this is going to be amazing part
because you get to learn how classes
work this is the part where things you
can do some really powerful stuff I mean
already with what you know you can do
pretty much anything you can do a lot of
powerful things already but after this
section you learn even more powerful
things ok this section will teach you I
mean after this you can even make start
making you know I'm not saying you can
make the best graphics in the world
that's a skill in its own but the logic
behind games like Street Fighter and
fighting games so you can use text base
is fighting for now and you can create
games or when somebody attacks other
guide that health gets depleted or you
can loot items and then it increments
your level of gold in your inventory and
you can buy things and when you buy
things it decrements the amount of gold
that you're currently carrying so there
are a lot of things that you can start
to do even in up until what you did so
far and especially when we get to unit
six that's it for now a lot of talking
for me I'm sorry about that
please subscribe to the channel it
really helps out again we have broken
past hundred subscribers which is great
but our goal is to keep going up so we
can help more people out in the
community who are looking for
programming help and generally just
something fun that's not boring that you
know you dread when you watch this
programming videos so trying to spread
the word like the video if you liked it
if you need any help please comment
below and I or somebody else who is
really nice will help you out and thank
you for watching I'll see you in code
CAD Ameen part 12 okay take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
