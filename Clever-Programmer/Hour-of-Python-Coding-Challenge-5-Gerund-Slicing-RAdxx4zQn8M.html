from clever programmer common this video
we're going to be doing the gerund
slicing challenge hopefully I'm
pronouncing the word right I didn't
learn grammar in United States learn it
back home anyways we have done the
reverse slicing challenge so our word
zebra index challenges switch-case
challenge uppercase challenge lowercase
challenge if you haven't done it already
go check out those videos from before
and if you want to do this challenge is
live you can do it right below this
video on my website the coding thing is
right there if you're on youtube there's
a link in the description what you feel
free to watch it right where you are
okay so let's get this thing let's get
this show on the road
gerund infinitive so basically what this
challenge says for you to do is if I
gave you something like building
anything that ends with an egg right I
can't think of any examples end with an
Inc well anything that ends with an an
egg what we do is we return it as like
for example if I give you building you
return to build right if I gave you
billing you give me back to Bill okay oh
yeah here's another one singing if I
gave you singing you give me back to
saying if I give you dancing giving back
to dance
oh well that's actually a little
complicated we'll keep it simple but for
so for Bill you should be able to do
that and for building you should be able
to give me the right thing
alright so let's jump into that and if I
give you something that's not adjourned
infinitive then just give me back that's
not a gerund okay something that's not a
gerund just say you know that's not a
German so this literally the string on
line 8 is what you should give me back
okay so let's get into this so how would
you do it take a stab at it actively
code this up try comment your solution
below otherwise I'm going to solve this
and I'm doing this live
you guys are going to hear my thinking
process okay all right so if I get a
string and the last three letters of it
are ing how would I do it I would say
here's how I would do it this I'm
thinking of the simplest way to do it so
I would slice it can I slice it from
negative three all the way to the end I
think that's possible
let's go and check it out so what I do
is I open up my command line and then I
try things in here as well so let's try
it let's get hello and I'll try to index
it like this and it works right from
negative three all the way to the end
and what if it was something like this
it still works so great so I'll say go
from negative three all the way to the
end and if it's equal to ing right then
what we do is we return that string we
return to plus let's put a little space
here right accounting for this space and
we say string from can we do from start
up until negative three that way this
negative three isn't included in there
it's kind of weird I think that should
work so what I would do is I open up my
terminal
if you're on Windows open up your idle
if you're on iMac if you don't have idle
which it just means you have an
installed Python so install Python first
of all or just coat it in the thing
below and hit that play button right
this play button and then it should work
for you now let's go back here and let's
try this thing here right so I'm going
to paste it and I'm going to replace the
as with building see what it gives me
what's here oh yeah to build okay that
actually looks like it works I was
surprisingly good how I was able to
solve it and you'll be able to say that
too when you can solve these coding
challenges that's the bonus all right so
I have to build and if it's not
something that ends with ing right so we
can say else we will say I'm too lazy to
type so I'll copy this guy from here and
I'll paste it and just wrap it because
it's a string and this should work let's
give it a try
okay building we got to build for build
we got that's not a gerund all right
hopefully that was insightful and
awesome for you guys to watch and do it
live with me I know a lot of you
watching got tripped up on that and
that's okay
it just means you need to practice think
about a little bit more and what I would
do follows you when I can't solve
something I try to forget about the
solution right I come back to it a day
later and try to just do it from scratch
but not just by like randomly putting in
random things in the code I'll take a
piece of paper and step through
everything and see if I can truly
understand and gain a deep understanding
of what it was
hand-waving is single-handedly the most
disruptive thing you can do to your
improving your coding skills and by
hand-waving I mean it's like oh that's
just simple I got it I got it
of course after you see the solution
it's so simple it makes sense remember
high insight is 20/20 but when you try
to code it right ah completely from
scratch and from a blank canvas it's
going to be more difficult and that's
generally how you start off coding
anything any even big project right you
start off from a blank canvas so that's
why it's good to practice like come back
to it a day later don't hand wave and
just go oh I got it I got it if you
messed it up go back to the drawing
board come back a day later and try to
do it from scratch
okay all right guys that's it for this
video thank you so much for watching I
love your guys faces off and as always
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
