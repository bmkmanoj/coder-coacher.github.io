clever programmer comm and today I want
to talk about how you should use and
think about your money so one tip I
would like to offer you that will
hopefully change your perspective on how
you think about this is like a lot of
people think about it as this very like
static thing that you just pile up or
save and then you use it for whatever
reason like purchasing something but you
should think of money as something that
you can trade for another thing right
and I know it sounds obvious or like duh
yeah I trade my money and to go to Best
Buy to buy some electronic equipment or
trade it in for a car but I mean that
you should start focusing on trading
your money for skill so one thing that
helped me a lot and how I was able to
get a lot better in programming in a
much shorter amount of time was as I
started learning about programming I
would do my other job or I would do
where I would coach people in chess and
then I wanted to get better at
programming so what I did was I was like
okay if I'm making a certain amount of
money from teaching my chest I can trade
that money trade that skill for the
skill of programming so I'm using my
chest skill and then I would take that
money and I would give it to somebody
else so they could teach me about the
skill of computer programming and while
I was learning on my own I was using
this thing to help me boost because then
I was able to work with like
professional software developers and
learn the skills and the trades that
they had or if I wanted to vice versa
learn about chess and I already knew
programming I would start using my
programming
like in a dynamic way to trade it for a
skill so we a lot of the times use money
to purchase things purchase static
things which you know a lot of the times
don't have a return value on them like
you don't have an ROI or a return on
your investment you'll just purchase
some kind of liability or maybe
sometimes you purchase an asset you'll
purchase a property or put it into stock
most of the times we'll spend it on
either buying clothes buying a jacket
purchasing gloves or whatever right some
random thing but if you start using your
money to trade it for skill now you
start getting to the next level
and what a lot of the times happens is
that you'll think okay I'm I just got
paid like $30 or $50 from somebody else
I don't want to put that much money in
but essentially how you should think of
it is I just gave somebody my time for
chess or for something like Photoshop
and now I'm trading it in for learning
about a skill in Final Cut Pro or I'm
learning about a skill in some kind of
business thing or cooking or arts and
crafts painting whatever right you're
trading one skill for another and this
way you can start adding on and boosting
up your skills really fast and again
when you invest in learning and quality
learning right not just I hate to say it
like this and I don't want to sound like
I'm against all schooling and colleges
again I think there's a lot of value
there but when I for example paid $1,500
for a course at my college where I knew
more than my teacher and a lot of people
did as well
and that teacher really wasn't even a
computer science teacher in the first
place now that's money that I'm not
getting my value back on right but if
you trade it in with somebody who's
skilled at that task and even if it
costs you a little bit more you're now
getting value back and again how I
thought about it is if I did computer
programming right and I worked at like
for example I
a computer programming client who I
worked for and they paid me money for
designing their website designing
invoicing system and a calendaring
system for them for example right and
when I would get paid by them I will
trade it in and to to learn from a
professional developer because how I
thought of about it is like I'm trading
my really you know crappy skillset for a
much higher and a crazy higher level
skillset right I didn't think about it
like oh let me just keep my money I got
my money and I'm just gonna keep it for
myself right like whatever money I was
getting I was like I'm gonna use it to
learn from somebody else and if you can
hire somebody who you're not paying so
much for like you can even hire some
people from different countries there
are websites that allow you to do like
upwork.com for example you can hire
people from are cheaper because they're
they're in a different country and so if
you paid them in their currency it's a
lot of money so essentially like let's
say you're getting paid I don't know $10
an hour or $50 an hour $40 an hour right
let's say getting paid $40 an hour or
whatever if you hire somebody else from
another country and you're paying them
20 bucks or 30 bucks an hour
I mean think of it like holy crap I'm
trading in my really terrible skillset
you know for a really high-level skill
set and I'm getting two hours from this
person so essentially I'm just learning
a new skill becoming an amazing
programmer amazing whatever right
whatever things you're interested in
better business person for free and as a
matter of fact I'm making more money on
top of it right even if you're trading
in literally a hundred percent of the
money you're getting and then giving it
and acquiring a new skill but I
understand can't do that you got to pay
your bills you got to pay for other
stuff right that's fine but if you have
money left over and you trade it in for
a skill I mean you'll be increasing so
fast and the things that you do because
you'll save years of your time and
sometimes more than years of your time
it's a lifetime
like when I was landing my first
consulting gig for software development
I had a mentor his name is Nick and if
Nick ever watches this video Nick I love
you you're awesome
I'm still in touch with Nick he's
actually one of the teachers at
full-stack Academy which is a
programming boot camp and it's a really
good boot camp and how programming boot
camps work is that in three months you
spend some money there like I don't know
a few thousand ten thousand dollars or
something and then they pretty much
change your life and they will do their
best to land you a job and a lot of
people actually did end up getting job
right off full-stack Academy and Nick
helped with that and Nick was one of my
mentor well I didn't even you know I
wasn't paying him but just because I was
such a good student I was crazy I would
be like working learning programming and
coding skills like 20 hours a day so
when I had Nick to help me out he helped
me with my consulting gig and told me
what rate I should charge them and
because I started off with a really high
rate because thanks to Nick he told me
what to charge I just say five years of
my time maybe more and I had a head
start in front of everybody else and it
was because I wasn't afraid to take my
money give it to somebody who knew much
better than me right like I had such a
you know shitty skill set and I traded
in for a superior high-quality trained
professional skill set so that's amazing
it's essentially like I worked for one
hour and somebody would the train and a
high level of skill set was essentially
when they give you one hour of their
time that's like 20 hours of your time
or more so I was almost thinking of it
like oh my god I'm earning time I'm
saving so much time I'm literally like
getting 10 to 20 hours or more per day
and I could use that time to either hang
out with people I liked and had fun or
take that time and just boost myself so
much so I could catch up with people who
are years ahead of me right you'll hear
most people rely on their experience as
something that's very important you'll
go to a job and people will just try to
show their superiority based on their
experience and that's because that's how
most people learn very linearly right
like like this very linearly in one day
their skillset is here in two day their
skillset is here in three days skillset
is here but when you work with somebody
who's really good or you trade in your
skill for another skill to improve and
somebody who's a professional can teach
you you're just learning exponentially
like your curve is almost like absurd so
you catch up to those people they're
very fast and then you end up becoming
better than them and then it's not about
experience anymore but that's the only
way they know how it works that's why
sometimes you'll hear in jobs like oh
there's so much politics going on and
these people think they're better than
me even though I'm more skilled and
that's the reason why it happens people
are like well he spent 10 years you
spend one year so it just doesn't make
sense how you could have caught up to
him but if you think about the skill set
and if you use this way of learning yes
it does make sense how you caught up to
this person so again for me I just spent
relentless time I'm like I'm a
borderline obsessive right when I am
learning about a new skill like if it's
jiu-jitsu
I'm just watching jiu-jitsu videos while
I'm eating I'm just watching Jitsu
videos while I'm walking around thinking
about things I'm watching jujitsu videos
when I was on my train on Metro like
that's what it's about I'm ordering
books on jujitsu I'm talking to jujitsu
coaches I got a digit zoo membership
like it's like my whole world is that
and so I just I would pick it up really
fast I would try to get a mentor in
jujitsu as well with programming you
know you could use that to learn very
quickly and don't be afraid of investing
a lot of time in one place because then
your rewards are so much better too like
you don't have to go about it in such a
systematic way like one hour a day for
like the next thirty days you can do
that that's fine but then just
understand that the results you're gonna
get are also gonna be in the next 30 or
60 days rather than in one week or
whatever right so train your skillset
think of your money that you can
actually invest it to earn skills
they'll put a very different spin on how
you think of money and how you can use
it I hope this video was enlightening I
know some of the stuff may seem obvious
and it might be I don't know that's just
how I picked up a lot of the things
really fast in whatever field I worked
in or started enjoying that's something
I wanted to share with you guys maybe
you'll find it helpful maybe I'll help
you let me know if this helps you maybe
I can speak more on this subject but the
video is getting along so I'm gonna stop
but thank you guys for listening thank
you guys for being here and I can't
believe it we're over 10,000 subscribers
that's amazing and you guys are amazing
I have released a new course where I
teach you guys how to create Python apps
and 30 days or less so if you're
wondering if you want to create learn
how to create apps or you know without
having to know a million things about
theory in Python and start to do some
practical projects that's a great course
for you to start taking we have a
community of coders in our slack Channel
so everybody who is actually part of
that course is also in the slack Channel
and then that you guys can talk with
each other so you don't get stuck I am
always in that slack channel so I'll
personally jump in and help you out if
you're getting stuck on anything and
yeah just check it out you know I also
have a bunch of free videos in there
that you can like click preview' if you
don't want to pay for the course that's
fine there's a learn Python course
that's free we have thousands of
students enrolled in there so you can
check out the learn Python course before
you know if you before you want to jump
into the IOP learn Python olp course
which is a paid course and yeah you have
30 day money-back guarantee so if you
want to get in there for a few days
test some things out if it's too
advanced for you you know you can you
know get your money back or you should
just ask me first like Hayes is too
advanced for me but if you know
basic Python like for this course
honestly we haven't even jumped into if
statements yet in this course because
we're constantly adding more videos more
modules more exercises and projects and
we also have live webinars or a lot of
live training we haven't even jumped
into like lots of things that have to do
with if statements or whatever but if
you do if statements and if you do some
functions like basic function knowledge
that would be helpful to you so those
are like things that are very
supplemental but I think you can pick up
most of those things while you're taking
the course as well so check that course
out out if you have any questions ask me
about it we have about I think 20
students in that course now so you can
ask those students questions about it as
well and how they're doing they've done
some really cool stuff so far that
they're shared and I'm gonna put that
actually in the course like what the
students are able to create they're
learning like professional development
workflows so like how do you put sublime
text on one side how do you put the
command line on one side and then how do
you run Python scripts and how can you
start working on GUI development into
kinter how do you install packages and
libraries so lots of practical knowledge
that will be something that you can
actually put on your portfolio as well
because that's where I would like to
take it you know you go from basic but
use like basic Python like where you
don't know nothing anything don't know
nothing it's called it and learn Python
and you learn some basic things then we
build projects and then maybe you know I
want to put some course together for you
guys they'll show you how to actually
like step by step create a website where
you can take those projects and put it
as a portfolio and then how you market
yourself and how should you train for
interviews and how should you position
yourself so you have a much higher
chance of get getting and landing either
independent job as a freelancer or
landing a job at a company and how you
can actually use the briefcase technique
and help them as well so lots of cool
things coming up check it out again
thank you for every
thank you for being here and yeah so let
me know what you thought about this
video if you found anything helpful and
I'll jump in there and talk to you okay
I love you guys take care and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
