programmer calm where you learn to code
smarter so let's get started I want to
cover last letter of a string function
in this video okay so how do we play
around with the string so we can get its
last letter that's the function I want
you to write should be very simple you
should be able to get it pretty fast if
you look at the tests below if you use
the last letter function pass it hello
with the summation mark it should give
you this LeMay shin mark if you give it
banana it should give you an A because a
in this case is the last letter if you
give it something with only one letter
it should return that letter if you give
it again funny guys
s you get the idea so let's code this
bad boy up again you do not deserve to
view the solution if you haven't
participated and try to do it on your
own this is you got to be part of
actively learning ok I don't want you to
be passively learning like you're
sitting back like eating some popcorn I
don't want you to do that ok while I do
agree this is kind of like Netflix for
your career but I still want you to be
actively learning ok it's like Netflix
that you engage and participate it
alright so let's get to coding this bad
boy up notes or below solution notes or
below exercise problem is below
everything is there let's keep going
define last letter ok now what does it
take in it takes in some string so you
can literally call it some string if you
want to but we're just going to call it
strength what does it do then well it's
very simple
it returns the last letter how do you
return the last letter if I opened up a
terminal and showed you guys how does
bad boy works quite simple if I have a
string like hello too
it's second letter I would do this to
get its third letter I'd do that to get
its first letter I'd do this but if I
wanted to get its last letter there's a
trick in Python that you can do index by
negative numbers if I do negative two
this gives me the second-to-last letter
which means I'm going to get the second
L okay he'll last L of the word hell but
if I want to get the last letter well I
can just do this right it gives me the
last letter
now let's code this up return string and
last letter okay as simple as that let's
test our function and prove to ourselves
that we are indeed correct and it says
your code is correct okay that's it for
this video if you washed up to this
point and you haven't subscribed
subscribed right now because you don't
want to miss the next videos I will see
you there it didn't end let's try it
again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
