some time to go through my videos either
on YouTube or some of my videos at
clever programmer comm so you have a
sense of how everything is working and
hopefully you were able to go through it
and learn new things ok that's my
ultimate goal now believe it or not
there are going to be times where you
are going to get stuck all right you're
gonna be pulling your hair out and
you're gonna be looking at a wall just
reflecting on your life decisions and
the code and its errors are going to be
staring back at you making you think why
are you programming still but do not let
that deter you please alright that's
actually one of the most fun parts of
coding but sometimes I understand it can
get frustrating when you hit that
roadblock and there are times when it's
actually completely useless to try to
work around it it's spent months
learning something that was maybe just a
small thing that somebody could have
told you okay
so what I want you guys to do is if you
are stuck and can't get out of it try to
find yourself a mentor alright so there
is a website you can go to called
meetup.com and you can network with
other people who are like-minded they
could be one step ahead of you two steps
ahead of you doesn't matter they could
be a professional programmer wherever
they are if they can help you that's
great or if you guys can make a group
and help each other study that is
probably the best thing that you can do
but if that's something you're having
trouble finding and you need a more
immediate solution you guys can book a
session with me
so in our session we will go over
whatever your problem is or if you want
more general help let's say you want
specific and specialized curriculum for
yourself that's something we can do as
well a few things that you are going to
get during the session
if that's something that you choose to
do you are going to get free
downloadable PDF as soon as you book the
session so that's going to actually
teach you a lot of things and also help
prepare you for your first lesson also
when we are recording our lesson we will
be able to take control of each other's
screens so I will be able to code on
your screen if you are stuck at a
certain point we will be able to share
screens and we will be able to record
the session so after the session is over
I can send you the session and if I want
maybe to fast during the lecture with
you well you can go through it at your
own pace at this point you can either go
to meetup.com or try to find a mentor in
your local place or you can book a live
session with me you can click some link
below or around my face and I can help
you get through your problem if there is
any reason you're unsatisfied or the
lesson wasn't helpful or you're just
like this guy's boring well I can just
refund you okay that is not going to be
a problem I want to make sure that you
are learning from this and that's the
ultimate goal that's it for this video
and I'll see you in the neck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
