doing alright let's get pumped up oh man
this is super exciting uh alright guys
were in the final we're in the
homestretch okay hey hey there guys hey
alright awesome we got some people
coding at the moment great stuff
I am excited it's okay if you're eating
hi
welcome welcome back
Sabra unheard robot says for the
Facebook people you can't see a timer
here like the people on YouTube can okay
so basically there are 20 minutes left
till this course closes and then it's
gone okay there's no registration there
are no exceptions
so it's that 20 minute home stretch and
I want to sign I want to like answer any
questions you guys have at this point
okay that's what I'm here for
cool hat yeah it's my friend's friend's
mom made it
enak what after you sign up once you
sign up you get manually enrolled by me
or one of our team members like Rachel
who is drowning and enrolling you guys
which is
awesome yeah she just has way too much
work and then we have a few more people
were trying to enroll you guys and
they're just like oh my god but rachel
is really the lead there so this is
super exciting uh but yeah we've
literally today we've got hundreds of
students right we had that webinar
earlier in the day at 12 p.m. we had an
email earlier than that we had another
email we had another email we had
another live webinar or live stream on
Facebook and YouTube and right now this
is this is it this is the home stretch I
mean we are building something exciting
like the group the community that we
have that we're building we literally
have over hundreds of students now it's
just such an amazing experience and I
really want you to be a part of it like
genuinely I want you to be a part of
this and help us take this to the next
level so really yeah I'll do these live
streams you know once in a while like
I'll try to do more of these if you guys
like them and I'm gonna start calling
out everybody who's joining right now
also I've got a fast action bonus so for
the first 15 people who actually joined
from this live webinar or this
livestream I will send you out this book
one of my favorite books that I've used
okay I will send this out to ten people
and I will sign it is that something
exciting for you guys would you guys
want a book from me signed deliver to
your house for free
let me know hold on on YouTube I think
I'm not sure if it's showing up
correctly but now it should be showing
up correctly awesome
so I'm going to put this away it's
called intro to programming by John Zell
it's an unbelievable book like you
create these apps you create some you
don't really create like lots of apps
but you
really learning the fundamentals of
programming and I think it's a great
great book can it be the first 50 people
armed no it's going to be the first 15
people that actually get this book
signed okay so it's going to happen but
for the people who are actually in this
live cast so you're going to you know
once you sign up you're going to get you
duh you are emails basically to connect
with us want you to just tell us and say
hey I joined during your live cast Kali
said he'll give me a book I'll sign it
well this with this pen right here right
here okay and I will ship it out to your
home free of charge all right awesome
all right let's see I'm gonna start
answering guys's questions I signed up
all I see are some videos is that all or
is there more there is going to be
constantly new content added to the
course also the some videos that you see
actually are projects that when I give
you these assignments it's going to take
you a long time to do them so don't
worry about the length it's about the
quality of the videos okay so the
content is very powerful lots of
students are getting great results with
a student david build an app in two
hours two hours we have a student his
name is Dennis he has a website called
the happy mindset calm uh he's killing
it he already has a job he's doing
really well we have another student his
name is David
he built a really cool graphical user
interface application he's a freelancer
he's actually in slack so you guys can
once you join I'm not making these
people up you can talk with them okay
and I've Li also put them in my email
and he made something for Tobias guitar
comm and he basically links his app to
it so it makes all of his stuff
easier he's using this so then he can
actually charge more as a freelancer I
think it's a really cool idea that he's
learning programming skills to help him
with his freelancing capabilities we
have you know obviously the infamous
kiddie which you guys at this point all
know about she has her website it's
called the savvy coder comm and she
built it after joining you know after
she became part of clever programmer she
got motivated she put together her
website and now she's also blogging on
that website so which is super cool
Kevin Moreno joined great this is
awesome
Fanny Wong joined a little just a little
bit before that all right let's see so
payment plans there's a three-month
payment plan okay where you pay $33 for
three months and the course is yours
there is a one payment which is $97 the
course is yours again just a reminder
the course is about being able to create
your very own Python apps in seven days
or less from scratch you get live
sessions you know with all of the
students actually there you get
personalized email so just to keep you
on track hold you accountable I check in
with you you get weekly check-ins every
Monday okay we're going to be doing a 30
to 60 days sprint so every Monday for
the first 30 to 60 days I'm going to be
checking in with you we're going to be
sending you surveys and based on your
responses the course will be customized
for you okay time to take the hat off
boom so I think that's going to be
pretty cool um yeah okay
more questions let's see I'm your
follower from from Italy nice ISA how
did you learn programming I learned
programming through many different
resources which I talked about probably
throughout the whole day but I'll just
mention them again okay um I'll
and through Coursera introducting part
one enter to computer programming part
two principles of computing part one
principles of computing part two then I
took intro to computer science at
Udacity that was really cool then I took
some courses at college arm let's see a
little bit of free code camp you know
team treehouse I mean everything ok
another student just joined I'm gonna
announce his name great Christian
Christian Nielsen um awesome if you
joined um no so Josh Newman it's not
about the first ten people in the stream
it's actually the first ten people who
buy the course while watching the stream
that get this book sent to them okay so
that's a bonus for you guys
so once you join the course this is I
think a twenty twenty dollar you know
amazing book and you get it free of cost
and you get my signature on there
alright programming necessary for
ethical hacker I'm not sure about this
question let's see no no not necessary
alright other questions okay
another student joined his name is Frank
welcome Frank I mean guys this is
exciting like we are in the homestretch
we have literally hundreds of students
enrolling at this point like we have
hundreds of students enrolled this is
really cool like we had when we started
we didn't have anybody
now clever programmer has grown to
10,000 students enrolled in the program
we just got another student Oh Lamar
Roberts you're in I see that right here
Frank man is here awesome guys this is
exciting great so you know I'm
really excited about this because we are
really building something powerful here
right we got 10,000 of you guys to
enroll at clever programmer and not
because of you guys
it's a massive thing the YouTube channel
is an amazing thing and now finally this
course we're getting so many students
and we're getting all of you guys and
especially with that energy and that
whole group like I think we can achieve
some really exciting stuff and get
really good results whether it's really
earning a higher income whether it's you
just really want to learn get a deeper
understanding of programming whether it
is like you want to actually work at a
professional job software consultant
what consultant whatever it is this
course will give you the fundamental
tools so start heading in those
directions to start getting results and
also focus on getting your returning and
investment so I'm going to be honing
that point in constantly how you can
actually the investment you make into
this course how you can get that back
right right when you get out of this
course and again just a few reframes and
to understand what this course is really
offering and to put it into perspective
is for $97 you get lifetime access to
everything so when I add bonuses and
when I add new upgrades to the content
and when I add new videos new projects
live sessions one on one call with you
it's free to you any additional stuff is
free when this course relaunches it's
going to be a higher price and just to
put it into more perspective is like
thankful which is an online coding
bootcamp charges you $500 a month to
provide a much poor experience than what
I'm actually offering you and the reason
why I know this is I was in the thankful
program and again same thing with Linda
Coursera and Udacity you know they don't
actually provide you the community of
other students so this is providing you
know you with the community of students
who are driven dedicated just like you
so you guys can collaborate and build
something awesome together all right
more questions arm Python was not
invented by a
it was invented by Rossum something I
forgot his last name or whatever but
basically Python is a very powerful
language just in case you guys some of
you guys don't know Python you know
Instagram was built off of fight on I've
said this so many times but I'm sure
that some of you guys are new here and
don't haven't heard this yet but Python
you know Instagram is built off of
Python 450 plus million and growing
right and that is based on by insta and
that's powered by Python Pinterest is
Python you know one of the three major
languages used at Google is Python so
with Python you can make even android
applications using their TV framework -
working at NASA you know doing data
science stuff doing image recognition
doing video recognition doing data
analytics or you could be creating games
with it or you could just be writing
software to automate a lot of the stuff
you do okay just some stuff you do for
fun all right
Alexander Moreno has joined every every
time somebody joins we get a phone call
here great we got some more stuff um I
mean guys the return on your investment
is really simple like you teach to
people what you learn from this course
which you can do in probably a week
after learning stuff from this course
you can charge those people let's say
very minimal you know usually can start
off by $50 an hour but let's say you
said $20 an hour you just give them five
lessons and your money is back for the
course okay lifetime access for $97
there's no monthly fee here just
lifetime access so again that's not
going to be the case the price of this
course is going to be increasing um yep
so when the time is over the
registration closes I go offline and
unfortunately you won't be able to join
the course anymore okay so I'm going to
update this and I'm going to say that
basically core closes in five minutes
Josh Newman it's totally okay if you
can't get it okay
I'll still be here I'm not going
anywhere
okay
this course will be live again for you
maybe you'll be ready then plus 99% of
my stuff is free on on YouTube and even
on clever programmer comm so use it and
get a lot of value out of it um I would
suggest if you are going to be busy I
would still suggest get it now because
you lock it in at the current price and
then you can use it later let's say you
just never used it and you even went
over the 30 day money-back guarantee
I'll just return you your money because
I'll be able to see that you haven't
used it ok I'm not here to nickel and
dime you but I am here to hold you
accountable so you can be successful
this is not a magic bullet everything's
going to be perfect course this is we're
going to be involved in this course this
is not the I'm going to take this and
throw this in the trash course this is
the we're going to work together and
make sure you get your results and
achieve your goals course ok so that's
why everybody's going to be involved
that's why this is so exciting right
this is not just your average udemy
course you just take throw it in your
library of courses alright um so yeah I
would say lock it in at the current
price again 30 day money back guarantee
right that just should just make it a
no-brainer you get it now you don't like
it you call me and like I say you know
I'm going to get upset I'll probably cry
a little bit in the corner but then I'll
send you your refund I'll call to I'll
call you and apologize and I will give
you a one three one-hour one-on-one
session with me okay personal coaching
session that's normally valued over $150
for an hour ok you're going to get that
for free because I just stand behind you
know what I offer that much okay so take
advantage of that as well Violeta joined
great excited to have you Violeta
ok Oh Facebook live just fell off all
right here we go Violeta just joined
Violeta booney she awesome
she joined okay yeah there's also PayPal
so if you want to do a you know one time
payment you can there's a three month
payment plan with PayPal you can do
debit card or credit card so that works
let's see what other questions we got
Ajax if you joined before the deadline
which was supposed to be yesterday at
8:00 or 9:00 p.m. Central Standard Time
if you bought the o P course then you
get slack channel for free right now
slack channel is $47 okay our course was
not ever free for anybody the hopi
Python create apps course which is
designed to help you create apps it
takes you from just writing code to
actually being able to create full apps
so the old Peake course was actually
never free from the start in the start
when I launched it it was $49 and a
bunch of you guys missed that time to
buy it
bunch of you guys waited and then a lot
of you guys actually bought it at $97
price point so I was kind of laughing
like you know you didn't pull the
trigger then and now you're pulling it
up what price point when it's doubled
and the next time when I launch it is
probably going to be doubled or tripled
or even more because the value of this
course is going to be unbelievable like
and it has already been unbelievable
like just one of the students made
thousand dollars you know just this
month from one of our free videos so
people are getting results people are
students are building their own websites
students are booking new clients I mean
so the results are awesome together
we're going to make this in even better
course we're going to build it together
and you know help you get the results
that you want so you know if you're
really debating and you're on the edge
the worst case scenario you get it and
then you can think about okay maybe I
want to you know I would get it now if I
was in your situation if you have the
funds that's that's what where's a Pay
Pal select same place I'll click that
link in the you know this is the page
and it'll show you there's a PayPal
option you scroll down enough
it's a link okay the apps that I've
created are on github you can see them I
even show my apps and videos well just
one of the apps that I show you guys is
called agile directions which you guys
can even play with most of the apps are
built commercially so like you know I
can't show those to you guys because
they're private software but the other
apps that I have they're completely
online they're on my github calm and
also on my youtube channels you know in
the description boxes I actually link
them so you can click them also on my
website when you go to my blog posts I
put my apps there for you guys to check
out all right let's see
mm-hmm
ah Kiki yes you can always learn for
free uh but you just get faster results
when you get high-quality stuff
that's just a fact I bought a $4,000
course it's called zero to launch just a
few days ago like few not days ago but
months ago and it's really designed to
help you with your business and its
really helping it has helped me scale a
clever programmer like insanely um so
yeah there was a price that I had to pay
but then the results I got which was was
much more unrealistic than what normal
people get okay so they're always good
free stuff I've always always used it
but one hack I used to do when I was
taking Coursera courses was I would pay
$50 before the course even start up $50
for the certificate so then even though
I could have taken the course for free
it was so I could be committed to take
that course okay so that was just a hack
I used all right let's see okay guys uh
we are running out of time we have ten
nine eight seven guys here is the book
that you get if you join in this dream
and textbook or something to us
you will be getting this okay um alright
guys that was awesome we had tons of new
people join I am super excited guys
while I'm taking this course actually
offline some of you guys actually might
be able to join but very soon it's gonna
be offline so probably the next five to
ten minutes expected to be completely
offline especially once I go off this
webinar I'm gonna turn that page off
okay that link is going to be
unavailable
alright guys okay that was exciting that
was like a little era that we had and
thank you guys for being a part of this
honestly I appreciate you guys so much
for being here
for supporting the channel from for
being here for really a long time you
know
