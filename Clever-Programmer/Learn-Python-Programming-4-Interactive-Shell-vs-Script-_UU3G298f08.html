solution to the previous problem that I
posed to you and also we're going to
learn how to write the turtle the entire
thing in one go so the problem that I
pose to you is make a square with the
turtle well in your case let's see how
you could do exactly that so let me find
the file where we open up the turtle let
me close that guy right there copy this
line and paste it right there okay
my turtle has begun well the idea is
simple I take this line forward and go
100 now since sometimes programmers are
lazy I don't want to keep writing this
over and over again so one thing I can
do to make my life is it easier is go to
the line that I want to click on and I
want to use basically go to that line
click my mouse there hit enter it brings
that down at the bottom as you can see
right here and now I can just hit enter
so you can see my turtle just moved left
okay now it's facing up now what I want
to do is move it forward again and you
can see that it's facing up again or I'm
sorry it's a it moved up now I need to
make it face left so how do I do that I
go to the left make it turn 90 degrees
and you can see turn 90 degrees now I
want it to move 100 again you can see it
move forward and 90 degrees and then 100
once again and I have made the square
now what I want you to be able to do is
make a python file which means that
remember this thing that we opened up
right right here where we write all of
the code at once so for example I'm
going to close it I'm going to show you
how to open it again okay so I'm going
to close this one and I will simply open
it again new file or command and and I
will go and put it to the right side
just so I have these side by side and I
will say something like important turtle
remember that command if you don't use
that command and you try to do turtle
your program will be like what the heck
is turtle so by doing import turtle now
it knows what turtle is it's like when
you're talking about your friends if you
talk about your friend John right like
let's say you're talking about your
friend John to your mom or to your dad
and you're like dad this guy blah blah
your dad's gonna be like who the heck is
John so you're gonna be like oh yeah you
remember John from my fifth grade class
and then your dad if you're talking to
him he's gonna say oh okay I know who
you're talking about so import is
basically like hey Python import that
turtle that those coders wrote and now
we can use in Python is like on that
turtle but if you don't have this import
command here Python is gonna be like
what the heck what turtle are you
talking about you must be out of your
mind anyways we're gonna import this
turtle all right so now here's what I
want you to do I want you to write a
script that makes the turtle in one
single go okay and I want you to make
that square with the turtle straight up
in one go for example let's come over
here to our script that I've written and
if I write stuff here it does things
immediately right as you saw but if I
come to my right side over here oh by
the way just one quick note whatever you
do do not name this file turtle that py
you can name it turtle underscore game
or a game or something else just don't
name a turtle because then it confuses
this turtle here with this file and
everything goes all over the place so
don't do that because um I ended up
taking that and caused lots of problems
alright so let me just show you what
happens when I run this file I'll go to
run I'll hit run module and hit OK and
you can see that my turtle went and did
all those things in one go how cool is
that
so you don't have to sit there type it
all in you can just write it in one go
and it'll do that every single time so I
want you to work on that square but
before you go and do that I just want to
show you what this file actually looks
like so if I go to
ooop um let's say documents and clever
programmer practice exercises and we
take a look at this file turtle game
it's just a text file with this code in
here okay that's really it that's all
that's going on in here so I'm gonna
leave it here the code that you write
for the square I want you to either go
to the YouTube place YouTube channel and
post it in the comment or I want you to
paste your code right here in the
comments on clever programmer comm okay
I'm gonna take a look at it I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
