we just did some simple stuff in Python
right we can print stuff by doing this
and then it prints it out to the screen
that's cool
now we want to do is we want to take it
to a little bit of a next level I want
you to come up here and select new file
okay this brings up this file here let's
go back to our other screen and let us
simply put this to the left right side
let's put this to the left side and what
I want to do is I want to write a few
things here like print hello
print monkeys eat bananas all the time
and then I want to say and notice how
I'm putting these quotes we will learn a
little bit more about that later and
then I can say print 5 times 25 okay and
I am gonna run this so I'm going to save
this first you can save it anywhere you
would like let's for our purposes let's
save it in our desktop or let's do one
better and let's go here and let's call
this practice exercises and we will save
it in here printing and I'm going to go
to run and hit Python shell and you're
going to see what happens so I'm going
to say run and actually run module okay
so I'm going to say run module that just
means run this whole thing that we just
wrote so let's run it let's check out
what happens boom on the left hand side
it ran our entire file okay on the left
hand side everything you type in gives
you the result right away so you can
write 4 times 8 to 20 times 6 but on the
right hand side notice when I press
ENTER nothing happens so you're kind of
like writing a story here that's how I
like to think of it you're writing kind
of an
novel and this is almost you having a
conversation with Python you're like a
Python what's up or in pythons language
8 times 8 and python is like 64 here
python is not listening to you you write
out your entire whatever you want to
write and then you send it over to
Python and then Python responds to all
of that
almost like you're sending an email to
python and python is sitting there and
once it sees your email a like type
stuff back to you okay let's run it
again just to check what happened and I
will run and you can see that it runs
all of that at the same time so what I
want to do is I want to give you guys a
little problem and the problem is how
would you print hello world okay
and I want to be able to test this for
you guys so what I have done is I've set
up something kind of cool I want you to
go on open a new tab I want you to go to
clever programmer comm and once you're
here I want you to click on and learn
Python for beginners notice that it's
free so simply go to that and here I've
put together a little exercise for you
guys okay so once you start this course
you can you feel free to watch all of
this on YouTube it's available for free
if you want you can also go to my
website and here it'll give you a little
progress bar and everything and you can
comment and I can respond to you as well
and here this is where I'll also put all
of the exercises so if you guys want to
follow along this course and do the
exercises this is where you can come and
find them so let's click exercise one
and start now notice you have a quiz
here it says how do you print out hello
world so I'm not going to answer that
for you here although I'm sure you can
figure out and we want it to look
exactly like this in Python 3 just a
little bit about Python 3 versus Python
2 is if you do this in Python 3 you're
going to get an error so let's just try
it out on the left hand side let's say
print 10 you can see that we get an
error and if I do
print 10 I don't get an error sent
Python 3 this is the correct way of
doing it in Python 2 you can do it just
like this and it actually will not give
you an error okay just for something
something for you to know so here I want
you to select the correct answer and
another thing I made for you guys is if
you click this link what I've put
together is so simple you'll have to
like sign up it'll be really short and
once you're done doing that just click
on exercise 1 and on the right hand side
you see that I want you to print out
hello world alright so now that you're
here let's type in something like print
25 times 63 and let's run it it gives me
1575 great let's hit submit let's see
what happens
oh whoops it says output mismatch and
you failed the correct you fail to
answer it correctly okay so you can
click what's wrong and it'll kind of
tell you what the answer is or you can
hit submit anyway and then it might also
tell you what the answer is okay but I
want you to try to figure it out and I'm
sure you probably already have so I'm
not going to tell you that the answer is
but once you write the correct answer
it'll give you a little green thumbs up
and say hey good job you got it okay
so now I want you to try it and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
