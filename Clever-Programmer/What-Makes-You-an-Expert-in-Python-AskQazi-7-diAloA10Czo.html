clever programmer common in this video
on a tackle
Robert Lily blacks question essentially
wants to know what makes you a Python
expert he wrote a big message but that's
the gist of that message so I'm going to
tackle that one okay let's jump right
into it so what defines an expert that's
a good question and I've been getting
that quite frequently now so I decided
to just kind of answer it for you guys
okay
what defines again an expert somewhere
else like in English or whatever there's
no like one thing there's no specific
thing that makes you an expert or the
ultimate authority
it's accumulation accumulation of
multiple things so for example I
wouldn't say years of experience though
that certainly helps and that's what
most people will use but having build
projects that are useful around it that
is something that takes you a step
closer to being an expert but there's no
list of like build a calculator at build
this build this and now you're an expert
but if you're working with like if
you're creating multiple projects using
Python or you get proficient in speaking
Python like you get proficient and
speaking any other language and you
start start to create things that are
actually useful to yourself and to other
people
and it's not you're not just stuck in
the basic level anymore that's when you
start to get into the level of being an
expert okay once you start becoming very
fluent with it so that's what you should
be focusing on and there's no again
there's no single defining a line
there's nothing that you just cross over
and then all of a sudden you become an
expert it takes time it takes obviously
experience which comes with time and it
takes a certain level of skill and
building actual projects that are useful
to you or other people okay that's
common answer this question thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
