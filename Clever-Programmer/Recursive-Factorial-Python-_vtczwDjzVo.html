talking about in this video is the
concept of factorials and the concept of
recursion so let's get started so I'm
going to first of all write the function
and implement it and only afterwards I'm
going to talk about it so let's say we
have some functions called factorial
takes in some number n okay if the
number is less than or great less than
or equal to one we return that number
otherwise we return the number times
factorial of the previous number okay
now let's just make sure this runs and
let's do five factorial of five should
give me 120 and you guys will see the
results at the bottom so let's give it a
run and I got 120 so let's talk about
how this recursive solution works so the
basic theory behind this is f of five
goes in and it goes hey is f of five so
basically factorial of 5 is that less
than or equal to one so it does not
match the code on line 2 and line three
it goes past if statement because it
doesn't match that condition and then
goes through the else and then it says
well I know what factorial of 5 is
that's just factorial that's just 5
times factorial of 4 so let's write that
down it goes I know what factorial of 5
is that's just factorial of 5 times
factorial of 4 ok but factorial of 4 is
another recursive call and it goes oh
yeah I know what factorial of 4 is
because now the call on line 9 which is
factorial of 5 it has to figure out what
factorial of 4 is in order to actually
compute this so continuing on factorial
of 4 goes yeah I know what F of 4 is
that's just and let's call it f here
just to be consistent hydrilla 4 goes
yeah I know that is just 4 times
factorial of 3 right n minus 1 that's 3
factorial of 3 goes yeah I know what
factorial of 3 is that is just 3 times f
of 2 or factorial of 2 factorial of 2
goes yup I know what that is that's just
factorial that's just 2 times factorial
of 1 and now something special happens
and this is a concept that gets pretty
much all programmers who are learning
about recursion anybody who is trying to
understand this concept so let's break
it down so now is when the unwinding is
how I like to call it begins okay so now
what happens is f of 2 figures out what
itself is and here's how because on line
12 if you can see we have F of 1 and F
of 1 when that function calls itself
factorial of 1 that goes back to the
definition of factorial and that goes
hey am i 1
in fact her and then and that matches
that if condition it goes yep that's
true and is 1 and then returns 1 so
factorial of 1 is able to figure itself
out because it has a base case so let me
go up top and write that down the top is
the base case and then this is the
recursive case ok that else statement so
that just goes I have figured out what
factorial of 2 is that's just 2 times 1
and that gives me back
so that actually evaluates to a real
number and then factorials 3 goes great
I was waiting on you factorial of 2
thanks for figuring out what 2 times
factorial of 1 is now you can give me
the information I needed
and what's information that factorial of
3 needs the information that factor of 3
needs is what factorial of 2 is so this
will basically be 3 times
well factorial of 2 return - so just be
3 times 2 and that returns 6 now we
continue on and we have factorial of 4
and going yep I was waiting on new
factorial of 3 3 thank you so much for
figuring out that piece of information
now can you please give that to me so we
get 4 times 6 and that is 24 and then
lastly our initial call that we made
which was waiting the entire time it
goes now I know at factorial of 4 is
which is 24 and so now I just have 5
times 24 and this is this returns 120 so
here answer is 120 and that's how we
were able to figure out what factorial
of 5 is I hope this helped you guys if
you guys liked the video please comment
like or subscribe and I will see you
guys in the next video thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
