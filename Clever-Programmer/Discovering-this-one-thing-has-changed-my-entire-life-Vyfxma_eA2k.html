is literally pumping out of my chest at
this point and I know I have to make
this phone call but I don't want to do
it I've just gotten this job today I
found out and I've gotten it at $50 an
hour and my mentor against everybody
else's advice has told me charge them
$100 an hour don't charge them 50 and I
remember my family going what are you
doing you're looking a gift horse in the
mouth your 20 year old Oakton Community
College student with a terrible GPA you
are lucky and you should accept this as
is and my mentor is telling me look
you're good and this is what you should
be charging as a software Python
developer freelancer and even though
this is your very first job this is
possible so again you can imagine I've
already gotten it $50 an hour full-time
and now I have to make this call and
tell them look I want $100 an hour and
literally palms are sweating I pick up
the phone call and I'm like listen I
know that we agreed to 50 but because of
the workload that's involved I'm gonna
have to go with $100 an hour because
this requires a lot of work
I'm gonna be doing some Python
consulting I'm your trusted advisor and
for everything that needs to be done
that's gonna be the rape and at the
other line he just hung up or he not
even hang up immediately but he goes
okay we're gonna have to look at our
budget and I'll give you a call back we
hung up I spent 24 hours and just agony
thinking about what is gonna happen am I
gonna get this job am I not gonna get
this job did I just throw everything
away this amazing opportunity and the
next day I come home from college I
haven't even told this to my parents yet
that I have done this I haven't told
this to my friends I've been told this
to anybody and the next day I seed my
phone and I see this text message and it
says it's a long message but it
ultimately says congratulations you've
got it and we're starting this Wednesday
that was the moment where for me
everything changed literally my whole
life changed because here I was willing
to work for free to do coding because I
loved being able to take something
that's in my head and bringing it out to
the real world bringing it out and
making it a reality and then everybody
else around me can use it okay so I
would do it for free
I wouldn't only do it for free I love it
so much that I would pay right I would
actually pay somebody to let me work on
a project like this and not only was I
not having to pay out of my own pocket
not only was it not just a free job but
I was gonna be getting paid to do this
so unbelievable moment the lesson that I
learned out of this is that if I didn't
have a mentor right this would not be
possible for me he was somebody who
helped me accelerate my progress by
years literally helped me cut my
lifetime and have something that would
have taken me 10 20 years to achieve
maybe five years he helped me get it way
faster of charge what I'm worth and
again
money is not only important because you
just want to have a pile of it and sit
on it because you don't only want to be
able to take care of yourself but those
around you okay
and my having that mentor was key for me
so in your life if you want to achieve
something and you want to get there look
for that mentor who can guide you in the
right direction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
