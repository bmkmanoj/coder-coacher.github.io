I talked about string slicing in this
video I'm going to talk about lists okay
lists of things and what the heck our
list lists are awesome however in the
last video I left you guys with a
question I said take this prot
take this right and parse it and
basically xbox 360 pull that out save it
in a variable like product pull this out
save it in a variable like price and
save this in a variable like condition
right so when you have your excel sheet
open it looks really nice it'll look
like this okay so I'm going to I'm in my
solution I'm going to do it in a
different way because if you try to use
it as index this is a solution so you
can pause the video think about how it
works that's how you'll pull the 150 and
using the same logic you'll pull new
however index is a very ugly method to
use for getting parsing the string what
I want to show you guys is this method
called find okay that's very nice method
so like let's say we take the data right
and I do data dot find and find it shows
you the bottom what it takes in as the
function it takes in the substring and
then it takes in optional arguments like
start and end so I'm going to say data
not find and I'll give it a substring
pipe what a substring means is that
that's something that exists in the
original string string okay so for
example um I have to give find the
function find or the method find I have
to give it something that exists within
this if I gave it something that doesn't
exist within it like banana it would say
negative one like I didn't find anything
but if I gave it a pipe you can see that
it finds a nine and another thing you
can give it is how you saw is you can
give it where to start from
okay
so I can say like for example start
looking after 10:00 or hold or look for
pipe but I want you to start at string 9
okay or I want you to start at string 10
all right and now it finds of pipe at
location 15 so if I do data and if you
count it up you'll see that this is the
pipe and it is an indeed location 15 if
I do data of 15 you'll see that it gives
you back that pipe right okay so by
getting that second pipe now you can get
the value in between the first pipe and
the second pipe by saying something like
start from finding the first pipe and
then go up to finding the second pipe
right so I can say finding or start from
or look for pipe and then start from 10
for example right and this gives you
this guy here and just to make sure we
don't include the pipe in the first one
we can just sister from plus one of that
okay so that gives you in between the
first and second pipe you get back 150
okay so the reason why I went even more
in-depth and strings even when the video
called lists is because a lot of what
you learn from strings is applicable to
lists okay so let's take a list and call
it groceries and I will have Apple and I
foreshadowed this for you guys a little
bit banana and you can also have
integers so usually you try to put the
same kind of thing in the list but sure
let's put 5 in there and 6 in there and
then oranges or something okay cool now
if I want to take this list and I want
to get the first element in the second
element if it was just a string right
like the reason why lists are useful is
because you can use it too
store multiple variables like for
example if you wanted to use variables
to store this gosh it would be a little
um it would be weird because you will
say groceries 0 is equal to Apple you
would say groceries of 1 or banana and
so then when you do groceries of 0 you
get back Apple and when you do groceries
of 1 you get back banana but let's make
it make that thing for you in a really
easy way okay so now if I do groceries
and if I do groceries of 0 I get back
apple ok and if I do groceries of 1 I
get back banana because Apple is in the
0th position bananas in the first
position this is in the second third
fourth position ok so grow let's make it
really nice for you imagine if you were
trying to store a data for a race so
like four of your friends ran really
fast and you want to record who came
first who came second so you can say
race is equal to like John came first
and then Bob came second and then you
know whatever like Timothy came in third
Timothy is pretty slow so we can say
like okay who came in first we can ask
that question we get back John we can
say who came in second we get back Bob
and I can say who came in third or I can
say who came in last like negative one
gets you the last element and this
answers all my questions so just like
how we were able to slice strings we're
able to slice lists okay but notice this
is nicer for elements so for example
Xbox 360 and all this stuff I'll show
you guys a really cool trick you
would list to break that up into pieces
so like for example if I gave you a
string like this right what is going on
notice that there are a lot of spaces in
between right let's just replace those
spaces just so it's a bit more visual
let's replace those spaces with that and
let's say we want to get the what part
separately is part separately going part
separately and on part separately
without having any of the dashes in the
middle there's a method we can use
called dot split okay and we can pass to
dot split what we want to split by so I
can say something like this I want to
split by the dashes okay so check it out
now I got what is going on right this is
a list of strings now the data
complexity is getting a little bit
higher right it's a list containing
strings inside of it okay so I can call
this like you know greeting or something
doesn't matter and if I do greeting I
can say what's the first word of
greeting what's the second one word oops
greeting right what's the second word
and for example I can say what's the
last word and it'll give me what is
going on on being the last word right
now I can also do string slicing just
like how I can doing strings so I have
start I have stopped and I have step so
if I take the race one again I can say
go from zero all the way to the end I
can say the same way like this this is
like optional right zero starts from
zero and it ends at zero or ends at the
last one by default if I want to get
from John to Bob I can say like give me
the first to race like first two
contestants of the race and they'll get
me John and Bob or I'll say give me
everybody but the last guy so I can ask
that question to my list just like that
okay now to answer your guys's question
of how to reverse the string
it's the same way you can reverse the
list as well so let me show you guys
there are a couple of different ways but
I'm going to show you guys the nicest
the fanciest way okay
so let's take this list and I want to
step by or sorry I want to start at the
default which is zero okay I don't have
to write it zero but I'll just write it
for you guys I want to go all the way to
the end and I don't have to write this
okay so I'll just leave it blank here
and for the last part first step instead
of saying step by one which will just
give me the whole thing and it's the or
cest
instead of saying give me every other
element so like give me John and then
Timothy I will say step by negative one
so check this out let's remove this
right and let's remove that guy and
let's do that and you will see how it
steps right it just reversed
the list if we have the the same string
like let's say we have data I can do the
same way and reverse everything in data
so you can see Xbox 360 and new and 150
are all written backwards okay so that's
how you would like reverse something now
I want to talk about split again and I
want to talk about one very important
method called append for a list one of
the most commonly used things that any
programmer does in any language okay
so split is like Java op sees everybody
uses that it's might not you call split
and then same thing in Python everybody
uses split and the next method I'm about
to show you a pen very common for all
the games you make for everything that
you do it's going to be like one of the
most common things you especially a pen
so pay attention so I'm going to show
you the method called the split okay so
I've shown you a little bit of that
already so let's say I take data and I
want to break it up right product price
condition very easy way to do it very
easy way to do it split so let's do data
dot split and I want to say split by
pipe boom look at that how nice is that
right
it automatically just split it by that
and you can store that in details or
something and now if I do details of
zero right and I can set that equal to
product' so now if I do product I get
that I can say price is equal to details
of one and I can say condition is equal
to details of - okay price condition
boom okay so that was like some really
nice ways to get this done in the next
video I will talk about app end so stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
