the live stream right now so doesn't my
second live stream which is really cool
but yesterday I remember we got to the
tournament the chess tournament well we
didn't actually get to the actual
location we just got here for the
tournament I mean so we stayed at a
hotel and today we're actually gonna be
going in hi to Molly hi angel hi Darth
Vader Rajesh
how are you doing Siddharth right and
then Jenks yeah hi i shun done deep hyah
meat so Wow you guys are coming in and
fairly quickly so today I'm actually at
the event this is going to be the chess
state championships I am again coaching
the high school chess team and that's
what I'm here for so I'm gonna start
walking around a little bit we have a
lot of people here today
so you can see what's going on I'm gonna
take you guys actually inside and give
you a sneak peek hi - Bruce hi hello
from the bay hi nice to see you I'm
gonna actually take you guys inside and
show you what the room looks like there
are a ton of people in there they're our
highest de venecia I didn't want to miss
next live video perfect there are gonna
be about a thousand over thousands of
people in that room that I'm gonna show
you they're all high school students
playing at the state chess championships
but it is dead quiet there's not a
single sound it's very quiet so when I
go in there I won't be able to comment
it okay and I apologize about that I
won't be able to talk I'm not allowed to
talk I actually
oops you know I am the coach of the
North High School chess team so I
actually I definitely can't talk because
then they're gonna actually penalize the
team so how it works is that eight of
our students from now north are
reversing against eight other students
so it's like our team versus another
team and there are 149 teams in there
playing and then if there are five total
rounds and if they win then we go on to
the next round okay so I'm gonna show
you guys inside but I cannot talk
right now but we are going upstairs I'm
taking you guys upstairs with me
we're gonna be actually going into the
event
check it out
it's a pretty cool place I think it's
just a random car in here which is kind
of weird I used to play here I used to
be actually
I so we're taking a break from coding
right this is a coding channel it was
about programming but I can't be doing
that right now so I decided I should
still make a video for you guys okay
so lots of stuff going on here we're
getting closer to the room okay we're
getting closer to the room we're almost
there
all right thank you yeah
that's Hardeen
okay
that was a little too much silence so
we're gonna get out of there
we're gonna go back downstairs so
basically that was the team that I was
recording was actually my team announced
North High School team and they were
there were all the ones in the purple
jackets and so far everybody's game
looked pretty even to me it looked like
nobody was losing on her team but again
I have to you guys have to know like
these games are crazy long for example
in chess you can win by checkmate or
running out of time or making somebody
else run out of time so their time on
each side is like 2 hours so that's a
four hour long game for each kit and
then I think they get an extra hour on
top of that so these games can get very
long but they're pretty smart so yeah
though they'll play through it and then
figure it out
I'm gonna go get some dippin dot ice
cream
what happened
OOP bad connections
bad connection
hi
okay so for me it says bad connection oh
um the name of this place I don't really
know but I'm in Peoria so if you look up
IHS a Peoria Chess Championships that's
where I am at
it keeps saying bad connection so I'm
worried if it will disconnect I really
hope it doesn't like last time for some
reason on my phone I can't see your
guys's like messages I wish I could see
that that would be cool
cause you never thought to work in
Google oh they're becoming so ready to
try it
no never really thought about okay so I
wanted to do it right when I was
studying and becoming really good in
coding everyday like 20 hours and then I
would study all these algorithms data
structures so I could actually apply but
then in the end I ended up changing my
mind I decided not to pursue the route
of working for somebody I never really
worked for somebody I always worked with
clients that I would find on my own did
independent consulting generally was a
lot of like independent contractor work
that I've always been interested in
doing and then I started building my own
businesses off of that so I decided you
know to go kind of entrepreneurial route
and you know I started my chest company
called chest tastic so I was also doing
some software development web
development for that as well building
things on my own so yeah I had a dream
of working in Google I thought that
would have been cool then changed my
mind but definitely if you guys want to
do it definitely those are good places
to join but always remember you know
people always bring it down to Google or
Dropbox those are not the only two
places to work those are not the only
places I'll give you the most money so
just remember that
really go somewhere where you enjoy and
it works out for you they're not only a
few companies they're a bajillion people
that need your help with software
development and web development and
whatever else right app development
don't live telecast just leave
ouch yeah well I kind of enjoy it but
I'll be around today I'm gonna be doing
some chest stuff but later on it's gonna
get into more coding we might even build
some stuff together but yeah I wanted to
kind of check in and talk with you guys
now there are a lot of people looking at
me like I'm crazy so I'm actually gonna
get going in a second and then I'm
probably gonna do this again hype you sh
nice to meet you
okay yeah I'm gonna do that that's a
good idea so I'm I am logging the events
if you're on my snapchat you'll see a
lot of it and I will put it on for you
guys afterwards okay I'll edit it and
I'll put it on okay guys I gotta go I'm
the coach I got to help out the team so
I'm gonna cut it off here and I'll talk
to you guys later okay guys thanks for
coming in I'll catch you later bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
