talk about how a pend works in a list
because the last video got a little bit
long but for those of you who want their
minds blown I want to even give you a
better solution for the problem with the
whole splitting thing and then storing
as a product price and condition so
remember we had data Xbox 360 product
150 price condition new there's even an
easier way to do it I can say product I
can save comma price and I can say
condition and check this magic out and
I'm going to say data dot split that by
pipe and boom we're done so now product
is the first element from that list
right if I show you data that split by
pipe what you get is first element
second element third element so the
first element maps to this product right
this product right there price ends up
mapping itself to 150 condition ends up
mapping itself to new so go check it out
it's also kind of known as the concept
of tuple unpacking really really
advanced concept we're not going to get
to it till maybe an intermediate or
advanced course but um yeah just
something a little fun to blow your mind
and look at how efficient Python lets
you do things right efficiently so
really simple way but hopefully this
shows you the power of how you can
combine lists with the whole idea of
slicing and all that now one of the most
common things I want to show you is this
whole thing called dot append okay it's
a method that you can use on a list very
common method and this is one of the
reasons why lists are a lot more useful
than strings or any other thing okay oh
let me just be clear it's not that
strings are not useful or lists are more
useful but the reason why I lists are so
awesome is because of that that's what
makes them unique okay so let me give
you some lists with
let's give you racers or let's do
something simple let's do numbers okay
now there's a really easy way to grow
this list so I want to keep adding some
numbers to this list well how do I do
that what if I want to add some number
to this list I know how to access each
of these numbers I know how to slice
each of these numbers and get a range I
know how to step and slice and get
ranges at the same time I know how to
reverse the list well what if I want to
add more things into the list or change
existing things in the list well to add
things in the list we use dot append
okay append meaning add something to the
end
hence append prepend to add something to
the beginning so we want to add
something right over here in front of
the five so let me do it six and if I
show you numbers and now you have a
bigger list let's say I wanted to add
another thing I'll just say a pencil and
now if I show you numbers now the
numbers has grown bigger you got seven
all right so we're using this new app
that you're creating where once your
friends raced you put them in the list
but let's say more of your friends get
excited they're like wow this app is
amazing we want to race to so you can
put us in there we were like I already
don't list only takes in three people
well a pen lets you add in more people
right so you store that data you keep it
there and then you use a pen to add more
of your friends into the list
what's also nicer is you can use a loop
to add things into the list okay so for
example I can say for I in range 100 if
I say print I well what is that going to
do it's going to go all the way and
print up to 100 okay so I'm going to
stop this right here but you get the
point
it's basically range right what is range
just to show you range of 10 that's
effectively just a list 10 okay and then
we kind of go through it and we print
out each of those numbers I'm going to
get more into loops in the later video
but just this is just to give you guys a
little bit of an idea of how we use
lists
so for example every time I sew first
time I zero then I is one that I is to
then is three and we keep doing that
right so what can I say I can say
because effectively right since this is
a list now I can explain to you guys a
little bit more about how loops
since range is really just a list right
I'm calling lists on it because in
Python 3 to hide it from you and you'll
learn why later but if I call lists on
it shows me what range 10 looks like and
range 10 happens to just be a list and
list is what allows you to make that for
loop okay that you've been making while
you when you were creating your original
turtle games so what happens is that the
first time going through this list right
let's say let's just make a smaller list
here for now when we're going through
the loop I is 0 the first time and then
we call the print function right here
right so I is 0 the first time and then
we print 0 then I is 1 because it's the
second element from the list and so then
we print one out to the screen then I is
2 and then you get 2 here and then we
print out two at the bottom okay so
that's how loop runs right then dented
code keeps running over and over again
so that's really what allows you to do a
loop it's actually a secret list in the
background and so that's why you go from
0 to 100 here right now if I wanted to
take that list that I had at the top
called numbers and keep adding a lot of
numbers to it say up to 30 instead of
keep having to manually do it well
here's a nice way to do it I can say if
Ryan range
let's see 14 or let's say our I want to
start my range okay
so if I just showed you you can also
give a start and a stop to range so
let's say I want to start my range from
8 and go up to but not including 20 or
21 so I go from 8 to 20 right so these
are the numbers I want to add ok so
let's do 4 number in range 8 and 21 and
I'm not using I am using the variable
number just so you guys know that you
can't you don't have to use you know I
is not some magical built-in thing that
you have to use use a variable that
makes more sense in this case since I'm
going through looping and it's really
numbers and now you guys know that I
turns into a number it just makes more
sense to call it a number so then you're
like oh yeah
this will just be 8 the first time then
it'll be 9 then it'll be 10 then it'll
be 11 and then it'll be 12 right so
let's go back so let's just replace this
with just number and then let's say
numbers dot append and to the numbers
list I want to keep appending each
number okay so the first time I'm going
to append number is going to be 8 so
then I'm going to append 8 and so it's
going to add 8 to my numbers list then
numbers number is going to be 9 and then
it's going to append 9 here the number
is going to be 10 is going to append a
10 ok so let's do it like this let's
replace this bad boy with number let's
run it let's take a look at our list and
voila
you see it goes from 1 and all the way
to 20 ok and if these were your friends
and we wanted to see you know in the
reverse order
like from losers to winner's instead of
winners losers in a race I would be able
to do simply this trick which says start
by default stop by default and then step
by negative one so that answers that
question
right okay cool so a lot of stuff but
hopefully it's making sense and
hopefully lists are making more sense
and upend is making more sense right
upend is one of the most useful things
so I want you to remember append
and we'll come back to it and we'll
probably build more things with it okay
I'll have a project for you guys as well
or you're going to get to practice it
more for now come up with something cool
whatever silly idea or a fun idea that
you have coat it up something simple
post it in the comments below in the
YouTube one or my website here okay
clever programmer calm either way that's
fine all right guys I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
