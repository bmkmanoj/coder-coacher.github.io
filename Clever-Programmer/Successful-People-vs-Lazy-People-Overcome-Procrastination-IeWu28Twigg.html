is Kazi from clever programmer common in
this video I want to talk about one of
the most important key characteristics
between successful people and people or
lazy people so in this video I'm going
to talk about this and without any
further ado let's jump right into it
okay so one thing that I kind of want to
drill down and this is one of those
things that you will be able to take
away right from this video and actually
start applying it in your life is this
most people consume content and we're
really good at consuming it you know we
will sit there and watch Game of Thrones
we will watch house of cards we will
watch online tutorials we'll go to
websites like stackoverflow.com to get
our programming questions answered or we
will scour the internet we'll be on
Reddit we'll go to YouTube watch videos
but you'll but then you'll start to
realize a pattern you'll like of you'll
enjoy a video on YouTube but you won't
find yourself actually hitting the
thumbs up button you'll want you'll
you'll see an answer on reddit but you
won't see yourself adding a comment and
adding to that discussion you will see a
video or show on Netflix or whatever but
you won't ever see yourself as part of
the discussion so yeah you will see us
you know we will do a lot of things that
we enjoy but we won't actually be
collaborating with the community and
adding something of value to the world
right now successful people on the other
hand will add value to the world will
add value to the community so one of the
main things that I would want you to
focus on is stop just sitting there and
consuming things because you won't learn
things as well everything that is that
you pick up those habits won't be a part
of your lifestyle those will just be
something that's a very passive but when
you teach this to others or it's one of
those things that you collaborate with
the community in right then it's
something that will be ingrained in your
head so here's what I mean let's say
that you are learning something new why
to blog about it or why not write about
it and share it with your friends even
if you don't want to share it online if
you are picking up new skills or there
are new things that you have coming in
your head you know put it in a forum on
a website like stackoverflow.com on a
website like Reddit comm collaborate
with the community the next time you see
something that is thought-provoking you
know put it leave a comment on it and I
don't care if it's for my video even if
it's something that you see on a website
like github comm or again Stack Overflow
or reddit you know those are the ones
I'm I keep using because those are the
ones that are coming to my head but
start with small acts of contributing
and creating and when you are creating
things you're becoming that top 1% who
is actually taking part in this world
whereas the other 99% merely consume it
so even one of the key things that had
that help this channel grow is in the
store it wasn't this awesome channel
with all of you guys there right it was
just me and what the heck do I talk
about I was in like professional content
creator and all the other stuff all I
did was I learned about factorials and I
was like cool I'm gonna make a video
about it and share with the world I
learned about some random stuff I wrote
a blog about it anything that I was kind
of learning about you know or even when
I was in college any new thing that I
learned or thought could provide value
to the world all I did was make a video
on it so I didn't have to go all have to
like be a professional content publisher
just like let me just document what's
going on in my life and maybe I can help
other people and as long as I got one
comment or two views or one like that
was enough for me because that told me
that somebody in some part of the world
was finding this valuable now let me
give you some other big giant benefits
that come from this so let's say that
you are learning computer programming
right now you're a complete beginner
what would be the benefits if you
started writing about your journey 1
even if your
your complete beginner right because
sometimes we worry or we have to be an
expert to write about it keep in mind I
wasn't an expert when I was writing
about these things
so let's talk about some of the benefits
let's say you start writing a blog right
or you start writing about this one of
the things that's going to happen is
you're going to become damn good at the
subject because you're going to have to
crystallize your thoughts to actually
write it and then it's edge there
forever so you can actually refer back
to it okay one for you very beneficial
another benefit if you go to apply to a
job you can show them your resume which
is cool you can show them your
curriculum vitae you know your CV that's
cool you can do an interview with them
that's cool but hey how about check out
my blog or even better yet how about if
they say oh we've checked out your blog
so that brings me to the third benefit
of it which is people can find you
people can recognize you and find you
and be like hey I want to work with you
you don't even actually have to go out
and get work people will come to you
right they can come to you and in the
other scenario where they don't find you
at least it gives you something very
powerful that when you show the people
it gives you that giant edge over
everybody else right this is one of the
things I want to talk about unfair
advantages not unethical advantages but
unfair advantages meaning that they give
you a boost in life that other people
miss out on right so you want to get as
many unfair advantages that you can get
but make sure that they're ethical
obviously you know one of the other
unfair advantages is waking up early but
that's for another video in this video
just want to talk about get in the habit
of creating now I also want to show you
one of the students that clever
programmer okay you see my channel you
guys could go back to my older videos
and see exactly what I was doing but I
want to give you an example of somebody
else
so this is one of the students that
clever programmer and I've actually been
even working with him one on one a
little bit but all like all of this
stuff that I'm going to be showing you
he pretty much did on his own okay so
you can check this out his name is
Dennis Dennis Murphy and it's really
cool what he's doing so for it
okay we work together one-on-one and we
built a basic flash game okay and I
barely I showed him just a few things
about how flask works in Python then he
went ahead and instead of just sitting
there and watching tutorials all day
right which is again what unfortunately
most of us will do he went in there and
he started building things okay so this
didn't just happen in one day but you
can see he put together this full
website from you know terms from pretty
much scratch using a framework called
flask using HTML and then using I
believe bootstrap and some one of the
themes from bootstrap but all the
technicality aside he is a beginner in
Python he's getting better through just
working at it but making sure that he is
actually producing things and making
things so this is one of the prime
examples of you actually working to
produce content rather than just taking
it okay so you again all he did was he
built this website and for the idea all
he's like okay this is just going to be
my you know my portfolio essentially so
he built a portfolio he says he's a
wordpress developer a Python developer
and he built this using flask framework
cool now another cool thing that I want
to show you is that all throughout his
journey right you can see he's just been
blogging about it so focus on social
media write a blog Python apps behaving
badly in flask so now he's so there's a
there's a blog post about Python suspend
the filters I have no idea what
the hell that's about but sounds pretty
cool right he had an idea and he wrote a
blog post about it a third way of living
and then again you have deploy flask app
to Heroku and this is really cool and I
think a lot of you can actually benefit
from it
especially if you've you're in my old P
course and you watched my flask video if
you click on that blog post he talked
about how he published that flask app
you know
so if nothing he might be able to get a
junior developer job faster than most
other people simply because he's writing
up about it and those who hired him can
see his passion for and they're like
this person is trainable and they can
look at his consistency of him creating
things and he doesn't just sit there and
consume yeah and then also then he went
ahead on medium.com and he's been
blogging and he started recently I kind
of pushed him to you know start medium
but then I'm not pushing him anymore and
he's doing it on his own he's
consistently been blogging even on
medium.com you can do the same things
doesn't take rocket science you don't
need a degree you don't need crazy
levels of experience and you don't need
to be an expert in any of this
you can literally blog or write about or
make a video about what you're currently
learning and maybe it'll resonate with
somebody else maybe it will get you a
higher paying job maybe it will make
that convincing of you getting a job
easier maybe people will recognize you
and maybe like clever programmer you
might actually be able to build your own
business right and get a following of
people who find what you're doing
helpful so get out of the habit of just
consuming start getting in the habit of
creating and start small you can start
by leaving comments in places and if you
think something is bad dislike it
instead of just walking away if you
think something's good like it and again
I'm not talking about my YouTube videos
which but you can give it a like that
would be awesome
but I am talking about literally if
you're on a post you're on a forum you
are like on a random website and you
read something you know just get out of
that weird cycle of not doing anything
I'll give you an example on github um
it's a website for developers made by
developers and I was stuck in this
problem for one problem for a long time
so I went on github.com and I went and
deep into this one forum and like thirty
threads down or whatever right 30 pages
this thread I still didn't find I still
didn't find a solution there but finally
I was able to figure it out so what I
did is I went back to that thread wrote
exactly how I found my solution and then
you know I kind of left it I'm like
whatever I'm just going to write down
how I found it maybe he'll help somebody
else a few months later you know I got
people who were thanking me they're like
thank you Rafa Kazi that worked
thank you this worked and here's the
cool part two years later I got stuck
when I was doing Python development in
the same problem but I had forgotten
about the solution or anything I went
back on github.com went to this thread
was 30 pages deep in that thread just
going bashing my head spent like five
hours under figure up couldn't figure it
out went and I saw some people were
saying thanks thanks and I'm like oh so
maybe somebody found a solution that's
why people are thinking let me go to the
person that they're thinking and guess
who that person was it was me and I
basically solved my problem two years
before and it helped cause II from the
future so it can even help you right if
not for anybody else but it's cool to
help other people along with helping
yourself alright so that's the message
for this video stop consuming start
creating that's one of the key
differences between people who end up
becoming successful versus the people
who stay where they are
again take control thank you for
watching and as always I love you so
much and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
