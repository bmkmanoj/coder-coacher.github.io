makes one
million dollars hey guys what is up
this is konzi from clever programmer
calm and you are watching interview
questions so today we decided to go down
to a mall and ask a bunch of people what
they think computer programming is and
first I want you to take a look at their
responses and afterwards we're going to
go on to actually answer and address
most of these questions starting with
the most important question what is
computer programming we are here at
Woodfield Mall and we're gonna take you
on the ride with us so let's let's keep
going alright
hey everyone my name is Tenzin from
developer Tintin calm do you guys know
what computer programming is it's where
you put all the brains inside the box I
mean I don't know exactly we like the
whole software and stuff is done by
coding so numbers and basically the
engineer computer programmer makes codes
for different computer programs to
operate systems on a computer how do
things work like making something work
function correctly essentially at it's
very core it's simply a way to digitize
your ideas this idea can be related to a
field in biology related to a medical
field I want to go into the medical
field even in a lot of biology research
they can sometimes use computer
programming an engineering field or it
could be related to whatever the heck
you want it to be related to I want to
teach digital media so there's probably
some coding involved in that ah probably
video game design sounds like a lot of
coding there are no lot yeah definitely
watch now let's talk about why it might
be useful to you imagine you were trying
to build a video game and you wanted to
put it on an interactive website using
programming you could build your very
own game that nobody has built in the
very specific way that you want it built
and you could put it on your very own
interactive fun website now let's talk
about maybe more practical ways for some
of you people who are like I want to
make that money right business
intelligence it helps you make better
and more informed decisions not just
based on your intuition
sometimes intuitions are good but you
need it backed up by evidence and data
which programming will allow you to do
and the field of data science and data
analytics is all based on computer
programming it helps you take a lot of
these features that you can't process
all at once and let's the computer
decide for you what decisions to make
how powerful is that and you can
generate Morley
and more money for your business but
Kazi why do I need to have myself learn
how to program why can't I just have
anybody else digitize my idea for me
imagine Mark Zuckerberg the idea the
specific idea that Mark Zuckerberg had a
lot of other people had similar ideas
how to create social media right but his
idea was the key so a lot of you folks
who have these brilliant ideas you want
to be able to execute them so yes you
can hire somebody to do it for you but I
promise you it's not going to be as good
as if you did it yourself if those
weren't reasons enough for you let's
talk about instant scalability any idea
that you digitize them that you create
on your own you can scale it infinitely
imagine you create an app that solves
some kind of problem maybe it's a
Fitness related issue or a finance
related issue like a budgeting app or
like a working out app all of a sudden
with a click of a button thousands and
millions of people are having that
problem solved because they're able to
download your app or download or go on
your website and use what you've created
what other medium allows you to scale at
that level and so fast they're not many
that I can think of like when you think
of a computer programmer what did it
look like to you and what do you imagine
in your mind I'm an overly smart person
dressed in skinny jeans and a tight
button-up shirt okay
probably just an average guy from wears
glasses okay like this guy like that guy
okay yes okay pretty like shirt
well-dressed like skinny pants and with
some dress shoes on brown dress right
right right I just imagine like yeah
like a nerdy guy like at a computer just
like typing no that's funny my husband I
without computer business but he just
wears like a polo shirt
nice shorts or pants I met a lot of
computer programmers so they're actually
not close to stereotypes at all like bit
they were like nice all right now let's
talk about the job market okay so so far
you've been following me along you're
like this is great Kazi I want to do
this whatever this very thing is so let
me give you a little bit about what kind
of jobs you can get the job market for
computer programmer
looks pretty fantastic now don't get me
confused by thinking that it's instantly
easy to become a programmer that's not i
personally myself have failed a
tremendous amount of times you guys
while i was trying to become a computer
programmer and even to this day i fail
over and over again anything that has a
true value you know from personal
experience that it's hard
there are 1.4 million job openings for
computer programming every single year
however the number of college computer
science graduates is only 400,000 which
means money money for you how does it
translate to that there's a 1 million
people per year window open just for you
compared to all other jobs or most other
jobs the job of software technology is
growing at a 17 percent rate every
single year okay so the growth the
projected outlook all up to 20 2024 is
only growing now let's talk about the
money
you can make from computer programming
what do you think computer programmers
make annually okay I know that women
make a lot more money in the field
because they're like they don't have a
lot of women in the field right now so
I'd say maybe like 17
like starting me like 60
so if you're a girl you know what you
need to start doing a 80,000 probably
like 72
ninety thousand well a lot it's a really
good skill to have I'm guessing like
around fifty thousand maybe more fifty
thousand dollars ninety two very
specific so at this point you're like oh
yeah I'm excited so let's talk about it
2015 statistics show that the average
median salary is one hundred thousand
and four hundred and ninety dollars that
is a pretty good median salary right now
many jobs might start off with that
glassdoor.com that say if you look at a
specific area like Chicago the median
salary might be eighty five thousand
dollars give or take now why is the
average wider range so different it
depends on where you live if you live in
the Silicon Valley the heart of
technology you are going to be getting
paid more for the jobs most of the times
if you're living in other places like
Chicago it might be a little bit less
than the top you know the hundred
thousand dollars that you could
potentially be making why you might
actually really enjoy your job more than
just the money is the amount of impact
that you're making most of the
programmers are able to work either from
their office or remotely
this way this means you get to spend
more time with your family you get to
spend more time with your friends so if
you're working with let's a company like
Microsoft you're affecting an influence
in the lives of millions
so your role in the society is very
important and as one of my really smart
friends once said your rewards in life
are exactly proportional no less and no
more than the contribution you make in
your society did you let that sink in
good because programming allows you to
make a tremendous amount of contribution
to the society simply because it lets
you scale instantly so that great
amazing idea that you had yeah now
everybody is using it and it's changing
your lives okay guys so at this point I
think that hopefully this videos blown
your brains to bits and you're like this
is fantastic what can I do to get
started you're looking for that sign up
button for success unfortunately I don't
have a sign up button for success but I
do have a button to subscribe so click
that stay tuned for my videos because
not only will I make videos based on
entertainment and how fun programming is
but a lot of them are based on tutorials
so watching these tutorials you yourself
can learn how to computer how to program
and how to get started in it and if
you're worried and you're not ready to
make that dip into majoring in computer
science and paying a heck of a lot of
money for something that you can maybe
learn on your own or at least get your
feet wet and see what it's about
check out my tutorials if you if you
don't like it or just start watching the
video and leave the channel it's as
simple as that right but if you do like
it stay by watch more videos you're
welcome to be here it's me casa su casa
right my house is your house as they say
and span
anyways it's been really exciting guys
