is Kazi from clever programmer calm and
in this video I want to talk about where
do you go and find clients so without
any further ado let's jump right in
okay so I get this a lot Kazi where do I
go and find good clients well it's just
like if I could give you relationship
advice I can tell you just going like
match.com or something and find somebody
and just like that for freelancing I can
tell you going upward comment find
somebody so there you go but it's really
not about going out and randomly finding
these people right if you had to find
somebody the love of your life a lot of
you guys would probably do that in real
life without looking up online and it
doesn't just happen magically happens
when you have that mind shift that
changes for example what's a really good
way to attract a ton of negative people
be negative you agree what is a really
good way to attract a lot of
high-performing excellent and motivated
driven people be motivated be driven be
excellent right so if you want to
attract premium clients good clients
what's the first step that you might
need to take you might yourself need to
become a good client a premium client
imagine the time that somebody was
working under you whether it was like
they were doing some painting in your
house for you they were fixing your tire
for you we've all had people who've
worked for us how are you to them were
you nickel and diming them every step of
the way were you giving them the benefit
of the doubt in different situations
were you being nice to them were you
like even having a conversation with
them and treating them like they were
human beings not just like if you're
just painting this okay go ahead you do
this I'm going to go in another room
like where you actually did you have a
conversation with them to talk with them
right first of all define what that
premium client will do for you so in
your head think about if I had a great
client they wouldn't even question about
paying me my price right one of the
things another one of the things that
could be important is I would have a
great time with them it wouldn't feel
like I always need to prove something to
them we would have a good time number
three I would be challenged I might be
being pushed to my limits but what we're
doing the projects that were working on
now reverse engineer that first focus on
becoming a good client for people it
might mean you hiring other people - I
don't know tutor you you can hire
somebody to tutor you for like $7 an
hour and let's say art whatever it is
that you're currently doing right but
start becoming a more premium client
with them right if your budget doesn't
fit somebody at a higher paying level
and once you can start to do that you're
developing something very special which
is you yourself are turning into that
ideal client that you want to be and now
what's going to happen you're going to
start attracting those types of clients
I'm going to attract people think that
you're going to be like this magnet
you're going to be sitting in this one
place and all of these amazing keyboards
are going to be falling in your lap that
doesn't happen but what will happen is
that you'll know what to see in those
people before you invest your time with
them right it won't be somebody just
really needs your help and you help them
and they never had the money to pay you
so you're the one getting the short end
the end of the stick here for example
but if you turn into that great client
for other people now when you go looking
for other clients you'll identify those
key factors because you yourself are
that person what are you good at in life
I am good at chess sometimes I can see a
person in their face and tell how good
they would be at chess or just talk with
them a little bit and be able to
determine how good they would be at
chess or played just just for a little
bit if I play chess with number five
seconds or just hear a few words even
that I can detect what their ability is
the same thing for computer programming
so when I'm hiring people working with
people it's very easy for me to figure
out whether this person is going to be
the right fit for the company or not in
your case the same scenario if you want
those things you got to be that thing
makes it a heck of a lot easier to find
those things okay so there's no one hub
these clients are just sitting swimming
and you just go there and just grab them
by the hands you should ask yourself how
do I become a premium client and then
you can start attracting them so whether
it's for Python software development you
want to be a consultant you want to get
these clients or whether it is for
something completely different you want
to work as a web developer in JavaScript
same rules apply for you so this is
something that's applicable throughout
different industries even different
programming languages okay it's kind of
like a universal rule understand people
that said guys that's it for this video
thank you as always so much for watching
I love your faces off and I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
