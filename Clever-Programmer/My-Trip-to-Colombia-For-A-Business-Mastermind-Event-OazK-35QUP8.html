you guys have any suggestions for where
we should go
let us know we up until this point I was
recording the vlog only to realize that
there was no audio no it's kind of sad
but now the audio should be there the
language barrier has been a problem one
of the funny things that kind of
happened was we ate it up a PHA
so they came and gave us a check and so
we paid and it was like 94 thousand and
I was like wow that's crazy but like our
rights let's go explore the city and see
what's going on around us
lots of people the air is much fresher
here I gotta say it feels very clean the
u.s. the air doesn't feel this natural
alright so these guys dance right over
here every time the light turns red
every red light you got an entertainer
and that's how these guys to earn their
living
hey guys what is up how's it going this

put the name of it here yeah I
definitely come here just like the air
in Colombia in this place it's like
fresh and really amazing like super
refreshing when I'm in California
honestly doesn't really feel like that
it's like there's a lot of light
pollution and pollution in general and
you don't have a lot of nature whereas
here there's a lot of natural stuff
check out what this thing is guys you
know it's a slide

three two
hola mi amigo hola como esta as view as
muy bonito what's your name her name is
Jessica she's part of this group now we
have a group of how many people do we
have now that stay there seven hey Jesse
okay so for some reason we didn't think
our trip was adventurous enough so we
decided to climb this incredibly giant
huge awesome and epic mount we're going
up there that's gonna be Jenny you ready
to go up there yeah she's ready she's
excited Billy you ready to go up there
ready
nice yeah this is a pas de pay or guada
pay this is a Hamilton and he's the one
who helps us around see navigate in this
place find new places otherwise we'd be
totally lost
he's like the Chuck Norris oh I see my
friend up there
wow he's really high Wow
see it's beautiful
250
Wow that one I made it to the top of
this mountain as you can see very very
tired
there's about 650 steps there's a lot of
fun we came out pretty fast let me show
you guys around so this is where we are
pretty high up okay guys we are going to
be traveling on a private yacht one of
these also known as a boat
we have Hamilton with us that's good
this is a Pablo Escobar's house this is
one of us not mentioned and actually
we're staying at a Pablo Escobar's
mansion of all right now
okay so we saw really cool stuff on that
boat right we saw Pablo Escobar's bombed
homes - Hamish Rodriguez which it was a
soccer player Lum bein player one of my
favorite players and now we're actually
headed off to the jungle on a really
dangerous hiking trip who are they
actually had a sign a waiver for you
know if something happens to us cuz they
told us they're snakes vipers that'll
bite you and rot your flesh and also
snakes they'll paralyze you for 72 hours
being us we thought it was gonna be fun
and it wouldn't make for a cool vlog and
so we went
so okay some of the footage was lost
some of the audio was missing we
regardless we had an epic trip a really
amazing journey to Columbia Mary Mary
Jean is how they say it and what we
ended up finding out was this is not a
city where they're drug cartels in every
corner a collie cartel is gonna kill you
Pablo Escobar's men are gonna come out
of somewhere and we definitely didn't
even see anybody dealing with drugs this
was what we saw was an amazing place all
of those other things were just
stereotypes was a beautiful place with
loving people
incredible coffee I'm gonna miss their
coffee
it had malls it was very developed we
got to stay at epic hotels for actually
pretty cheap price as well and get a
great time learn Spanish and we'll
definitely go there again the jungles
and the mountains over some of the most
beautiful breathtaking scenery sites
that we've seen in our entire life and
this is a place that I'm gonna be going
to in a month or two and I would
definitely like to go there this time
for a much much longer time so in
conclusion I urge you guys to go to
Colombia Marion and check it out for
yourself and I just urge you to travel
and explore your possibilities because
look when you look around the world is a
huge place and just being trapped in
Europe in a little land you don't want
to be part of that statistic where you
live and die within a you know 300 mile
radius of where you were born so don't
be a statistic go out and explore more
and like one of the most hated youtubers
currently says life's not short you just
got to do more I agree with them his
name is Logan Paul so do more and enjoy
your life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
