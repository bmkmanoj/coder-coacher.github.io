bit about functions with their arguments
and also a little bit about functions
with multiple arguments this naturally
leads us to the next thing what if I
want to make that one square but I want
to make it multiple times sure I can
copy it and paste this line and paste it
again right and then paste it again
so on and so forth so for example let's
try having it paste it twice I'm going
to remove these comments here and just
so you remember this 50 goes in for the
length it replaces every part of the
length of 50 this 90 goes for the angle
it replaces every angle with 90 that's
how it works
okay so let's go back real quick and
simply run this now okay so I'm going to
hit the shortcut key to run it and you
can see I said draw two squares and it
did yeah but here is the concept here's
the most amazing concept in programming
which is the concept of doing things
over and over again
also known as loops so if I said I want
you to do ten push-ups that's like a
loop okay and every time you do a
push-up I count 1 2 3 4 and then once
you hit 10 I stop automatically ok so a
way to say that here is you can say for
push-up in range 10 so for each push-up
for 10 times like do this and just push
up part I can call it whatever I want I
can call it this I can call it I will
just keep it simple and leave it at one
letter I and what we're going to do is
this part all this part says is run
something 10 times ok that's what that
part essentially says if I run that code
on the left hand side if I show you what
a range of 10 gives me it's actually it
gives me this so when I do range 10
it won't really show you it kind of
hides what it gives you but in reality
it gives you a list of ten numbers okay
so we're going to talk about more things
like lists and integers and floating
points in our next video but for now I
just want you to think of it like it
gives us ten things and so it runs ten
times okay so if I did for I in range 10
and I said print I what actually happens
is the first time in this list I the
first time you run through this loop I
is zero then the next time right this
range ten is really this list here so I
is zero the first time then it's one
then it's two then it's three then it's
four and each time what happens in the
loop is the part that's indented inside
of the loop that's the part that runs
over and over and over again so what
happens the first time I is 0 we say
print 0 and we get to 0 right here then
we say I is 1 so I is 1 over here and
then it says print 1 we get 1 over here
then in the last one I it turns out to
be 9 so we print 9 and then we get this
9 over here okay that's a basic idea of
how the loop works so the part that we
want to we want to run over and over
again we're going to put it inside of
this loop notice a colon at the end very
important and I'm going to put this part
inside of the loop and I don't even need
to put that I can just do this and I can
say I'm basically saying do this thing
here draw a square four times that's all
I'm saying
okay and I will replace this code in the
regular way without a loop and I'll
prove it to you
ok so first let's run it like this dang
that was cool right
that was really freaking cool it just
ran that four times in a row now I can
show you what I mean ok and I'm
comment out these lines and you can see
it's going to draw that same four
squares that we just drew okay just like
that but by using a loop your code gets
a lot more clear what if you didn't want
to run it four times what if you wanted
to run it 1 million times yeah it would
be a lot harder to write that out 1
million times but it's really easy to
write 1 million in here
I think that's 1 million that's ten
hundred thousand ten thousand hundred
thousand 1 million that's actually 10
million so there you go
ten million so this thing is going to
run 10 million times right if I ran it
I'm going to close it and really quickly
because it's going to keep running
forever but you'll notice that oh it
just keeps overlapping on the same
square that is going to do that ten
million times so if I went to sleep and
woke up this will probably still be
happening and then I'll still be
happening after that so let's exit that
before something crazy happens okay so
that's loops for you guys that is it for
this video I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
