clever programmer calm and as you can
probably tell we're trying out something
new here in this video we're going to
cover is we're going to teach you how
you go about building apps but before
you get to that level you need to know
how you can actually think logically
about creating those apps once you get
those logical skills up something I
cover in my free course if you guys are
in it we're going to be doing coding
challenges on Python okay
this is what's going to allow you so
then when you are creating those web
apps that I'm going to be teaching you
guys in my olp course you're ready for
them and ready to go okay so let's get
our coding challenge started so I'm on
this website called hour of Python and
we're just going to do some coding
challenges live and we'll see how it
goes
the first thing I see is it says string
challenges and we're just going to hit
and open it up so let's say we go to
lowercase challenge okay and what I'll
do for you guys so you guys can try
these challenges as well I'll put it
right below this video so you can
actually code in here and give it a try
alright so this one is pretty simple if
I gave you any string just give you a
lowercase version of it so let's say I
gave you hello in all caps if you call
what we call a goal function on it it
should just turn it all lower case okay
so let's give that a try all right so I
go to my line 11 I don't know if I'm
playing I'm probably planning wrong
because I'm just trying out we're trying
out this new thing but let's let's give
it a try and one method and python that
I remember is lower so that makes our
life very simple we get a string we call
our lower method on it and that just
makes it lowercase so let's run this and
give it a try
and as you can see we were given capital
art and Capital trinket but what it spit
out is lowercase Targ and lowercase
trinket so fantastic we did a great job
there let's move on to the next
challenge the next challenge is
uppercase so what if we're given
anything that's lowercase or any
different case we want to just return it
in uppercase for example let's say
you're making a blogging website and you
want to show the title in upper case no
matter how the user puts it so let's say
that you have somebody on your website a
user that logs in and then creates a new
title what if we want that title to
always be lowercase even though the user
might have put it in the lower case well
that's where this challenge will help
you in Python so then we're building
those bigger apps you have the tools and
strategies when you need them okay so
let's go ahead and give it a try
upper case is very simple it's just like
what we did previously we can make it
more complicated but we're going to do
similar things so as you can see they
have written some of the code for us it
says define uppercase string so we're
getting--we're called creating a
function called uppercase it takes in
some string and then on line eleven we
can do something similar and we can say
dot upper okay that's again a method in
Python so if we're given lowercase Arg
and the lowercase trinket it should
actually print it all in caps so let's
give that a try boom works perfectly and
in the next video we're going to cover a
new challenge called switch-case
challenge that one is a little bit
trickier but I want you guys to give
that a try that's it for this video I
love you guys so much and as always I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
