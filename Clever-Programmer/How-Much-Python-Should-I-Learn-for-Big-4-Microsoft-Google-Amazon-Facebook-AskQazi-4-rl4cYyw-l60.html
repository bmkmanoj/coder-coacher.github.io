clever programmer calm and welcome to
the ask
Kavi segment i am going to be answering
a question by kevin the holy cow Kevin
asked he called me a big fan I had a
question I wanted answered a completed a
learn Python for free course and it's
been a long time correct it's a long
question I'm going to summarize it for
you guys
essentially he's saying hey I finished
up the free course I want to learn and
take the olp course but I was wondering
since I want to work at companies like
Amazon Google Microsoft and what have
you how much percentage of Python is the
old peak tour point to help me with
let's jump them right into it
okay so here's how I'm going to answer
this question it's so weird it's a
little weird question Kevin but I'm not
kind of coming at you I'm just trying to
help you out here and here's why because
it's like asking English how much
percentage of English is covered
percentage of Python covered is not
going to land you a job even like a good
companies like Google Microsoft the big
four I'll also link the awesome talk by
this one guy I forgot his name but he
talks about the big four and how you can
get into it he talks about solving
coding challenges getting really good
with algorithms and stuff like that but
one theme you'll notice it doesn't have
to do with a programming language and
your breasts of percentage how much
you've covered in it it's about how like
what you can do with it it's about how
many projects have you built with it and
how can you help Google Microsoft or a
local company out using Python right
nobody cares like somebody wants to hire
it's not gonna be like hey you know
twenty percent of Python ok let's go I'm
gonna pay you a hundred thousand dollars
a year
no they don't care about that they're
gonna be like hey listen I want to hire
you we have a hundred or three hundred
thousand dollars of revenue coming in
every year but if we use some data
analysis on this I want to understand my
customers behavior I want to understand
their patterns I want to reach out to
them and automate everything the right
way think Amazon okay and how they
upsell you you'll click on a certain
thing and then they'll bring up the
recommendation or think Netflix how
you'll watch a movie and it's so
intelligent they'll figure out what
movies it should recommend to you
similarly when somebody's hiring you
that's what they're looking for somebody
who can actually do things and then if
you happen to be able to do it with
Python that that's why they want to hire
you if you were able to do them in Java
they want to hire you as well okay as
long as you can do that thing so it's
not about the percentage now going back
to my course my course is teaching you
ideas my beginner beginner course learn
Python teaches you the basics of the
language
you can start to move around in the
language become a little bit flexible
with it like a ninja almost but it's
very specific to just coding but now
going to the oo P course that course is
really about taking the code turning it
into something real a graphical user
interface so that course is focusing
heavily on teaching you object-oriented
programming which if you don't know what
it is is already it doesn't matter to
you and you don't care but the most
important things that you'll learn in it
are how to create real-world
applications at a pretty simple level
and we won't be going to the web
applications yet that's the next course
that's what it's going to cover because
I don't want you guys to have the
complexity of understanding how
networking works while trying to create
your apps also you would have to learn
JavaScript HTML CSS sequel learn a flask
framework so I don't want to combine all
of that at once right now I want to keep
Python have you learned locally taking
the old peak course so you can build
these apps locally then once we go
online you won't have to deal with the
complexity of Python you'll understand
that part perfectly
all you'll have to worry about is
learning the additional things to take
your offline app to on line okay Kevin
great question I hope that this answers
that question for you again if you want
to work at the big four also watch the
interview that I talked about I'll link
it if I can find it if I can't with
somebody else means jump in the comments
and help them out that's it guys for
this video thank you guys so much for
watching as always I love you and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
