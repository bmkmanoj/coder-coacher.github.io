is Kazi from clever programmer calm in
this video I want to talk about the
power of generalizing versus
specializing and how it can help you and
it explode your growth as a computer
programmer as a developer as a Python or
JavaScript whatever programming language
you're doing it's kind of free of that
without any further ado let's jump right
into it
okay welcome guys this is Kazi from
clever programmer comm Here I am in
Colombia marrying and traveling trying
to get as much footage as possible here
because it looks awesome but I do want
to say that while I'm travelling here
and exploring new things right like I
moved to LA just go a bit like recently
and now I'm in Colombia just like
traveling
it's like broadening my horizons at a
whole new level and it's allowing me to
think and tap into new ways of thinking
that I never thought of and it's helping
me explode and grow the business that's
clever programmer like clever programmer
is about to turn into something that's
bigger than me or any one person you
know it's all of us and it's a movement
and I wouldn't be able to think like
that if I just stayed pigeon-holed
in one place at one time it doesn't let
you operate at that higher level and so
that's what traveling and exploring new
things has done for me not Tommy and now
tying it back to you right if you are
learning let's say even programming you
don't want to maybe even stick with one
specific technology and become a
specialist because like Robert Kiyosaki
says in his book he says that
specializing is for the I think he said
something like for the bugs right and
really the idea or insects I said
something like that but basically idea
is if you only specialize in one thing
and kind of go
laser focus in that you're not growing
in all aspects of your life and you only
have very linear growth okay it's very
linear okay one for one when you look at
and try new different days tap into
possibilities you never explored before
you have this explosive growth that's
kind of what happened to clever
programmer business like how it grew
into this big thing in less than a year
right that doesn't happen for many of
those are coding channels and it's not
because of me it's because I'm
constantly changing my surroundings
constantly changing the people that I'm
around and the thoughts that I'm letting
it because as long as you remember the
thoughts you're letting in are not your
own and they can be changed as a very
powerful and freeing thing and you could
use it to your advantage okay so if you
want to become a better programmer
why don't you travel go to New York
places and just meet people there and
maybe they can teach you some new ways
of program
right it just opens up the way that you
think and explore and look for
opportunities you might not have been
looking in the places before you know
also it lets you go of the fear of
what's new what's next then you can
apply the same thing to programming the
same reason why people get so afraid of
applying to this job or that job because
we're afraid we don't know what's there
and we don't know if we're gonna get
accepted we don't know there's a lot of
unknown variables so when you do new
things all the time you become less
fazed by the unknown you actually start
enjoying the unknown okay and that's how
I want you to look at your life as a
programmer as a web developer as a
businessman whatever it is that you're
doing okay and if you can do that you
will tap and you will grow at an
exponential level and that's what I want
you to be doing in whatever area of your
life you're in do that you will explode
you will grow a lot other cool things
right like I'm here and you could hire a
private instructor to coach your
programming in United States that might
have been like I don't know 100 hundred
$50 an hour you could come to another
country like Colombia I'm 18 and you
could have programmers train you for
like $10 an hour or $15 an hour and
they're badass programmers so just
different way of thinking and kind of
think of value arbitrage as well right
take advantage of all these
opportunities that we have in this world
you're not supposed to you know most
people 80% of the people die within 300
hour radius of 300 miles from Woodman
where they're born you don't want to be
part of that statistic ok squad Explorer
have fun and as always this is Kazi I
love your faces off and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
