&quot;her disks are fractured.&quot;
And I remember thinking, okay,
so my brother lives a perfect
life and he's a perfect child,
got his degrees, got jobs, got promotions,
both of my brothers.
My dad work two shifts.
He worked at night shift
and he worked at day shift
and he actually work as security guard.
He gave up the opportunity that he had
in our country, Pakistan.
And I saw them and when it came
to actually helping out my mom,
one day at the hospital was $30,000.
And we couldn't afford that in our family.
That was, like, we literally
could not afford that.
And so, I saw her in pain
for the next seven, 10 years
and imagine somebody you
love so fucking much,
like you care about her,
so you care about them so much, right?
She's your mom.
And I saw her go through this pain
and I watched her suffer every single day,
literally because we actually
couldn't afford to help her.
It's the feeling of like the
helplessness is just unreal.
I've never felt this
helpless in my whole life.
And so I thought, I wanna grow up
to not be in that position
where I'm that restricted
and I can't even, like what's
the point of earning income,
earning, making money, having
some financial freedom,
having a secure job when
you can't even support
the people you love and you care about?
So, watching that when I was growing up,
I was in high school and I was,
like, I know school is good
but I gotta kinda find my own way.
And so when I went to
Oakland Community College
and I was in college,
I was always trying to
find something different.
That's how I came across programming
and I was, like, &quot;Oh,
this is cool.&quot; (chuckles)
&quot;Lets me take my ideas and
put it out in the world.&quot;
Now for me in the start,
it wasn't about even making any money.
It wasn't about trying
to become successful,
becoming a freelancer
earning an income from it.
It was literally something
that let me express my thoughts and ideas.
And it was one of the things
that I could call my own
and it gave me freedom from that life
of just watching my mom suffer
and it was a creative outlet
for what was going on inside of me.
It even helped me deal with
my anger and my frustration.
And then later on,
I realized you could actually
earn an income from it,
you can make a living from it.
And not only that
but I found that I could earn
such a good living from it
that I could actually support my mom
and actually help her get her
surgery, and I actually did.
And that was the day that
changed everything for me.
And now that I have gone this
and I found, you know,
I just found my own way.
It's not the greatest way,
it's not the best way.
Everybody has their own way.
Everybody has their own way.
This was just my way
and that's just the way
that I wanna share with you
if you're interested in watching this.
I put together a completely free training.
If you come to this webinar, I want you
to walk away with every single
tool that will help you,
not only learn programming but tell you
what's the path for you
to learn programming,
what's the path for you to go
from being a complete beginner
to then becoming a freelancer
or even getting a full-time job,
what are those freaking
steps that are in the middle
that nobody shares with us,
what are the steps in the middle.
How come there is a job that says,
this entry-level job,
and it says you need
three years of experience.
Like, &quot;Are you kidding me?
&quot;How do you get three years of experience
&quot;for an entry-level job?&quot;
By definition, it should be
the first job you get into.
So, how do you baby step
your way all the way there?
That's my path, that's
what I'm passionate about.
That's what I wanna share
with everybody in the world
and that's what I wanna show you, okay?
So, if you're interested and
you wanna learn this stuff,
please, come to this webinar.
It's an amazing training
that I've put together.
I wanna not only show you
your Python earning potential,
how you can get your first client,
I wanna give you the roadmap
to start on your journey
to becoming a freelancer,
to becoming a developer,
and use this as a resource to get started
and have that right path
because I didn't have that right path
and it took me a long time to discover it.
And I got really lucky, I
had mentors along the way.
I had my older brothers
who would guide me.
I had other people that
I ended up finding.
And I worked really hard.
I was doing 18 to 20 hours
a day coding and learning.
And so, I wanna help you.
You can't skip all the hard work.
It's hard, it's difficult.
You can't skip all of that.
But I can give you a roadmap
that if you follow it,
you will get there,
you will get to becoming a
freelancer or a developer, okay?
