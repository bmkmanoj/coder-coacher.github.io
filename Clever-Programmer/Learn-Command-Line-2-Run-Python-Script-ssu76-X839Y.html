the learned command-line tutorial and
before we get to running the Python
script what I want to tell you guys is I
want you to get comfortable with it a
lot of the times when people start in
the command line they think they're
gonna break something and they're going
to hit CDs so slowly an LS so slowly I
want you to get so used to it as if it's
like you're just moving around the room
by yourself okay or moving around
wherever just get comfortable with it
feel it so essentially hit LS you're not
gonna break anything hit CD hit tab like
a million times if it doesn't work then
you know do something hit tab hit CD
again get back so get used to hitting
these commands because you want to go
from these commands being memorized from
a book and trying to just always
memorize and be like how did these
people memorize these commands to making
it like a feeling and an intuition okay
you're not gonna break anything it's
okay if you hit CD instead of PWD
nothing bad is gonna happen
okay so let's so seriously go practice
that on this or your own computer
wherever but just kind of have fun with
it get used to going around then coming
back home go deep in some directories
and then come back home you know hit CD
it's your safe place one more command I
want to teach you guys right off the bat
this one took me a while to learn but it
was actually one of the most important
so what if I go forward and I kind of
want to just undo one step and just go
back one step so let's say that um I
enter no northern meadow but what I
really meant to do was enter Western
forest right so I can go see Dee
northern meadow and then I'm like oh I
don't want to go there I want to go back
one step so I can do C D and I can do
dot dot that means go one directory back
so I went one directory back and now I'm
in the comfort of my own home which is
how it likes to state it now let me show
you guys how you can use the command
line to learn or run the Python script
and as a matter of fact after this if
you guys are going to my python tutorial
still a
only run the Python script like this
okay how I am about to show you right
now don't be using that idle stuff
anymore that stuff was good when you
were picking it up but now this is a
better way to do it so for example okay
let's write a Python script and let's
put it on the right hand side and we can
just open up a new snoo script here okay
example or sorry print hello hi let's
save it and let's go ahead and save it
in clever programmer okay or actually I
have a better director to save it here
clever programmer save it here okay and
let's save it in learn command line
all right so I gave it the py extension
now I'm gonna open up my terminal I'm
going to put it on the right hand side
that's how your workflow should actually
look most of the times so let me make
this big - all right so on the left hand
side I got my terminal or sorry on my
sublime text you guys can download the
software it's free beautiful text editor
write your code in there and on the
right hand side is where you'll run it
so let me show you a practical
application of using the command line so
we're going to go home so I just hit CD
now I want to go to where that file was
so I think it was in my Dropbox
I'll hit LS again I'll look around me
what's there
I think github should be around me so
I'm going to go to github I'll look
around again and clever programmer is
right there I can see it so I'll do CD
clever programmer and then I will do CD
clever programmer again I'm keep using I
keep using tab to autocomplete for me
now I'm here and I can see these
directories I just made learn underscore
command-line I'll go CD learn whoops
because there are two of them that start
with this it couldn't find it so I'm
gonna do learn underscore C and then hit
tab and it'll all look autocomplete it
and I can see that file right there
hello world under hello world a py so I
will do Python hello we're all that py
okay and let's run it and you can see
that it says hello well if I wanted it
to do for I in range one let's do 20
print I okay let's go to the terminal
now we don't need to type in that whole
command anymore this is one of them very
important features of the command line
you can actually you don't have to type
in Python hello world anymore just hit
up and and hit enter okay so you see
that it's added it added the new part of
the code so it's printing on from 0 to
19 and just practice that a little bit
hit up and enter up and enter up and
enter up and enter okay kind of
you get comfortable with that so you
know let's let's make a change here
maybe let's print done okay and save I'm
gonna hit a command tap to switch to the
terminal
hit up and enter switch back write more
code more code save hit command tab or
alt tab if you're on the windows hit up
and enter okay so that's how that works
and the thing that I wanted to show you
guys on Windows is basically just simply
go and open up a new terminal or sorry a
new tab and you can go get bash download
and for for Windows just download this
software okay it's called get bash and
you should be able to download it pretty
much from anywhere I think download kit
for Windows and then that's it it
started downloading automatically
against my will which is not cool but um
you know for you it might be helpful
because if you have Windows you don't
have to hit any buttons woah alright
guys I hope you're starting to see the
practicality the pragmatic nuts the
awesomeness of the command-line and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
