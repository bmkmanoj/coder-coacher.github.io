clever program comment today I got four
most important tips for computer
programming beginners so let's jump
right into it
tip number one syntax this is one of the
most common complaints I get from
everybody I get hundreds of messages
from students and they always need help
with their code and whenever I kind of
look at it it's always a little syntax
mistake that they made what do I mean by
that what I mean by that is they meant
to write for words like turtle dot
forward but they ended up writing turtle
dot forward so they didn't spell forward
correctly or they forgot to put a little
colon at the end of the if statement or
they forgot to put a parenthesis where a
parenthesis goes and a lot of the times
I see this they're following my videos
like you might actually be following my
video tutorial and you might make this
mistake and it's totally ok because I
make this mistake I mean even today I
make these syntax mistakes but
especially when I started I used to make
them all the time so before you jump on
and ask for help make sure that you're
paying attention to how you are actually
writing your code ok so I know it seems
like it's below you and it's so simple
but trust me make yourself kind of dumb
when it comes to these things and really
pay attention because you might be
missing this a lot more than you think
and you might be making those simple
syntax and stakes and a lot of the times
they lead to crazy frustration like some
of the students actually said I don't
think I can do programming I think I
should quit like literally one of the
students said that to me and the problem
with this code was actually him writing
s bow w ard instead of fo r WRAT okay so
syntax very important make sure you
follow it seems simple but pay extra
attention to it
that's tip number one tip number two
kiss keep it simple stupid don't try to
get fancy with your code like for
example with code Academy or some of
these other websites there are great
learning resources but a lot of the
times just because you're hitting those
bullet points and covering those
concepts like the title might say
covering bitwise operators or covering
object-oriented programming and there
might actually just be one lesson on it
don't think you're an expert on that and
don't downplay some of the simple things
like you'll be like oh yeah I already
know if then statements I don't need to
learn them anymore you can learn if-then
statements infinitely and they get
infinitely complex another thing
function right super super super
important but so many times when I tell
people like hey work on your
problem-solving skills and really
understand how functions works and
really understands the basics and
they'll be like oh no I've already been
past that I've been even past bitwise
operators just because you've covered
that title in that headline it doesn't
mean that all the concepts that go into
it and all the main things you're done
with them right that's actually like 99%
of a programmers job writing basic
looking code but it ends up getting very
complex at the end of the day so keep it
simple and focus on the most simple
things and get very very good at them
alright moving on to tip number three
make learning play I said this in many
of my other videos but I just cannot
stress this enough make it play think
whatever concepts you're learning and
just play with them some of the students
who are getting the best results from
following my courses have been with
students who made up their own examples
just yesterday and to learn Python olp
course one of the students in the flat
channel using object-oriented
programming created this little game
with somebody shooting a gun and then
having an option to reload so kind of
like how you would actually see in a
game like Call of Duty there is a reload
option there's an option to kind of
change the gun that you're using or the
skin of it and you can add on more and
more things and nowhere in the course
have I taught that right I've taught you
other things that you can do but he took
it ran with it created his own
implications and had fun literally some
of the students were taking courses at
clever programmer or following a YouTube
channel or whatever are ahead of some of
the students we're taking masters level
courses at university how do I know well
because I have students that I
personally coach who are actually going
for their masters in Python data
analytics computer science you name it
some of those students are at UFC some
of those so those students are going to
UIC as well and I'm working with those
students and they are they're given so
much homework they're given so many
assignments so many projects and then
they have a busy life and whatever else
they're doing in their life that they
don't have time to make it play so what
do they do they end up focusing on
regurgitation and by regurgitation I
mean literally like hearing whatever is
being taught to you and you just kind of
like repeat it right and that's what
they're doing they're copying pasting
code from Stack Overflow and they're not
taking the liberty to actually learn to
actually play and they think they're
very advanced and very far ahead but I
swear if I gave them to do a
simple project they will just be
completely lost they're going to need to
go on different websites copy/paste code
and have zero understanding of what
they're doing to actually make it work
sometimes I get frustrated we're not
working with them but I have to
understand from their perspective that's
ton of work and they don't have the
luxury of time to kind of learn it how
again I got really good at computer
programming in such a short amount of
time was I was learning it on my own
from online courses before my college
even started teaching me it and that's
how you know I kind of got good at it I
would just do it and I would have fun
with it and how I was able to spend so
much time look up to 15 to 20 hours a
day at times was because I never thought
of it like work or homework or
assignments or a project I had to do to
be created on I was using it to solve my
own problems I've like hmm I want to
create a link sharing app because I like
to share lots of content with my friends
but I want to do it in an intellectual
way I want to have it so it has its own
categories I want to have it too when I
share this content and one of my friends
gets notified I want to have it so then
my friend when he sees this comment and
notify and sees my post that I made on
this website it notifies me and then
when he writes something you know we're
notifying each other and I wanted to
create you know really epic link sharing
app and I did it and it was awesome for
my friend and was awesome for me and the
day that I was actually getting paid to
work with the client and work on code I
was like are you freaking serious like
I'm getting paid for something so
amazing creating things from scratch and
building my ideas and turning him into
digitized things like I'm learning and
I'm getting paid this is ridiculous
so that's the power of making it play
you'll be so limited if you just do it
for our job change so many people but I
just want to do it for a job change I
just want to do it cuz I heard computer
programming there's a lot more money in
this field yes there is I totally agree
with you and that's what actually
brought me into it but you have to make
it fun for you have to do it in a way
where you
not being like the information is not
being forced down your throat you're
learning it on your own time at your own
pace and you're enjoying it I want you
to be sitting there like wake up in the
morning having a cup of coffee talking
with some of your friends and then play
you know what time for me to code now
like I'm going to do this I'm going to
build some fun project today that's what
I'm going to work on or I'm going to
solve some really cool problem you know
just for my brain my mental stimulation
just to kind of get ahead and when you
can do that you will excel beyond
everybody and I know I'm emphasizing
this a lot I'm going to get some people
you're talking way too much about one
thing look then this video is not for
you to be honest okay the reason why I'm
stressing this so much is because this
is the number one most important thing
to excel at really anything that you do
then around having fun you can create
systems of productivity that make you
accountable and hold you to it end of
the standard but unless you're having
fun you're going to quit and you're
going to do the least amount and you're
not going to really understand what's
going on at the most fundamental level
which is going to stop your handicap you
from growing exponentially
so this is this was a third tip and
quite possibly the most important one
all right moving on to tip number four I
want you to learn how to ask for help a
lot of people ask me please please help
please code please my code is broken
please like this meant more time saying
please and showing their desperation
than anything else those are the people
I filter out like this I will not help
you if you're desperate
right and it's not just about coding
it's about anything in life if you want
to actually succeed and get good why are
you panicking you should be having fun
right this should be like a
problem-solving kind of thing for you
whenever I was stuck in a problem and
really it was hurting my brain
I mean that's kind of amazing now sit
there and be like okay how can I try to
solve it and look I understand there are
times where you'll get stuck and can get
out of it but being desperate is not
going to help you think about it and
right analytically like okay so I wrote
down three functions and here's the if
and then statements that weren't and I
know it's doing it correctly because of
reasons
ABC I've tested it and I know that this
works but then this other is statement
that I wrote or this other function that
I wrote doesn't work and here's why
reasons a B and C so you've done two
things first of all proven to me that
you're not lazy and just making me work
for you also you have taken the time to
really analyze your problem 99% of the
times if you go so deeply analytical and
just solving your problem you'll realize
that you actually solved it if you go
deep down into actually being really
specific with your questions you'll end
up solving your own problems and I know
this because I posted on Stack Overflow
and all these forums so many times in my
life asking for help and that's one way
I ended up solving it most of the time
don't be desperate relaxed coding a
sponge it's awesome building your own
ideas your digitizing things a lot of
the panic comes from I have my
assignment due tomorrow I don't know
what to do you should have started a
while ago and you start it you should
have started doing things that were fun
for you so when you get to the
assignment it's like play for you
playtime baby don't be that person who
waits until it's the last day before the
assignment is due then you're not going
to develop a passion or love for it
you're going to associate computer
programming coding with this feeling of
work and stress just like for example
living in chicken city of Chicago is
awesome but I always say I would hate to
live in there and I want to live in the
suburbs you know why
I'm not an introverted person I like to
go out have fun hang out with my friend
so what could be the reason why I don't
want to live there because every time I
commute there's crazy traffic every time
I have to do something like go to the
courts or deal with legal stuff I have
to go to the city of Chicago and because
of that ended up I end up associating
the city of Chicago with these bad
things and that makes me not want to
live in the city you understand what I'm
saying if you relate that back to the
world of code and how you learn you're
not going to enjoy it if you just
associate it with work meeting deadlines
only a job career right you're not going
to get very far computer programming
look is not hard to learn you don't need
to be a certain age to learn it somebody
who is 58 year old 58 years old just
asked me a question saying hey is this
for me can I still do it yes you can you
literally need like less than half a
year and you can actually land
freelancing gigs I'll pay you good money
like a while ago I landed I get
personally I pay $100 an hour and they
gave me full time work okay and that was
years ago and that was like me having
like I don't know like half a year are
you sure of experience in coding so
money will come there's money in this
field but don't just be attracted to the
money you're not gonna get good but most
important you're not gonna have fun
right I don't want you to be thinking of
it like oh in nine to five I'm going to
work and then I get to come home and
then I get to have fun know that
nine-to-five should be fun for you
because then when you come home you're
not mentally drained you have energy and
passion to spend with your loved one if
you come grain from work like everybody
else you're going to be grumpy at home
not give quality time to your family
right look you're not tired
you're uninspired
okay if you thought that was powerful
tweet it at clever Kazi people working a
lot who said they're burned-out they're
not tired
they're uninspired okay there's no such
thing as burnout
I may be rambling on at this point but
again there's no such thing as burnout
it's only when you do things that don't
fill your purpose and your goals and
motivation that's what makes you feel
you're burnt out okay so I'm going to
kind of end it with the four tips that I
gave you okay
syntax follow the syntax pay attention
to small details I'll be using two equal
signs for a quality operator one equal
sign for an assignment operator if it's
a function does it have open closed
parentheses after it am i missing a
colon simple things if I'm a misspelling
the word don't think you're above that
I'm not above that nobody else's either
you will make spelling simple stupid
mistakes and it's okay to keep it simple
don't over complicate things don't jump
into learning about AI just because you
spent one hour learning about if-then
statements and functions okay please
learn the basics so many people jump
into learning about advanced concepts
and it's destroyed their learning in the
future so keep it simple 3 make it play
have fun make it play enjoy what you're
doing this is what I just talked about
for so long for how to ask for help
don't be desperate be specific when you
ask for help most of the time they'll
solve solve your problems and if it
doesn't solve your problem it'll make me
want to help you otherwise you just seem
lazy seems like you're desperate seems
like your assignment is due tomorrow you
want me to do the homework for you right
those are all the things that people
think about when you ask them for help
make sure you do your homework before
you ask for help
I'll solve your problem save you time
but most importantly help you learn
because you need to make your own
mistakes and struggle with them before
you can truly learn okay if all the
answers and solutions are fed to you
you're not going to learn you're just
watching Netflix you're not actually
following a course okay so that's it for
this video I love your faces off if you
like this video like it right now okay
so we could reach out to more people
subscribe to the channel hit that Bell
button so you get the notification every
time follow me on twitter follow me on
snapchat at Roffe a one RAF CH one I

programmer following me there and it's
one of the best ways for me to
communicate with you
I send you a video message right away or
a text message right away and you get in
touch directly with me okay
go to clever programmer comm sign up for
a course if you haven't you have
learning management systems exercises
notes solutions everything in the world
right there okay
check out the learn Python oo P course
there is you will learn about
object-oriented programming but most
importantly you will build apps and you
will get access to our VIP slack channel
so you can be in there learn enjoy and
actually be part of everybody else
that's there right join the coding
family essentially so we have a slack
channel with all the students
collaborate and really help someone and
take it to the next level take you learn
Python course first okay it's absolutely
free and you get so much value out of it
they will love it we have thousands of
students enrolled in their learning in
the single
and that's it for this video guys I love
you and I can't wait to see you in the
