from clever programmer calm so on my
Facebook page today I got a story to
tell you first of all check out this
chair how awesome I feel like I'm
strapped in like a little baby like look
at my head it's just so strong it's so
good okay so anyways before I waste any
more of your time I I kind of made a
post on my Facebook page and essentially
it was like hey guys go check out my
learn Python olp course which is a paid
course I don't know why everybody goes
so crazy about that and one of the
gentlemen said like he saw my course and
then he goes blah blah blah you are a
scam your Facebook course should be
priced at $50 and not any higher and
I replied and I said well yes but also
not yes and because you know there are
lots of other things that are being
offered in there and I specified each
thing like okay we have a slack channel
and then we do like life a route
meetings and we like try to build some
projects together and bunch of students
even get lots of one-on-one help and
then he responds back to me and he goes
you're not a real software developer I
just checked your LinkedIn you're you
haven't worked for anybody you you are
like a fake and so then I saw that
message and I was like well you know I
kind of got at that point I kind of got
defensive I wanted to I wanted to say
something I wanted to say something back
but then I started thinking from this
gentlemen's perspective and and the one
thing I did say to him was okay you're
not gonna go and look at the five
hundred thousand people that are on the
YouTube channel finding valuable
information and you're also not gonna
find like the five thousand people that
we have enrolled in our courses at
clever programmer but you're gonna like
go look at my LinkedIn might as well
also look at my Google+ page another
social media thing that almost nobody
ever uses so that was very interesting
and you know I was trying to reason with
this gentleman and I was like go check
out my github and I've made apps and you
can even see my apps and it's all like
all open out there for the world to see
but then I took a step back and I kind
of stopped and I you know I got to
thinking okay why was this person so
emotional and why was this person who
barely knows me probably never watched
any of my stuff
got like really upset about this that I
was actually like selling a course or
you know got personal he went from price
of the course to
like calling me a scam and I I I got to
thinking and I was like okay what could
be the reason and I think I'm kind of
starting to understand right so he
wasn't really upset at really what I was
doing
but what he was kind of upset at is how
come I have more experience and it's
very possible he could maybe he's a
professional software developer I don't
really know the gentleman but maybe he
saw that he had so much experience and
he just worked for so many years and
then there's somebody else out there who
is actually able to help more people and
offer more valuable information to other
people and other people are following
that person and learning from that
person and it ultimately comes down to
that right I have more experience how
can you be ahead of me how can you
provide more value to people right that
will happen with everybody in their
lives that will happen with you all the
time people will always question who
made you the expert and they always want
you to be the one who just backs out and
goes yeah you're right I'm not the
expert let me just go back let me lower
my self-esteem let me lower my standards
let me lower my rates because let's be
honest I'm not an expert that's what
they're actually trying to do they're
trying to bring you down so when I get
kind of that kind of feedback it's
almost weird but I get excited I love
that energy even if it's negative energy
I want to take it and turn it into a
positive energy for myself because it
just tells me that I'm doing something
right and it should also tell you that
you're doing something right
when you start to get people who really
want to bring your energy levels down
because they can't take it anymore it's
actually a self projection kind of like
how if you are you want to start a
business or you want to do something and
you'll
- I don't know one of your cousins or
your uncle or your mom or one of your
friends and they'll be like you will
fail and you know I love you very much
but you know back when da da da started
something bad person failed and then but
back when this person started so when
they're talking about their failures
right they're not talking about you
they're talking about their failures and
they're projecting it onto and saying
you will fail as well okay they can't
wrap their heads around what you're
doing or if you start to up your rates
and actually get jobs where you are
providing high value and also making
lots of money back they'll be going what
bar you can't charge that much you're
not an expert it's not that there are
going against you or taking a stab at
you is that they can't justify how they
would be able to do that and they can't
justify why they spent so much time
learning these things and they're not
able to do as much as you or get as many
things as you are getting so it's it's a
self projection is what it is and skills
will always beat experience and that's
why I'm such a big you know proponent of
that fact I am very young right and it
doesn't matter how old you are or how
young you are what matters is your skill
I know for a fact that I'm better than a
lot of software developers I'm also not
blind and stupid and I know that there
are but Jillian software developers who
are better than me I don't claim to be
the best I've never claimed to be the
best but what's very important to
understand is whether you as long as you
can help somebody else that's all that
matters that means you're gonna stay in
business and whatever it is that you do
so understand that skills will always
always always be experienced
and don't let anybody tell you otherwise
and don't let anybody else bring you
down because to be honest with you you
know this stuff gets to you and like
there are times where I'm reading it and
I'm like wow like this is you know it
gets kind of depressing sometimes you
read it and you're like wow I really
must be doing something wrong here but
sometimes if you take a step back and
kind of console your own self but also
understand your own value right and you
don't have to explain yourself to people
but you can know what your worth is you
know don't let people like undervalue
you because that's what they'll always
try to do so I just thought that that
kind of wasn't cool but rather than just
kind of ignoring it I wanted to share
with you guys because I think that
important takeaway is that skills will
always beat experienced and wide that
should be consoling to you is you don't
have to be you don't have to have
started programming when you were five
so then when you're 20 years old you can
say you've been programming for 15 years
you can learn you can start learning
when you're 20 get really good and then
get a job all your 20 okay you don't
need experience you need to skill so if
you've built something then yes you will
get that job or whatever it is that
you're trying to get okay and this is
regardless of just coding pretty much in
any field of supplies also
I am taking the mouse north chess team
I'm also their assistant chess coach
because that's where I graduated from
high school and I used to play chess on
