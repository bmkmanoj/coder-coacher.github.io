for you I really want to learn
programming and I really started once
but I lost my passion and motivation for
for it does that mean I'm not for it or
what you're gonna lose passion and
motivation and then it's gonna come back
it's it's like like mjid said a sine
wave it's a horrible way to describe it
only people who do math or know anything
about math will get it but it's like
waves you know you'll get really
motivated and you'll be like yeah
motivated and then you start going down
and then all of a sudden you feel
motivated and passionate again and then
it goes down it comes in cycles but
motivation can be reversed engineered so
motivation and passion is not what you
guys think it is it's not this random
thing that happens by luck all of it
could actually be reversed engineered
and you could turn into a system and
make yourself be motivated and
passionate so for example as human
beings we are really dumb okay we are
really really really really stupid as
human beings here's what that means
whatever is happening around us
influences us and what you think are
your thoughts aren't actually not your
thoughts at all these are thoughts that
you have based on the environment that
you're in the people that you're around
the media that you're consuming that's
what is that's what those thoughts are
actually comprised of they're not your
own there's just a mixture of all these
and that unique combination that gets
marinated that's inside your head that's
what you think is the unique you and are
your thoughts now knowing that we could
be really depressed that we are really
stupid or knowing that we could be
really happy because we could
reverse-engineer it a lot of things in
our life so for example if I feel less
passionate or motivated when I'm driving
I don't listen to em you
because it's a waste of time listening
to music it's sometimes good if you're
using it to get yourself palm-tree
working on something to get yourself
focus but if you're driving it's just a
waste of time why not listen to books on
something like audible why not when
you're in a train and you got your
headsets in or you're doing a commute
listen to books and you could listen to
books that motivate you or talk about
coding or programming that's one thing
you could do here's another amazing
crazy hack that's life-changing when you
are at home and you're about to eat your
food why waste all that time just
sitting there eating food looking at a
wall or what do some of us do we eat
food while watching house of cards while
watching stranger things or suits or I
don't know whatever news channels or cat
videos or just you stuff on YouTube or
surfing the internet whatever it may be
for you instead of doing that why not
watch cool stuff you could be building
with code or maybe there's a new problem
in coding that you've hit and now you're
stuck so you're looking up how to solve
it or you're looking at coding tutorials
and you're eating food and looking at
that at the same time all right so if
you replace your car time and all that
other nonsense so you replace your music
with stuff about coding and you're
watching stuff about coding and coming
up with new ideas those are the easiest
hacks so you can start implementing
right now or also you could go to local
meetups where there are other people who
think about coding who dream about
coding who love it and want to build
amazing things now this is something
important to you and you start applying
all three of these things I just told
you you know changing the circle of your
friends because you know they say the
five friends around you write the five
closest people to you you're not only
just the average of them but
quantifiably that
it's actually measurable and your
average salary is also the average of
the five people around you and how much
they make okay
so for those of you who like to think
very objectively like me even if you
don't believe that other whole thing
about you're the average of the five
closest people to you if you look around
what their salaries are and you see what
your salary is you're like whoa we're
all really close that should be you know
that should tell you something so if
those people are not about coding or not
passionate about their life or not
trying to reach their goals or not
trying to move themselves forward or not
motivated and not motivating you and not
believing in you maybe just maybe it's
time to expand that inner circle to
other people and those people who don't
care for you or are there for you to
make yourself feel comfortable but don't
really push you or challenge you or move
you to do new things maybe just maybe
it's time to cut them out all right so
you combine replacing music with books
you combine or placing Netflix and the
stupid shit you watch and you waste your
time an average American spends 40 hours
a week and my phone just died so my live
stream is dead let's figure out what's
going on with this bad boy but think
about this okay average American spends
40 hours a week on TV so most of us
complain about not having time we have
time we just spend it on a lot of weird
things and I'm not putting myself above
it I do it all the time that's why I
have these things in the back of my head
because while I am teaching you and
sharing this with you I'm mostly getting
the most benefit for myself because it
reminds me to do these things because
I'm the one also who's not spending time
doing the right things so if we can
change our habits we can reverse
engineer being motivated and passionate
and being at that level that we want to
be at and we don't have to condemn
ourselves
anymore for not having that passion or
that motivation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
