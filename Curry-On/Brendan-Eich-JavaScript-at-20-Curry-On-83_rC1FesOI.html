2:00 in the morning so I'm here to talk
about something I did 20 years ago how
many of you did something 20 years ago
that is is used all over the world by
billions of people it's it's not a good
feeling but it was necessary to
persevere to make it better things that
are impossible just take longer I'm
going to talk about the past and the
future to today and I hope not to get
stuck in the past because the future is
brighter when I was lured to Netscape in
1995 it was with the lie that I would
come and put scheme in the browser
and that didn't happen for reasons
anyway but there's an irony here because
some of you have been following John
Carmack of oculus Facebook formerly it
games work on on VR he's he's using
racket in his version of the Metaverse
he's got a racket server for his VR
world but he's building this led to this
twitter exchange where i said that i did
something once in 10 days in response to
Tony for EC who said hey come on John
just spend 10 days and get javascript in
there too along with racket or instead
of bracket and and I said this would be
sweet revenge
if we actually had racket PLT scheme in
in the future of the the internet if
it's really the VR world it's the matrix
and then Marc Andreessen told me like he
always does because he was my
co-conspirator in JavaScript and he
always has to rationalize his past
misconduct
and the only way that javascript could
have succeeded was if it had to look
like Java because otherwise no one would
have used scheme this is questionable
but there was a change when I got the
Netscape I was recruited saying come to
scheme when I got there it was due Java
already a second Java like language
because they were doing a deal with Sun
and Java was going to be the biggest
thing ever and it was going to kill
Windows didn't happen it was very hard
to justify doing the second language in
addition to Java if you have Java you've
got one problem why do you need two
problems but in recent and I and others
bill joy at Sun notably saw that Java
was not accessible to the average web
designer programmer amateur and we
needed a little brother language and so
when I did that I took some damage in
ten days I created a demo which then
shipped and that led to a lot of the
craziness in JavaScript some of it was
was just me compromising with people who
wanted dynamic language always here's
Gary Bernhard on
it's a string of course because it's a
sea wipe language because it has to look
like Java the line starting with the
left curly brace is a block not an
object
Thank You Seng a Britta is a rubyist 15
comes
all right it was the nineties so I
shouldn't have overloaded plus obviously
Java can do it because it's a it's a
type language in JavaScript I should
have used something else like like dog
like Perl used only they had to change
that you have to realize PHP was born
the same year and I think June of 1995 I
I knew a Smurfs lair door through the
active state Advisory Board and I ran
into him a few months ago and it's good
to catch up and Rasmus has worked on PHP
and PHP 7 has you know optional types
and things like that things get better
if you work on them long enough but back
then these dynamic languages were
considered you know silly languages they
were they were not for real programmers
and and of course Java needed such a
language it needed a little brother
language because otherwise you would
just be looking at this all the time
Java didn't work out on the client and
there are reasons for this but I'm going
to go back further to the mid-90s the
last good TV season according to voxcom
this is where the picture comes from and
that's when I went to Netscape year late
I should have gone the first year but I
didn't I didn't have the chainsaw for
the end at that point I would go to
Stanford University and read papers
because the venture capitalists John
doar said all you had to do was hang
around market Jack's Hall to be it
successful something and so I did that
and it didn't really help me be a VC but
it helped me quickly implement something
in ten days that became JavaScript one
of the constraints that isn't obvious
was that there was going to be a
server-side product sort of like PHP
based on mocha JavaScript and so I
actually wrote a bytecode compiler an
interpreter in those ten days and I was
inspired by this paper by James Gosling
just a little
from sigplan and it talks about sort of
how to how to generate efficient machine
code from byte code thoughts about java
sky Nowacki mostly typed by code it's
not a bad paper and it shows early Java
and there's there's that nice not so
nice Java by code on the right it turns
out that by Venus Barbara this paper and
writing a bytecode interpreter I put
some things in the JavaScript that I
didn't have to do I put in the bitwise
operators from not only C C++ but also
Java including the unsigned right shift
operator I I wrote a bytecode compiler
an interpreter therefore I had to write
a way to decompile by code back to
source I didn't want to hang on to the
source then there wasn't much memory on
on 16-bit windows machines there were a
lot of problems I think people who
remember the early version of JavaScript
that came out in 1995 it's amazing it
survived it did not have nested
functions for instance those were I
didn't have time to do closures properly
in those 10 days and it had you know
lots of hacky substitutes for a real
standard library it had the date
constructor which was based verbatim on
Java util date which had y2k bugs if you
remember office space they were all
fixing y2k but I think it was Gosling he
had get year which returned a two-digit
year offset from 1900 we fixed this one
we standardized JavaScript and Java
essentially I think deprecated to have a
till date but it's amazing how how badly
designed it was considering it was in
Java it made javascript look like Java
which was the whole point
give me that I did in a big hurry not
all in those 10 days I had sort of the
rest of June July really to do the rest
of it was the integration with the
netscape browser which was as important
as the language the language could have
all these you know these silly gaffes
and warts but if it didn't actually do
something in the browser that was
interesting it would have completely
flopped and it turns out java couldn't
do any of those things java just had a
rectangle java was a plugin it was an
applet but here's an example I found on
the Internet Archive
unfortunately not all the art is there
this this is from an early adopter named
Bill Dortch she did a really good job
using javascript dynamically back in the
days if you click on these links you get
generated pages these are all client
generated pages this is like a single
page application using frames and frame
sets using JavaScript on the client side
to compute presentations from downloaded
data here's what the data look like it
was you know art gallery with artists
and their works and it had to be written
in very early JavaScript there was no
JSON you had to write it using
constructor calls nested he'll build or
it's nicely indented them here but you
could do a lot with with this and it
showed the promise even then of what
became you know in Microsoft's parlance
dhtml or ajax ten years later or the
modern world I'll take for granted it
was there in the beginning and there are
some art fortunately and it worked
barely so that that I was expressing the
language design wasn't the only or even
the most important factor it was the
integration with the browser since then
thanks to those bitwise operators we've
discovered things like as new J's which
is a statically typed subset of
JavaScript that has definite performance
it has no garbage collection pauses it
has no just-in-time
recompilation pauses their performance
cliffs and I'll get into what that's
inspired recently that was announced
just did a week we have the six edition
of the Xmas crypt standard when I say
equina script I'm referring to
standardized version of JavaScript
because son wouldn't donate the
trademark they
that no starts with JAV a so we are not
going to give that to the standards body
and by the way they had their lawyer
suing everybody in the world who had a
website starting JAV it was a somebody
who had a site named Javon code was his
surname and he got a cease and desist
letter from sons lawyers saying you
can't have your website named Jovanka
because it starts with Gav and he said
that's no I'm gonna stick with that
JavaScript probably should be donated
now by Oracle I don't know if it will be
but it's it's arguably not a defensible
trademark anymore
meanwhile ACMA Script is an unwanted
trade name it sounds like a skin disease
we have other things in JavaScript now
we can get to the hardware we can
actually get into the GPU this is thanks
to work going back to another Silicon
Graphics with the original GL then
OpenGL which standardized the OpenGL ES
for mobile and then the version of
OpenGL ES called WebGL that
Vladimirovich did at Mozilla and took to
the Khronos group which is now in all
the browser's in iOS WebKit is enabled
and web views - it's an IE shaking their
butts looking good in IE 12 or edge
excuse me
typed objects an evolution of the typed
arrays from WebGL that allow you to
treat memory as a packed array of
integers various sizes very important
for Azam's very important for GPU
programming obviously typed objects are
generalization of this we hope to get
into a future version of ACMA script
perhaps yes 7 / 2016 I don't know and
then this sort of tool culture also talk
about where typescript from Microsoft
and then flow from Facebook are getting
very popular typescript especially
people are running not just linters but
actual static type checkers on their
code and they are finding problems ahead
of time these really our warning systems
they don't generate any runtime checks
unless you enable an option that can be
quite expensive so maybe they should
have called it warned script but type
serves a better name so if you go back
to that Gosling paper there was a class
vector
you can now write something like that in
es6 it's again it's still dynamically
typed but here I've taken some pain to
hand annotate the uses of variables and
values to show how as MJS actually
inserts casts to Bruce a statically
typed subset of JavaScript you can see
the vertical bar zero in in three or
four places there to cast to a 32-bit
integer those bit 1 operators are how
you get 32-bit integers in a world of
only I Triple E double precision
floating point which is what Java
scripts number type is because I was in
such a hurry and I knew I could project
integers into doubles I I thought I
stopped at double but I knew something
told me it's a little C hacker I wanted
those bitwise operators and they would
be useful even in 1995 even for a sort
of a toy kid-brother language so I put
them in and it's paid off and here's
again from Gosling's paper there's Java
bytecode on the left and there is a sort
of hand approximation of as MJS on the
right and it's interesting to point out
a couple of things about this it didn't
really pay for Java to reduce to a
postfix bytecode you had to have the
verifier and had to check the types were
consistent in the control flow graph
adjoin points until they added you know
stack maps it was expensive
I'm like how Michael Franzese here am
I'm not a paper about how you could
torture than a Java verifier 10 years
ago by giving it artificial spaghetti
code that would cause you know fourth
power complexity and denial of service
attacks on the Java verifier meanwhile
JavaScript has only structure control
flow you know every control flow graph
is reducible you can type types linearly
in linear time as you parse it it turns
out to be a win except for the cost of
parsing all that that you know keyword
rich or both source I'll get to so
javascript is everywhere on the web Java
is only on the server-side the plug-in
you can still get it occasionally you
need it there are banks in Scandinavia
that require for smart cards it
boondoggle it was unfortunately not
well-maintained plug in the Java plug-in
and it was being used for security
exploits for malware it was the number
one bought and paid for vector for
malware
I think Oracle's fixed that up a bit but
it's it's kind of too late Java failed
on the client javascript succeeded and I
think that's because it was good enough
that it could be evolved and it had this
MJS statically typed subset inside it
and that is actually being used now not
just by people writing hand code but
also by compilers compiling a javascript
is is old news many of you know about
this if you haven't been aware of this
I'll just run through a few of the tools
Google web toolkit and I should mention
open Lazlo before it
CoffeeScript helped quite a bit people
could see like Gary Bernhardt who its
Rubeus I think you could see that there
was a better way to use JavaScript
without having to pay for the heavy
stielike syntax and you could use head
of time compilers to generate JavaScript
that was still pretty do the debug level
so pretty close to the the level of the
source language sort of trans
compilation transpiling it's and then
dart which is now I think committed to
being a really good compiled to
JavaScript language also has a virtual
machine but that virtual machine is not
getting into browsers not even to Chrome
that most news this year let me do a
quick demo if you haven't seen this this
is something by Sean LeBron it's written
in clojurescript which is David Nolan at
Swami that on Twitter's version of
closure which is language that compiles
to JavaScript so they're compiled a
JavaScript language and Sean did this
nice solar system of JavaScript where
JavaScript has grown like a Sun a yellow
a nice yellow Sun not too big it has
these standards inside it that happened
over the years es 3 the third edition
was the the 1999 air
versus the standard when I was at
Netscape we took JavaScript to the ACMA
at that point European computer
Manufacturers Association standards body
and we did it because they had already
gotten Microsoft mad at them by trying
to standardize the windows API because
the European governments wanted a very
standard for all this this important
software that used Windows api's
Microsoft tried to sue them and failed
ECLA seemed like a good place Netscape
was under pressure Bill Gates was
complaining that keeps playing changing
JavaScript every release like he's never
done that visual basic but he had a
point and with Netscape was was not
careful about standardizing things there
was wild innovation there was there any
frames and frame sets plugins image new
image types image came in with mosaic
but there was crazy innovation without
standardization and because Microsoft
was competing effectively with Internet
Explorer by 1996 let's say we had
Netscape felt pressure morale pressure
we took JavaScript to ACMA we did
standardize it it was a really good
effort I think it forged some bonds that
are still going today Microsoft
contributed because they wanted to gain
market share from Netscape and they
wanted to have a standards approved
implementation of jscript their version
of JavaScript but they actually had
somebody really good Sean Catherine
Berger who did a lot of the heavy
lifting in the spec some contributed guy
steal it was great to have guy guy
brought dick Gabriel along for fun to a
couple of the meetings I think Richard
Gabriel wrote the the Clause 3 of the
echo spec which is very nice chapter
sort of introducing JavaScript concepts
yes 3 then rolled up the follow-on
innovation that I couldn't do in 10 days
including nested functions and closures
regular expressions switch statements a
lot of things that we take for granted
this became the bedrock for the Ajax era
2005 and Firefox I also did Mozilla
Firefox so he had
restart the browser market and under
detail to get Eklund back in business
but that led to es5 there was also a
fourth edition which we mothball it
failed it produce useful negative
results in some ways it was prefiguring
what we see now in typescript and flow
or things that are going into es 6 &amp;amp; 7
it was there was too much it was an
attempt to take a sort of a forked
version of JavaScript it was in the
flash player from macro media and then
Adobe and unify that with the third
edition about my script was based on
worked by wall / whore watt at Netscape
I gave one Omar the keys to the kingdom
in 1998 I said though you know fixed
JavaScript and Walmart said I love you
know core Delhi object-oriented you know
type systems I'm going to go sort of
graph that on to JavaScript and this was
before I think any of the work on
gradual typing or hybrid typing Robbie
fiddler and Phil why learn and Corrine
Flanagan those people hadn't written
their papers so one of our came up with
a bunch of interesting ideas but they
couldn't be done on the web Macromedia
which then got bought by Adobe took them
to heart put them in the flash player
because they could make their
programmers run static type checkers and
make them run tools that would compile
packages that would have definite types
definite name bindings and that became
one of the inputs to the fourth edition
and it was just too much try to
standardize and it still doesn't really
work on the web we never couldn't figure
out how to make some other work so we
skipped the S Ward now es5 was the big
2009 standard at this point we were just
rolling up a lot of things that we've
done as browser implementers that I'd
done it in Firefox and SpiderMonkey
things like array Map Reduce for each
reduce right these were dated facto
standards and this is another point I
would make about innovation on the web
you you have to have implementations and
developers in fact lead users writing
libraries anticipating standards
informing the standards actually
creating new standards they have to be
able to run ahead of the standards
committees which are a terrible place to
do any kind
design and you do get a bit of a
hodgepodge effect it's inevitable but if
you have good stewardship in the
standards bodies then you can either
harvest the best ideas from the
developers from the browser of winners
any aspire did that es6 is in some ways
es four plus six it has a lot of new
things in and i'll talk about that in a
hurry soon and then es seven things are
still going
Shama Brahmas optimistic that we'll have
es 8 which is supposed to be in 2017
with macros we'll see but one of the
points this talk makes which is nice is
that people are used to using tools now
the so called transpiler or compiler a
linter at least if you're writing hand
javascript a module system since up
until es6 javascript lacked that and it
still isn't fully implemented in any
browser this is a new kind of closed
culture for javascript in the old days a
lot of people writing javascript would
say i i want to write to the raw
JavaScript i don't want to use any tools
I want to shift reload after I edit my
file but now people use nodejs based
automation watches files and it's all
magic and it works the tools run all the
time when he to and so that this comb
culture is enabled compiled JavaScript
static type checking for JavaScript
which has been informed by all that
great for search one gradual types
anders Helzberg is what the team of
Microsoft did typescript which was very
smart and it's still growing and they've
committed to sort of rican verging it
with the evolving atmospheric standard
which is smart
they didn't make a different language
that had to go its own way whoa except
on the sort of syntax that we've now
reserved for the future standard
so-called colon annotations VAR x colon
t and flow as i tell you has more
sophisticated analyses more specific
inference so that you don't have to
write so many annotations as you do with
typescript
there's the agust closure compiler and
i'll close your of a closure from google
which also is doing sophisticated
analysis these days require some
annotation sometimes done in comments
but these are all sort of circling the
same Sun they're all in the floor system
of job
script figuring out how to add some kind
of typing and there's an experiment in
VA called sound script which I hope
succeeds this is being done under the
aegis of the ACMA committee tc39 which
is going to take ideas that were in s4
and simplify them and try to improve
blindage in an opt-in way so that you
can have less of the jail at effect that
Gary Bernhardt I'm using lis mocked and
you can have optional types and these
types will mean something at runtime
these are not just warnings CoffeeScript
have to give a credit dart is now in
orbit captured it nicely I was kind of a
rogue planet at first clojurescript
David no one's language based on cloture
which this presentation is written in
and the list goes on you know it's a
very large snore system there are
hundreds of compiled Java Script
languages so to get back to this one
important compiler I'll mention is in
script in by Alonzo kiya Muslim research
based on LLVM it's a C and C++ compiled
to JavaScript solution it's a back-end
for LLVM that generates JavaScript from
LLVM ir it has to reconstruct loops from
the elevant roll flow graph it has to
approve certain facts about the code it
was generating to make it really fast
this led to add some JSON as I say as
majesté was in some ways discovered by
alone and Dave Herman Luc Wagner it was
a little research and formalized David
wrote the type system for it you can see
it as McKesson org so JavaScript virtual
machines are now running very close to
the metal if you use this type subset
you don't have to declare all the types
Lee you have to use those bitwise or
zero casts and it's painful to do by
hand but the compiler can do it and gzip
compressed it nicely though it does turn
into a parsing overhead of course in the
meantime Java has persisted on the
server-side it's it's done well and you
have things like the sort of dynamic
language support in
JDM now which is doing very well so I
like to say the circle is now complete
I'm afraid this makes me Darth Vader
though that's not really good Jamie
James Gosling over there I don't know if
anybody saw this Mark Hamill is now the
same age Alec Guinness was when Alec
Guinness was in Star Wars the first
movie and Mark Hamill's in this new JJ
Abrams really which I'm sure is gonna be
a travesty webassembly so what is it
Assam Jas the definite performance no GC
pause statically-typed subset of
JavaScript has led to a great sort of
peace treaty among Google Microsoft was
law and even Apple fill pixels here so I
think to work in earnest on a second
syntax for JavaScript when I was doing
JavaScript you know scheme in the
browser I think Tom Lord was starting
guile machista call me at work on down a
little bit he ended up going to work on
WebKit at Apple and you know people know
about scheme they know how to do fast
languages why are we stuck with this
JavaScript syntax its silver votes it's
it's costly to parse especially on
mobile let's make a second syntax well
now you can have two problems except
that if the primary syntax javascript is
just too expensive even if you gzip it
for transfer compression you have to
unzip it parse it is low memory and time
time for a second syntax but we now know
how to do a better intermediate form
than a POSIX bytecode like Java has for
instance so let me just refer you here
to the github where the big browser
companies are all working on this design
based on as MJS it starts out as Co
expressive with Asmodeus and it grows
from there some of the you know design
was informed by things like Ben let's
work on J's app and there was previous
work for Michael franz and christmas
store on arithmetic coding of abstract
syntax trees so instead of using a
bytecode for some kind of a sack machine
that the plan is to use a officially
binary encoded abstract syntax tree
there's some debate right now how much
pre-order how much postorder because you
might want to interpret this you might
not want to always compile this there's
a fair amount of cold code that's loaded
on the web or in any large application
and sometimes that code warms up only
once it runs only once so it doesn't
make sense to compile it so I think the
the the lead thinking is you might have
sort of a post order encoding for
expressions and pre-order for control
flow structures which are currently
equivalent to statements now we also
want to get rid of the statement
expression economy in this new syntax
JavaScript unfortunately has statements
from C from Java but but webassembly has
them for short need not so the nice
thing about this is it starts out as the
second syntax for Asmodeus it can
actually be implemented in browsers by a
little translation library so-called
polyfill that translates the binary
syntax to as MJS and that can run
quickly in fact it can run faster than
if you had had just taken the entire
large program as as as Vijay s so
inscripted is supporting this prototype
this is all experimental collaborative
design in the open in a w3c community
group anyone can join that community
group so I encourage you to do so
there are lots of people already
contributing to give you a feeling for
what it looks like there are storage
types like in date in 16 and there are
32-bit system urban integers and floats
there are ways of viewing memory which
you recognize from typed arrays there
are operations which then you compute
sign this or unsigned this appropriately
and because the Google portable Native
Client stream is contributing this is
really great news we have all the
excellent work and research they've done
over the years to try to bring undefined
behavior out of the C and C++ not just
language but sort of tool memory model
and hardware the entire stack has to be
more definitely specified than it is for
a C compiler because we're making this
available on the web we were worried
about security and we want to we want to
have less non-determinism we want
software fault isolation just like you
have in Athens yes just like you have
importantly a client if something goes
wrong program crashes but you cannot
pone the machine you cannot take over
control flow and do return oriented
programming or anything like that so
anyway this is a long github and I
encourage you to look at it there's a
road map again informed by the azzam
Jess and pinochle people's future
thoughts that includes support for
dynamic languages support for tooling
things like dynamic linking garbage
collection even just-in-time compilation
of wasm this is big news and it's it's
not all going to happen at once it's
going to be done in the open I hope to
see a sort of experimental nightly build
support in Chrome and Firefox and in the
preview release of edge for some of this
over the next I'd say six months but
that may be optimistic I don't think it
should should wait though I think the
big lesson I learned do something in ten
days when you have a chance to get
market share and it will succeed and
that is important for wise um I think
it's great that as when Jas is being
optimized by Microsoft edge ie 12 it's
great that that chrome v8 is also doing
well out of a new turbofan back-end is
optimizing for SMBs as you know sort of
part of the job optimizing for all
JavaScript but now with webassembly
leave a chance to to really improve the
sort of parse time and once we have all
the browser's supporting the second
syntax we can let it diverge and let its
semantics grow beyond what we want to
push into javascript I used to give
talks where I'd show the yen and the arm
symbols JavaScript serving two masters
it was supposed to be a happy compromise
never really is doesn't end well with
math and we can relieve jobs from having
to do both a great compiler target
language and the successful dynamic end
to end language it is JavaScript can
grow less and last them for
or so let me do some demos because I
don't want to take too much more of your
time but I do want to leave a little bit
of time for questions at the end just to
show you where this all started before I
think as ingest was formalised Fabrice
Boulard the super hacker did QEMU tsetse
and many other things did something that
was pretty amazing
he did a PC emulator in JavaScript to
use typed arrays he used sort of his own
hand coded Assam Jas and helot boots it
is starting please start
that's how my okay this is session
history bug I'm gonna have to start it
over
yeah there is good thank you this is the
Firefox nightly good I'm not sure what
that big pause was it's actually Linux
running on an emulated PC it's still
there gotta get the keyboard focus in
the right place now you can you can run
TCC this is all running to JavaScript
you're in the matrix we've taken the
blue pill you're happy
and at some point it'll come back
this was faster in my hotel room
all right we're timing you know Wow so
he you can see he's got a full PC
emulation here hardware emulation and
we're getting like irq timeouts
alright let me go back to this something
didn't work there but I'm going to play
games instead this is an example of
Asmodeus just compiled with him script
and it's the unity 5 engine it's a hobby
game so you have to forgive the boar but
I won't have to kill any zombies because
my sentry chickens will do it for me
unfortunately they the machine guns tend
to overheat and they explode it's very
sad but this is not only showing off as
we dance but also WebGL of course Web
Audio full screen at the eyes a lot of
things we added to the web over the last
few years to make it more of a complete
platform for things like games that
better take some help anyway
full frame rate supported target for
unity also Epic Games Unreal Engine
supports the web now this is I think
primarily due to the work we did at
Mozilla and it was picked up on by
Microsoft and of course other browser
vendors and it works for lots of games
there are many games based on unity many
based based on Unreal Engine that are
all licenses you know based on SDKs or
game engine source licenses and they all
work now on the web you just press a
button you run it through scripting you
get code you can download again it's
JavaScript so this little big can't wait
for wasm which will be more concise that
what faster loading faster starting but
it's so very nice and yes some great
Greybeards talking what to do story my
wife
but at least I can get this Fabrice
Maillard thing to work this is Linux
this was really important to us before
we formalized as him
it just was amazingly fast and it's a
full PC emulator running Linux running
TCC I mean networks gonna let me down
here but while I'm loading that you can
also see something called sweet Jas org
that's what you're seeing right there
that's macros for JavaScript so there is
hope maybe won't be an es 8 watch 2017
but there is hope that we will get
hygienic macros and you won't have to
keep coming to the standards body saying
please add more special forms for
convenience or to express new semantics
instead you can we help use macros and
have a smaller language kernel semantics
or you can use wasm macros presumably
why as I'm again webassembly is not
meant to be hand coded the Nick bray of
Google is working on a assembler for fun
where we think people might write a
little wise in by hand mostly it's a
compiler target and it really won't be
that fun to write by hand I think the
hotel Wireless is letting me down but if
this immensely loads you'll see boot up
I can't even write a program I hear them
that so if I if I compiled I didn't
compile whoa all right
not sure what's going on there its
timing out so the program is not working
you can play with it's on the web you
can actually use Linux running on
JavaScript and that was so fast we
realized there was something there and
scripting was coming up we realized
you're alone Zack eyes work you could
cross compile crazy big C programs C
Python Lua Ruby you name it then - as
from Jas led to web assembly so you know
when I do these talks I usually end up
with some some great 90s homage
involving a wesley snipes movie no one
remembers it's actually passenger 57 but
people think it's blade I don't know why
that makes even less sense and I had to
explain it on Hacker News because nobody
nobody appreciates old movies anymore
always bet on Jas like Wesley's slogan
where he told off a bad guy saying all
is down a black doesn't really make
sense except with Wesley you know he's
gonna kick the bad guys but with
JavaScript it happened to be at the
right place at the right time and happen
to grow and took a lot of work frankly
to evolve it and now we have webassembly
so I've updated my slogan almost bet on
JavaScript in what assembly thank you
very much thank you for a very
interesting talk
I was actually most blown away at the
beginning of it when you said well they
hired me to do scheme and I was in the
haze imagining the world as it would be
if they had carried through on that they
had reasons why they wanted to look like
Java okay so the question is did you
consider doing a scheme with the syntax
that looks like Java which sounds
completely bizarre of course if you know
the history if you know McCarthy's
original intention for Lisp was a
different language it was a different
surface language and s expressions were
just a hack where should happen to stick
just by ghosted yeah no there wasn't
time I had to do a demo the Netscape
codebase had to work on 16-bit windows
windows 31 there wasn't a steam engine I
could have used I didn't have time to
create a front-end that could sort of
translate C syntax lower it to s
expressions I didn't even have a proper
garbage collector I had to hack
reference County and there were a lot of
memory safety books
Netscape was an incredible rocket I'm
not saying good thing here everything
was being rushed it was a sense of
doomed not just from the sort of build
public ethos
which was embraced by the founders
especially Jim Clark but also Microsoft
was coming up in the rearview mirror and
Mike Homer of Netscape the marketing
executives no longer with us
unfortunately said we were the little
you go and there was just a monster
truck with Microsoft on its license
plate coming up in our rearview mirrors
getting awfully large and it drove
Netscape right off the road right there
was a famous USB Microsoft in the trust
case those although that organ was the
remnant sort of escape pod we didn't
have time
if I had it more time I would have done
scheme and I would have even fought back
against this make it like Java or use
you know sort of the list to you know C
syntax thinking that was around but
there was no time there was there was
absolutely no time to do do it right you
know I met Richard Gabriel through the
standards process and he's famous for
the sources better essay which I think a
lot of people misunderstand or miss
appropriate sometimes worse is just
worse JavaScript got by to the skin of
its teeth let's just leave it at that
but I'm glad that it got by enough that
we have things like well I'm assembling
we have this incredible reach of the web
and all these programming language is
now compiling to it sure they could have
been better if there's more time there
just wasn't worth quite thanks
so I guess my question about webassembly
is why now this is an idea that I feel
like people have proposed much earlier
and it seems like a really good idea but
why is now the time to do it yeah it's a
good question we've talked about this I
mean I mentioned Jay s app from men live
shits I think Michael Franz the
Christian storks work was even older
we've thought about second syntax for
JavaScript but even beyond that we've
talked about a bike code for the web
everybody you know sort of the sophomore
question on Hacker News why can't I have
a bike code but Java byte code actually
was a problem it was not well designed
it was frozen for binary compatibility
reasons which then impaired the language
evolution in my opinion things like
erase generics so once you have two
problems two syntaxes you can get into
this sort of trouble where you freeze
one or you feel compatibility
constraints correctly from changing one
and that limits what you can do in the
other or in the underline semantics and
that that was a problem we didn't want
to rush into with JavaScript I remember
many years ago on the es discuss list
machista codec of Apple said look we can
do a syntax for JavaScript that's a byte
code but now we'll have to freeze it and
we'll have to version it but we'll have
to figure out how to compatibly extend
it and we'll probably get it wrong so
there was great resistance doing that
meanwhile it was easy for you know
Microsoft to do dotnet the CLR for
Google to do things like Native Client
or the dart VM big companies with lots
of resources can do the obvious thing
but they can't get it into the browser
and one point I'll make about web
assembly that's important there's only
one VM it's the JavaScript VM growing a
second syntax and then evolving its
semantics to express more than
JavaScript can or should Express to
support native codes for other
programming languages maybe call cc
someday that one VM principle is
extremely important trying to put two
VMs into all the browser's that's been
attempted to fail I paid mark Hammond to
put C Python into Mozilla just for
active state and clear their companies
they took it out it was too complex dart
VM was supposed to go in the chrome
fails does not go in will never
the idea behind webassembly that's
critical here is that one virtual
machine evolved once that breakthrough
was was was reached once a from Jas
prude the performance could be
asymptotically close to portable Native
Client I think everybody got together
among the browser vendors you could say
it's politics you could say it's
learning process among mobile companies
there's lots of ways to analyze it but
I'm just buying it's happening now
better late than never
hi so regarding SMGs and webassembly
people and you also said it's type set
of JavaScript but you don't think this
is true in in general all this is much
more restrictive than Java type subset
of JavaScript in other words it's also
much less than a typed subset of
JavaScript it doesn't have any kind of
GC it only has in Sandrock mem really
doesn't have any kind of reasonable
interaction with interrupt with the Dom
or anything even in the medium long term
of web personally I have seen that there
is hope to be able to manipulate objects
coming from the GC but it's still not a
GC language or GC bytecode is there any
hope that somehow at some points in the
future we can get something like a
garbage collector it's typed bytecode or
sure again I invite you look at the
github web assembly is a moving target
so it's JavaScript it was a big mistake
in my opinion for the dart people to say
javascript can't be fixed and can't
change because it has and it is being
fixed
same with web assembly it is starting
this cook expressive with Assam Jas
which is typed but doesn't have garbage
collection your notion of type must
include more expressiveness than is
therefore the C and C++ compilers and
that's that's fair we will get there
it'll take a couple of years I think
maybe three or four years even but on
the roadmap here for whether Sam will
you see garbage collection and dom
integration you see just-in-time
compilation
memory bigger than four gig which is
necessary co-routines there's a large
roadmap here and it is it's well
understood especially thanks to the work
of portability to plan folks he asked me
to ask people with Mozilla this is all I
reach when I was at Missoula we working
on spider Mike and we thought about how
to expose garbage collection to guest
language we had that type on integration
ten years ago we had a cycle collector
based on bacon and Rajan 2001 so we've
been around this block it wasn't
practical to do with two BMS now we have
one VM
I think it's within reach but it will
take time you're right just don't assume
that everything's in stasis the web is
evolving rapidly javascript involving
the web assembly is evolving hi I'm Ben
I work on the web assembly sign in
chrome Athene turbofan I think this
really happened because of it was
communication between engineers and not
necessarily management we kind of all
got together and we kind of all got just
together and decided that you know we
need to design something to solve this
problem and assam jeaious was a step
along that way and actually you know we
did optimize for it but we kind of
realized it was not the right solution
and so this is kind of a way to actually
design something for a particular
purpose and it was really contact
between people at the bottom level
basically got to got together decide
what if we could do this wouldn't that
be the right solution so I mean that's
an ongoing process that was it goes back
more than more than a year probably but
now it's all open and actually we're
really excited about this so thanks man
nothing
it really is engineer engineer we have a
problem with Azzam parsing JavaScript
cost too much we have another problem
with JavaScript as a language that we
want to be good stewards of we don't
want to keep extending it to be a
compiler target had crazy things that
are hazardous to hand coders we're just
engineers solving problems and that cut
through a lot of politics I think the
time was right I remember two years ago
I visited Microsoft I talked to Steve
load going to Anders Helzberg so they're
on background about as in Jess and they
got excited so it's been a gradual
process and I think it will continue
