and you know what it is and why we have
making it so it's a new systems
programming language actually so much of
my talk I wish I had the time to revise
it entirely based on the arns um
because so much overlap is there so you
know we need to have fast code for
systems programming and we want to have
a good fi interface to interface with
native services you want to have
low-level control things like data
layout but also you know we've got the
decades of PL knowledge to draw upon so
we want to mix in all these classic
ideas drawing from the best-of-breed
stuff you know stuff from c++ like rei i
but also things from the ml and haskell
and etc communities with generics of
definite polymorphism etc pattern
matching all that great stuff but
perhaps most importantly the most
exciting thing about rust is the focus
on safety and that for us means not just
being memory safe in terms of no seg
faults no pointer no pointer
dereferences or you know garbage pointer
dereferences but also a new condition
for safety which is to be data race-free
which is pretty awesome and there's a
great blog post about this topic on
called feliz concurrency so yeah all
this stuff do you need to hack on rust
yourself is that this website so you
know you could all go there right now
and download the rest compiler and you
know start running your computer right
now and of course you're all doing that
I can see but perhaps more importantly
the playpen is something you can get to
I might not be able to get to it
actually um but this is something that
you can actually visit and run yourself
in the browser and it goes to a server a
dedicated service online so these slides
actually every piece of code that I have
on here is on has links to the playpen
so we're gonna see some demos do you all
geared up these are like three little
tasty tasty tidbits so the first thing
zero cost abstraction we heard Bjorn say
that over and over again it's a huge
thing for us to but not to come not to
compromise safety that's you know that's
the first and foremost thing but still
zero cost abstraction so this is some
pretty high level code here where we're
doing some iteration over an input
vector and we're doing a filter
as we go and then summing and this
compiles into this assembly code this is
really tight assembly code considering
how you know relatively high level that
code was and in fact if you want to get
even more high level you could have
written the code like this and it
compile listen to the same assembly code
and this is due to a mix of stuff
between both ly and LLVM to do great
optimizations but also question that's
um a closure
that's our syntax for closures which we
may or may not get to in this talk we'll
find out but that's our syntax for yeah
lambda expression is the I within the
bars so yeah but it's not just LLVM to
rely on here it's also that the iterator
abstraction we use allows us to do
things like not have bounced checks
during the actual iteration itself but
also we have memory safety and this is
an example I like because this isn't an
example that everyone necessary thinks
of in particular this is a bug that
plagues even sound safe languages like
Java namely may have heard concurrent
modification exception when you try to
modify a collection while you're
iterating over it rust doesn't have this
so in particular this example is one
where in C++ if you try to modify a
vector while you're iterating over it
that's a bug as in it might reallocate
the backing store for the vector but the
iterator doesn't know that and so you've
just invalid the iterator but it doesn't
detect that and so you just get garbage
but we detect it and tell you that
statically compiled time no not allowed
and here's why yep yep when you said you
optimize the iterators does the compiler
knows about it no that's one minute so
that the iterator country so library so
that that there is some special code in
there where the iterator is itself
taking event there's a tight coupling
between the vector representation and
the iterator that it yields when you ask
for it okay but and finally the other
point I want to make is about
concurrency we probably I'm trying to
like get to a lot of slides here oh no
um oh okay that makes sense actually I
tried to get to something that I
couldn't get to oh no this is very bad
how do I get back
sorry I'm using a hacked version of uh
of mice of my Chrome or Mozilla so it
doesn't show up the for Firefox it
doesn't show the UH the URL bar but
unfortunately it doesn't show the URL
bar ever um so we need a presentation
mode so anyway um this is this is an
example of fork/join concurrency um so
this is really slick because we have
some data that's owned by the local
stack frame namely the or somebody it's
owned by somebody maybe it's not owned
by local stock right and some of you
borrowed but the point is that we can
split the input array into four chunks
hand them off to threads and have them
process those things concurrently and
then but just passing out pointers not
making copies the data and then we like
do our processing and get a result back
of course you wouldn't typically do this
for something like Mac's that's kind of
stupid but this is just the illustrative
um there's a caveat which maybe we'll
get to we'll see so okay but why Ross
why why uh why is Mozilla doing this and
the simple answer is because it's the
only way we see it be competitive
um we don't have enough of a work force
to especially with a volunteer work
Basin so on that we you know we need to
compete but C C++ it impedes our
productivity too much so for fast
experimentation with new ideas into the
future of what web browsers can do um we
needed a different we want a different
system for that
so in particular we have this thing
called servo it's a separate project
it's a browser research Platt
implementation research platform it's
written in rust it's this codes open
source etc and so we're using that to do
experiments like things like doing pair
of penny and parallel or doing parallel
layouts or parallel CSS selector
matching various experimental things um
so one more thing I note about goals
here because you might think that we're
all totally focused on static safety and
whatnot but in fact rust is more than
happy to use dynamic checks to ensure
soundness when appropriate because you
know what is sound is anyway it's not
okay to have seg fault in our opinion
but a clean shutdown of the system when
you have some internal invariant broken
that's actually okay in our book you
bugs if you can recover from a bug in
some way and actually shut down system
cleanly that's not the same kind of risk
that a snake vault represents so we
actually have warms for doing that kind
of clean shutdown and then doing a you
know proper unwinding of a stack much
like what yarn was talking about today
with doing using destructors and having
exceptions and properly cleaning up
after them but you know we use static we
do static analysis where we can so how
are we gonna get this how we get this
done what's the main piece the main
pieces to this again I wish that I've
redone this in terms of yarns talk so
move semantics is a huge huge part of
our story and it's basically something
that's built in the language from the
ground up because it gives us much
direct control and direct expression of
what the resources are that you're
representing your program um and we have
this notion of borrowing which gives it
back references we'll be talking about
that later and then finally we have
lifetimes their way of actually putting
constraints on the references in the
system so you may have noticed during
beyond talk somebody mentioned about how
if this is after after the timeout that
they're mentioning wait a minute you're
giving back a reference there and yet to
ensure that outlives sorry that doesn't
how live the thing it's referencing into
and he was like yep you do but okay
uh-huh
that's the programmers job to ensure
that their and rusts you can actually
encode it and it statically checked so
this is a demo of MooMoo semantics I'm
not gonna play too much but the main
idea is that you have this vector you
create and then you actually can modify
it and then when you make a call like
this some call over here you actually
are moving that resource to that other
call site and thus it can't access it
after that point and likewise if you
then take effect as an argument and you
don't move it somewhere else then at the
end of your scope it's cleaned up just
like in c++ --is model of resources okay
not everything is moved it doesn't make
sense like move an integer
you just really copy those they don't
represent the resources but so there's
this notion of things that are like
resources and thus can't be copy of like
that and things that are not resources
and there's the interface called copy
represent this and then there's a
selection of errors that I have to
illustrating here but I don't want to
take too much time on it the point is
that you catch we catch you when you
make mistakes trying to access things
that moved you can check out this light
yourself the big problem here of course
is that you just had a language with
only with move semantics it would be
unusable this is not a work this you
can't just rely on using move semantics
because you need to reuse stuff from
time to time so this is where you need
pointers and the answer then is how we
you know bring pointers back and the way
we do it is by we reuse the syntax of
C's address of operator but it's
conceptually a bit of a different notion
it's not that were mean we are taking
the address of something but I prefer to
think of more abstractly that we're
borrowing a reference to that data and
then handing that out so that's what a
borrow looks like so okay we have
borrows great everything solved right no
no you see that we're bringing back all
the same problems we had before with it
because the reason that bugs happen is
because well a reason that you can't
just statically detect all the bugs in
the world largely because of aliasing it
becomes too hard to analyze code and
borrow experience and reduce aliasing so
what do we do we restrict it and the
analogy here that I've come to
appreciate is when you're doing
concurrent systems programming there's
the notion that there can use a notion
of abstraction called a reader/writer
lock where you either have many readers
at once that only have read-only access
or you have one writer that has
readwrite access and it's exclusive
access to the thing and we have a
similar model in rust so this is
including the type system statically
there's types T there's things that
correspond to the readers that are
ampersand T and there's things that
correspond to writers that have
exclusive access and that's ampersand
mute T so here's some concrete examples
those types again so if you're doing a
read of data then you take an ampersand
back and that'll let you hit read access
to the data but you can't for example
move strings out of that vector because
you're only you can't do that here
because the vector you only have
read-only access to it you can't do
things like change its
you can only just take references into
it or you could modify the vector so
here we can actually take them and
percent mute back and then push things
on to it and finally you can have
something you transfer ownership the
vector and this actually consumes the
vector by iterating over it and this
code is kind of funny what it's doing is
it says oh I take the vector I do a for
loop but then if I see anything at all I
take the object which now I've actually
moved out compared this bottom example
for the top one the top one I'm not
allowed to move the first element of
vector out with it but in the bottom
that's the only that's happening is
moves of each element out of the vector
because it's being consumed in that very
first line okay
this is what call it looked like it
should be pretty intuitive based on what
I said before in terms if there's
ampersand B for taking a read only
borrow that's alias go
ampersand mute be for the read read
write one and then no ambition at all
from when you're gonna transfer directly
I don't know if I really want to talk
too much about this looks like what the
issue here is that I haven't gotten too
many questions yet and there are a lot
of slides here um so I'd like to get
some input from the audience about where
we should go
so okay lifetimes oh shoot that means we
do need to talk about this okay back to
this then Oh so okay so I was talking
before about borrowing and here's some
concrete example when you borrow
something there's an indefinite extent
that we represent statically within the
compiler that corresponds roughly the
lexical scope it's kind of like lexical
scope except there's some finer grained
things that don't they don't correspond
to explicit variables sometimes but here
I've made it very explicit by explicitly
binding all the intermediate represent
you in tirmidhi a trip expressions for
the borrows it happened so you can see
that our two is being borrowed the very
bottom there and its scope is strictly
less than our ones and then those are
each less than V 2 and V 1 okay and then
when you do it you make a call like foo
each call to foo has to choose the
appropriate scope to plug in for it yes
absolutely good question we have macros
sorry um so I
I love macros do I actually say that
somewhat facetiously but yarn really
seemed like he had sinned against them I
guess if we were awesome we would figure
out a way to do it true true
we have hygienic macros that's the oil
sort of we taught we trying really hard
we'll probably even better later but the
point is they're mostly hygienic and so
four constructs the way that instead of
having variable arity constructors like
in C++ to do things like that
construction instead we have a Beck
macro that construct an empty vector and
then pushes each element onto it and
then we that succinctly summarized in
this Beck bang or Beck exclamation point
on their product house it back to us the
talk sorry um
so likewise the print Linn down here
print min bank that's another macro it's
a lot like C's printf function except
it's a macro and thus it can like check
that your arguments that you give
actually correspond to the template
string and it statically checks this yes
oh you do it right okay all right so why
do we need a bang micro some people like
to get the immediate visual feedback
that a macro is there and they believe
that it's necessary for humans and or
for tools to tell you that there's a
macro here I'm a scheme person so I
don't understand this logic but I accept
it I think there's also I think that the
parser knows about macro so it consumes
like everything so I think that I I
believe I believe that problem could be
solved I could be maybe not that's an
interesting point it depends on how you
deal with name resolution if you
interleave name resolution and parsing
then you should be able to deal with
that but we don't currently do that so
that's actually a good point
I don't think we could do it with rust
as of today or yesterday but I don't but
I think that rust in the future would be
able to deal with that that detail okay
thanks yeah okay so that's great the
bangs are the macros but like the other
thing here that's new
syntax is the input to the foo function
here it's not just taking a reference
but it has a reference with explicit
like time on it that lifetime tick a so
it says this is a reference that lives
for at least as long as 2 K whatever
Takei is and what is Takei the compiler
has to figure that out you know we don't
currently have a way well
we typically don't try to explicitly
instantiate the Takei's here instead
that we let the compiler to it so okay
the main point here is that we have a
borrow checking system that checks for
errors here in terms of your use of
these lifetimes so here v1 got moved by
the consume call and there's still as
outstanding reference to r1 and if you
attempted then call foo with r1 the
compiler checks this and catches you it
says no no you can't do that and it
gives you a precise error message saying
you can't move out of you know who's the
blame here it's it's a call to foo or
the call to consume there's not enough
information to actually you know pick
one so the compiler says oh you probably
meant didn't mean to move v1 out here
because you still are gonna read from it
potentially down here and it's called a
foo but the point is we tell you about
both points and so you can figure it out
ok now ok this is a clearly a case where
this was a you know buggy program the
system we have is naive we have to admit
this it's based on lexical scope and so
even if there is no call to read after
the call to consume I wanted to compare
these two slides so I had a call to foo
and that was definitely wrong but even
if I get rid of the call to foo the
current compliation model um it still
treats that as an error it still says oh
are one lives this long and therefore
something's wrong this is going to go
away in the future we are almost certain
I think we'll be able to compile this
code in the future could you explicitly
unset not with our current bottle of
scopes I don't know because that would
be equivalent for example to just moving
our one somewhere else sort of and but
our current model for how our scopes
represented doesn't handle that but I
think the answer here isn't to put it on
the user the answer is to make the
compiler smarter we can make the
compiler smarter about how we represent
these these scopes
regions as we sometimes call them okay
alright so um the main thing I want to
get across here is that even though I
said these are lexical scopes they are
actually non-trivial the computation
involved here and the analysis of all is
not just a simple matter of doing a
trivial analysis of lexical scope of
what of variables in particular in this
example how long should the Baro UM that
I have highlighted with the letter A
there how long should it last
if you read over this code it's C you
can see that r1 is only used in the call
to foo and so it doesn't need to last
very long at all it can last just for as
long as r1 does it doesn't have to
borrow for that borrow be one where it
says a it doesn't need to live longer
than that so that could be a very short
borrow but compare this these two slides
if I change down there so it returns r1
and finds it up to our - now that borrow
needs to live much much longer it needs
to actually live long enough to deal
with the read of r2 as well at the
bottom so that basically means you're
gonna have to have the scope of the
borrow pea effectively as long as b1 so
not trivial so I'm talking about
figuring it so that there's that a there
yeah we need to figure out how long that
borrow last because in particular
imagine if we added a mutation of the
other vector V where that comment is on
this piece of code you could you could
freely mutate V if we had internet I'd
like to go and show you um but you can
freely mutate V and it's not a problem
but borrow can be very short but in this
version of the code now I pass that
borrow and it gets down to our to our
tool is passed where that comment is and
it's up being read yes all right I guess
you so are the scopes always nested all
the examples that you've shown every
there's always nest currently follow a
tree structure yeah there's a strict
nesting I don't think that they may not
be this case in the future
you do have side effects in your
language yeah
side effects yeah absolutely so how does
this play if I let the reference and
escape their global scope um yeah the
compiler will not let you do that unless
you give it unless the debark there are
situations where here the stack this v1
is stacking out it's owned by this local
stack frame and so you wouldn't be able
to actually let the Baro escape its be
something where would there's an example
in a slide later of this but basically
if you have something that's um that's
owned by the local stack frame you
wouldn't be allowed to let the Baro
escape that far it's gonna be a story
straight to this this function call no
that's not true
um but things you've allocated on the
stack frame can't escape the local
borrows the things on the stack frame
can escape the global scope but for
example if there was some static data
and I borrowed a pointer to that that
can escape to a global scope well if
it's statically allocated then it's
static and there's actually a special
lifetime tick static that represents
this yes I mean practice the reality
here is that you wouldn't try to move
things and you don't move things and we
don't remove references like that into
the global scope that often except for
whether it's static data because it
doesn't make sense in terms of having
independent threads that might you know
one might die at any point so moving
into a global variable you there's no
better thing and to put it in global
scope modulo GC stuff so but we don't
have a GC so you know that's yet oh
sorry um
so um yeah it's something where the
place where this really comes up is it's
that not when you have a global scope
but rather if there's some function um
lower in your stack frame like very deep
like if at the func of the main the main
entry points if that has it allocates an
arena of stuff that you can dynamically
allocated to and it's owned by that you
know sex it has sex for pushing on the
stack like this and the guy at the very
bottom actually owns an arena that he
can allocate into that's a case where
now you can start having borrows into
things in the arena and put those
references pretty much anywhere
as long as it doesn't outlive your main
function so that's sort of like a global
scope this is a lifetime year program
and that we can actually encode we can
we can encode that you haven't seen
enough yet to see how but we can do that
that sounds like it requires full
program analysis no it requires editing
your functions that explicitly annotate
that this lifetime is being passed in
and then flows out essentially we
definitely keep allocate like malloc
free but we don't have a GC heap yet
yeah what does the quote a stencil
yeah the ko a that's an example of a
lifetime so that's the syntax quote a is
our explicit notation for a lifetime and
so that first foo of angle brackets to K
that means I am parametric over a
lifetime I am for any tick a for any
scope that someone might choose so the
cost of food each call that there's two
calls of foo here and each one can
choose an independent lifetime that's
the crucial thing about why this code
right now works in the sense that that
first call that foo our one can use a
very short lifetime that instantiate for
the tick' but then the call the very
bottom who are two is almost certainly
going to choose an entirely different
lifetime it's certainly a longer one do
you have do you have true virtual
dispatch in your language through what
virtual dispatch virtual special
absolutely yes yes do you have lifetime
yes
we we don't have virtual dispatch over
it so you don't you can't have a method
on a virtually dispatch method that
itself is parama type parametric we
don't have that but we do have lifetime
parametric city even for virtual for
virtual methods because they are erased
at compile time they don't they don't
have a runtime representation they are
solely for ATM compiler and doing this
analysis to determine that you've safely
all of your accesses are safe so is the
lifetime annotation necessary or the
compiler inferred the lifetime so we
only do type it we don't do global type
of type analysis don't do global type
inference so the type annotations a
lifetime annotation is necessary because
we're trying to avoid that and not even
I don't know how it work to try to infer
the Y times it's not clear to me what
the right way to do that would be in the
first place it seems like a hard problem
Thanks so that was my question but then
I heard you have a like addition but I
don't know yes that's that's that's you
know we might get there um yeah you know
what we must move there um sure
well go straight to elision and then
we'll come back so elision yeah the
basic idea here is that you know yeah
these two K's and tic these are ugly so
yeah this was some example code um where
you're taking in like x and some of
these examples are actually taking in
multiple lifetimes because there's
independent references that might have
independent their their data they point
to might actually one might died before
the other and so this is the very
explicit form where you've actually made
every lifetime for every reference
explicit but you can actually the
language we allow you to actually allied
lifetimes and these essentially
basically the rule is if it's obvious
what you meant um then you can avoid it
and it's I don't unfortunately don't
think I have an example right now have a
case there there's also the case entry
returning a lifetime so if you take a
single this first function up here this
print one if it returned
a reference even that could be elided
because if you only take in one
reference then it's clear that the only
same thing you could do if you return a
reference is to use the same lifetime
for that reference that's not a hard
percent true there's another scene
there's another scene option but this is
the best choice it's on the prior fly
was um I can go back yeah go back real
quick oh right how much port one else's
do you need to do - you'll need one
layer down to the compiler doesn't after
like follow the the chain of lifetime
analyses from one point to the next to
the next it's essentially function local
um there isn't there is one thing we do
have closures in the language and so
those don't have explicit types on them
so there is the analysis does need to
have to in oh if you have a closure in a
closure expression in a function then it
does have to dive into that but
especially parla compliation units in s
infer things there but yeah the way with
your virtual dispatch is the signatures
are explicit um I'm not sure if I
understand the question maybe um but we
don't infer the but of the signature for
a function for like a top level function
or a method yes you can say for example
this lifetime must outlive this other
lifetime yeah no I don't know I don't
know slide of it doesn't you mean but
spatially static is the oldest one right
it's the sort of obvious semi obvious
thing so he's like a linear thing I
don't think I call it linear because you
might have
there's unrelated lifetimes okay okay
thanks developers to get their head
around this this is like that's a great
question um it's interesting we are
still working on pedagogy here um
for example there's an active debate
about whether been teaching this should
you show the lifetimes explicitly from
the outset or should you leave them out
and then show them later
my impression so far
is that people get it eventually but the
harder part I think is they first have
to get the ownership model once they
sort of get that and understand that you
know things are going automatically
Bialik because we're talking about some
programmers here where it's like Ruby
programmers who aren't used to a C++
style you know ra Ã­Ã­- you allocate the
thing here and it's deallocate of the
scope they're not so used to that and so
once they sort of understand that piece
of it then the lifetime part kind of
flows from it sort of we have a
fantastic volunteer community actually
I've been amazed by how many non Mozilla
like people who don't care about Firefox
are jumping onto rust um and this is
another bjorn reference so yarn
mentioned how C+ C++ doesn't have a
central community we do like we've got a
great system in terms of having chat
rooms and a really active user base and
people actively contribute the compiler
the compiler is written in rust which
means is super awesome in terms of being
able hacking a compiler in this sound
language but you know still get you know
doing native code generation and whatnot
um I mean LLVM is doing most of the hard
work there to be fair so the point is
that we have an awesome community it's
not just Mozilla it's people from all
over the place
Python programmers a lot of rubyists for
some reason um that I don't quite
understand I got the impression that
some ruby has basically realized that
they needed you know they've said oh I
need I need to make some component
native and they said well I could do it
and see Oba I'm scared of C and then
they found rust and they figured out how
to hook into rust because we've got a
pretty good FFI story and that led to
them you know being able to actually
make rust plugins for Ruby
so speaking of the FFI story could you
say more words about it about which
about typify the basic story there is
that we have one um and if it's so it
basically lets you express right now
it's essentially just less you call in
this thing's with a see call invention
like we've about the rest of all
invention in the sea convention and you
declare what kind of thing you're
working on and you can basically express
most see its types that one thing we're
missing is union like actual union types
we don't have a good story for handling
them directly in our FFI right now you
sort of have to just know what the
representation the compiler is gonna use
unfortunately right now but other than
that you can define structs we didn't
see any struct definitions yet but we
have a strut syntax and basically you
just annotated saying this needs to get
the c representation there's an
annotation system where you can say this
struct need to have the c with style
layout because i'm gonna be using it
passing pointers into it into c code for
example so called does this work with
additional safety measures like
ownerships yeah you need to be that's
the other piece of it so the other thing
I haven't mentioned yet is that sure
this is a safe language but it's also
Assistance Program language so how do
you you know make those things two
things mesh and the answer is that I'm
gonna focused mostly on the safe
language but there is actually a
superset of rust that includes the
unsafe portions of it so what we have is
a construct called unsafe where you can
actually bound a piece of code with an
expression block and then within the
expression block you get to do all the
nasty things like native pointer
dereferences etc and warmth and also FFI
calls you can't make an FF I call
directly you have to it has to be in an
unsafe block so all these things are
basically a big warning signs saying
okay you need to be a little more
careful here and make sure that you get
you away the rules you don't break any
system invariance compiler has less to
rely on and doesn't apply all
definitions it applies all of the rules
for the type note it's a it's a distinct
two sets of types involved um so native
pointers don't look like these reference
types here there's a different syntax
for declaring that kind of type and thus
if you have an unsafe block you
still get all the analyses of things
like that the lifetimes of references
are you know being properly used it's
only unsafe pointers that get treated
what's the right word they're basically
ignored by their comply the compiler at
that point you know trusting the
programmer to do it so how many of these
unsafe blocks that you need to build the
rest compiler I don't have that
statistic handy but it's easy to grep
for um I don't I don't want it the time
to do the grep right now maybe you can
come to me offline the answer is there
is certainly some but there's less than
we used to be like people used to do
crazy hacks in the name of efficiency in
the compiler like things where they said
oh we should be like but we don't want
to deal with reference counting on this
data type so we're gonna like just
allocate it this is on them you know the
heap and just ignore the fact that it's
shared and user need a pointer
everywhere and just trust they would
that we know how the allocation pads are
so that wasn't something that we used to
do but eventually someone said this is
this is unnecessary
once this lifetime system remember I was
talking earlier about the pending a main
function with an arena basically someone
realized hey we can take that arena and
we can these types that we've been doing
unsafe stuff with we can start
allocating to an arena that's basically
has the same lifetime as the grant
compilation unit and then you're assured
that that's the objects to allocate to
that arena live as long as the compiled
current compliation of that function and
so you have a sound and proven sound
approach there so the number of unsafe
walks has gone down over time is the
short answer as the language got better
okay I think that's everyone right
alright so um yeah so we were talking
about sighs about these these um these
read-only borrows and the crucial thing
here is that you have to assume very
aliased as in you know the programmer
does and the compiler does because you
know maybe they were and so that means
that for example down here that's called
the Tri modify it's an error to do that
because you don't know if that vector is
alias by something else and so it tells
you you can't borrow this immutably
borrowed thing as if it's mutable and
that's a bummer because you know my I'm
tired of programmer I want my
algorithms and so this is where the
exclusively borrowed mute bar was come
in where now you can do ampersand mute
and then you can call it modify back and
that works fine and you know ends up
printing one two three four here so a
crucial detail because a lot of people
misunderstand this I misunderstood it
for a really long time
ampersand mute it sounds like it means
oh all mutation must go through this but
that's not actually what it means mmm
most types that need mutation do want to
use this form because most mutation
there's some sort of invariant trying to
maintain where you need exclusive access
to actually properly update that data
structure and so ampersand newt is the
right thing for most mutation but there
is plenty of mutation like if you just
have for example a counter on a data
structure and there's no like
relationship with the other piece of the
data structure there's not a reason to
require a person need access just to
update that counter it can be an atomic
integer that you use in a compare and
swap or our tog
Tomica increment on and so that's
something where we have various types
that don't require ampersand you access
to mutate them so my opinion I know my
motto here is that it's not about as
syntax it's sorry it's not about
mutations about having such access
that's what ampersand mute denotes and
should have perhaps me name something
else to make that clearer those special
types that you can mutate without
requiring the mutable access are there
predefined and supplied by compiler you
can define a custom one there's a mix so
there's there's pre-deployment like
atomic word it's for you know that
that's the kind of thing where you can't
just add new atomic things the community
runtime sister we need processor support
for that but there's also generic types
where you can have their certain you can
talk to about it later but the point is
there are certain cell types that can
hold data one kind is one where it's
basically always forces you to take a
copy of the value and if value isn't
copyable then you're not allowed to even
put it in there and there's another kind
of type a ref cell type where there's
that rule right where you have either
many readers or exactly one
writer one person is host access and the
truth the truth the cute thing about the
ref cell is that it enforces that but it
does it dynamically it's a library type
it's an implemented where it enforces
the rule dynamically and so if you break
the rule you're allowed to you're
allowed to you know attempt to mutate
this thing while there's now setting
borrow and what happens you get a
runtime failure but a clean one it
cleans that shuts down the system
cleanly when it does this it shows on
that read cleanly so it's a crucial
difference from like a segfault or a
data race that may or may not answer
your question okay uh-huh
so how much time do I have here okay so
um again I wanted to point out that
these this is who's versus ownership
thing they seem quite similar and they
are pretty similar but in my opinion the
interesting thing is that ownership is
power the power to mutate plus the
responsibility to actually clean up the
resource while ampersand mute is all the
power you know freely available mutate
it but none of the responsibility you
can't you know in fact it's it's worse
than others ones ability you can't drop
it you can't clean it up um you can't
you best you can do is make it another
one and swap it in which is legal okay
um these are demos of like the various
ways that ampersand mute like you know
these errors that it checks but you guys
can see the slides yourself hopefully
some of you took down that that tinyurl
the beginning um we have method calls we
have virtual dispatch and the
interesting thing about methods is that
um there's you know again the three
kinds of types where you have methods
that just consume the receiver you have
methods that have read access and you
have methods that have exclusive access
the interesting thing about these
methods is that the way it works yeah I
don't have time to I can get into this
in too much detail but the neat thing
depending point of view is the sugar we
have where method invocations will
automatically do the borrows and DRS as
necessary so these calls here to is some
is none and um grab done wrap or the
interface on the top here reflects three
different kinds of argument passing
protocols but the method calls all look
the same
this is a huge boon in terms of like
product programmer convenience we don't
do it for all the other argument it's a
special thing about the self argument
they've won that's the receiver and the
method call but it's a huge reason why
you're not just wasting all your time
figuring out how many stars or
ampersands we need to put in you get
away with a lot with this rule yeah okay
we have smart pointers I don't think
I've time to talk about them say only 30
seconds too bad we talked about light
emulation we have generics the one thing
I want to point out here is that you
know we have parametric polymorphism but
it's not and we have F bounded
polymorphism so R Us is not C++ we have
basically C+ those concepts already in
the language we checked them at the time
you define the trait so here this trait
this this we're sorry the time that you
time to define the method this method
you can't print this thing or this T
because it doesn't have the right
interface provided oh you don't have
much time for your question it's better
people what's hash mark test yeah that's
that's we have two unit testing built
into the language um so you annotate
empty function function with no
arguments is unit test and that means
that when you run when you compile the
compiler or the special mode it
generates a binary that that runs all
your unit tests this is just you know
search software engineering awesomeness
that just has come up over the years so
the thing I wanted to hopefully get to I
don't know if I actually have time or
not all right so the thing I wanted to
talk about besides f9 and polymorphism
is that we have these traits right which
are like Java interfaces you explicitly
say what method something has and then
you use that as bounds on a type
parameter okay that's that's interesting
but it's sort of old hat the interesting
thing is that that kind of programming
doesn't suffice in all cases this is in
particular if you have a mix of things
on an array where you have both a rect
struct and a circle struct you can't mix
those things into a you know to a um a
parametrically or a parametric array
where all the types of Li the same that
doesn't work because you need be the
same type all the way through it has the
uniform so the crucial thing is you need
auditory programming right
to be able to actually have virtual
dispatch and the awesome insight that
rust has is it takes the same system
that you use for trait bounds are used
for these you know for ballad play
morphism and it just turns them into
objects by saying if you have a the way
we code this is by saying if you have a
reference to a trait that basically
means you have a special fat pointer you
have a pointer to the actual data that
you was you know the actual
representation type and you have a
second word that's part of this fat
pointer that points the be table and
this is a really cool way to get it's
not the same as a class hierarchy that
you have instead this is an arbitrary
sort of graph structure where the traits
can inherit from each other and you're
just passing things around and the B
tables are part of the pointer
themselves so this is really cool ok but
you know this crowd probably doesn't
care as much about it oop is that well I
don't know actually there's a lot of
Java's for people here right right I'm
being curry on so I'm thinking FP but
okay point is we have we have closures
as well um you don't need the reminder
bubble closures look like so this is
yeah this is the slide if somebody
wanted way way along ago the bar syntax
our syntax for closure expressions and
you know you can define closures so yeah
that's nice we're gonna skip this you
know time um we have our III we have the
structure it's just another trait you
have with this trait and you get a
destructor boom so there's a simply
example but also the more important
thing is this is an example of how our
reference count this is a simplified
version of our reference counting system
so it's just another piece of rusts code
that if a reference our C pointer is
just an influence drop to properly
maintain the count oh it's such a shame
we don't time I guess come see me after
because this is a this is a really
awesome part but we didn't get to talk
just talk about it all
