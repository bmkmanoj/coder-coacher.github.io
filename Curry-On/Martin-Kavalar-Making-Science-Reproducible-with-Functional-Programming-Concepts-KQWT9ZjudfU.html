bit and so yeah at next journal we're
solving this problem of writing
reproducible research by actually
building a time machine for science and
so if you search for advice on how to
make your work reproducible here's one
thing that comes up it's the ten simple
rules and they go like this for every
result keep track of how it was produced
avoid manual data manipulation steps
version control all custom scripts it's
just a simple list of ten items it's
really long
and it's really complicated I believe so
it involves doing a lot of manual work
and just gets more complex with each
additional tool that we use and we see
only a tiny percentage of papers out
there today are actually reproducible
and I believe this is because this is
way too hard all right so I believe
scientists need better tools to automate
this work something bread Victor has
been arguing about for many years and it
was his article on climate change that
has been a major inspiration for us
which now brings me back to our time
machine for science so to achieve
reproducibility we need to capture state
at all levels of our research
environment and enable reverting back to
previous States so traveling back in
time like for us as developers get as
our time machine but this works mostly
for code probably everybody here uses
get and get up and it's hard to ignore
the massive impact these tools have had
on software development but for science
we have to consider more than just
source code so the idea of scientific
research tool mixes pros state
computational results figures what's
commonly described as a literate
computing environment what you see here
is a fully reproducible article in next
journal to make just reality we need to
enable time travel on several levels so
this has to work first on the language
process then we have to consider the
environment this process runs in next we
have to consider input data and results
and lastly the document itself so let's
first look at doing time travel on the
process so this is an example from
Jupiter a tool that's popularized
literate computing and brought us a step
closer to reproducibility so what we do
we start by defining a variable and in
the next cell we make a change to it so
look what's happens if I delete the
first cell andrey executes the second
one
so here in Jupiter things are just
running in global state on top of each
other which is why I'm now in this like
inconsistent state I'm missing the
definition for X and ya my document
isn't reproducible anymore and I'll only
notice this if I restart the kernel and
re execute everything from scratch and
now I get an error like I expect so this
is a pretty simple case here but as the
document grows this actually becomes a
pretty big problem like I'm using
somewhere down in my document I'm
reassigning a variable from up there and
I have to rerun my whole code from the
top in order to get these results back
and here we look like what how that
works in next journal like compared to
Jupiter which runs on this global state
here old code cells are running in
isolation by default so we do the same
thing here define a variable X which is
1 add another cell where we try to
increment X
but in contrast to Jupiter I now do get
an error here yeah um as these are
running in isolation but I do need to
access global state often times so you
can explicitly change the scope a cold
cell runs in so it actually does have
access to the variables above if I do
change the state like this and now you
get to like you would expect but what I
can do now also is in the third code
cell I can use the scope of the first
and still have access to the previous
value of the first cell where X was
still one
enters another thing instead of relying
on scope to pass the area around you can
also run in isolation and access values
that other cells define so here I'm
changing the scope back to be isolated
local scope and then I'm actually
printing out the value of x and now you
see it if I do change the code of the
first cell I won't have to like I'm
making your code change that changes the
code but let's X keep the same value so
just making it 2-1 and you'll see that
the second code cell will re execute but
the third cell because the value is
still X is still one doesn't need to be
reevaluated
so here we avoiding these inconsistent
States users don't have to do any manual
work and yet you can imagine as this
grows more complex that that saves a lot
of work compared to like having to
constantly stop and make sure like run
on continuous integration to ensure your
stuff stays reproducible for others so
how does this work um we use a
relatively new kernel extension called
checkpoint restore in userspace
to do a memory snapshot of the running
process we can archive that to disk and
yeah that way we can go back to to any
previous state of of a process and yeah
as this is a kernel feature this is
language agnostic so it works with all
these imperative languages secondly on
the back end we model each culture as an
elixir against age process
um and so these code cells form are
directed acyclic graph
um and using n stage to subscribe to new
values of other cells
so before you so before you talk more
about the architecture I'm just a little
curious about how so the stuff that
you're showing us before it's hosted I
presume right and then you have the
stuff that you showed us before is
hosted right so you have it it's like
offering this as a service and then you
have Julia and a few other languages
right yeah um and then now you're
describing basically how the you know
how the backend works and you know but I
guess my question is how easy is it for
you to add other languages or is there
some way for users to have like a
version checked out locally or something
that they can use so that let's say I'm
on a plane and I want to work on my
paper is there any way for me to execute
some julia code in my browser like you
know on a plane like how i mean is it
all hosted or you some kind of offline
capabilities well so yeah we we do work
on a standalone version as well but yeah
at the moment it's it's all hosted but
yeah we've gotten that feedback a lot
that yeah people need to work on planes
yeah I think it might be something we
did like just to offer support to edit
your document while offline but the code
evaluation might stay yeah remote for
what
I was curious what the serialization
methods you use to do to pass data in
between these alright so um yeah so we
have to the Creole stuff as a fallback
like to use a global state and that's
also like we do this because yeah you
can see relies all object especially
across languages so yeah for now we do
like JSON encoding for some type of data
and for data frames we're using a like
Apache arrow this is like this column or
fatter based on pecchì arrow which is
this columnar serialization yeah but
this is actually something like we we
plan to have user extensible so yeah
people can be find our own coders and
like yeah define more tests or yeah hook
into the system and choose whatever they
want
so this looks pretty nice for some
smaller or medium-sized programs but
what if my paper involves me forking
some huge project and changing a little
bit and so how do I run that big thing
from inside the journal thing to get
some results if I want to version them
or call out to some external thing yeah
that's something where we're still
figuring out so yeah we I think um yeah
that's that's certainly a use case we
have in mind down down the road as well
for now we're focusing on these like
stuff that works on one machine
basically but it would certainly be nice
to run like molecular dynamics
simulations or stuff like that stuff
that takes weeks and like yet have have
capabilities to like stream data back to
the platform um and like what you're
like also like autumn I made these kind
of kind of tasks like getting the data
out there starting this program and and
get the data back again
yeah sure sure sure is there a way to
send data like I run the thing on my
machine okay it's maybe not perfect but
I run my big simulation on the week on
my server and then I send the results to
your at the moment there isn't yet but
yeah we certainly want like such a
document to have an endpoint yeah where
you can get data back to it all right
then yeah next thing to consider is the
environment our process runs on um so
what do I mean by that um yeah the
reality is that most code runs of this
shape on this shaky foundation of
constantly changing that dependencies so
we have the operating system system
libraries run time length the language
runtime and packages like this problem
is commonly known as dependency hell and
yeah what here just an illustration of
how this works so the certain article
that uses the Yahoo API to plots Apple's
stock price you can get it to work and
so that API was actually it broke like a
month ago so we have to install this
additional package which works around
the problem and fixes it so here I'm
trying to like because this is an
isolated cell I can just delete the
package or the cell and room to import
here and test it like reverting those
changes of the installation like this is
something like we're often having having
problems doing like we keep installing
stuff on our virtual machine but we
don't know what where the commands that
actually
what was the stuff that was actually
installed and how do we get back to this
like yeah get back to previous states
and what did we actually need to install
for this stuff to run and yeah reverting
like installing a package often brings
dependencies with it which we also want
to get rid of and this solves this
problem also saving a lot of time by
being able to split up these into
individual pieces of work as we as we
choose and yeah not always having to run
stuff from the beginning all right so
yeah this is made possible by filesystem
snapshots so yeah we're using docker to
store immutable snapshots of the
filesystem and archive them forever and
yet you don't ever have to worry about
this this just happens automatically
also hopefully saving users a lot of
work
next
all right yet then I'd look at time
travel on results and and data and yeah
just to give you another example here
this is like a Python article that uses
some data from NASA's open next project
a prediction of the maximum mean
temperature in Chicago for the next 50
years and like given this this filename
here I can upload like new contents into
that file and without ever having to
like fiddle with file names or anything
I can rerun that code and it will like
behind the scenes it does content
addressing so yeah I don't have to worry
about manually versioning those files
the article just uses a reference to
their file and I can also undo this
again
yeah like I said so data is
automatically versions and content
addressed so our we've looked at like
versioning the process its environment
and its data and the last thing we have
to consider is the document itself so
what we do here changes to a document
are described as as data and we just
keep that list of events that change the
document and are able to deduct any any
state of our articles by purchasable in
order and so yeah like using this
I guess this mom alright so here I'm
able to go back in the browser to remote
versions of our documents curious you
talked about time traveling what if like
for example I have a few people
collaborate with me on a paper and they
do some changes and they want to merge
or something like that which we're
pretty used to from software development
do we have some facility to merge a
rebase around all so yeah at the moment
we do yeah it's just live collaboration
and yet this works on a per node level
basically and it's just last right wins
yeah which actually works well in
practice so far and yeah we want to do
like next to operational transform to be
able to support merges and and Forks
okay so yeah like the github pull
requests workflow model is something we
certainly want to have in mind here and
want to support so yeah this is so this
time travel on the document is done
using event sourcing using closure
scripts immutable data structures that
make it feasible to do all of this in
the browser any questions so far
all right so yeah we we certainly want
to enable um
reuse and like rapid exploring of like
so not just have this available for the
authors but for the readers so they can
dig in and understand this data better
as they're playing with it and yeah also
to do more more complex workflows like
what we don't support at the moment yet
is like so these code cells can be seen
off as as functions of their like
depending on what well use from other
cells they subscribe like yeah labeled
arguments of those values and yeah you
could imagine calling those with other
arguments and yeah if this was possible
like you could integrate any kind of
yeah complex workflows you can think of
and yeah like getting that to work and
make it perform well is the tricky part
we're we're certainly open to any
suggestions also like how to like we're
trying to keep this like the API to
integrate languages as simple as and as
open as possible so like you can
actually like without any work without
writing any custom code to integrate any
any kind of programs that just like read
data from files and process like write
to standard out and and write data back
to files just okay I have some questions
now so
but what so what how do you export your
notebooks so let's just say I mean maybe
I want a PDF or maybe I want like a
markdown file or something of like the
current snapshot that whatever reason I
can't send a link you know maybe there's
somebody who works at a company who has
like restricted internet access or
whatever which is pretty realistic in a
lot of industries so I want to send
somebody my results like how do I get
how do I get something out to give them
uh yeah so we just at the moment we just
do like you can get a JSON out of our
yeah just this is just this tree of the
notes
um but yeah we definitely want to see or
exporting to latex
yeah exactly like that you know you
can't separate academics from our PDFs
from academics it's just impossible I
mean I don't think that most people
outside of academia find PDS
particularly like practical however you
know nobody nobody reads papers so much
like on blogs or anything anymore I mean
there are many HTML versions of lots of
articles on the internet but most of the
people are still downloading PDFs that
don't to read them so I mean if you're
going to export la tech awesome but then
the next question about exporting la
tech is that people do horrible crazy
things with la tech where they try to do
ridiculous formatting or let's say I
like to do type theory so maybe I have
some some inference rules or something
like that's going to be hard then to
import into your into your into your
system to actually put in the notebook
because you have to use some special law
tech package for that so I guess I guess
my observation which is kind of half an
observation and half a question is you
know are you thinking very much about
trying to you know trying to make this
notebook play nice with la tech in case
I want to actually make a notebook with
my my my typing rules for example um so
I think the like what we're focusing on
now is like actually like making
generating the results easier so I
probably see just more useless like
generating supplementary material do you
revert then like we should like
replacing PDFs for for people and yeah
so I also think collected yeah it's
it's difficult for like to always get
this PDF route presentation hey thank
you for showing us this stuff and I'd be
keen to re-examine the premise because I
think there was a list of stuff that you
said was hard and I guess my reaction
would be like those a girl's not hard
and there's a bunch of other stuff that
doesn't seem that hard and so I wonder
if you could explore some of that
because if I'm a little concerned my gut
reaction is that this is a like a bad
abstraction and that sorry this is
really pretty but yeah I'm nervous that
you're kind of closing a lot of stuff
off and centralizing things whereas an
open system might be a bit better for
this I might get a bit more pickup but
yeah yeah sorry
so um yeah I think it's like we're like
as we're crossing like different tools
yeah it's like in the stuff I worked
with I did my diploma thesis and like
bioinformatics and so I went into this
group and like every student that comes
there has to figure out the stuff from
from scratch again and I think like
compared to if you if you had good ways
to automate these processes like you
could could save months of work for
every new person joining this team and
also like all the knowledge that is
created like it lives on these people's
machines and then when they're gone it's
it's gone again mostly so I think
they're there yeah there is a big
problem that needs to be fixed I do know
that like a closed system can't be the
answer
No so so one idea we have about that yet
so as these things are immutable and
content addressed like distributing them
is pretty trivial actually so yeah some
projects we're looking at this for
example ipfs this distributed
peer-to-peer file system and yeah we
certainly like yeah we don't want to
lock people in into the system we want
to provide value for them by like
ensuring things are running smoothly
that you can run your computations then
and you don't have to worry about
manually ordering servers or shutting
them down again so we want to save
people time and money but ya don't want
to lock them in and like if like we'd
certainly plan on open sourcing this
stuff but at the moment we're we're
still moving pretty fast and we're not
ready yeah for it just yet
hi um so I have like more general
question I guess maybe you've kind of
already answered it but so the whole
premise is reproducible science
I guess so what if what if I have some
sort of code that somehow accesses the
outside world like for example just it
uses the current date or something and
how how can we make such things
reproducible um yeah so or what do you
mean by making that reproducible in that
case well I thought the premise was that
we always want the same results so if we
if we won some arbitrary code we should
always expect the same results right all
right so so and yeah I mean these are
languages that like you can do any kind
of side effect in those hotels yeah and
yeah we're not going to stop that so
what we're doing we're more like we're
chopping this up into tiny pieces so
compared to always having to run
yourself from top to bottom and like in
your first cell your installation of a
package breaks because this doesn't
exist anymore you can choose to run
these cells rerun these cells and
individually so yeah you can choose
where to enter in your document so
cutting up this this problem a bit into
pieces and like one of the projects that
actually second light without much
information on it so yeah this is
actually something that functional
package managers look at addressing so
like there you have this these actually
help you to like for pretty much
everything you've seen in the dependency
hell graph like yeah from
system libraries to the language itself
to packages in that language these
functional package managers help you to
build your stuff in ways and ensure that
this is actually reproducible on a bit
per bit level yeah so this is one
solution to the problem where we're
playing around with this at the moment
and it's quite yeah encouraging hi I
yeah I was I was thinking about next a
bit so I'm glad that you went to this
slide so what I'm wondering with respect
to next you said you were you just said
you were you're thinking about it I go
to choose I'd be interested to sorry I'm
interested to hear about your thoughts
for making Nick's org Wix easy to use so
I imagine so I've used I run my system
on Nixon it's certainly not user
friendly I think most most researchers
writing papers don't want to deal with
it so not yeah I think so what what
should happen there is so we so both of
these systems have these like global
store of content addressed packages
which is also append-only and has some
like pretty nice consequences of stuff
you can do if you have that so with
gates there's also like running only
free software so to make this work
nicely for a lot of stuff like people
want Conda people want to compile stuff
with Intel MKL and to make this work
nicely so yeah on the one hand you have
to provide yeah
substitutes so binary packages so
installation is fast you don't want to
always compile stuff yourself and yep
for making this nice to use I think yeah
there should
just an interface where you select the
package if you don't specify the version
it will use the latest but then it will
like it will know what that version is
at that point and you'll always be able
to get to that environment and yeah just
should also I think happen behind the
scenes without the users yeah having to
deal with this as you say
hi have you maybe looked also into like
a more general question maybe like how
could you with a kind of a minimal
product improved the situation that you
found yourself in in the bio informatics
department but maybe also in other
departments concerning this reusing of
knowledge and kind of tracking what's
going on and because I've also looked at
it into the space a bit and I saw some
efforts from words Cunningham I think in
where he is trying to expand Wikipedia
to a more federated situation I'm not
sure if you've you know not at Yahoo
suits
I was just wondering like at there this
seems like a very fruitful approach for
like a programming perspective but maybe
there is a more general question of
versioning stuff and that could help a
lot of scientists in general to have
more reproducible results on a more like
basic level
because I can imagine a lot lots of
people just working Word documents and
that's read all over the place like is
there like a minimal you have an idea
about like a minimal approach that could
we would be useful by a lot of people
but I still would improve the situation
um yeah I think like something like ipfs
like or are you thinking out more on the
on the document side or so ipfs is this
like peer to peer system for storing
files and so it's yeah it's it's using a
lot of different concepts underneath so
it's actually this this myrtle is it
myrtle tree or virtual deck so similar
to get so you have content of the rest
file
and cryptographic hash like because of
cryptographic hashing you don't need to
trust any of the peers and yeah on top
of like so you can very easily like
store a file system tree version in it
or can think of storing documents in it
and also establish trust like yeah
using this cryptographic hashing like
you or you can establish links between
those things that never break and each
user like each peer can choose like what
files he wants to keep in a system like
this is called pinning on yeah so this
is one general solution I can think of
but yeah from a document side I I don't
know anything um so I actually wanted to
follow up on that and it's about I'm
sorry I'm gonna keep being annoying
about logic I'm so sorry
but so this is one way I think that for
example you could reach like a whole
like broader swath of fields if I mean
maybe not just la tech but if you wanted
like typeset better typeset you know use
some special la tech package to typeset
some math in a special way then
basically you target all of the math
community and perhaps they want to show
you know let's say that there's some
math that generates a certain I don't
know plot of some kind that's
interesting I mean they could then do
this bolt in the same in the same window
basically you could typeset your math
and then you could show some interesting
drawing that that that math generated
for example and I mean you could have
both the math and then the code that
generates that which is exactly
reproducible right yeah um so I don't
know I mean I I know I you know I'm
freaking out about la tech but seriously
I like most of the science people on the
planet are glued to LA Tech except for
the physics people they do things I want
in word for whatever reason but on that
point though I think you should really
really super consider more la tech like
reusability basically yeah so like
formulas we do support like yeah yeah
and you think they need to control on on
that level right hi about ipfs how can
you do to make sure a documentary
stirring it will keep available even if
your hard drive crash crashes can you do
something - Felicity to say okay the
document I'm pretty sure it will stay
available for something so how to keep
data available as it crashes or
available of a other ipfs I if there is
something like this um well yeah so you
can like each node in this cluster um
can can choose what what files it wants
to store and I think I believe there's a
process a project called ipfs cluster
where you can configure like I want like
each piece of data to be stored on at
least three nodes or something like that
and yeah it also does so it's this yeah
distributed hash table that does the
routing like to the closest peer so yeah
if you want to remove big pieces of data
like around it would always collected
from the from the nearest peer and yeah
so I think this a pretty interesting
thing for for science
so I have two comments the first one is
echoing people before we talked about
closed systems and Federation so um in
your answer you talked about a way to
share the file and encrypt it um I want
to like ask again about Federation and
open source oh yeah you did mention open
sourcing um so would you consider after
you do open source uh the probe you know
the web app that puts it all together um
like making it easily federated so that
you can have distributed systems and
like I can spin up my own server running
the code on my local machine and have it
and I can then like use the app without
having to have in it or it wouldn't be a
closed system and that kind of thing and
if you do we consider like making a
package for sandstorm also which is a
thing that my friends made and it's it's
sort of like mmm
it's the purpose of it is to bring the
like promise of Federation and
decentralization to the open web like we
all want um
decentralized things and to spin up our
own servers but like ops is hard so it
like does the ops part as a service but
um and the second part was it's sort of
like using la tech as a platform with
like all of your plugins and then this
is like a platform for that platform
many other things and then that made me
think of the browser so like is it is it
like a la tech browser that you're
looking for sort of like alright I guess
this is sort of what that is but anyway
yeah so um yeah does standalone making
the client a standalone thing um that
yeah works on it's on its own is
certainly something like we we want to
do and yeah we just want to get to a
state like where we're still changing
our document model around and
yeah I think within the next few months
I hope we'll stay stabilized that and
yeah also be in a good position to to
open source that yeah and like down the
road I see us being more of an
infrastructure provider yep then then
like offering the software yeah I think
this should be something yeah people
should be able to run this on their
local machines and then - sandstorm
project oh yeah I think this was
something I um I came across as well um
yeah I mean there we're considering yeah
our options currently um like yeah if we
use something like ipfs or um yeah I
believe as this stuff is like yeah a
Content addressed like sharing it and
transferring it into other systems yeah
shouldn't be so hard anymore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
