mattias racketeer okay so this is is
going to be an interactive talk at least
in the beginning and just to make sure
you actually pay attention and you don't
read your email don't feed your social
networking addictions there's a price to
be one realm of record anybody know what
it is
I'm of record is it Boca finished a
couple of years ago with eight freshmen
I start with twenty five but eight
survived and so at some point I will ask
you a question and the best answer will
get this book the person with best
answer I'll get this book alright so
close your laptop the attention
otherwise in music decent talk let's go
so what's that anybody know just called
out the Jaco record that's the IDE we
are known for that right okay what's
that it's an academic paper about record
so it's one thing okay what's that
anybody know what's the name of the game
I'm Charla it's a game produced by not a
dot which is the studio of Sony the
budget for this game was two hundred
fifty million dollars it's produced in
racket okay
so we live in three different worlds we
started out in the educational world
introducing students to good programming
style that was a wonderful talk just a
moment ago in the neighboring room of
our programming styles we do research on
this programming and we do research with
this programming language and industry
is picked it up - so we straddle all
these lines and we actually deliver on a
regular schedule as if it were industry
but the core team is actually in
academia and this idea was pretty much a
pipe dream for a long time for me I
didn't know how to make it real because
this is far
at some point I hire you Rica cuz
Matthew walked into my office where's
Matthew
holy cows not here there we go
without him I wouldn't be here so I just
want to call out I start my talk with an
acknowledgement it's him who made it
possible right so what is this pat pat
trim so what is this thing there's this
wonderful lie that Haskell is a purely
lazy functional programming language
everybody repeats it everybody spread
this lie and everybody just takes it
with it we all know you're actually
programs more hats more not totally
imperative but they tell I really well
write Python same story wonderful lie
there's one obvious way to do it right
Krista just showed you that thirty five
stars of doing it wrong how my record is
their one line life or racket there
isn't I couldn't come up with one so I'm
going to give you three different ones
the first one is it's a programming
language programming language and
there's a typo in there it's missing a -
right okay so that's not stuttering it
reaiiy really mean that phrase next one
it's a full spectrum programming
language because it is a programming
language programming language and it is
a linguist language anybody know a
linguist - do they anybody know what
linguists think about thinking or do you
think about thinking it's language who
was that it's all language if you don't
have language then you can't get it that
was the question now you can go back to
a social network and the linguist want
to internalize every thought you have
into language if you can't say it in
language you can't sing about it so it's
quite different from that first or the
second one right and all of this lives
in an intense feedback loop
that we created from day one we threw it
out of the harshest possible audience
you can throw an IDE at k-12 students if
you think you have an idea you ready for
the audience try high school teachers
your info trick ok let's go through
these three slogans programming language
programming language many many years ago
somebody wrote a paper about 700
languages you could make it 7,000 or
70,000 now do we really need more than
one because racket per se is a
programming language right why more why
do we need more languages right so
imagine actually programming this this
game this uncharted game right these are
the kind of problems you will encounter
you have to talk about physics you have
to talk about the scenes in the game
transitions between the scenes the music
and many more things like that what
tools do we have as programmers to
express that we have four and one
imagine that
we have methods and classes and you
might have a monad and he comes for free
those are the tools with which we tackle
with which we let people lose on really
deep problems that have their own
language that's the state of affairs in
programming languages Stone Age and the
same is true for English we don't really
speak born English not even for native
English speakers are not one of them but
I have noticed that over many years when
you are in this game design world some
people talk about the story some people
talk about the physics engine some
people talk about music but they have to
get together and noted that by the way
follows that principle very much that's
why they don't think a program but the
first thing that was right is left paren
and unlike you that not afraid of
parentheses all right but you could also
go into a board room right and put
another board room is a company your pin
in the startup maybe and you know that
the CEO talks see you're right and the
CIO talks about you know technology or
an operation seolin there's a legally
sky they speak different languages but
they have a common substrate English
right the English is underneath these
domain language data talk and they
figure out how to talk to each other
with this common thing but what happens
when you do that you use the word
accounts in the financials part you move
it over into English and it pops out
that information if you're out of luck
the accountant from the money world into
an eunuchs account right so clearly it's
not that simple to build these language
and put them together but somehow we
figured it out in English how to do that
it gets worse if you suck so back up
you can our dream is we're not quite
there but we're on our way that's a
research project right so the vision of
racket is that you build these languages
and the common substrate is rack and of
course you all know that different ways
of the different styles of building
dere's owls that embedded deers else and
have fluent in the faces to their host
languages we can do that we have heart
interfaces for little languages that are
outside the thing that works just fine
and the problem is the problem that
we're tackling is we want to build these
things okay I want to glue them together
so they're two problems you see here
right one how do you build these tears
else so that things like the account
word just means the right thing but then
how do you glue the program's together
in these tiers else why do people build
yourself because each cell has its own
little conventions and invariants as we
call them stuff like that
you wanna preserve them at runtime in
addition to having them Ganza at
compilation time
okay so let's tackle compilation first
oh you may know that I am the one who
coined that phrase hygienic macros
decades ago okay so it clearly must be
all about that right and it actually is
true remember this account thingy you
know you do this thing you move it over
and it comes in here and you plug in
UNIX what you do is when you when you
build fluent interface between EDA cells
and ESL's you mesh together syntax from
two places and you better figure out how
to preserve where the words came from so
that mean the right thing like the count
or I can't plug into a phrase that came
from somewhere else okay so that clearly
is something that we need to be able to
do but you can also imagine that this
company has an external language maybe a
European subsidiary
so here's a DSL for you if it still
exists I'm sorry
and of course they want to ship
something in a different language
it's a foreign language an outside
language outside of racket it may not
have friends it has ugly syntax so you
need parsing right you need passing to
bring this language into your world
where you build to yourself okay that's
clearly something else you want you want
to be able to into tune to enlarge the
University of languages that you deal
with actually meckel's absolutely not
that's a small a very small piece of
what we need building languages is much
much more than having the ability to
throw one more macro out that's why I
got up this morning and push back and
gave it I saw I'm somewhere here had
this strange remark that we're not gonna
you don't worry use advantage in fifty
years from now you'll be alive I won't
you will be using this kind of
technology so in racket you can
literally write down modules in whatever
language somebody's implemented for you
of course that's hassling racket which
is the actual racket language there's a
set up language for packages to find
their way into the ecosystem this is a
documentation language for scribbling
the manual that we have our style files
with style guides in there that's half
length type racket our type custom
there's data log and then log is data
log you write down actual data log
syntax and it runs the only difference
is you have to write this line the first
line in there any module is this okay so
to build that kind of thing yeah this
whole stack of technologies that we've
come up with over the last 20 years
since I threw out your project thirty
years since I threw out hygienic macros
and what a pictures one of those many
many features maybe I pick two
what kind of thing you want to be able
to do this is all it takes to get you
started on turning racket into a lazy
racket that's all there is
it's mind boggling and the key to that
is the two keys number one you don't
understand that every application every
function application actually is a
syntax note which is what everybody knew
that but you can reprogram it in our
world you can say I want this thing
function applied arguments be rewritten
from here to there where you have the
suspension this thunk string there as a
land of thing so it doesn't go it's not
gonna run right well what do you do then
what you do then is on the way out of
this module when you provide things that
is module you say from now on don't use
regular application use that don't use
out 1u strict that one the one that
actually takes the argument and runs the
thunk first so the first line tells you
we use every single feature we inherit a
complete length to huge piece and then
we override certain features it's just
one example what we do we call this
linguistic reuse and this man was sure
run back there he's now a pirate has has
a whole dissertation on linguistic reuse
that's an example of what going to do
this many many many technologies let me
pick the last one how do you get a
foreign language with ugly syntax in
this ecosystem of course all you have to
do is you write a parser with our parser
tools but you don't target normal
agencies you just target the macro
system what we call
this whole stack of things everything
comes along the surface syntax
attributes the error reporting nice
checking of things all this comes along
and you can report it back as if data
lock were a native element of your
ecosystem
okay so I've shown you languages that
are reasonably normal full-fledged
kind of general purpose programming
language a log is not as close but you
can imagine actually building like
Naughty Dog did a language for the sound
engineer and a language for the same
composer the language for the physics
guy and they then start programming that
just don't call it programming they call
it describing their scenes describing
their music and you compose them
together into one game engine but to
compose them together you write these
actual programs in these tiers else you
glue them together and you run them okay
and then actual values flow around from
there to here and we better make sense
that when you see you all talk to see if
all everything works out same so lazy we
just build a lazy language if we don't
take care of that thunk that goes into
at one things go wrong so clearly a
value flowing from strict to lazier from
lazy district needs to have something
with it we have to be aware of these
things okay so how do you deal with
values as they go from one language
program to another language program
that's the whole FF eye problem over and
over again it's not we lifted it up many
layers in the trees and you should think
of these things else as a tree structure
and you only have to go down as far the
tree as you need to I should have drawn
a different picture that's the actual
idea so you don't deal with bytes you
don't go through some kind of sea level
in the face you go through the closest
thing that matters and how do you do
that well in the olden days we used to
say good luck think think positive right
hope don't do it
there was a lot of stuff going on we've
done better
we've improved with a lot of tools just
like on the syntactic side of building
languages we also have a whole bunch of
things of building the runtime so these
languages can talk to each other and if
you want example for one thing that they
need to maintain invariance is contract
Sofia this morning peppered Peter with
questions about contracts one of the one
of my former students Clare Albers
actually moved in the closure world and
started doing some of that stuff how do
you actually do contracts well we don't
have contracts baked into the language
because you never know what exact shape
you need what you actually pay into the
language is proxy values of the right
kind but exploring many different ways
we realized we needed two kinds of proxy
values and one we had them ready we
could use them for many different
purposes we call them impersonators and
chaperones so when you do that kind of
thing inside a module or implement
another language you use actually these
things and you compile these contracts
to these things that's one example
there's a whole bunch of other things
that we need to glue stuff together like
event spaces for gooey things or
custodians to keep track of resources
okay and they come up again in a moment
so how all this needs out problem solves
that all the compilation problems solved
or the runtime problem stuff of course
not as I said we are doing research this
is half vision half done but we have
made huge amount of progress and that's
pretty good so when you realize that
gluing together programs in different
languages needs a whole bunch of
mechanisms to preserve things as they go
across these languages right you realize
that you actually want much much more
than an untyped Lisp
modern as it can be you want a lot more
so what we do is and what we've done
over the years we've turned this upside
down we've turn it on the syrup we turn
this diagram on the sideways what do I
mean by that
we start with racket racket okay but we
really want the whole stack of
programming languages fortunately racket
is a programming language programming
language so we can build that stack of
languages so one one particular goal we
have in mind is to build that stack it
turns out the stack is necessary to
build the program in amis programming
part two so it's mutually referential
but you know recursion works kind of ok
so how do we work that so we have a
racket on top of that you may want to
protect your IEP eyes with contracts
maybe you won't actually get them tight
maybe you want very white the red stuff
is not implemented we're getting good
I'll show you an example you moment all
you want to go down the stack maybe want
to have ff5 so you can pull out a C
write C library that counts what
frequencies and have a one line program
to solve Krista's problem right or maybe
you want to drop down to assembly it's
not implemented yet but you should dream
about that you can drop down all the way
to the backstop and do unsafe things at
the bottom if you need to so how does
that work what's that language is
something where normal racket programmer
starts with something like this what you
need to see you is that there's an
interface API provide and it is very
nicely documented the guy took my first
course knows how loop programming styles
no questions out and then there's a
whole bunch of stuff and there's more
there's yellow stuff that's called
defensive programming it's not a bad
idea it's not the worst idea okay but
but what we do in on-site languages we
protect ourselves because otherwise it's
our fault something goes wrong
okay but then the guy who reached the
API just want to read the whole module
that guy when he sees this much how can
we bring this into the API how can we
assure ourselves automatically that
these things work out just fine
that's what a contract is in a general
sense you lift out always defensive
programming into another DSL this is by
the way DSL of course everything is it
is on our world a contract DSL just
expands in the regular rocket lab rates
down there
and you say I get an object it's an
image I get X in a wire and a background
it's also an image these guys clue your
numbers and they in a certain range
pardon the strange syntax for hunting
down ranges don't worry about it some
important you see the yellow dynamically
check every time you call this will
check it out and we figure out hey are
you there and if not we synthesize
wonderful error messages for you because
as I said the Papu keynote many years
ago the slogan was Aerith matter when
things go right everybody's happy when
things go wrong you want to have an
automated very reliable error reporting
mechanism that's what this is about
but you also see oh let me say Robbie
Findley is the guy who did that one
right that's the guy up day on the right
you see this yellow stuff some of that
some of that should be slightly
different color because that really
reminds you of a type so why not go to
types so we pull that type racket I want
to be statically assured that these
things are the first thing is an image
last thing is an image or there's some
typos that should be arranged sorry
we want static assurance that's what a
type system is about okay we can do that
we can move from contract record to type
racket Sam Tobin how's that make that
possible
okay then you go like hey can't we do
more
this is numeric stuff we know how to do
numeric stuff and American strength and
that much we actually have in addition
to verifying the types we can also
validate some of the contracts with
dependent at racket it's going to be
released any time near you somewhere on
a github these two guys are working
independent efforts in this direction
and there's even a more fancier saying
that says we're gonna verify through the
whole program all kinds of contracts
that's by David Byrne horn Marilyn so
you can move up that stack as a
programmer all the way you can enter as
the prototype man and you end up up at
the top of the stack as a verified
developer okay we can go in the other
direction so le bar silly
you should go put in a really cute as
ever and I didn't put the code in it
looks like Lisp wonderful syntax
beautiful index left paren underlined to
the dot right paren everything is
parenthesized but you really program in
c okay and it's all one homogeneous way
of doing it you don't have to switch
worlds you're in one world in what
ecosystem so more of that is coming if
you are a strange loop I recommend you
buy a ticket for racket con I'm not
making any profit on that and we have a
cool sticker I mean at all like she's
coming here I'm gonna go all that with
her for two minutes at the airport but
she is using racket as another kind of
TSL to program in a very different world
in the sap checking as in key world so
you buy the racket interpreter of
whatever your favorite language is but
it actually spins up SMT and that's cool
stuff without verifies programs all the
way down so things are taking out from
here and that is what
is the full-stack programming language
racket is also a linguists language and
Andy said everything you think has to be
in the language well in our world what
we think is let's you talk about money
company guys talking about money right
it's a resource it's a common resource
and we all want so they're all grabbing
it except for one guy who wants to not
let go and what do you need to do that
it that what that means is that programs
India sells go for common resources you
need to maybe just time you maybe space
especially in a game in a game setting
like a Playstation very limited amount
of space your space is definitely a
resource but it could be something like
battery power it could be all kinds of
things a printer a connection to the TCP
ports or whatever resources and what we
really mean man is what we want to say
is if something is at the periphery of
record we need to bring it in we need to
have ways of talking about resources
that means in principle we are really a
little operating system or a little IDE
or all of it okay so that's the actual
food I don't know whether anybody's ever
seen that I stopped the record
professionals use it in mine and to when
you open up all the tools intersection
is all the tools in about five years ago
they're probably more in there now if
you open up all tools you have a whole
bunch of them like module Viewer board
IV we have the advert this for about 15
years and to and to get an IDE going of
course we have functional programmers so
unlike Peter this morning you said well
of course we didn't apply infernal or we
do build everything in
racket so the question becomes and
that's that our that's one of the
elements we need to do the explore
racket as a real programming language
our since what does it take to build
everything inside that's what I mean the
linguist starts and I'm not gonna go
into a lot of details I don't want to do
that because it's very much in the
fringe of things but again there's a
whole bunch of things you can do and it
is so ingrained in our culture going
back to 95 that any conversation that I
have with Robbie and Matthew ends up in
but how does that inside of record now I
will tell you we cannot be ideologues
about this because some things really
are better left - unikz does a few
things right some things are left -
device drivers know a lot of things
maybe shouldn't go in there
so this is the trade of which we're
playing with for a long time and that's
what I'm gonna leave it at this is a
product that came out in 95
we immediately threw it at high school
student in high school teachers of
course it was a catastrophe catastrophes
are incredible feedback you go back and
you fix it and pretty soon very quickly
became an actual development team that
also does research but it what I have
realized as an academic and this is what
I differ with Peter for example what I
realized is it is very good to be an
actual developer if you want to be a
good academic that's relevant I'm not
gonna tell you that you're gonna program
in parenthese tomorrow maybe you are by
switching the closure but what I'm
telling you is I want to have a vision
how this translates into the real world
so we started from this very simple
thing here I'm into students and we have
a little thing going back going forth I
think is now all the way up to people
who program big applications like games
there were there's the biggest
application we know of but there's more
companies that doesn't program as what
the DoD or for the Air Force and things
like this and we really want all of you
to we want developers to try it out see
what it feels like it won't fit in your
stack necessarily but maybe you get
ideas on how to have closure and use
this advanced technology to get things
right of course what you will find a
closure will break on you but then you
know how to build it you just copy our
stuff and port it to racket and they
will be unbelievably happy right so
what's the takeaway I know I'm between
you and the party so I'll keep it a
really short one's life it's a
programming language programming
language it's a full-stack language and
it's a linguists language and if we as
academics don't live in a feedback loop
we are doing tiny scale stuff so we
don't thank you very much
so I want to trust you said that this is
not supposed to be included in our
current attack but why are the efforts
for that to happen because when we were
having the discussion this morning on
cloture where I get from Claudia respect
it's the list of tests how to make the
testing I'm gonna have a deployment
system I'm gonna have you know all these
tools that are required for the job it's
almost a religion these days and when I
go to rocket I have dr. rocket which is
awesome I really like it but it's not a
good sell who put a quick check before
it was enclosure and there are other
things that you may not be able to find
so yes maybe the tools are not as easy
to find but they are there are there as
well developed as enclosure no we are
community 10 times smaller than closure
but if all of you start programming in
racket tomorrow especially you then
we'll have more tools in our world
Matthew has the sign-up list where you
can sign up for jobs well they all want
to go to the party right well in that
case
oh I pushed on pita too hard
no I love this because I love lip so I
mean you you named Tex
Landon's paper next 700 programming
languages earlier on right so is this
sort of realizing that dream or do you
have a different is it a different dream
to Landon Reynolds
around then realized in scheme I guess I
can call it the record a scheme or is
there a distinction in your dream can
offer you at the moment is macros macros
break
I mean minimum you have to have hygiene
but as I told you it's one of ten
elements and just a syntactic side to
make this dream work so a plain Lisp
system lacks expressiveness when you
mingle syntax from two different worlds
on the average it's broken that's true
for list and it's true for scheme so is
that so there's it for schemes I know
so we're derivative of those worlds we
have more number one number two
Landon didn't have a dream he had
observation and you know that the
observation was you can separate the
application layer which to him and
Reynolds to of course was a bunch of
libraries on say strings or numbers or
whatever and on top of that there was a
lambda calculus including effects by the
way he was never an ie a lot like many
have to come
he had jump effects in side effects in
there that that's the essence of
programming languages if you live today
he would add concurrency or parallelism
to it but that would be it all languages
have this structure my dissertation
picks that up says there's the
three-dimensional space now we say
there's a four dimensional space and
everything is generated from there
including objects and classes and
whatever that's a different dream it's a
dream of how do you analyze things I did
one kind of hours analysis more cheated
another one and came up with monads
which were more easily translated into
programming constructs okay okay
I'll be shy just tell me what I gotta
party do you have any other stories of
racket in production apart from well I
mean that's a big one yes yes that's a
bunch of them and we know of about I'm
gonna say dozen or so companies of small
size they'd use it for various things
it costs a music composition to I'll
just say as much as I say there's like
some software is deployed on
battlefields PLT scheme at some point
used to live in every single arising
switch doing the error ticketing so PLT
scheme is the first name we had for
record racket itself is six years old
the name is six years old and we were
first called POC scheme but we differ
from scheme so much we give the new name
so when it was called PT scheme and I
think maybe today stay even it went in
every Verizon switch in the United
States as an error ticketing processing
tool that was not a team it was a single
person who did that it was supposed to
be a year-long effort and he was able to
do it in our world in about two days
Verizon was impressed and then deployed
it in the actual switches so ever ticket
is when when a switch is basically a
phone database when the phone call comes
in it has to look up certain things
about you and the recipient so you get
charged and you get connections or
whatever usually something you feel
often something fails that's called an
air ticket recovery comes on you don't
know this hopefully you don't notice it
in the phone call but the phone company
wants to know your ticket goes to
experts
that's an example in Hawaii first
looking for batteries just to continue
so what would you recommend like a first
practical application if I want to
introduce racket and probably you
wouldn't recommend to write a database
server or web server in it but what do
you mention is a good first practical
use in the production setting what would
be good for I mean or adult funnels like
this they had they have realized that
everybody speaks exactly those
domain-specific languages they had
written is in list and Common Lisp and
people realized that list is a broken
way of making languages so the analogy
is if you have applications that need a
lot of small domains of these language
and you want to glue them together into
something are runs on say like the
PlayStation or just a normal desktop in
a real computer so the way they do it
not that much is public they built these
domestic languages they compile them
into something like racket and then it
becomes a DLL that's linked into a small
C post last engine and that deploy that
so that's an example of of where it
would be absolutely great if you have
many little dialects of things you want
to do in your problem statement then
that's what you want to do that's that's
a big application small ones what do you
recommend Matthew
I think modest Web Services with a
connection to a database is a common
entry entry application sometimes little
gooeys on the desktop boots pirate in
with the half line pirate of course you
build a new programming language you
wanna play with it the very beginning of
a programming knowledge is a very
intensive design feedback loop and so
the quickest way to get bootstrap in
language hash line pirate hash Lang
Andy's favorite language you know and
you're up and running you're up and
running in a day it's mind boggling and
then you can explore your language you
find problems and and you fix it and
then then you would stop I would
mattie maybe you have more updated
version of this but I would recommend
looking up the Danny you tutorial and
how to do this there's sort of a putt
there's a there's a racket way of doing
this that makes it really quick and
really easy and how many of you have
heard of brain okay good there's a
really great tutorial on how to
implement brain in racket and how
to improve its performance use the
performance where you know because of
course ever Andy's high performs
brain-fuck so it's a really good
tutorial on that except it was written
by somebody who couldn't say the second
half of that language in so it's called
a how it's called how to fudge up a
racket
and that's a great tutorial on how to
build a language
side racket because it explains that the
philosophy of how to do it thank you for
reminding me about there's a question
back there general question you told
about benefits but what are the
disadvantages there is any problems of
course the research language a business
language is not finished we preserve
backward compatibility as much as
possible it's become a religion across
relation especially one of the
developers steps and everybody's toes or
everywhere else or somewhere back there
if we are not backwards compatible it
goes as far as preserving bugs it sounds
crazy but so that that that is a problem
we discover because people it's like
teachers for example we have about
100,000 downloads a year and most of
them educational and teachers have notes
going back to 1990 whatever and we break
things the teachers that's there were
some developers there you have their
nose their yellow nodes I mean as in
yellowed paper will could dry out
brittle to the touch but that's where
the notes are and it has to work like
that we do that but it's of course we
have sometimes we have that's why we are
washing 6.6 now sometimes we do break
these compatibilities and your host we
warned you early on
I'm with you host number two
an academic team as much as we can try
to simulate industrial delivery and we
do with regular release cycle we were
releasing in two weeks week we are
twenty something people in the core it's
really three or four or five people plus
twenty more committers overall there
were a hundred people committed how fast
are we in really fixing things when that
break well we're a small team we have
the resources sometimes you have to
teach for a week or before we get to
this thing
that's number two our integration with
the web stack is it's just the fact of
life it's not our thing if so many of
you live on on the web stack now so you
can't and still integrate it so as it
visit language for for the for the
outside world many companies many small
companies some big companies cope with
that as an academic their disadvantages
I think you're an academic right so if
you're an academia working on a research
language that's delivered and has to
live up to industrial language standards
it's a hard thing to do
Peter talked about this this morning
it's a 10x effort and I actually agree
with that it's 10x over academic
prototypes when we write a paper
when Matthew for example writes a paper
bout with the one eye I didn't make fun
of it but I said this is an academic
paper but that stuff he had to system up
and running for a couple of years before
he wrote the paper because we go all the
way to the end to deliver a completely
totally robust product robust means all
the errors are done right no academic
would ever do not errors getting right I
give you one example does this famous
LED macro that everybody's the lead
hygienic macro from the 1980s or 70s guy
still wrote it down so it must be a
saintly product right it's it's there
it's two lines long in his little report
the actual implementation of this macro
when we look it up is 18 lines two to 18
is not quite 9x close enough for Peters
sake right it really is that much more
effort to make it look like a native
construct nowadays we have so one of the
dissertations I always our so recently
was reduced that over because all these
these 16 lines can be generate
automatically now but before we got
there we had right test to make as an
academic make the software deliverable
industry the scholar won't listen same
idea maybe not Heather she's making a
face at me but some of the Scala people
live in that boat where they have to
deliver to and not many academic groups
if you look around that can live up to
the standard because it's so much more
work so that's I have only talked about
this advantage but I get that make it so
if you're a PhD student looking to find
advisers
there's also benefit you are real nobody
will ever doubt that you are real
your stuff is used mission-critical
stuff it's not fake prototypes that
really don't do anything but give you
one more beam on your CD one more poeple
paper one way you could paper no it's
real stuff out there
answer the question
Thanks
so for better or worse C and C++ have
become sort of the most portable
languages around right now if you're
invest into building a game engine for
instance like C you can compile it run
on iOS you can run it on Android you can
compile it to the web can you speak
about portability and in the future like
example four people work on the C++
layer and the rest of the ADA of people
we're going to record deal layer and
that's a good ratio because that way you
keep these things portable to other
platforms and you you have the actual
accessibility in the links where you
want it Matthew has gone through many
many many efforts to make this thing
make racket portable is ported across
many platforms it runs on an arm right
it runs on your stainer platforms and
it's like Java you know right ones and
hope for the best for the others I think
we actually better than Java probably
but who knows
so yes it's totally it's very portable
stuff and so for example dr. Rico's I
teach students download it there use
various linux's they use various Windows
versions that use Mac versions and they
deliver the homework and I was just fine
but we can tell the difference because
the phones are not quite right when they
deliver the image stuff like that but it
definitely is portable in that sense
is it portable too very so I OS or I
wouldn't say we're right there yet but
if you can clone Matthew then if then
it's gonna be there tomorrow okay so I
think we're actually at the the end of
the session so let's thank the speaker
and just as a reminder there's a group
of people that are gonna be walking over
to the party venue at 7:15 and
everybody's meeting directly outside of
the venue so if you're interested in
catching that group and all walking over
together meet outside then otherwise
check the coupe's lashkar-e on a website
and there's a page for the party with
the address and everything so you can
look it up on your phones or whatever
but hope to see you guys all at the
party</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
