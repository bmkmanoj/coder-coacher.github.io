figure it's probably more programmers
than sociologists in the audience so
first thing to talk about is the notion
of a case study should we do a starting
over starting now or just get one count
about the development of something
especially let's keep particular in
order to illustrate some general
principles the first we want to convince
anyway I don't need this for this part
so the first thing we want to convince
you is that mini cannon is an
interesting exercise to be a case study
up second thing that we intend to talk
about is prove some of the general
features of many i want i actually need
to pay attention to us to come out all
right
and we're back the second thing we want
to talk about is what makes mini cannon
a desirable helps why what makes a good
host for mini cannon and finally we want
to from that draw more general lessons
about what to do when hosting a
domain-specific language mini cannon
rather wats so many cameras itself a
shallow embedding shallowly embedded
domain-specific language used for doing
logic or relational programming it was
first introduced in the book the reason
schemer bye bye Dan and will and Oleg
some years ago in 2005 their belts and a
lot all the information about mini
Cameron the tutorials implementations
uses can all be found at website mini
Canada work so a domain-specific
language is it's a programming language
or spec that offers through some
notations and abstractions an expressive
power that's usually focused and
restricted some particular problem
domain it's it's kind of interesting to
consider that that I mean think of three
long existing general-purpose
programming language thing really really
well-established programming languages
the ones that came to my mind were
fortran COBOL and lips all of which you
can kind of argue started life as
domain-specific languages or formula
translating business logic and list
processing it so the the lines get kind
of blurred there's a couple places their
lines you can get blur
between how much how specific does our
domain have to be these are obviously
movable categories and will also be
discussing some other gradients as we go
but these aren't unlike a lot of things
we talk about programming language six
categories yet yes or no right or wrong
some of this is going to be inevitably a
judgment call but places where there's
room to give different decisions
different choices you can make that's
sort of on the artistry side rather than
the science side what we do that's not a
bad place to be all the time so as an
embedded domain-specific language that
means it's embedded in a host and as a
result the language inherits some of the
infrastructure some of the framework
from the host that's the point of having
an embedded domain-specific language is
that you don't have to build whole thing
from scratch you can sit on top of the
shoulders of whatever your favorite
language happens to be just incidentally
the term domain-specific embedded
languages was first coined by Paul codec
in 1997 so an example of some mini
camera is the relation of pendant and I
think this is you and wills is usual go
to their
you're factorial the 0 on the end stands
for what was the output logic
programming I'd also heard i think that
the 0 is the top of ? names ok so in
scheme for example you have predicates
and when you write a private return to a
fault always have a question mark appear
we always wanted to have some way of
distinguishing relations functions so
old debris simple strange name
strange-sounding name like a pendulum
last night 0 corn is a fun thing to do
but of course it's told you last night
was oh my goodness there's an extra arm
I so this is you know the opinion
function this is its cousin in
relationship you're describing what it
means for three things to be happy open
relationship so there's two ways hold
one if the first elements md in the
second and third things are the same
otherwise possibly existence of two more
variables and say that the first element
is the composition of a headache some
rest then if a pin holds for the
recursion then the result we recursion
plus the the head on the front is
something else that happened deep end
relation and even if you're not a mini
can turn expert don't see how this code
how does codes what is cooking you can
understand the running part we're using
a pen like you would your regular old
info if I give you the list BCD and the
list EF and say what happens when i
append those two together i get back out
b c d e f mini can always return to list
dancers so there's one actually get back
out easy navy f ec
ya rabba those returns of quoted so the
point is you can give you if you're a
new mini cannon I just want to write
functions like I've been doing as a
playable functional programming i love
it you can do that but by taking your
pin function and turning it into a
relation you get super pounds and you
don't have to just use a pin to like you
live in you can fill in all or partial
answers for any of those three positions
LSN oh and then you can will do its best
to give you answers to establish the
rest that's the power relational program
yes just sorta cute correct q4 query
thing yes q4 query so why mini Cameron
as a case well it does have some
practical commercial uses it's been used
for industry for doing malware detection
for processing database queries or web
testing and in fact with their companies
out there using mini hammering
production is cool and neat ah but
that's not the kind of stuff it gets
them and will and I all excited mostly
it's the kind of peel offs in this stuff
that we can do with it we we've
implemented or many camera researches
have implemented exponential explanation
the devil's logarithm algorithms and I
think you said two duh the only one for
the most patient really a backward run
long division points that's correct
instead it takes someone like and Shawn
to say to you after subunit firm that's
just long division backwards and then
what you know that it's easy so if you
ever read a book so we've got likewise
in a similar sense that app in words
mobile Corrections right a type checker
that works the type inference or type
and Heather a comment or a bocce
producer that actually also performs
commentator sentences we go through this
100 and in language interpreters that
also doubles buzzers wine generator okay
we'll figure this one out have a dispute
of life continue so there's lots of cool
stuff you can do with it that might make
mini cannon on an interesting object in
a case if there's also some intrinsic
reasons that many cannons interested not
just what you do what is its we got
implementations fewer than 100 line wrap
one quarter that's just a influence
stuff that unification it's a small
enough artifact that you can experiment
with it and its home luckily an object
to study that's not just a hundred lines
from getting rid of all the line breaks
this is we think are the other recent
data I like we think is pretty well it's
not really
my legs but you know in the right papers
to go to college really different color
code that's light it's a really really
quite a bit we've got people have done
more than 50 implementations and at
least 30 languages Matt means that you
can do an interesting cross section what
we get from implementing in this
language versus this language what what
what does my host bring to bear having
that cross back sauce makes it an
interesting things and thirdly that that
notion where program where many Cameron
programs are derived from we actually
happens to show this to you yet we're
programs in mini cannon or derived from
programs in a host language we start
with a racket program and then transform
that into a mini cannon program and
resulting in the zune Power Suit pals
but not many domain-specific languages i
can think of have this kind of
development model that's who makes it
sort of interesting so let's let's do
some cover damn all right so the whole
Rack is reverse okay so here's our
here's our in relation in the relation
we looked at beforehand you want to do
this evolution of reverse right here
yeah we want to do a similar thing for a
version that might be thinner and I'm
tired of seeing it all right so all
right well then we can show this off
functional programmers are in reverse
this one's a slightly more sophisticated
notion reverse but it's doing the same
thing we just happen to and this is the
model we use for writing any canon
programs now we translate it into a
still perfectly nothing out of the
ordinary comfortable program it happens
to look suspiciously like something that
might turn into mini camera but so far
as I know when I run ever use it looks
just like any other rivers program what
does it mean I reversal is just if the
list is equaled Angeles then the answer
the engines otherwise we can decompose
it into two pieces reverse the back half
and then a pin pin de hands are on to a
list containing the first step
so defined relation first thing we do
and the most important aspect adeola me
the most or so they can't becomes Conde
how I say the two things are equal in
any camera that's the beautification
over
now I was easy about herself well hey md
looks like the cookie first I need to
posit the existence of two new variants
fresh Amy and then we'll say it
ok
so I've got a neat freshman this one now
we need to talk existence one more
variable fresh are so we really just
like you think there's yes so don't
forget the older rivers so reverso Dean
two are with me when we used to say that
are to reverse a deep now to say they
have its relationship and find them
these are the old in relationship to
finish the job
so this one direction yes
and okay Ruby o our to which a is final
answer and we've got a Hindu vote
related now for those of you who may be
reading the book right now the fine
relations that's under negotiation all
right so Ron 1q get the answer what
happened my reverse oh yeah question hey
could you just reiterates what's fresh
did and Cheryl fresh scope to new
variable it gives me a fresh there might
say the the backwards e in your formal
logic class it's kind of like that but I
want to make sure I've got a brand new
never before seen give the universe
variable to which I what I'm uses an
answer like we think I've describing
relationship if i want to say if i want
to say portugal is two countries away
from france i might posit the existence
of spain and say that they both barely
one country away relationship described
so often when describing relation these
relation to get positive incidental
variance and that gives me too so i can
run it the reverse the list ABC's willis
cba we can also do it the other way
around and this is the the flexibility
of the logic programming gives us and if
we had more places in our relationship
we could partially or completely
instantiate all these and we can have
many camera generate stuff for us so
that's the power that it gives us to a
new
yeah based on what we've got top quit
how do I asked in something to power how
do i ask for a power yeah didn't say
market twice so Ron one who no longer on
6311 rehearsal we're so cute cute give
me a palindrome OMP listen to how how
can you 10 all right I could have asked
for it give me elements that inhabit the
the pen relation to and any camels fed
an alpha I could give it an answer list
and say maybe Henry getting all the
waste the first two elements could have
pinned together together and we spit it
out just quick as this these are
actually oh oh yeah one of those what's
that underscored not what is that what
is that these have to do sit there this
will be so they're arbitrary mini cannon
turn where the one the number indicates
which one happy is saying so the last
ones are the same second the left the
outside ones the second outside where
the same et cetera then we've got some
of the songs for this bona fide founder
cool no idea what this is he just knows
that all right so how about
pallidum well expo oh it's file yes this
one yes all right yep it's a little
tough to see from here all right so damn
I promised and Chloe you can go show it
off right quick you want a forged you
just run so the same power that we use
to turn a reverse function into a
reversal relation we can take an
interpreter for a programming language
the kind of thing dan has students right
on the third week of class in his
undergraduate course and sprinkle a
little mini cannon added and you get a
relation between an input and output so
you run one you eval eval expo they
program see let's let's lambda X X cap
with what yields what output cool why
call the any function on cat like a cat
that's the fridge reviewer what happened
how about if I ask for some cute that
gives me cat as an answer well okay okay
holy woman if I evaluate calico cat
that's that's good if I after ten so now
with this more interesting and you'll
notice of weird thing took them because
this mini Cameron is much more powerful
than those they might be Cameron was
that my pretenders will come up and
things like this they well those guys
better be civil so we will soon have a
son additional please write some time
but the hundred line little
implementation and liability have a
correlational language what's smaller
than mini candidates micro camera and
sprinkle a little syntactic Packers on
top of that and you get perfectly
serviceable functional logic program we
add some constraints and constraint for
a new framework that's a little
additional complexity but it's still
perfectly understand a lot of item to
bring this up oh if I if I run it it's
generated from these programs that when
i rub them evaluate to the answer i want
i can generate test data for whatever
program that one that's kind of well I
I I can't think magnet it doesn't seem
like a useful frame it's a it's a parlor
trick pure boy what might you through a
few luminor yeah alright so I'm asking
mini camera given the eval eval expo
relationship to give me something where
the program evaluates to the same things
everybody wants a quiet right and there
they are that's 10 of us and we're not
even gonna bother to prove it to you
because there are so many videos Kendra
org but there's there's interesting
stuff to be done all right so um I'm up
and so close is attractive for she
didn't want to go I mean I speaking we
can look at it wanted to the forward
line also this is are not going to take
we're relying on the ability to take
functions as our games return functions
value the equal equal we saw it takes
two arguments and then return the phone
waiting for a third so high order
functions closures you gotta have that
we all over the place we use cons of our
primitive data structure we take a two
cells stick them together allergic or
turn another step now this list is quazy
quote comma syntax that's just all
pretty sugar make presentation will
allegedly but really it's it's all
content so higher functions const oh
there's honest-to-goodness one macro
sink an implementation yes how important
crinkle yeah really critical there it is
no that's not it yeah so we this is how
we define relief guess what does it
helps us define relations and I don't
want to get in the deepest what it's
doing but it is we can't we absolutely
need some way that gives the ability to
define relations to rehearse without
that make sure that they're so into what
what's an expression okay basically
built apart right you don't want to do
with it yes all right want to delay and
we're introducing variables of lexical
scope so we need to make sure we don't
do any unnecessary capture that's an
important thing and we also rely heavily
on the garbage bucket mini camera we
don't do any any of the sorts of things
that a lot of languages would have to do
for actual explicit backtrack you're not
setting things we go on the garbage
collector do that for us as a pious
functional programs so what we're doing
alright so that's so to go through the
list closures hygienic macros as a
present and garbage collection you're
just listening to h'sac scheme that or
rabbit or a picture you need this could
be radical and so we might have closed
this but if you want to influence a mini
Cameron just you rather speak and that
would be a perfect that wouldn't be much
fun part it's not it's not even true
because we can get by without a logical
speak we don't necessarily need closures
how's that possible well
there's a long time and abbreviated
version but Norman Adams had wrote the
paper that objects are for mains
closures if you're using you can use
objects to just stick and apply method
on there you can use them like clothes
over let's let's go but you would and
that that kitchen through some stuff but
Christian pointy action is Lisbon small
pieces points have the closures
dolefully scenes of poor man's objects
closures are an impoverished version of
object is you only get one method that
you get to do it there's some play back
and forth point being it's an turn that
Scott wrote up is that cool lows in co
on you can find on the web if you start
on start off thinking the one-way
objects are a poor man's closures and
then you think about it really hard
closures or a poor man's objects and
thus Anton reaches in life so we don't
need you closer if you've got an object
system that would be good enough
somebody is implemented a mini cannon
and job where they rather than using
functions they go into the class and
attach methods to it lots of people
actually took this approach would be on
the website mickey kantor gotta work
we've got listed all the implementations
up there so if you've got one of your
favorite languages odds are there's a
mini cannon for you already out there if
not we want to try and convince you to
build your own give it to us we can
stick it up so we don't really need I
get mad drugs though we already need
those either hygiene prevents captures
during that look very good captured or
natural
you don't have a growth and it was uh
not there yet oh it was uh appreciate
your scheme but dance you wanted to have
a fast so nothing goes to say nothing
went to say that just a dissertation
work that's right but really cool
consumer so is it vintage it was
invented in the eighties which is teen
years later in already computer science
but that means there they would do
macros back in the battle good old days
listed so Dan and I wanted to implement
one the language called shin it doesn't
have hygienic macros yet and way did you
use to do what I think so the first two
they're fine you can if you're not doing
any scope capture you can't tell the
difference but the way it used to do
with you give a brand new on students
never seen symbol or straight make it
simple and then use that Mexico and your
guarantee you're not doing any scope
capture if you got a brand new negative
universe and so you don't really need
hygienic macros you can use a knife
attack of civil or if you don't have
macros at all you can get by by
explicitly adding adding delays in
places it's not so clean the code which
you can get by doing the thing dropping
delays which required for many cantor to
work and you can read this in a couple
of
paper you drop the delays explicitly
places and you don't eat mac words at
all so we can get back that map as a
present we actually kind of do need
something work like this what made the
transformation from a pen yo pendo
reversed a reversal possible was that we
had comms card cutter as our language
primitives and we're using binary trees
the basic data structure in minicamp the
fact that we can decompose everything
away many Cameron wants and we can sort
of simulate that beforehand in racket
that's what makes the transformation to
go and makes us able to develop programs
like this believe me if you've never
written a huge mini camera program being
able to write it as a function in a
language disorder feels like home at
first make sure it works in one
direction for you start counting
backwards is a 14 would you think and we
have have comms card could make that
work if your language coach language
doesn't have it well you can either
change the term language and somebody
wrote a toe camel implementation where
they this is perhaps the only example
but Adam lists as basic elements over
which to unification you could change
the term language to support whatever
term structure you've already got that's
an option Adam list is cool but why not
in the rate language as far as I know we
don't have a peeled hammer or j or k
camp how cool would it be if you had a
raised as a transparent data structure
which do unification how's that plum
still sitting there but if you don't
have that the other thing you can do is
it would calm seven if they're not
already hosts and a lot of people did
this Justin like it
went ahead just first thing we need is
comms card cutter methods on it so we'll
go ahead and add that framework and then
sitting on top of Ruby flush my new my
new construction implementation now
we're ready to go and select just add a
little bit of infrastructure you can
make it go garbage collection we
couldn't say the same thing we can say I
mean someone could say look there then
one might say yes hello after I get done
in booting comms card that I'll just
build a runtime system that doesn't seem
like the right decision watching you're
not sitting what platform are you
sitting and this reminded us both green
sponge temple which is any sufficiently
complicated c or for training program
contains an ad hoc and only specify
bogans flow implementation half
economist by the time you're sitting on
top the infrastructure took to get there
running seems like you've almost
implemented the host language you wanted
the first place there's room to do
something for struggling but if you go
too far then you made it stick we've
there been Oh lots of mini cannon
implementations well that's a lot you'll
notice the one that we wanted to
highlight here it'd be good the little
micro cannon that we talked about 40-50
lines there abouts we implemented mini
camera dan I got a hankering I apologize
you in public Dan for suggesting this Oh
Dan was nice enough to go along so it
can be done sort of meaning and we don't
have real or written a fake like
normally do it's all done with mine
bitwise binary multiplication think holy
piss me off of that so anytime you want
use numbers is separating them from
lists otherwise you gotta tag and so we
have to check for those tags anytime
you're doing anything it's we can't rely
on any camera to provide lexical scope
so we had to write an interpreter to
make the implementation tractable we
limited each program to one single
recursive relation and you had to use
tag to dispatch you where you wanted to
go the next loop around it worked but
programs were pretty verbose and I thank
yes you can go on being handed over and
check it out and the i w-want to show
you what it looks like two opinions we
still kind of love it but open an
apparent could still love it evidence
clearly is made a mistake so programs
are pretty provokes it doesn't have
great courage so if sometimes it's just
not available those so just because you
can do it doesn't mean you shouldn't
that's probably the most important take
away your brother flanked that you can
get it done maybe you should consider a
higher bar for that then other people
have given some other bits of advice
some of it we just got off Twitter
others we solicited for how to implement
your main camera and they said it so
anywhere that console aren't the same as
lists we belong in our implementation
using improper lists lisps with me what
looks like listen to you get to the very
last bell and it's got something in
there but it doesn't you
Sarah so you're gonna have to be aware
to emulate that echoed around if you
want internal language without macros
those delays we were talking that you'll
have to add those explicitly we've got
examples of how to do that on any can
another world for the rest of the
mangrove people noticed and then show me
a technique pioneered decades ago I
think just plain it's one of those
listed next to rain so I'm going to
brush my writing so you can use listed
goals to avoid using the macros you can
use numbers to help you know how many
variables you want a freshman if I'm
using closures to the variables then I
don't know the area off the top top my
head and you have patty are taking
longer to get something that is good
enough to run the search the micro
camera and then you can both come to
complete search it's it's sort of tricky
look at so other people suggested
visualize me drawing out on paper seeing
how it's getting the answers to get
that's one way to test to test it other
people wanted a bigger test suite if
you're running low on test paper
examples go to mini Hannah Doerr grab
what it will dig giant test Suites but
but there's there's room for more and
why aren't there and this is the part
where we implore you go build your own
in micro camp I think they're already in
a ray Bates mini camp and we were
talking there ought to be a tree base
wing from an over Fowler's the settle
language the set a swing I think it
would be cool to see what it looks like
having mini campus I think it'd be cool
to have a wall hammer why can't I has
walked a man already bubble you have a
locator I don't think they love it isn't
it alright so we need all the list we
had before we had about 30 or so we're a
few letters away
every language we've ever every one of
the outfit anyone who wants to get on
APL Bertrand injuries chaos typescript
humor code vba Wolfram and 0 will be
getting pretty close here so what we say
more broadly about domain-specific it's
when you're building your dsl consider
the evaluation one of the things that we
noticed is that we never reuse the
strings that we build for our
implementation and since we never reuse
them if we were relying specifically on
call Bonnie language we can use a lot of
unnecessary memoization consider the
evaluation Molitor folks been building
those similar pattern similar data
structures helps that program
transformation if you don't already have
those similar data structures go ahead
you may have to implement them or
consider changing what your language
designs but make sure those met chef you
want to also limit infrastructure that
that work there's there's a happy meet
if you're doing three weeks worth of
infrastructure development for what's
supposed to be a little one off language
you should reconsider but on the other
hand I think if you're if you're if
you're host language you can almost
already do all the things you want to be
why are you going the effort to building
a whole new language for that if you
host language is most of the way there
so let me say the sweet spot we just
thought this was beautiful yeah just to
toss out a number make it sixty seventy
percent of the way there with what
you're looking for is when you're when
you can add with a limited amount of
development effort a whole lot of
aggressively with any length and so
having a small number of mine elegantly
written lines of code giving a lot of
expressivity that's a sign that
something's
right and I reminded me of something
Alan Perlis said I I never feel bad and
my thoughts after the valley girl is
that a programming language is love love
with programs require attention to the
irrelevant if I'm having to implement a
whole lot of infrastructure to get to
writing the lames but i wanted to write
a trip you can't get you shouldn't get
there from here you go somewhere else to
start but there is lots of flexibility
and design the 50-plus implementations
should part of the design space there's
and I think there's room for a lot so if
you've got the time have another camera
that's stand on all the recipes we found
a mini-camera door thank
is there a type-0 type level mini
current I type level mini cannon I don't
believe that what are you doing this
afternoon no I type level mini can oh
yeah yeah once you get it going in Idris
then you'll kind of good answer so in
the previous incarnations of this mini
cannon you're able to define relations
just as normal racket functions yes so
what exactly are you doing now with your
defined relation macro that's that's
different then just a function there
were a lot of delays and now there are
one per definition of course if it's
recursive that'll get another one but
there's only one and furthermore if you
happen to have mutually recursive
definitions then you can still get by
with one so it's changes the perception
of how complicated things are now I'll
tell a little story which is when we
were sort of sometimes after the book
came out we were starting to think
harder and hard about this completeness
problem and we had a approximation and
what we would try to do is oval stick it
with thick of delay here we'll stick a
delay here and little by little we got
closer and closer but it was an absolute
chaotic structure that we were working
from we didn't know what was happening
at all where would micro Cameron we now
know exactly what's happening we make a
small change to it then we make a small
change to a pen map and it's done and
there's not it's not us thinking about
it anymore there's there's a reason for
each one of those delays now and it's at
a spot that's great to begin doing some
static analysis which I know is close to
your heart so there's it's a good
starting place for doing that sort of
stuff thank you very much
