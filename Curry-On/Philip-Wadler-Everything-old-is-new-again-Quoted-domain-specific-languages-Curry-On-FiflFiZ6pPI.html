everything old is new again
domain-specific languages how many
people recognize everything old is new
again is the title of a small C song it
is you can look it up on YouTube if you
want I won't inflict it on you now okay
are there any questions not yet
okay please I know there's a varied
audience here I know they're always even
though I'm not speaking to a varied
audience I can say things that people in
the audience don't follow if you don't
understand what I'm saying please help
me out and help the rest of the audience
out by asking a question I'll try it
again
are there any questions okay that's
what's on the next slide how many people
have heard the term smurfy okay so
Snuffy is French for a child's soft toy
you can see one of my daughter's had she
had many Snuffy's that was her favorite
but when she got older she decided that
I needed a smurfy so she made one for me
so many of you will recognize this as a
lambda the symbol of the lambda calculus
there it is with the PI that she made me
later and the point of doing this is
many people tend to think of theory as
hard difficult all of this lambda stuff
that these academics want me to learn to
make my life difficult what I'd like you
to take away is that theory is soft and
cuddly theories there for you to hug to
your bosom at night or to comfort you
when you're trying to write a difficult
program and imperfect in fact the theory
can give you a very helpful guide often
to doing a practical implementation
and that that is why the theory is there
not to make your life difficult but
because it is soft and cuddly you're
taking a picture of the picture do you
want to take a picture of the thingy so
the question then be looking at today's
how does one integrate a domain-specific
language and a host language and I'm
going to go back to two old ideas right
the old idea of quotation from Lisp
originally due to John McCarthy in the
1960s and the even older idea of
normalizing or simplifying proofs due to
gettin in 1935 Prague has the
distinction of being the city that
killed Jensen off he was a Nazi he was
teaching here when the Russians rolled
in they put him in prison they didn't
feed him where the other prisoners he
died very young so let's get started so
for most of this I'm going to look at
one example which is embedding SQL in F
sharp as a domain-specific language and
at the end I'll say a little bit also
about embedding feldspar and Haskell so
feldspar is an embedded domain-specific
language in Haskell and we've been
testing out our techniques can we
duplicate what they did using our
techniques and the answer so far seems
to be we've got two examples so far but
I hope that after you've gone through
this you'll think yeah that's a
technique that might be useful in
certain circumstances maybe I'll try it
out for mine and domain-specific
languages can mean many things but in
particular I'm going to be focused on
those where you have some host language
say f-sharp or Haskell and then you have
a target language say SQL or C and
you're trying to write an a nice F sharp
or Haskell program and then that
actually stands for generating
equivalent SQL or C so I'm gonna be
looking at SQL mainly so here's a little
database of people and here's a query
that we can run over that so from people
bound to you and from people also bound
to V if the used name is Alex and these
ages less than you age
then select V name as name and V age as
age and you get that table over there
those are all the people who are younger
than Alex okay any questions about that
you cannot if that is completely boring
nobody is nodding now what we want to do
is look at our database within our
programming language in this case F
sharp so we can just easily take a
database and convert it into data in our
programming language so here's an
example of a database so it's a record
which one with one field people
correspond to the one table in the
database and then that is bound to a
list and the list has a bunch of Records
and each record has one field for the
name column and one field for the age
column and I've used lists here rather
than bags because that fits well with
f-sharp which supports a list type
rather than a bag type but we won't care
about the ordering of the elements in
our list so this is completely
straightforward right and we could add a
little construct to our programming
language database which reads in the
database and turns it into data in the
form that I just showed you and then we
could take our query and just rewrite it
out
so to find all these so this is going to
return a list of records for each record
has a name field and an age field there
we are and again we just iterate for
each you in the people table and for
each B in the people table if you use
name is Alex and Vees age is less than
use age then return a record with a name
field and an age field taken from V so
again this is pretty straightforward and
I hope the correspondence
the query I showed you before is pretty
straightforward now I've put Prime's on
these things and within this talk prime
is going to have the following meaning I
wouldn't do that if I were you
why have I put Prime's here does
somebody want to suggest yes right so we
run over everybody in people once and
then we run over them again so if people
has n entries this will take time and
squared where's the SQL query I showed
you before if you use indexes properly
just runs in linear time that's one
thing that's wrong it takes too long
anything else yep right to the example I
showed you the database had only six
entries reading that into memory is not
a problem of course databases can
contain terabytes of data and then
reading all of that into memory would be
a problem so it uses too much space and
too much time but other than that it's
perfect so how can we fix these two tiny
problems with space and time and the
interest it's easy of course when we
evaluate it we get out this thing which
corresponds to the table we had before
and that's what we want to get and
notice that here representing his data
is fine because typically the answer is
much smaller than the whole database so
that that's okay how can we fix the
other problems it's easy all we need to
do is write some bits and Bloo so here
it is with bits written in blue and
there are two changes first of all
instead of letting DB be the actual type
DB this record type it's an expert of
that expert means this is a type already
in F sharp it's the type of quoted terms
what is a quoted term it's just a data
structure in the language in particular
a parse tree that represents that term
and many language has forms of quotation
in them in F sharp
the quotations are written using these
brackets so here's the open quotation
bracket and there's the closed quotation
bracket so I've got the same constructs
that I've written before but now written
as a quotation so the type is now an
expert of what we returned before and
we've got this quotation and indeed when
you and then this here is an anti quote
that just means splice in the other
thing so that means literally you get
database of people in both those places
so we're saying which database were
referring to and of course I'll get to
that in the math but we only want to
refer to one database of course you
should splice in the same one every time
and you can see that this has exactly
the same structure as the SQL so it's
easy to run over this and generate the
SQL and then we'll send that off to the
database get the answer back it will be
a small answer so then it's easy to run
over the answer and convert it to our
programming language so now this runs it
doesn't read in the whole database and
it runs in the same amount of time as
the SQL query because the SQL query
we're generating is exactly the same one
that we saw before so now we have a nice
integration between our programming
language and our database language and
how many people are familiar with linq
what's that central language integrated
query and it's a commercial product
offered by Microsoft as part of the.net
framework developed by Eric Meyer and
many others at Microsoft and it's based
on exactly these ideas so this is just
another linq provider that we've given
and in fact in a line Q this is again
very straightforward but I'm going to
show you some things that didn't work in
previous versions of linq and do work in
ours but one thing you should take away
here is wait a minute this idea of using
quotation it was already there in linq
there's nothing new about that right
that's why the title of this talk is
everything old is new again it's a
standard idea
and I'm just trying to draw people's
attention to it again and in part draw
attention fact that this is around a lot
so for instance as well as in linq you
use pretty much these same techniques in
Scala so here's our naive query in Scala
written very similarly to what we had
before and in Scala if you want to
actually generate SQL right so this is
the one that uses too much space and too
much time and if you don't want to use
too much space in too much time you just
before we wrote expert in Scala you
write wrap representation up and wrap is
the same thing it just means this is a
parse tree that represents a term and
the type of the term is then what's
written in the brackets in this case a
list of Records which name and age
fields and interestingly write Scala has
very powerful type mechanisms so in
Scala when you declare that the type is
a wrap it infers that everything here is
in blue so you don't have explicit open
quotation and close quotation you don't
have explicit anti quotation but the
type inference err works all that out
for you Cormac yes
it's not absolutely necessary but
typically when use quotation in a
particular language you're quoting terms
of the same language you wouldn't have
to and beat that's an interesting idea
but the cases all look at yes we're
quoting the same language yes why do I
oh why do I still have the prime there
that's a very good question why is there
still a prime there and the answer is
it's a type of my apologies
thank you for pointing that out
indeed okay so what does this run
contract I sure if you do right you take
the quoted expression right - you do all
your splicing you've got a quote
expression you then simplify it now the
particular example that we had no
simplification is required but will see
that this simplify step or normalized
step is very important you then
translate your query to SQL you then run
the SQL right you send it off to the
database and run it you get back a table
and you take that table and you
translate it back into your host
language so those are the steps we saw
and then you get a theorem so
mathematics right every run will
generate exactly one query as long as
the answer type is flat that is it's a
list of record of scalars or scalars
something like string or integer it only
uses permitted operations so for
instance if you used is a prime well we
definitely can't translate that to SQL
use recursion for standard SQL we can't
translate that to SQL so you have to
only use the things that SQL knows about
and you should only refer to one
database right if you tried to refer to
two databases you couldn't change it to
a query on one database question so what
if the answer was too big that you don't
want to bring it into memory but you
want to stream it one piece at a time
right so what I said is what we're going
to do is just take it and read it into
memory but of course you could stream it
if you wanted to but I'll leave that as
a exercise for the reader okay any other
questions you're asking excellent
questions thank you keep it up okay so
you've been through this call okay so
that's the basic idea so any other
questions about the basic idea so now
we're gonna ramp it up and see more
interesting things we can do okay so
here we go
so the first thing you need to be able
to do is of course abstract over values
so yes gulia so just a small question
that's been bothering me why was DB in
black
does it mean that oh you mean here right
if you know the front of it it's the
same answer for both so DV is anti quote
dude why is it anti quoted because the
type of the variable DB is it's an
expert of DB not a DB so it's another
parse tree that gets spliced in at that
point exactly the same thing happened in
the Scala okay good question thank you
so up you know clearly we've got to be
able to abstract over values so we just
do that we write a lambda expression so
sorry a a function abstraction so fun is
of course the way in which F sharp
writes lambdas so we have a function
that takes two arguments a and B and
then we iterate over all people and if a
is smaller than W sage and W sage is
less than B then we yield the name so
these are the names of everybody's whose
age is between 30 and 40 in this case
and again this would just translate very
straightforwardly to this query note
that here we are making use of
simplification because the actual
parameter 30 gets substituted for the
formal parameter a and similarly 40 gets
substituted for B so doing that
simplification is part of what happens
before we execute the cry so we build
this big parse tree which includes a
function that's applied to something and
then we simplify that down to substitute
actuals for formals which if you want
the proper theoretical name is called
beta reduction and we get that query out
and then we run it and we'll find out
whose age is between 30 and 40 so that's
fairly straightforward you should be
able to do that in any DSL but the
following thing was very hard to do in
many versions of length and there were
long blog post explaining how to do this
so now what we want to do is abstract
not over values but over predicates over
functions higher-order functions so now
we've got an expert
a predicate a function from Interpol and
it returns a list of names so here's our
our thing so it's a function it takes an
argument P which is our predicate it
loops W over people again if P holds of
W age then we return the name so here's
a predicate that we could apply
satisfice to it's a function of X which
is true if 30 is less than or equal to X
and X is less than 40 so in fact after
we do all this simplifying so now we've
got here's our actual parameter so we'll
substitute that for our formal P but now
we have a function applied to W age so
again we'll substitute out and we'll
replace X by W a gym now we've got 30
smaller than W age and WH is smaller
than 40 oh and that's exactly this query
again so it's the normalization that
really makes this work and that's the
lesson I want you to take away
normalization makes this stuff a lot
simpler and you might think let's see
I'll go off and do one more example yeah
normalization just means you have a
function applied to some arguments so
you do the substitution now much more
interesting still is done generating
queries dynamically so now I'm going to
embed a little DSL using my little DSL
so here's a little DSL it just expresses
predicates this one only has three
constructs but we could easily add more
being above a given number age below a
given age or both predicates hold it and
then we can convert one of these data
structures into an actual quoted term by
saying okay above corresponds to the
function of
that returns lift of a sari above of a
means that lift of a is smaller than X
weight why is there a lift of a there
isn't it just a is smaller than X well
no a is an integer
we're splicing something in here that
has to be an expert of integer so we
need to convert our integer to the parse
tree that represents that integer and
that's what lifts us similarly with
below and then and is just a function of
X that takes again takes this operation
big P and applies what's big P of and of
T and you well it's big P of T and big P
of you and both of those are applied to
our predicate our argument X so does X
satisfy big P of T and does X s my big P
of U and if it satisfies both so we'll
can join those together then we'll
return trip this is fairly
straightforward and simple code right
there's only one problem with it it's
insane why is it insane because if we
take P and evaluate it we get out this
thing which is unreadable actually it's
even less readable because I've
subscripted X 1 and X 2 so you can see
that those are different formal
variables actually it's all just acts
when you expand it out but that's okay
because when we normalize it we get back
to that and that's what we passed into
satisfies before so satisfies the P of
this term just gets down to what we had
before now this is in quotes and
everything in the quotes is black you
might think what is quoted here and the
answer is the application term is quoted
so we're splicing in two things and then
applying one to the other and then this
normalizes as before and we get the same
query as before so for many years it was
mysterious to me how do you use language
integrated query to generate queries
dynamically because that's of course the
interesting thing to do but here it's
just completely straightforward and what
makes it straightforward is that we have
this insane middle step but the insane
middle step doesn't matter because it
normalizes down wait wait wait you'll
say that it'll take time to do that that
will
costly well no it's very cheap compared
to the cost of evaluating the query so
it's not really that big of a problem so
that's all there is to it now I want you
to notice something that happened here
here's the way we wrote big P right this
is exactly what we have on the previous
slide many people in the real world
don't do this they do this instead so
instead of big P returning a function
the representation of a function from
Interpol it is a function that takes a
representation of its argument and
returns a representation of its result
and then it looks like this and you
notice if you did it this way you
wouldn't get all these functions applied
to things that you then need to simplify
so this generates something more
efficient and this seems like a better
idea so why not use the one on the
bottom and the answer is here's the
satisfies that we wrote but if we did it
the other way around we need a satisfies
like this and notice it's primed again
and what it does is it takes our P now
is a function from expert in to expert
bool not an expert in to bool like here
and that means to make it all work we
need to apply to a quoted thing and
that's fine we just apply it to W age in
quote and this all looks fine except if
you run it through F sharp you get back
an error message which says um where is
W bound because if it you try to give
this thing a type on its own
okay well it's type is it's an expert
event but it's typed you'd say oh and
there's a free variable W and there's no
easy way to do that in the type system
so F sharp says no no you're not allowed
to use a free variable one place and
bind it in a completely different
quotation that gives you an error
message that loosely translated is what
are you crazy and there's no way of
making that work so this is a perfectly
fine idea except it
work in F sharp now there are more
complicated type systems for languages
like meta o camel where this does work
perfectly well and you can do this and
people do do it and then you might say
oh okay
so if long as I'm using meadow camel
then I don't need the simplification and
in fact for every single example I
showed you that's true but if you go to
my website and read the paper which was
published in IEEE cfp 2013 it is filled
with examples that don't work that way
and when you still need to simplify and
indeed if you I'm giving a talk
continuing this one at DSL di
domain-specific language designed an
implementation at 1610 in the room over
there I'll give you an example there
where you need to do simplifications
that are not gotten for you
automatically by meta o camel so the
meadow camel idea is a good idea as far
as it goes and it goes quite far but you
still need simplification but it doesn't
work in F sharp because it doesn't let
you have a free variable in a quotation
every variable in the quotation must be
down somewhere in that quotation this
one is bounded in a completely different
quotation so I was so used to doing
things this way now I just thought we
were doing things this way I hadn't
realized we were doing something that
was different and finally I thought
where wait we're doing something
different there is a picture of me at
the exact moment that I realized this
this is a recreation but indeed the
exact moment I realized that I was in
cycling in the links to work with
Edinburgh Castle right next to me there
like that
so so what's the point here this idea
that supported in meta o camel where you
have a free variable in a quotation
that's bound in
different quotation is called open
quotation but what's only the only thing
f-sharp supports is closed quotation so
my point is yes this idea with open
quotation is great but as long as you're
willing to normalize terms and by the
way you might want to normalize terms
anyway then closed quotations work
perfectly well and the way of thinking
of this is we want to use quotations of
functions something like expert a to be
rather than functions of quotations
something like expert a goes to expert B
both of these are fine my point is the
QED DSL technique involves the first of
these and it's an option you should
consider maybe it works for you now what
we've used throughout this is again
since I mentioned Jensen right I'm
carrying him on my shirt yes Jared
Jensen where does this come into it all
and you know that he died at age 36
quite young so here's natural deduction
as written out in Jensen's original
paper this is a photocopy of his
original paper some people said oh you
shouldn't use that part it's not my
fault it's Jensen's font but this looks
exactly like the way we do it now except
he wrote his A's and B's in German right
but the way we do it now is like this
this is exactly the same thing these are
his rules and the key thing he worked
out is that the rules come in pairs so
you have an introduction rule which is
called that because it has a implies B
below the line this says it's assuming a
you can prove B then you can conclude a
implies B and this is modus ponens it
says if you have a proof that a implies
B and you have a proof of a you can
conclude B similarly for conjunction and
the point is when the rules come in
pairs you can simplify so here's a proof
that a implies B and here's a proof of a
and of course we conclude B but we can
conclude this much more directly
like if this said assuming a proof thee
well we don't need to assume a we've got
a proof of a right here so just coffee
in that proof of a everywhere the
assumption was used of course when you
do that you might make the proof larger
because maybe that assumption is used
many times and maybe this is a big proof
but you're making it simpler in the
sense that this intermediate formula a
implies B you get rid of it you're
getting rid of an intermediate formula
and when you keep doing this you get the
following property here's what Jensen
said perhaps we may express the
essential properties of such a normal
proof by saying it is not roundabout no
concepts enter into the proof than those
contained in its final result and there
used was therefore essential to the
achievement of that result so it says
you can prove everything directly goth
prophets did love reformulation of this
and he called it the sub formula
principle every formula occurring in a
normal form deduction that's after we've
done the simplification we talked about
in Jensen system of natural deduction of
a from gamma so a is our final
conclusion gamma is a a list of formulas
which are all harmful hypotheses so from
some hypotheses you prove a result then
you know that every formula in the proof
is a sub formula of either the
conclusion a or one of your hypotheses
gamma so we don't need anything else why
is that relevant this is exactly what
we've been using right we wrote things
with lots of higher-order functions in
them higher-order functions via the good
old curry Howard isomorphism correspond
exact sorry yes higher-order functions
correspond exactly to implication so if
you can get rid of unneeded implications
in a proof you can get rid of
higher-order functions and in particular
if none of your hypotheses that is none
of your free variables
in Ballston implication and ours were
all tables which were flat no functions
right just a record of lists of records
of scalars and if your result has no
implication ours was flat it was a table
just a list of record of scalars then
we're guaranteed by doing normalization
that we will get rid of all the
functions which is why it's easy to go
to SQL those are the normalization rules
all I want to do is show you they're
very well known and they fit easily on
one slide so here's your one slide guide
to doing your implementation and this is
actually useful in practice because in F
sharp to an F here the different queries
I showed you I'll show some of those
later and some of them run in F sharp
too oh and some run in F sharp 3 oh but
thanks to our theorem they all run in
our version right I'm told that they
will be looking at applying these
techniques when they do the next version
of linq so that bit of theory gives you
a nice bit of God so just to conclude
how does one integrate a domain-specific
language in a host language there are
many ways of doing it well I've showed
use a technique called Q DSL it's not a
new technique it's used in linq it's
used in scala it's used many places but
the name I think helps to extract this
ideas one of the things to keep in our
toolbox and what does it depend on two
ideas quotation that's been widely known
and normalization going back to gettin
people often don't think about how
important or malaysian can be so go off
and think of normalization and your
friend the fuzzy lambda thank you very
much
thanks for for the great talk some of it
was over my head because I need to learn
lots of these concepts but forgive me
force to perhaps stupid question if I
have a completely different domain that
is not sequel where recursion for
example would be really interesting to
have with the same technique still be
applicable so that's not a stupid
question at all that's a brilliant
question I'll repeat the brilliant
question it was well ok for SQL you
didn't have recursion so of course when
you normalize the process terminates if
you have recursion you try to normalize
it that could go on forever what do you
do that so you notice that the Thera my
gate said you're allowed some hypotheses
so what you can do is put recursion into
one of those free variables and I
alluded to the fact that we've done
feldspar so in feldspar you have a
certain number of primitives that are
not simplified and these correspond to
things that will compile into C and one
of them is called wile
so we just translate the while into see
we don't simplify it but nonetheless we
can apply get the sub formula principle
to guarantee that we get out first order
code we can use functions as much as we
want and all the higher-order ones go
away and we're just represented with
something that corresponds to
first-order see first order to see that
bound variables are themselves
represented by functions so it's a
little bit trickier to do the proof but
it's not very tricky
so to summarize you provide not generic
general recursion you provide specific
forms like loops and then you make those
usable correct thank you good question
thank you and by the way I will just put
up this slide right you should know that
this wasn't just done by me it was done
by me and many colleague
and there are some of the relevant
papers and you can find those easily on
my web page and I should also point to
this which is the repository that lives
in the official F sharp project space
which is our library so you can just
download it and use it if you want to
you said that there's only a subset of
things that you can convert to ask here
like a supported set of operations what
if I use but what if I want to write a
function based on supported operations
and use that in a quoted term sorry say
that again what if I want to write my
own function that uses supported
operations only mm-hmm and then use that
that works perfectly well in exactly the
way that I showed you so the question
sorry I should repeat the question the
question was okay you can only use
unsupported operations sorry you can
only let me start over you can only use
supported operations fair enough but I
want to define my own function in terms
of those supported operations and then
use that elsewhere can I do that and the
answer is yes you would define the
function as a quotation and just splice
it in wherever you need it and we saw
lots of examples of functions that got
spliced in and the subform real property
guarantees that all of those uses of
functions will get normalized away we
have time for one more quick one if I
use an unsupported operation will I find
out at compile time a run time ah very
good question
so one property that dsls are supposed
to have is that you find out a compile
time if anything went wrong now what we
want to do in this example was just use
bog standard F sharp and in order to use
bog standard F sharp there are a few
things that you need to check by hand
and I gave you the list right I gave you
a list of what they were is that within
the quote
Asians your answer type is flat that
should be easy to check that you only
use permitted operations okay that's
pretty easy to check and that you only
refer to one database which is again
easy to check if so but you know a DSL I
heard might say no no I want the
language to check that for me anything
you have to write a little preprocessor
that checks those things so no we don't
do that for you automatically if you
wanted to do it then you could easily
write a preprocessor that does it and
then you have the cost of having a
preprocessor
so it's a trade-off but what we don't
give you for free is detecting that you
don't use unpermitted operations where
some other techniques for embedding do
give you that for free so indeed you've
isolated a cost I would say relatively
modest one of the technique I should say
this is all early work right I think
this technique is worth looking at I'm
not going to say this is the way to do
everything what I'm going to say is this
is worth looking at and evaluating and
comparing to other techniques ok and
just that's all the time we have it is
it I thought we just yeah we've got ten
minutes till the next session is that
right um no the session ends at 20 after
um so that you have time to like go out
and around but that's fine by me except
I noticed that I didn't get started
until a bit later because the previous
session didn't start there but that's
fine thank you very much for your
attention I hope to talk to some of you
over coffee thanks very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
