zhang zhehan who's over there and out
mr. Naugle i undressed low-health helped
considerably after the first release as
did the Haskell team at anchor which was
one of the first commercial users of
servant and I think this servant is a
particularly appropriate topic to
discuss here because on the one hand
it's solving a very practical industry
problem namely writing web applications
quickly and easily and safely but on the
other it's using some ideas that though
they existed didn't in some form in in
academia already
I think sermons the first time the first
case that applies them in practice to a
library and these ideas that's the type
level DSL side of it these ideas are
really interesting and I also want to in
addition to discussing servant as a
library also discuss this technique
which I think can be applied in a wide
range of circumstances so I'll talk a
little bit about what it is that
motivated us to do servant - what idea
what what view of what web development
should be like led us to try to write
this library and then I'll switch gears
a little bit and talk about a much
simpler and you have some examples as
well of what it does and then I'll
switch gears and talk about a much
simpler type level DSL that hopefully we
will be much easier to understand and
will really bring out the basic essence
of the technique and also the advantages
therein and hopefully even if you don't
use our library you'll consider applying
the SEC Nikken other circumstances and
then to the extent that I thought I have
time I will also talk about how do we
implement it practically how we convert
how we transform these ideas and
transfer them into the context of
web development so let's talk about the
main idea the main idea is roughly this
in web programming web api is should be
a central concept the description of a
web api in particular should be a
central concept and in a sense this is
already the case if you if you observe
if you've witnessed people working on
api's programmers will web programmers
will very often talk about their api and
discuss it at great length and and in
fact often that's the first is the
business requirement is this is the API
this is how it has to look and so in a
sense making that central accords with
the practice of development and that's
that's one thing that it has going with
with with for it and but currently web
frameworks don't do this if you look at
the code in the code written with most
frameworks the API itself is only
implicit in the implementation this is a
routing section and that's part of what
the API is but the rest of it what the
request body looks like what the
response body looks like what the
headers that I expected
there's strewn all over the handler
handles part of it a routing handles
part of it and we wanted to and it's an
unfortunate circumstance I think now the
the second reason is that it's much
easier to modify with with with the
description of the web api if you change
something at least in the case of
servant you get type errors wherever
wherever things need to be modified and
there's as a for those of you who are
hospital program owners or camel
programmers this will be a familiar and
and very desirable trait of programming
this line in these languages but the
third reason these are both
sort of you'll have to take my word for
it or you'll have to experiment and see
whether you agree with me points but the
third one I hope to make very concrete
and might be the most important and it's
that whether their descriptions are a
reusable component and one that we want
to reuse we want to reuse it in a
variety of circumstances when we are
writing a web service we want to be sure
that we accord with the specification
and we don't want to repeat ourselves
about the aspects that that go into it
when we're writing documentation we also
need it and I'll show you here I'll show
you some examples documentation will be
the first one to to make this more
concrete I'll give a simple example a
simple running example of a service that
just wraps a counter and we'll have two
end points if some aspect of this is
unclear because it's it relates directly
to web programming please interrupt me
and I'll explain as I said I think there
are lessons here that are relevant quite
outside the context of web programming
so so we have two end points and this is
the informal description of what we want
our API to to look like with servant we
can formalize this description we can
write it in a formal yes in a formal way
in a DSL which is the servant DSL and it
looks like this as you can see we we had
to be specific about a couple of extra
things for instance we had to specify if
that Jason is the way in which we encode
hours our response if we had other
content types we would put that in that
list and the type level lift we also
stated over there that step is the URL
that the post will so these two are
these two elements correspond to the two
end points this last one corresponds to
the combination of both
that's symbol in the middle that we call
a alternative combines two sub api's
we still have to define what counter val
is that's a type that's a Haskell type
so what this is saying is there's a get
end point that returns a counter Val
whatever whatever counter Valley is
serialized as Jason and then there's
another end point that responds in the
step you step URL to post requests and
doesn't return anything so we need this
sort of we need this code to get going
we need to declare that the our data
type in this case it's just a new type
wrapper over integer and we need the
appropriate class we said that we will
be returning Jason so we better have we
better be able to serialize this into
Jason a technicality is that we need if
you if you take a look at the section up
here you'll see that all of this all
these things are types but we'll also be
working with a value level and we have a
pre-need a proxy for a value level proxy
for our type to get going and then this
last section I'll explain in a second so
now we have a formal description of our
API
I haven't described what the servant
language looks like I will towards the
end in a more formal in a more formal
way but we've used the elements of the
servant DSL to give a formal description
of our API and given that we have this
we could hope to get a lot of things for
free we could hope to get documentation
Frances very often when you write a web
api you need to document it for your
users so that they know how to direct
with it and this can often be a painful
and error-prone process you sort of have
to look through your code and see where
it does and hopefully get it right and
hopefully maintain it but if we have a
formal language we can just hope to
derive it and using these two functions
from
the counter api is as you'll remember
the value level proxy for a type which
represents our api with using markdown
and dots we get a markdown
representation of our of our API this is
just the get end point but the post
endpoint looks similar and this is and
here you can see where to sample was
used we had to give a sample counter
valve so that the documentation can be
generated and so now there's this
wonderful scenario where as you'll see
we'll be using this this API description
for everything for writing our our
server as well and we can't go wrong
we can't go wrong and documentation
can't get outdated because it's
generated automatically similarly we
might hope that we can generate client
functions functions to query our
endpoints and in fact we can I wouldn't
be mentioning if it couldn't we have to
give a second argument to the client
function that we provide and that is
where the base URL is for our service
and then we Pat and match to get two
functions that that are the client
functions by the way this isn't
cogeneration this is just a higher-order
function and again this can go wrong if
we if we update it this gets updated as
well and if we add an endpoint then
we'll get a type error because their
pattern match assumes that they're two
and two client functions but there will
be three say this is the type of our
functions that we get and this exactly
as we'd expect it's very nice to program
with this
finally we can also hope for safe links
if you have some HTML and it has a link
nature as to something you often get
this case where where the link gets
outdated or you got it wrong and you get
a 404 whenever someone clicks on it but
if you have a description of your API
again you should be able to check
whether a link is a member of that API
or not and we have a function through
this overall we use a proxy for we use
the proxy that we already have for our
entire API and we have a proxy for the
link that we want to generate and if
that link is part of our API then we get
a link this is not actually a string it
just when printed looks like a string
and if it's not a if it's not a member
of our API if we try to do something it
doesn't exist we get a type error now in
my opinion this is this is the best
example of a smart constructor you don't
need a maybe you get a type error if you
can't generate it if you shouldn't be
able to generate it but of course the
the main thing that everyone's
interested in is is writing service
themselves and again we have a
description of the API so all we should
have to do is write the handlers
everything else we've already described
so we write the handlers those the the
servers get counter and server step
counters are types synonyms that are
associated type synonyms that will get
resolved into something that will
explain a second but as you can see
these two these two handlers are barely
aware and are not all aware of the fact
that they exist in the context of a web
api because we've already largely
handled that aspect of it by describing
the API and then we combine them and we
initialize the T var that we're using
and that's then that's the server and to
conform to a specification it will reply
in the correct endpoints and whatnot and
do all the things that you expect web
frameworks to do
that's that's a slice so I hope that
that gives a sense for why it is that we
think that abstracting away this notion
of a description of your API is an
important one forget all these things
that work with serving right now but but
there's there's this lingering question
of how do we get this done and you
probably already have a sense from the
title of the talk and from the examples
of before and that we have a DSL that
exists at a type level and with this
with the terms in this DSL you can
create an expression that represents
your API so let's talk about these type
level yourselves let's start with
something very simple here's an
expression in simple arithmetic DSL that
has just add in 1 as its terms and I'm
imagine most of you have have either
written something like this or know
exactly how to interpret something like
this and generally the answer is this or
something like this this is easy and
it's great but I never said that this
was a value level this is actually a
type so that won't work so let's try
again let's let's imagine how we would
interpret this as a type it turns out
that the answer isn't that much more
complicated
we're at a class that represents our
interpretation function we need to need
a value level proxy to figure out which
instance to pick and we sort of given
the same signature that we had before
almost and then we simply write
instances for it for the terms that we
want to interpret we also need to
declare empty data types we don't care
about the value level we're done with
that value level for now so so our data
types don't actually they're empty and
as you can see this isn't that much more
complicated than our value level to
yourself and you may think whoa cool but
this is just a parlor trick but it
really isn't the two big advantages to
doing this for the type level one is
that it's extensible it's extensible
along two axes in our value level DSL if
we want to write another interpretation
function we could if we want a pretty
print we could just write a new function
that would do the pretty-pretty printing
but if you wanted to add a new term we
would be in trouble if we had been
provided with a library that contained
the expression data type and we couldn't
touch the library we'd be in trouble
because they the types aren't open so
this is known after after Philip Wadler
believed as the expression problem or
this is one manifestation of the
expression problem and and Thecla hold
yourself solve this because if I want to
add a new term I just declare new data
type multi for instance and then I just
declare an instance for it and interpret
it so that's cool
but there are other solutions that solve
this problem the the the great thing the
other great thing about type level DSL
is the second advantage and is that
we're in the right side of the phase
distinction so this is this is you know
we're talking about Haskell which
doesn't have full dependent types
so our types are not allowed to depend
on values and this is important and this
is important for reasons that you might
already be seeing but that will become
clearer in a second but roughly look we
have an expression that represents and
let's go back to the servant ESL in mind
we have an expression that represents
our API now it could have one endpoint
it could have two we could have three
and in order to generate a server from
this expression we also need the
handlers and the the number of handlers
that we need varies with the expression
and in fact the type of the handlers
themselves varies with the expression so
we need to be able to do this we need to
be able to vary what we expect in order
to generate a server depending on the
expression and that means we need to
vary the types
so let's look more concretely how this
works in a vague extension of our simple
DSL we now add a hole and the idea
behind the hole is this whenever you
have you see a hole in your expression
in order to fully evaluate it into an
int into an integer you'll need to
provide another integer so you know add
hole that hole will require two integers
so now we can see how the types vary
right depending on the expression and we
can do this we now have a different
evaluation function we need something we
need an Associated type synonym that
allows the instance to declare how the
types vary and if you look at this if
you imagine value a are being just R
you'll see that it looks a lot like our
original eval phone
action in CPS form but of course value
AR doesn't have to be our in the case of
of one it it's basically just a CPS
version of a previous interpretation of
our previous instance in the case of ad
it is - it gets a little bit uglier
because of because of CPS now wait let
me see if I can get this well yeah there
we go
and so now the case of hole is the
interesting one the case of coal is the
interesting one
sorry it's locked out I don't understand
Max or computers the case of hole
requires an extra integer in order to to
evaluate and so we get something like
this look so here we have another
expression and it has a hole the
expression has a hole so once we have
valid we should expect something of type
into it because we have one hole so that
means we need an integer in order to get
back an integer and if we have two holes
then we get something you've typed into
into it and this is this is this is I
think the big advantage of having type
level dsls
so so now we'll go a little bit into
into the servant language itself I gave
you quite a few examples of the things
that you can do with an API description
in the servant ESL and each one of those
corresponds to an interpretation
function of the DSL and so similarly
each one of them has a class associated
with it that does the interpretation
much like our eval from a moment ago and
and quite a few of them have slightly
different approaches techniques involved
in order to get them going but of course
would be too much to talk about all of
them
so I'll just focus in the case of the
server and the server interpretation so
let's talk a little bit about the
servant grammar I've simplified it
somewhat and importantly it's extensible
remember you can always add new terms
and this is this is this turned out
great for us because it basically means
that we have a plug-in system a very
nice plug-in system where that we know
is nice because it's what we use to
write the library in the first place so
it's not like there's some second-class
citizen that's a plug-in system this is
actually what we use to write the entire
library so you can express we can't
foresee all the things that you might
want to express about your DSL you might
have very strange dependencies between
status codes and the requests and
response bodies or headers all these
things that we can't foresee but we
don't have to because you can write
these you can write new terms yourself
but still there's a core that we
realized as important to provide out of
the box
so we have API which is the top level
and we have this alternative Combinator
that combines two API so if you have a
sub API with four endpoints and one with
two you can combine them and make a
larger API and then we have this item
and that company over there hunka calls
bird face yep and that basically applies
applies something to the API so we have
some examples over here symbol for
instance symbol is just a Haskell
I'm throughout I'm using a lot of
implicitly assuming a lot of Hospital
extensions type operators and you know
yeah type let's a lot of a lot of them
and so we can we saw this before the
step URL was a type level literal and
when we combine it with bird face then
we say that the entire API on the right
hand side will be served under that URL
and if you come by multiple ones and
another one is a request body a request
body has like has a set of content types
and then a Haskell type so I can say
look the entire API on the right hand
side which might be just one endpoint
but it might be multiple ones all of
them expect a request body and the
request body should be serious DC
realizable into the type that I specify
as a second argument and the content
types that I accept are a type level
lift the first argument and all this is
type safe we we type check to be sure
that in fact we know how to deserialize
that type via the methods that you
specify
capture is something that will also be
familiar to web programmers if there's a
URL you might want to get it out it
might be someone's ID it might be
someone's name someone's age so we
that's re that second one should be type
instead of s type so we again have to
deserialize that and we always serialize
with the same class in that case from
text the symbol over there is used for
documentation purposes only and then we
have the method each method I'm zone is
already an entire API but of course it
can be combined with other things we
have the usual ones we have more we have
raw which is interesting we can combine
other Haskell application web
applications written with other fake
frameworks and as a sub API well some
web frameworks not all of them type is
just a Haskell type content types is a
type level list of Haskell type of
content types
some of which are for example plain text
jason HTML so this is this is a fraction
of the of the terms in the language and
the non terminals on the terms in the
language that we we ourselves provide
but there's more that we provide them
there's more that you can write and this
is the class that we use to provide the
server implementation as you can see it
looks a lot like like our eval Prime in
particularly it has an Associated type
synonym
and that is used as a second argument
again we have the proxy in in order to
figure out the types and whatnot but the
important argument is the sect of the
second argument and this is interesting
we we get to vary the second the type of
the second argument so in the case of
say get something then we expect
something of a particular type the type
of the handler a single handler but if
you combine two guests then we expect a
different type which is a combination of
two handlers so we get to vary that
routing application is can sort of yeah
I'll skip over it basically the essence
of it is that once you have an API
description you have a tree of sorts
with an implicit root node and so when
we are routing a request we sort of go
through the tree and trying to see
whether something matches and if
something matches we return that and if
it doesn't if nothing matches then we
return to 404 or whatever would you have
to sort of like look through it and see
which one combined in a sort of Monarch
way to see which one we should you
respond with noting application is
basically doing that so a particular
instance a particular interpretation of
a particular term that is my yeah that's
that's worth looking at is get forget
method but they'll simplify it a little
bit as I said you can have a list of
content types and we'll check that each
one we know how to see DC sorry
serialize in the case of the request
body we have to be able to deserialize
the value in the case of the response
the method we have to be able to
serialize the value and we do this for
any number of content types
but I'll simplify it a little bit and
assume that we are using just plain text
in this case to show how it works so we
declare an empty datatype we just care
about the type level
we declare an instance for it we have a
constraint over there that is that the T
can be shown so then we know how to
serialize it as plain text just by
showing it and then this says look the
the type that I expect is an either T
servant err IOT so in the case of left
you might you know your handler might
error for some reason you can always
return the left you can always do i oh
but if everything goes right you should
return the T whatever the T is that you
specify and then we apply route those
extra arguments come from routing
application we check that the path is
empty because we've been cutting off
parts of the path to get to the leaf
node that are the methods and if it's
empty then the URL matched and then we
also have to check the the method
matched and if the method matched then
we accept which I'll show in a second
otherwise we say no this this was bad
try something else
and then accept the type of the handler
is whatever we said that it was it's if
we're free to do to choose whatever we
want so we just run our either T which
is what we asked for and then if it
matches we set the content type and
respond with 200 and then if it didn't
match then we say oh there was an error
someone returned to left from the
handler so just give whatever error
their handler responded with so the
handler is a simple Haskell and a
completely non special Haskell datatype
we didn't even write it and of course I
should say the actual service
implementations have a lot of other
details going into them but this is sort
of a vague idea
and then we also have this the
alternative implementation the basic
idea is that whatever whatever we expect
from the left hand side and whatever we
expect from the right hand side we
expect the combination of those as an
argument once we see this so if we have
to handle it or if we have the
combination of two guess we expect the
combination of those as the argument and
then well I won't go into the details
but you try one then you try the other
this this might sound inefficient
actually benchmarks of head show that
it's not it's competitive with any
haskell web framework and then there's
capture but i won't go into details
because basically this is by now
hopefully becoming sort of intuitive
it's just writing a web framework in the
same way that you would before but in
the context of this entire
infrastructure so yeah so so hopefully i
should i just wanted to give a sense for
what the great advantage of having type
level DSLR and show that it works even
for very web frameworks are fairly
complex and and it still works and it's
still flexible enough to work quite well
and we've have all these interpretations
that do quite distinct things and we can
still implement them as interpretations
of a type level dsl so the notion of a
type level of yourselves sounds scary
but really we can do all these nice
things on there these two properties
that together very hard to find
I would guess impossible to find in
Haskell elsewhere and so yeah and so so
and and of course a I also don't do one
to sort of play up and leave a little
bit the idea that we with with this we
can write a new type of web framework I
think the reason why this was so hard
before and why no one did it is because
the extensibility is really
important and so there are web baby i
description languages they're called
there is not there had to be hard to
extend so they become these protocols
that are really complicated and whatnot
but if instead you have this extensible
language that's a dsl and whatnot you
really you really managed to do it and I
think also the the second component
which is varying the type that you
expect which you have to do unless you
crush everything into something like the
type of i/o unit and lose all type
safety because this is really type safe
in a sense right you specify your your
DSL and then you're forced to implement
it in a way that accords with your
specification in addition to getting a
lot of things for free so there are all
these they're all these things that work
out really nicely from this basic idea
of using a type level to yourself and
interpreting in this way yeah so thank
you I yeah all right so you can go back
to slide number ten number ten yeah ten
yeah so I say well if I make a mistake
here I get type error yeah so that's
great what does it look like
a little bit of self-promotion I suspect
now I'll admit it doesn't look good
there we have some tricks that make it
look we can sort of stop how far the
type error goes because I once I've once
made my computer stopped working because
of the type error but it was just or to
throw him anywhere did I store the
program no I know it was a really we did
at some point get really terrible
tippers now we get bad Piper's because
you I can imagine that somebody uses
your servant API says well please get
rid of the types now because actually I
prefer to run a unit test that gives me
good explanation where something goes
wrong instead of a tire that I really
don't understand yeah yeah yeah the this
is this is one of this is one of the big
problems that we still have which is
that we can enforce safety in all these
ways that are really good but basically
what we're left with is look you did
something wrong go go go back and figure
out what you did wrong we can't help you
which is yeah which is a good point yeah
so earlier you mentioned that Haskell
does not yet have dependent types if it
did how could you make this even more
awesome yeah so so we we when we were
writing a paper about this and we sort
of gave some thought about how it would
work in a language like I dress or Agda
and really for us the the type classes
are a sort of an important aspect of it
so you still need to have classes so and
it says type classes yes yes so it would
actually not look that different one of
the big differences is that instead of
having this explicit associated types in
them you could just you know do sort of
more regular value level and then figure
it out afterwards we we didn't give it
enough thought to come up with a
definitive answer either way but we
didn't see anything that was obviously
much better with dependent types so can
I make a quick suggestion something that
might be cool to do yeah so if your DSL
was encoded as an explicit value rather
than as a type and they sort of
interpreted as types yes or a typical
way yeah you could potentially read one
in at run time and so you could use them
on both sides of the phase distinction
right so read in an API description from
the user and then immediately be able to
call that API all of it safe yeah rather
than sort of having to recompile your
