out please to talk about object algebras
and how to use them to design in the
engineering sense domain-specific and be
dead languages ok so we are going to do
all that first I'm going to introduce
you the problems that led me to look at
a victory bath then what they are how I
implement them in Sierra and I will
highlight some of them properties and
finally I will pronounce the M word I
apologize by advance so first well who
am i I'm this would be quick so I'm
basically a software engineer and I
spent the last five years to essentially
build web applications so what kind of
problems did I met typically you know
web applications are about clients and
servers so when they communicate they
have to agree at some point on a common
protocol communication protocol I'm not
talking about HTTP I'm talking about the
application level protocol so that the
request / from past clients are
correctly interpreted by 0 server and
when we want to have documentation for
our web service we we also want to
describe this protocol so we end up
having the implementation and the
description of our particle scattered
and duplicated in several places so that
was a problem I wanted to resolve
so let me illustrate this with an
example in skala so let's imagine we
have a reputation for shopping that lets
users get information about an item they
want to buy for example so the important
part is that i'm on the server side at
some point we want to check whether an
incoming requests match is some pattern
and in such a case we call some business
logic and then we return our response to
the client so now on the client side
that the opposite we want to build a
request so that's how we we do it and
you see that indeed the way we build the
request here for example in constructing
the path item / blah blah blah the user
identifier duplicate the pattern that we
want to match here and also the HTTP web
get is duplicated here and here and also
the JSON representation used by the
cleansers ever is duplicated and so on
and if we have a system that documents
our HTTP API then from stones here the
description of the former that is
returned by every server duplicate also
the implementation of the server so all
of this must be consistent together so
that's a pain to maintain so instead of
that I want to have just one language
that I can use to effectively describe
the whole protocol communication and
then I want to be able to derive from
this language a client implementation
with a very employment a shin and to be
able to generate documentation so that's
a good okay
mmm but then I have an engineering a
concern um I don't want to do that for
each project each new application so I
want to be able to capture somewhere in
a library in a reusable library the part
of my language which are not specific to
a given application so then so that i
can use it in which application but then
if i do that i have another problem i
want to be able to integrate application
specific concerns in my common language
so i need a means of extensibility to be
able to do that another motivation for
extensibility is that we might want to
be able to break down our whole language
into smaller languages focusing each on
different part and maybe with some
languages having more power than other
and maybe sometimes relying on some
specificity and some interpreters so
that the idea is that the whole language
is not them done by the limitation of
some interpreters I will come back to
that later so object algebra our
solution to this problem object algebra
our solution that I did not invent so
here are some references that you can
read if you like the topic so all the
credits and go to these guys so we have
to start by first specifying the domain
of our language what are we going to
talk about so for the sake of brevity in
this talk I will focus on a subset of an
HTTP API just on the path of URL so a
URL path is for instance / pool / bar /
item / 123 ABC or flash item so it's
made of segments
separated by / it so we want a language
that allows us to define such segments
and to combine them by changing them so
we can translate this into what we call
an algebra interface which is just an
abstract interface or trade in skala
which contains these two constructors
segments and change the first one
construct the path segment and the
second one change together to segment is
the return type here is a is a which is
an abstract type parameter for now we
can we can see that this algebra
interface as a kind of abstract factory
that gives us the world to create an N
combined path but the return type of
this Factory is unknown yet as we will
see it will depend on the interpreters
that we will use but we can already use
this algebra interface to define path so
we just define this method here so say
that we want to define the following
pass item / 123 ABC then we we just have
this method the Texas parentals or Java
interface and then we just choose the
Constructors easy then we have to define
an interpreter so I need an interpreter
is just an implementation of the algebra
interface so when we implement an
algebra interface the first thing to do
is to choose a concrete representation
here for the carrier type so yeah from
the perspective of the client I want to
build path so i'm using a string as a
representation for path and then if i
apply this interpreter to summit empath
I get the forum so following path as
expected ok then from the server side
perspective thing things are different
ok that's a sign that there is too much
talent
slide and so the the job of the server
is to process incoming requests to check
whether they their path matches or not
the definition of the path so here as a
concrete representation I'm choosing a
function that takes us parameter the
path of an incoming requests and returns
a boolean okay so now if i apply this
routine interpreter to some attempt at i
get this function and then this finger
if i apply a path candidate full / bar I
get first if and if i apply item / 123 I
bc i get to so that's it easy um so so
far we define an algebra interface that
gives us the vocabulary of a language
and tells us how to define concept and
to combine them together and then we
define interpreters to give several
meanings to this vocabulary okay we just
needed abstract methods and inheritance
and type parameters you can do that in
july july five okay so let's do some
more sophistication in practice when you
have algebra interface when you have a
richer language you end up having
several karyotypes because you will have
you want to use one indistinct carrier
type pair concept so if you if you have
the concept of path and then the concept
of query string and then the concept of
URL then you will have three type
parameters here and that will be a pain
to use so instead of having type
parameters in skala you can trade them
for tech members so here I just removed
type parameters and replaced them with
abstract type
members so path query string and you are
way okay so why is it more convenient
like this look at you site now when I
take an algebra interface as perimeter I
don't have to specify all these type
parameters again and again that's just
the point how to support syntax we can
do that in scalar by adding an upper
bound constraint to our abstract type
member so we say that this path is
abstract but it has 0 but it has to be a
subtype of this path syntax and this
type is implemented here and it defines
a symbolic ideas for the chain
Combinator so that interpreters will we
just mix this trade into the concrete
representation and at the use side we
can just use the the nice syntax here
with the symbolic / instead of having to
write chained for instance okay this
this one is a bit more complex so until
now the path that we were able to
express were all constant it was like /
/ / / item / ABC 123 but we will not we
are not able with the model i presented
we are not able to describe a path which
is made for existence of one segment /
item for instance followed by any string
segment any segment containing string
information we can fix that by the
making path type constructor so here
that's my algebra interface my type path
here takes now a type parameter a and I
introduced two new constructors string
segment which returns a path that
carries a string information and integer
Sigma which returns a path that carries
on
information and I updated the chain
combinator so that it carries a total of
both the first path and the second path
okay so now i can define a path that
takes that describes any string segment
and and then any integral segment like
this for example if my items can be
located by first name and then astre an
integer identifier okay but let's look
at the the consequences on the
interpreter side so now when we choose
the use a concrete representation of our
path type and for instance for the
client interpreter we have to say what
does this a information means in the
perspective of the client and from the
perspective of the client this
information is the information that is
needed to build the path so we use a
function from a to string to represent a
path so now if we apply this interpreter
to item and then we apply this
information then we get the expected
path em but from the server side
perspective the situation is the
opposite the a information is what is
extracted from an incoming request right
so we use a function from from string to
option of path to represent our path so
if we apply this interpreter and then we
apply this candle advice but we are able
to extract this information but then if
we apply this candlelit bath we are not
able to extract any information because
bar here is not an integer
okay I'm I stop it um so now some
interesting properties of objected
revise the first one extensibility
that's that was actually the main point
of abject algebras they they were
initially designed as a solution to the
expression program it means that we can
extend an algebra interface in both
direction we can reach for actively add
new vocabulary so Frank for instance we
can extend the URL algebra interface and
introduce the concept of request by
defining a trait which extend the
algebra interface and which introduce
new abstract members that's it so here
the this get method means a request an
HTTP request using the get method and we
can also implement interpreters we are
ready so some of them so here is another
example an interpreter that produces an
HTML page documenting the vapi so again
an interpreter is just an implementation
of an algebra interface and both
interpreter and specialization of an
algebra interface can be implemented
independently of the algebra interface
itself ok and in the case of scalar
because we have multiple tried
inheritance we really have this ability
to define a composite language from
several pieces that we pick together and
then we are also able to define a
composite interpreter for this language
by picking the interpreters of this
language and combining them together
so that's a very powerful actually
modular explosive power these properties
is very interesting but a bit complex so
I'm going to explain it on top of this
version of the algebra interface the one
that takes here this type parameter a
for the path karyotype so let's say I
want to refine this algebra interface
and I want to say that the path carrier
tab must be an applicative factor I can
do that by extending the ribbon
interface and introducing this abstract
member of type applicative of path so it
means that at some point interpreters
will have to give an implementation of
an applicative of path corresponding to
the concrete representation they use for
path okay and I at use side clients
users can benefit from the expressive
power of applicative factors to
manipulate path for instance we can
already implement the chain Combinator
using the map to sometimes known deep
with community oh that comes from the
application fanta or we could also say
that the path type must be a minute so
again we extend the algebra interface
and we define this abstract member of
type monad of path and here because the
man I'd is also an applicative filter
I'm actually extending the applicative
interface rather than path interface so
what's the point of or that we will see
in a few slides don't worry then from
the own
at the interpreter side and we have to
implement we can when the the goal of
interpreter is to be as powerful as
petites to implement a language as
powerful as possible so in the case of
France stands the routine interpreter we
we can implement the melodic an
interface so we do so so here i am using
as a concrete representation a kind of
statement but then we season we see that
in the case of the documenting
interpreter we cannot actually implement
the magnetic interface because our
concrete representation is just a string
so we cannot implement a monad of paths
if if a path of a is a strain you can
write but okay we cannot implement a
minute but we can implement applicative
functor so let's do it well what's the
point of that now at use side when you
write a program maybe sometimes you need
only the expressive power of applicative
factor and in that case you will require
as parameter the applicative interface
and maybe sometimes you need the
explosive power of am honored and in
such a case you will require as
parameters the melodic interface but the
consequence is that the second program
here can be interpreted by less
interpreters because not all
interpreters are able to be melodic
basically so the conclusion is that the
the more expressive power your program
requires the less interpreters you can
apply to it so pick the least powerful
explosive power you need
last gsa families that's the ability to
encode subtyping relationships between
carrier types so here for instance I'm
saying that the path type must be a
subtype of the URL path okay so what's
the point of that well in practice it's
it's useful to to specialized some some
dsl and to add new capabilities to it
for instance here we can say that both
URLs and paths can be seen as URL but
unknit paths have the ability to be
chained together okay so if we put
things together what time is it okay
initially we have this problem where we
had a client and server which were
duplicating things so we want I wanted
to be able to capture the essence of the
HDD application level protocol on top of
HTTP so that i don't i do not hard code
things both in the client and in the
server so first i want to capture so the
fact that i'm using the HTTP web gate
and using this URL pattern so i can do
that with my language as follows and
then i can replace the server
implementation by applying by playing
the routing interpreter to my path to my
endpoint definition request definition
and also I can remove some code of my
client god by applying the client
interpreter to request a specification
to read anything okay
and I can also get automatic
documentation from my system by applying
this interpreter to to my read item
requests I think so last comparison with
women ads so initially I wanted to do a
deep comparison but it was too long so I
shrink a shrink it so here is the first
attempt to explain what Freeman ads are
in just one slide so Freeman ads
abstract over the melodic context of a
DSL interpreter well how does it works
in practice you start by defining your
language as a data type so the
Constructors of your data type are the
same as the constructors that we have in
our algebra interface actually okay and
then you wrap your data type
constructors into the Fremen odd so that
users can use them and write program
within n at some point you will
implement interpreters to actually do
something useful with your dsl and your
interpreter in the case of the Fremen ad
has to be a minute so because users can
use your dsl without binding it to a
given interpreter I'm saying that women
has abstract over the magnetic context
of the interpreter of the dsl so I kept
only one point of comparison there are a
lot of things that we could compare and
and tell about Freeman heads and
objected Jabbar's so I kept on this
point so a key difference is that with
Freeman add your interpreter has to be a
monad while with objected cheap-ass your
interpreter can do not but this is not
required so objective as are actually
more general than minute and as we have
seen in the module expressive power
section the fact that women had required
the interpreters to be a man add reduces
the space of possible interpretation for
a given language so in my example on me
the routing interpreter was able to be a
minute and more generally when you have
dual interpreters like a client and
server then at most one of them can be a
minute but not both so that's an
important limitation I think so in
conclusion I think objected rivers are a
way to define extensible NBD dsl in your
programming language and I think they
are quite easy and natural to to use in
object oriented programming languages
because they essentially rely on simple
features of object orientation like
abstract members and also i think they
are more general and also in my opinion
simpler than three minutes so that's why
i think they deserve more attention from
the community so that's it
thank you for the talk and my question
is how do you compare this approach with
a cake pattern that is usually used in a
similar way we do have rich patent cake
pattern Oh actually that's very similar
I mean in skala when you use objective
as you end up using the kick by 10 oh
yeah yes that's very very similar to the
kick pattern actually I think the cake
by tens of the cake pattern naturally
emerges in a lot of situation in skala
so you you might discover it
accidentally in a tough situation maybe
this one is one of them
so first I think there's technically
interpreter for free minute is not the
Mona there's a natural transformation
between Mona's as far as I remember yeah
but the target type of the
transformation is a few minute yeah but
itself is a natural transformation and
also push but that's not the question
the question is maybe you could you
compare to rehab Lakotas do the object
algebra grouchy when with free
applicative you have the same situation
than then here which means that it
requires your interpreter to be an
applicative factor and what can i say as
i think basically when you when you
write dsl's in using the free edge style
or free applicative style well today
there is no tooling that helps you
decide later if you if you can if you
want to use the free application if you
want your your dsl to target free
applicative or criminals and here you
can you can decide later you have more
flexibility when you want to to use a 1
expressive power where rather than
another specific are I expect a soldier
question
no they're question okay thanks
