programming languages like Haskell but
and many Anna others we've got a dilemma
when it comes to programming of graphics
libraries animations games engines these
sorts of things so we can either use an
existing state-of-the-art framework and
use it probably object-oriented
imperative API bound via foreign
function interface and write something
like objective-c code but in Haskell or
we can use a native Haskell solution
with graphics code it up from pixel by
pixel and maybe have a slightly sub
optimal graphical representation but
nice pure functional code well the
question is can we somehow take an
existing state of the art framework and
wrap it in a manner that we can still
have this nice algebraic and purely
functional API that's what this talk is
about it's not that we couldn't write a
library like this in history from
scratch but doing this is just a huge
engineering effort which people in
practice are not going to go through so
what we want to do we want a nice
function API and then a translation
layer which transcribes operations on
that functional API into a changes in
the underlying object-oriented
interactive framework so the way we are
going to do this we are going to look at
what the state of the art how do these
frameworks work these days
then what's the function interface we
would like to have and then finally how
can we bring the two together and to
keep this talk concrete I use two
concrete examples the sprite kit library
which is Epis framework for animations
games programming on all of epic epic
devices and a little game which may seem
familiar
so let's have a look at the state of
that in this case so you know the ocean
version where you are referred and
either some kill team there animation
types coming in some pretty pollution
tablet app so we have table all these
things so how is such a scene
represented in a framework like spicy
well we we start with the scene object
and then below that is a scene graph
composed out of a variety of different
types of what are called nodes in this
tree and they are notes which is a
visual representation such as the sprite
but they're also notes which are just to
group items and and then we can attach
properties to the visual and non-visual
notes those properties could be actions
and amazing action such as a movement of
a time or they can also be physical
properties where these nodes and
participate in a physics simulation for
example to add gravity or other forces
to the sea now this is really infected
graph because there's back edges and so
forth but in the rest of the talk I will
just read it at the truth and that's
okay at first as approximation so what
are some of the challenges that we face
when we want to represent this type of
structure in a in a purely functional
image like this one well it starts with
inheritance now surprise so spark it has
a super cloud called 8k node and below
that some specialized types of of nodes
and the superclass it contains a variety
of property and also methods which are
shared between all these different nodes
a location on the screen and so forth
and and somehow we have to
representation our healthy version and
then even worse I think after has made a
not so smart design decision by putting
the C in the overall root object into
this hierarchy as well for some I guess
not so smart reasons but as a
consequence we in an objective-c or
Swift program you actually have to
subclass this 8:18 object and probably
add some game states and in particular
you need to subclass it because the
superclass in Kokura and echo patterns
of HK note is a class called NS
responder whose purpose is to give you
access to input events so if you want to
get mouth click keyboard input touches
on on a touchscreen screen you need to
be able to subtract those classes and
doing that from Hezbollah is not going
to be any sort of fun so we have to find
a different way to do so that's problem
number one problem number two well we we
have mutation so for example the birth
is the kilt depending on its vertical
velocity so how is that we like well in
Swift or objective-c we just go into the
sprite a class which is a subclass of SK
node and hence inherit this rotation
property which is highlighted here and
just by changing that we can change the
tilting of the sprite now where's this
changes are set as well if we look at
the overall picture then we see that the
root class and the theme class includes
a method update and that's like the
sleek mr2 same things
it's called once per frame got in
through its self pointer it has access
to the entire tree and it can happily
mutate what about one in particular it
can change the
rotation of all the different notes now
this is certainly extremely non
functional way of performing this kind
of thing so we'll have to have a
different story here as well well but it
gets worse it's not just that visual
properties or locations positions are
being changed the entire graph changes
if you look at how these cards come into
the theme and float out of the scene
again well that's new objects which
appear on the screen and the way this is
realized is that again it cannot contain
certain methods which lets us edit the
structure of the scene graph you can add
notes you can take notes out you can
rearrange now and again it is from the
superclass this is case till object
update functions which we where we can
just go into this because note and then
what happens in this scene we first saw
we of course wanted a pair a pair of
types and then another one is added in
one frame another one is added in
another frame and then eventually one
set of type will move out of the sea so
all these graph edits we have to
represent somehow so just to summarize
so far we have got three types of
problems firstly there's the subclasses
somehow and we haven't got any
inheritance and helpful but we have to
kind of deal with the shared properties
of methods and that we need access to
these input events and so on and then we
have mutable properties and even worse
mutation of the entire scene graph and
we want to represent this in a purely
functional language in fact we don't
want to use anything like an eye all
mourn at or anything like that okay that
that would be and you to code which is
essentially like the imperative code you
don't win anything
it's fun isn't it all right so let's
have a look at what would we want so
with respect to the sub classing if you
look at this particular set up and
really we can ignore this teen class
because it really shouldn't be in this
hierarchy in the first place then only
what we got we got the face class it
came out with all those shared
properties and then we got something
like the Sun right and now this as I
label also sprite ultimate feckner I
mean these are all alternatives
so let's represent it as a sum type is
enough we use health records in pet and
we've got one variant for each and for
those of you familiar with the
historical syntax you may know that
within different alternatives of one
algebraic data type of different
alternatives of a sum you can actually
reuse the same label which means if by
convention in this case we do this for
every alternative you get a similar
effect as net of the base class in the
class hierarchy or something like name
position and so on these are shared
fields throughout all alternatives
that's what work what in objective-c is
in the air came out superclass and then
every alternative but the plain old
alternatives it is owned as alternative
specific fields such as labeled lab
which has a label text which is being
presented all right so first problem
kind of salt but we still have got
access the input events well that's
going to be sought in next part but we
still have to take care of the scene we
the thing which used to be in the
hierarchy we took out so we turn it into
its own data type
and it contains a list of notes which
are the different notes in the tea and
as we will see later the other variants
of the note type that can have children
as well so to get the three structure
and the team class is parameterize by
two type arguments and that's our way of
representing the extension of local
state which is usually game specific
state in a functional manner so as you
can see this English use this field and
the children no datatype refer to the
second type parameter so we've got a way
of parametrizing all the notes and the
team with game specific States without
performing any custom all right so let's
see how this works out well let's um go
into this and first of all we we have to
define the state which is specific to
our game so in this case for the
individual notes we don't need a lot of
extra days except where we spawn the
types because we need random numbers to
have the types appear at different
height
now let's the list of integers here
which is the null set then on top of
that we need a space record for the
entire game and let's mostly a few
different flags which represent the
specific mode in which we are whether
the game is over
it's running collision and so on and
some information like the current score
and so forth so we add this as well and
then finally we are not quite likely
have described which is the birth is
recalled manga and it has some visual
properties and then we've also got the
overall theme which includes for now the
words it is only child and if we display
we see now we've sus casas bird flapping
hanging met me there alright so so so
far so good
well let's take care of all these
mutation well now in this edge of a
datatype this is just the standard has
to type there's no way we can update
like over wide a field in the middle of
a healthy data structure it's a purely
functional language but then the
functional way of dealing with such a
situation is to define a state
transformer so we change the type of the
update method which now becomes an
update function so this is part of the
feel description then we can have an
update function as what's the type of
the update party well if you pure
function it takes this scene description
a record a time is the relative status
how much time passed in the lab we
occasionally something and it it returns
another thing there's no changing of the
old field which would be the interest
imperative approach now we will turn a
new value which is a representation of
the new state that is exactly the state
transformation function now this is if
you like the straightforward functional
and the most elegant and simple
representation the function language
okay so what about those is really
endless well you can deal with that in
exactly the same way the ceiling
representations addition to this update
function also contains ultimately an
event handler function and that function
the ethel event which is a
representation of him them like normal
in copper and then in this case doesn't
he just gave specific and polymorphic
see in the definition field data and it
may return a change birth of that why
maybe well this has to do with the setup
of event hanging in cocoa will be
synthesized whether we want to handle a
specific variable let it bubble up the
responder chain so we've really turned
this into a purely functional API so
let's use it in our little game so for
the moment the first just crosses into
the ground so we haven't got any any
event ending we need an event handler
and whatever events happened we need to
kind of be able to push to build up and
fills its position so we are going to
add some color and the first bit of that
is the event enter the event handler is
event it is a key press event then and
we take the game day and we this is
record update impact enhancer which give
me the purely function language that
means overwrite the field called key
press but it means make it new birth of
this thing where that one field value is
replaced by that new value but the old
one exists existed before so now in
place update but we just created new
slightly modified version so given that
event handler it records the scale he
pressed in the game state and then in
this update button which is the big
hammer to update stop once per frame we
can
use of the fact that a keyword quest and
color function which add some upward
velocity to the bird to pop it up and
also if they are with no keys this
question we have another hand called
cute lambda the words that I am doing
well it has to do the adjusting the
rotation of the sprite independent of
the vertical velocity of the earth and
just do that we do some arithmetic to
calculate the exact angle and then again
we have a record update when we take the
current sprite representing the world
and we alter its rotation field and
again the same idea this is a record
update in Haskell where we take the old
record value I generate a new version of
that with a slight visual field modified
know about writing up everything okay in
let them works quite nicely
we can finally kind of keep the bird up
and accuse if it's a poster now finally
how do we deal with graph edit I guess
you probably saw where I am going and
really I am doing the same thing all
over again because just like to see all
the different nodes alternative the list
of children which are just other nodes
and if I want to change that well I do
record update a purely functional record
update and so for example and if we here
because this is very games nearly done
but they're not heisted all right so we
have to be able to add new pipes to the
game and we do that in two steps
as an action these are these actions
which can only be added to note in order
to implement animation we add an action
a custom action to a specific super note
for all these types and that is spawn
Titanic
now that's a custom function which is
applied to the note from which where we
hang the pipette of a children so what's
the code for for adding another pipette
well quite quickly you take the current
node with all types of s and which
contains a list of children unless this
is this compare this containing hello so
we add a new element in front of that
list of children which are pairs of
pipes which is just the new pipe air
coming in from the side of the screen so
again a record update taking the old
value producing a new value which is
slightly modified so at this point you
may say depending on your exposure to
fund community
let's indeed how you would like a purely
functional version to work but how can
this ever come together with this
underlying sprite kit implementation
are we going to copy everything all the
time 60 times per second well let's look
at this object well so we've got this
graph here and we then the update
functions involved so the first thing we
have to do we have this Objective C data
structure then we convert it all over to
a head when is this my way emphasis more
graph could be much bigger then we run
the spawn pipe head function which we
saw in the previous slide which takes
the list and adds another list element
in front okay now there you have to turn
all this back into objective-c data
structure and loaded behold the new list
element turns into new subtree during
this marshaling concept but we still got
this always like the previous pipe here
which was already on the screen helps us
take this representation in objective-c
22 the Hetzel data structure only to
recreate it in Objective C land again
sounds like a bad idea doesn't it in
fact it's a really bad idea because not
only is it slow obviously it actually
wouldn't work
why well these types of frameworks not
only sprite kids but in particular
bracket they typically contain quite a
bit of hidden state so for example if it
has an action to a node which takes a
node and move it over one second in a
smooth animation from one place to
another then for many many many many
friends sprite kit has to keep track of
what we're how fast is an amazing
progress that it has to be accelerated
to accelerate there's a lot of
information and all that is in hidden
fields which are not part of the public
API so if you take a node which is
caused one of those actions attached and
you just turn it into a hassle
a structure losing all that hidden
straight turn expect into objective-c
structure then we lose all of that
hidden information and our animations
will be interrupted or we said like lots
of weird graphical things will happen so
and then of course it's horribly
inefficient so we have to come up with a
better plan
so what's the better claim the better
plan is as follows let's be smart about
it
so we've got our structure in Objective
C layer and we want to implement this
here has the function the state
transformer which takes a header theme
description turns it into a new value of
that scene description so we don't just
monitor everything
Alvah remember Heskey is a lazy language
we don't want to do work we don't need
to do that we only matter that those
piece of the data structure which we
actually need in Hector now you may ask
how would you know well you don't know a
priori but little with laser our
evaluation you don't know a priori
so maybe we can figure that out then we
apply the pure healthy function getting
new value and then on the in the library
layer of the finding we are constructing
we compare the two we check out what has
actually changed only to apply those
changes in place to the underlying
objectivity data okay so we play a game
of pretend with only the speed of the
graph which we need in this particular
frame of the pretend
sound like magic there's the big problem
about magic is you always take one way
or another so it's time to pay up now
how could we do this lazy marketing what
are incredible we've got this structure
we want to march it over to health land
so we take the topmost node and that
alone make a healthy berry oddity the
value of the skin type so what about all
the children and all the properties
belonging to that node we don't want to
master them yet because maybe we don't
need them so the generic solution to
this problem in it in a lazy
non-straight programming languages
create a thunk
so we create a thunk and not yet
evaluated representation of what we
would like to do if you ever to require
that value so that representation of
that computation will have pouring us
into the original objective-c structure
so that we can model other bits as we
need and we do the thing so this is for
the children which is really big piece
of the graph which we are representing
but we do essentially the same thing for
all the data values only that we just
referred to the origin node we don't
master the name over yet we just create
a computation as suspended computation
which could do that if we ever must so
how do we how do we generate such a
thunk for an operation which essentially
has to do as I called memory allocation
stuff like that well this is where the
playing a pipe camping we use unsafe
perform IO so what is that well for all
the hecklers in the room you know what
that is and that you're not supposed to
use it and for everybody else
well it's basically
well let's just forget about these pure
functional stuff at the moment to some
systems programming because we've got
some inline objective-c code in here
which we just want to package up into a
representation of a suspended Hekla
computation so how inline T well real
first in this I had called two years ago
there has been important explaining how
to write inline objective-c code in
Hestia and that's how this library is
implemented but its secondary to what we
are doing here so that's the trick all
right so that's the lazy marshalling we
create times and and we put them in
there if they be above you the
marshaling of the of that value will be
4 so how about the PC so we've created
this structure with lots of suspended
values then we perform the update
function which will touch some of them
it will evaluate some of them to inspect
them and it may change some of them so
this case will change the name so what
we want to do we want to somehow compare
those two versions of the seen value
figure out what's different and take all
the same values and only those are going
to be updated in the underlying
objective instruction so how could we
possibly do that metric payment number
two even worse really unsafe point ie
quality what does that mean this is part
of like a low-level class of the healthy
compilers runtime system what it means
is well what's the address of the
original version of this chunk what's
the address of the name field in the
updated data structure are these two
addresses the same if these two
addresses are the same if that field has
been accessed
if they are not the same well may or may
not have been updated maybe there was
some garbage collection at some point is
only then we to update this value in the
object to see representation so what is
this because it's really unsafe came out
wrong and the pointers are not the same
but the value actually is well then we
do some extra work we update a value
with itself
let's semantically b9 is just a few
wasted cycles okay so we are set
mentally on on okay ground but this is
an optimization and sometimes it doesn't
open all right so then for the last out
right away so your observation of course
one represents photon and this is
related to how react or Elm work and the
difference is that both reactant Elm use
of you bunkie
which is in every change version of the
view the view functions presents a
different view and then they are clever
about which part of the view to withdraw
they as far as I know done to any of the
lasers marshalling because the view is
basically generated Fred afresh each
each frame and why is it different well
the difference is really I believe
between an animation framework and the
UI framework and we are in an animation
framework you are not in this sixty
times per second
it's also a representation of the scene
structures in UI structures it's
somewhat different with where you keep
the application specific state at all
Jeremy yeah now this can't hurt us
because I put there few reasons why this
is not a problem the simplest one is we
have talking garbage collector so in the
next garbage collection no pointer will
be the same because they are all in new
space okay well even theoretically I
mean in practice this is impossible this
happening 60 frames per second if you
could get two garbage collections you've
already lost
but even practically it's no problem
because I mean the new and the old
objects are being copied right and if
one of them is not copies because
generational collector well then to
different area anyway so if you won't
get full printed and okay so now what's
the surfacers third price we have to pay
it actually looks very benign but it's
kind of the worst bit so each of these
alternatives of the of the scene graph
description has an option for on pointer
so this is a reference a foreign pointer
is a pointer from head to leg into
objective event
what was its meaning here well whenever
we take an objective-c object an old
object and be marshalled over to head to
land then we remember where it came from
that's important so that when we are
defining the trade in now which node
which objective-c notes to update for
changes in the Haskell representation
because in Haskell maybe somebody just
duplicated some
that record I mean there's no way to
track a linearity if you like integrated
different moment and so to keep this
information we have to keep this point
around but then there's a question of
course what happens if there's a note
programmer wants to duplicate this note
so they just make a copy and they don't
reset the pointer but they will set that
point so they put nothing in this field
then what will happen on marshaling back
we just create a new version for the
newly created node which is exactly what
we want but we can't enforce using ties
or anything at least I mean if you have
the ability now and any constraint on
this there's only one word for this
point now we have to do something I
thought if we ever come across to so
actually from a semantic point of view
although this is it we just put in maybe
but really it is actually the least
clean of this week so Haskell is slated
to get support for linear type maybe
that can help here we are currently well
so overall you can have your cutting
edge great graphics animations enhancer
and in a purely functional manner thank
you very much yes
so that healthy life now the healthy
type system as it stands at the moment
has no support for linear types there is
however a proposal by a few people
including Simon P shake on adding this
functionality already modified it on the
basis of implementing like low-level
code where you want to avoid where you
want to avoid duplicating resources but
I think it's applicable to this
situation as well maybe I suppose clean
to unique these times would be fine too
yeah yes yeah so so so if frame is no
problem here because we track all
foreign pointers has finalized us and we
objective to use a reference country
scheme called
up and we use finalizes to adjust
reference count in half so that's fine
yeah I mean I believe trust without
having credit I believe Keynes
uniqueness type should be up to this job
yes I'm not sure what the current no it
doesn't expose it and I I'm not sure how
I how much this community analysis is
used at the moment okay yeah but it's
here we need fun no no that's the
problem there is no way at the moment
like it would be in clean to have a
constraint in a type signature that's
right yeah
yeah yeah a pro in it in clean in a type
signature you can put exclamation marks
I believe before things and then you can
see you
it's the exclamation mark yeah yes
wanted to things like
Oh
so specifically speaking so the question
whether something like lens would be
useful to traverse the tree now in the
clearly yes in the case of sprite keep
this support for actions already kind of
take care of that because you can can
run an action on a specific node so
these nodes can be named and then you
can and that's what typically house
pricey programs are written anyway are
in this map has two specific so you use
one of these you attach an action to an
out which then on the master bath is
created on this underlying data
structure and so for example this action
may be to apply an additional force to
the lambda node and then that actually
is applied on that node and so that
traversal is that the strike it
internally and not actually exposed to
the program but I mean this specific to
sprite kid setup of the action system
yes so so so we this is kind of getting
into a philosophical point namely in
this particular API what I hopefully has
become clear is we really cried hard to
keep it really simple this is its
function types records that it there's
no not there a few type classes there's
no da/dt is no type families none I mean
not not this kind of 10 list obviously
expenses at the top of this I think
maybe something like that
there's some other ideas how we could
maybe make the interface a little
smarter at the expense of clarity now I
think som something like that it's
really nice to cook dinner to kind of in
a place with a kind of get into hassle
and hence the decision to keep it simple
so with that I'm not saying one or the
other Specter I'm just saying in this
particular case here the desire was to
stay away from sophisticated language
extensions even not use the i/o mana or
other magnetic data interfaces in the
API just to keep it more accessible for
people
and in theory yes and the problem is
practical problem in Connecticut
check it out of github and compile it is
the cross compile a horse compiler for
iOS use current version that the power
template Esther and the inline Objective
C is honester has described binding but
the inline objective-c stuff does use
template as well so there are some
tricks pun template SP is a meta
programming systems ahead sir and so
there are workarounds how you can kind
of compare this little stuff to iOS and
that could be I I have done it because
they would but that could be used
otherwise there is work on supporting
template testing if you see course
compiler at the moment once that's done
we could be using iOS code it's not max
Pacific
so she sees cross-compiler for IRS uses
LLVM is a second
oh I'm pretty sure this would work
I mean the application you saw in the
demo is a macaque called Christopher
mess and it's in the App Store and it
has already start in it and a queen has
never has a problem with that well valid
lenses that you have a look at the type
arrows into the rotor equation yeah okay
really well it struck and won by having
the fields down normal metaphors like oh
hey mark being struck different right
they're going to have the money so
that's what
yeah but this is similar to this point
and so the action apply action unknown
feature of sprite hit the disrespected
specific really takes away most of this
pain because what I usually do like in
the example of spawn types you have a
custom action which you tell spices
apply to this specific note and then the
walking the tree during the update
making the tree basically trees still
okay it's done by sprite get behind the
