coming in so yeah I'm Julian very wet
I built hack a long time ago
but now I've been working on a new
project for a few years now called
reflux so reflux is a new programming
language it's it's pretty different from
hack because hack is is basically a
gradually typed or optionally type
depend on depending on how you look at
it dialect of PHP and reflux is pretty
different in the sense that it is not
related to PHP anymore so it doesn't
have any roots in PHP but we've worked
hard to make it compatible with hack
because we still have so much hack code
at Facebook that this was something
important but yeah so it's a it's it's
it's a pretty cool project the team is
pretty big it's a team of like 810
people depending on how you count now
there's been working on this for for a
few years and it's the first time we
talk about this publicly so I am very
excited and whatever feedback you have
good or bad I want to hear it all now
after the talk and feel free to to
interrupt me all right so what is it
reflux is a reactive programming
language so reactive is a term that's
very loaded so it's used in many
different contexts so I want to I want
to clarify a little bit what I mean by
that what the reactive means in this
context is spreadsheet semantics so you
know when you're using Excel you have a
spreadsheet and then you modify one of
the cells and the the fact that you
modify that propagates changes across
the whole spreadsheet right and so
that's what I mean by reactive in this
context now imagine a full programming
language that works that way
so you execute your code that code has
external dependencies and whenever one
of these dependencies changes it's the
job of the run time and the compiler to
update the state of the world so you
write logic that just produces the
initial States and then it's the job of
the runtime to update things so it's
very much related
- incremental computing and because the
term reactive is used in different
contexts I just wanted to clarify that
so what can you use that form actually
surprisingly for quite a few things and
I listed a few ideas here but there are
other things
UI is the most obvious one because
there's the library called react for
JavaScript that has been widely
successful and the concept there was you
have a model that describes the state of
your of your mobile application you
write the rendering logic and then it's
the job at the framework to update the
view when the model changes another
example which is less clear and less
common is privacy so that's something we
care a lot about at Facebook but we
start to see privacy use cases in more
and more servers out there so imagine
you're building a website that website
has different kind of data and you want
to determine if one of your users can
see a specific piece of data
well what tends to happen there is that
you compute it once and usually it
doesn't change so it would be really
nice if you could store it somewhere and
then only we compute that privacy when
the part of the external dependencies
has changed and finally think about a
compiler and I know that to some extent
compilers are are they use separate
compilation they try to make the time to
be compiled are pretty slow but imagine
a C or C++ compiler all written in
reflex and now on every single keystroke
it recompiles only what's necessary
without you having to specify what so
all these use cases they have something
in common and that's um you want to use
reflex whenever it pays to reuse
computation so that's what I'm going to
get into but first why is that hard
today alright so I just mentioned the
compiler example let's say it was your
job to build a C++ compiler that just
recompiles every single keystroke and
that's that very efficiently by just
recomputing what's necessary well step
one you would probably be compiled
everything because that's the easiest
thing to do and frankly if you can get
away with that you should do that
because that's the easiest to maintain
well now let's imagine the file grows
your header file gets bigger than
there's more data right well the first
thing that comes to mind is you will try
to store intermediate values so that you
can reuse them for the next run right
and that is cache invalidation and cache
invalidation is hard and what makes it
especially hard in this case is that you
are storing something in a cache that is
the result of a computation so when
you're storing something in a cache that
is directly backed by a DB things are
bad but not that bad when you write you
the DB you just have to remember to
invalidate that cache but now if you're
storing something that is the result of
a computation that can have dependencies
to other caches other values and now if
you add to the mix that this could be
threaded well good luck in validating
that you probably going to get that
wrong and so that's where reflux comes
out comes handy that's that's what it
was built for the idea behind reflux is
you write your logic without worrying
about reactiveness I'm a little bit
lying here but just to simplify and the
the compiled in the runtime is going to
decide what to memorize within your
within your your application
automatically for you and then it will
track dependencies for YouTube which
means that when something that you
depended on changes it will go and
invalidate those intermediate values and
I'll get you the specific specifics of
that what's important to understand is
that to memorize something so memorizing
consists in I think you're all familiar
with the concept but just for the sake
of it
it's basically consistent saving the
association of parameters to assert to a
certain return value so if you have a
function and you basically save what
this function produced now to make that
efficient and to work what we had to do
was to make sure that the effects are
trapped within that function so there's
one solution which is to make everything
immutable and purely functional and then
you can memorize all the things you
like and that's fine that's not the
route that we've taken with reflex with
reflex we've developed a style and a
programming language that encourages you
to mutate things locally and the type
system proves that those mutations do
not escape the scope of the function
thanks to that we can then aggressively
memorize a lot of intermediate results
within within the course of a program so
why a programming language and
especially why your new programming
languages right there are frameworks out
there and there are a bunch of things to
do reactive programming today rx comes
to mind functional reactive programming
comes to mind there are there are a lot
of things to build reactive software
however what we wanted to achieve with
reflex was when you look at those
solutions what you do what you end up
doing is you're not writing a program
that produces a value you are writing a
program that basically composes streams
or continuations or whatever is you do
you're not writing regular programming
you are using constructs that allow you
to build plumb together streams or
whatever is your plumbing together and
so we didn't want that we didn't want
programmers to think about that we
wanted them to just write regular code
that doesn't know anything about
reactiveness now it's true that reflex
in that sense is strictly less
expressive than our X for example
because reflex doesn't let you talk
about previous values right however it
has a really nice side effect so it's
dumber than than rx in effect but a nice
side effect comes to that which is
that's the semantics of pull or push is
the same and for us running a big
website
this this is actually a very important
property let me try to be more specific
here what I mean by that I write a
programming reflex and I have a server
that is pushing me updates right
whenever the database writes something
it recomputes that value and pushes me
the update if I work in production at
Facebook and for some reason I've
decided that this data center or this
region or this server cannot handle that
load anymore
I can cut that's connection at any time
we start it in another machine as long
as it's backed by the same GB it will
have the same semantics and so that's
something very valuable for a company at
our scale so what about them the
language itself so as I said they're
basically three things to remember one
it's not purely functional it's a style
where we're functional at the function
boundaries so whenever you call within a
function or whenever you return
something from a function we encourage
you to pass around immutable values but
within the scope of the function and
we'll see how later you can mutate
things all you like and it's guaranteed
to be safe um oh oh and FP is are merged
so that's that's probably um I see some
from people frowning here and and what
why I mean I will show examples of what
I mean concretely by that but let me
explain in a nutshell so and this is a
gross simplification of course let's say
that all languages on one hand and FP
languages on the other the basic block
of an oo language is typically an object
and the basic block of a functional
language is typically an ADT to
manipulate data algebraic data types and
what reflex does it really merges the
two so you can use an object as a
variant if you want you can use an
object as an object if you want and you
can really make mix and match the two
styles and I'll show later how finally
and that's probably the key points of
the language reactivity is implicit in
the sense that you will see no
construction talking about stream
signals events whatever is all of that
is implicitly dealt with by the runtime
so some more general features and this
is just a non exhaustive list to show
that the language is actually pretty
rich so it's not a cleat idea has
generics it has type classes it has all
sorts of things that you would you would
expect from a modern programming
language all right let me show you what
this this language looks like so oh
sorry
so this is a very very simple example I
don't think it gets any simpler than
that but there are a couple of important
things to note here
one the syntax to introduce a variable
so here in this case the y equal one is
actually a let binding that is
introducing a new variable to the types
within the body of the function i
inferred and they're not at the function
boundaries so here i had to write down
the type int for the parameter and the
return type all the rest is inferred and
finally it's an expression based
language so in this case you see that
there is no return statement and that's
because we are composing value through
expressions if are not statement but
expressions at sea to a teacher this is
the simplest possible example of a class
so one interesting thing to note is that
the parameters of the class look like
parameters past you you know the name
point instead of being in the body of
the function and when you think about it
it makes sense because if you want to
pattern match on that class later it
makes sense to have these things
syntactically close to each other and
this our class is immutable and the
function add one is immutable as well in
the sense that it's producing a new
point out of an old one and that's
really the style that we favor anyway
I'll show you
mutable cases later so that's the syntax
for object creation very simple the
important thing to note is that there is
no new and the other thing that is
important is that this syntax creates an
immutable object so when I create point
this way I know for a fact just by
looking at the the expression here
without even looking at the definition
of point that this object cannot be
mutated at this point just a side note
is that there is actually a syntax to
use named argument because as you can
imagine when you start having a lot of
parameters you may want to you know use
them in different orders at each other
but that's that's just a side note
so now let's let's build something
mutable so one thing to clarify though
and that's probably the most important
thing the mutable on the X here
doesn't mean that the field is always
mutable it means that when we use points
in a mutable context and I'll show later
how that's introduced that field can be
mutated again the same with move X move
X is not a method that can be called in
any context move X because it is
declared mutable is only accessible when
point is in a mutable context and I'll
show later what that looks like for now
you can ignore the exclamation mark in
front of the X and I'm going to explain
later what that means all right so
that's an example of some style that
will encourage your lots in in reflex I
build a new point and in this case I
said mutable points and in this case I'm
saying ok I want a mutable version of
that object and while it is in that
version it is safe for me to call all
the mutable methods define on it and
once I'm done working with it if I
decide to use the immutable version I
have to call freeze on it so freezed as
a logical copy what that means is that
in practice it will often not copy
because it can prove that object doesn't
escape with the mutable version doesn't
escape but in the worst case it might
copy in some cases and so that's a style
that we actually favor
we are completely happy with you
building a hash table doing a lot of
things with it and then freezing a
capacity somewhere else that's perfectly
fine and you can use of course
persistent data structures if that's
what you want as well so what's the
problem with that style though so for
those of you are familiar with
functional programming one of the things
that can be a little bit heavy is when
an immutable object comes in and you
need to massage it a little bit to do
something else so in this case I've
created a class triangle and triangle
has points in them and I built a little
function that wants to modify one of the
fields not modify wants to build a new
triangle where one of the fields deep in
there has changed and what you end up
playing is you
you play with those boxes where it feels
like you're digging out what you need to
rebuild the new thing so I've used the
syntax with here don't read through the
whole code it's not very interesting but
basically what I'm trying to say is that
this is pretty heavy to write so Haskell
has lenses to make that more comfortable
but we we have something else and I will
show why it's more suited for for reflex
so that's what we have and I'll go
through the what the exclamation mark
means through the several slides to come
but basically the way to read this
exclamation mark is and when you put the
exclamation mark in front of the T
you're saying that's what I want to
modify so PT 1 and X the path is
immutable and what you want to modify
here is the T so it takes a little bit
of time to get used to it so I'll go
through a couple of examples so I took
this data structure very simple there is
a class C that has two fields x and y
and themselves have two fields that are
integers and I've represented what they
look like in memory so example number
one I am on the wrong slide sorry
example number one and this is basically
C style assignment so if you put the
exclamation mark on the last field what
you're saying is that you want to modify
deep that's what C and C++ always does
okay now um if you write it this style
so what you're doing is you're saying I
want to modify feel - but now field one
is actually going to be a copy it's a
new value so huh are you following yes
question over here no you're good okay
we're good finally the last one is this
one and that means that I I want to
build a new copy of my trial of my of my
data structure where the path to field 1
is now a new value and the
I want to replace it with the results
okay so when you think about it another
way to think about it is at one end you
are really using it as a lens in Haskell
that's this use case at the other end
you're really using it like a C C++
assignment and anything in between is
what the exclamation mark gives you that
that is pretty nice so why is this nice
this is nice because it perfectly fits
with a model immutable values come in
sometimes there are mutable objects in
there and you want to mutate only with
the roots but you still have to deal
with a lot of immutability and so that
syntax comes in handy
another thing his dress is that it's
very rare to make mistakes on those
because the types have to match so if
you try to put an exclamation mark on
something that is not mutable you'll get
an error and the other way around so the
it's very rare that you try to put an
exclamation mark on something and it
actually works if it wasn't your
intention because otherwise the types
wouldn't match finally the exclamation
mark is actually coupled to the letter
let binding because what will happen
often is that we want part of a result
to be to modify something and the other
the rest of the results you introduce
new logos so I've taken this example
imagine a function that has an
accumulator and that accumulator comes
in and when it comes out well you
typically want the new accumulator to
replace the old one but the rest the
result of that function you want to give
it a new name and that's where mixed
mixing the exclamation mark with regular
variables comes in handy and that's why
it's not a new operator all right so now
let's go back to my reactivity code so
I've got my code and that's very simple
code that does basically some filtering
over some data that's you know is
fetching some data over DB and now let's
say that something has changed here
let's say that this thing changes so one
of the dependency has changed well
thanks to the fact that you know we have
favoured a style where
and everything that falls through a
function call and should be immutable
well now we'll be able to do is reuse GP
filter fetch this one and hopefully that
will propagate up this way and by
reusing all of these intermediates
example values we will be able to
recompute very little so for those of
you who are interested this is not a
perfect model there are a lot we have a
lot of tricks up our sleeves on how to
make that better but that's basically
the basic idea another thing to stress
is that you can't be completely naive on
how you structure your code if you pass
around a big struct that contains a
bunch of Global's it won't work
finally mutation readability can cross
function boundaries by using annotations
and the types so is discouraged but it
is not forbidden because it would be too
annoying for those who are writing api's
over mutable data structures alright so
I said earlier that's object-oriented
programming and functional programming
were merged in reflex what did I mean by
that so first let me introduce the
concept of a base class I think all of
you are familiar with it except that
base classes are little bit different in
reflex so you can inherit from multiple
base classes but you cannot instantiate
them it comes with a nicer bunch a bunch
of really nice properties I won't get
into the details of it but I will more
explain how you can use them in a
different context so this is a very
simple example they should be absolutely
no support nothing surprising here this
is a list of integers and I have two
classes that are implementing that list
by extending interest this is pretty
much what you would write in Java modulo
syntax now what's interesting is that
you can write it this way too and the
two mean exactly the same thing so this
is really syntactical sugar for the
slide that we've seen before these two
things are the same so if you want to
write in an OS dial you can if you want
to write in an FP style you can they
both define the same thing the same is
true with methods so I can go around all
my classes and add you know the method
one to order them like you would in an
old language or I can use pattern
matching directly in the base class so I
can write a function add one and if you
look at the body of this function it
doesn't start with a with with a curly
brace it pattern matches directly and
that means when you write this syntax
you're saying I want to add a method to
the class nil this way and and you can
also mix the two together so you can say
I had a base class that was defining a
method add one and I decide later on to
extend it with something in an oo style
so the two really are going to be
stitched together and really mean the
same thing I took a more complex example
here with generics it's nothing to
understand there it's just to show you
that we can we can write pretty
expressive stuff in the language as well
so it might be surprising that we are
doing that but you need a lot of those
functional construct to make the
immutable style more palatable without
these things it would it would actually
not be that nice to manipulate all of
these immutable values and that's why we
decided to have that model where we're
merging the two together so I want to
talk a little bit about the memory model
because it's a weird memory model so
it's a language that is safe in the
sense that you don't have to write your
malloc and free by hand but it's not a
tracing collector and it's not reference
counted so what is it and it's basically
a model with two heaps one minor heap
and one shared heap the minor heap is
really just an arena that is leaking
memory and the shared heap is an nvcc it
works very much like a database
basically but one property that it has
that is extremely important is that
whenever you store something in the
shared heap if that value was already
there then it's guaranteed to come back
with the same address so why is that
important it's important because earlier
said we were going to memorize a bunch
of stuff the problem when you memorize
is yes you first have to check that your
arguments match something that you've
seen before and that can be very slow
and that's what this system is there to
speed up because what we will do with
that system is will first take your
value particular shared heap and then
the shared heap will give back the same
address if it's the same value and now
if you call repeatedly that function
where the same object well it's one hash
table lookup a way to get that data back
so the other thing that's interesting is
that thanks to the guarantees are the
language the miner collection is
actually is actually full so I need to
give a little bit of context on that
typically let's say you have a
generational collector and we're going
to simplify things and say there are two
generations young and old
you have a young collector that is
called several times and what it does is
that it collects 80% of the garbage but
it fails to see the whole garbage and
then you accumulate all the garbage that
you eventually have to clean up with a
full GC right the problem with that is
GC pause time of the full GC the the
major one because reflex is built to
build late potentially latency critical
things and so for us it's a big problem
to have
a GC that says you know what stop what
you're doing I collect memory so what we
did is we leveraged on the language on
the properties of the language to have a
long time that has a really interesting
property and that's the time to collect
is Big O of what you have allocated and
not Big O of the size of the heap the
reason why that's important is that yes
there is an overhead but you can but you
can actually measure it you can actually
predict by how much this overhead is
going to be and in a nutshell if you
want to understand how and why it's
because when you have a minor collection
typically what your problem our old
pointers pointing to the new generation
and you try to keep track of that
through right barriers or whatever is
but that's the part that you have to
approach
to mate for your younger generation and
with reflux we have a guarantee that
this doesn't happen because the type
system guarantees that it doesn't happen
so now when the minor collection
finishes well the memory is clean so we
can collect with minor collections all
the time like that and predict
what what the latency is going to be all
right I'm on time well I spoke very fast
so future applications there are couple
of things that we interested in looking
at especially at Facebook easing the at
peak computation that's actually a big
problem at our scale it's you know
imagine you have a lot of hardware and
you want to compute at different times
well what you could do is compute in the
morning store those values and then
serve those values later on during the
day another one and that's pretty
interesting is whenever you need a
remote cache so imagine you have a small
data center or one mobile phone or
whatever is a mobile phone is a good
example you have a mobile phone and
typically what you want is to populate a
local cache with data that lives on the
server and so I when that data is backed
by a database that's relatively easy but
when that data is actually the result of
a computation you're actually struggling
because you have to call back to the
server all the time
to tell you to ask has anything changed
so if you write it in v-flex in this
case what you could do is you write your
logic server-side and reflex and reflex
pushes to your client whenever something
has changed which means that now for the
app that is building the that is on your
phone they can consider all the local
data as in sync as if it was the live
data that they just got from the server
and finally and that's probably my
favorite one because we're actually
doing this
it's the compiler itself remember I told
you that example of my little compiler
that we comprised every single time well
it wasn't completely innocent um the
first version of reflex was written in
oak ammo and it was written in a subset
of oak ammo that matches that transpires
pretty
l.joe camel to reflex and so we haven't
we we're not completely done porting the
whole compiler and self-hosting the
whole compiler but we are like 75% of
the way and I'm pretty excited to look
what this will look like when we plug it
all together and we have our little
reactive compiler that's out there
finally this is all super experimental
in the sense that this is not in
production yet we're still trying to
prove that it can work at the scale of
Facebook we want to apply this on very
critical software at Facebook and what I
mean by critical is a lot of data a lot
of machines a lot of code but this is
still very experimental we haven't
battle-tested that technology yet that's
it thank you
okay so we have time for a couple of
questions if you have questions please
come to the mic in the middle Thanks can
you hear me Hey hi maybe you mentioned
it but I don't understand how you
implement memorization so do you insert
cut sequence at the beginning of the
function to check the value of the
arguments oh yeah so okay maybe then and
I had to remove a couple of slides about
that so that's probably how why you
didn't understand it so before you get
into the function call the argument is
interned so if the intern means move to
the shared heap and that shared heap by
the way is MVCC which means that every
single thread has a snapshot of the heap
so that the database can carry on
changing under your feet while you're
serving traffic anyway so you first
intern the object it's a full copy if
it's the first time we've seen this
object and it will be relatively cheap
if that object has changed little right
once it has been interned you come back
with an address and that address is
unique in the sense that if there was
already an object out there there had
the same value it has the same address
in the intern heap so then what we can
do is for this function look up that
address did we already compute this and
if it did it comes back with an address
of another object that lives in the
intern heap so that's how it works okay
so can I ask one more question yeah so
if you have like Android of values of
different values in a call to listing
function we will you check for the
Android values or so if you have a
hundred values those values will first
be interned okay if they come back with
an address it will be the same one as
before right okay so each time you just
ask the heap if the objects okay so
there's the intern heap and there is a
hash table that can associate to
function name and a value comes back
with value if they or something okay
that was my question
yeah sorry thanks for wonderful talk a
question for you you said you have a
self-hosted compiler so well you blend
how we end the process yeah okay so your
compiler compiles to bytecode to native
code or is it an interpreter or is what
so there are four different backends I
think so there's an interpreter which is
the thing that we use to bootstrap the
self-hosting days and that's the most
there's one that is the h h vm back-end
the reason we use that is because we
need to interoperate with hack and that
will ease this this kind of inter up and
finally there is the native back-end the
targets LLVM and that back-end
yeah that back-end is the one that is
really plugged into the reactive stuff
so all the other ones they are just
there to run once and for Migration
purposes the real reactive stuff is a
native back-end that targets LLVM okay
thank you so I don't understand
correctly that every time I call it
function its candidates return memorized
result yes so but if there is a case
when it's faster to compute results than
to yeah yeah thank you Sam so well so
first of all you have control over that
if that's what you want you get you
annotate and say what you want to do so
there's a way to tell the compiler shut
up that's what I want but yes the the
heuristics that you can build to
basically establish what is worth we
using and what is worth three computing
is a never-ending game of optimization
so yeah thanks all right okay so there
are no more questions like then the
speaker again
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
