and not so much about the technical
count of cryptic although I want to do
with that more and I hope that that will
work with more how we got from invention
to a product so with you look at the
website of curry on them then the main
phrase there is academic academia and
Industry they need to talk all right and
then the question is why as the obvious
question so there's two question for me
to you why do we need to talk so that we
start doing here so that we stop doing
your relevant research okay so that's it
relevant research oh right I in general
I think that a lot of good things are
invented in academia that are widely
ignored and a lot of useful experience
comes from people working in industry
that we ignore so and then we could do
more socially useful research or find
better ways to apply it the things that
we've done if we have talks with the
right people that way okay that's a good
thing anyone else that wants to say
something funny has an idea why on earth
academia reached and industry should
talk
I think in my work I sometimes so coming
from industry i'll i'll read a paper and
having more occasions like it's like
people go to www DC to yell at the
developers who make their life miserable
or like tell them like and so having
more opportunities to talk to academics
we're writing the papers that perhaps
influenced my work and be able to say
well actually what I care about is this
I really care about what you're doing
what also perhaps this aspect would be
really interesting that that does I
think that that would be sort of an
ideal scenario and something that I do
hope for I like that come for a lot
because it gives this interaction in a
nutshell in history industry sometimes
people miss the vocabulary to talk about
software and I think this is the main
reason why many developers just say I
like this you like that so let's stop
discussing about it because the
vocabulary is missing to quantify and to
describe software and I would have loved
to expand mine and my teammates
vocabulary and have better chances of
talking about software oh I like this
cover everything I will come back to
that in a slot in a minute anyone else
or shall I continue what I think oh yeah
I'm sure so we are for those that coming
in now we are answering your question
why on earth should academia on industry
talk the only thing that I was going to
say is I work i'll i can implement we at
pacha implement like crd teas which is
largely an academic invention and yeah
implementing this stuff is really hard
getting it right it's really hard and
yeah we need to talk together like
that's the only way we've been able to
do any of this stuff and get any of it
working so okay so I jump forward them
so my main reason to do this to say why
should we talk this because innovation
innovation is something that needs both
partners innovation is not
in academia that that's for sure because
that's inventions which are down there
and innovating eventually gets an
innovation if it is used outside right
that's what we call innovation so for
the rest of innovation we need to talk
and we need to to go and I will tell the
story of one of such an invention going
into an innovation and that's great
check a few of those of you have never
seen quick check i will give you a very
short introduction and then a little bit
longer than more later on and at all so
quick check the idea of a quick check is
that is extremely boring to write test
cases okay that's that's something
people don't like to do and people do
very bully and it's also some part of it
is creative but the Lord is very in
creating so you wanted to move testing
from this own creative kind of robotic
job into something small and the way we
can do that with quick check is to
generate your test cases automatically
so instead of writing yes the computer
make your test cases that sounds
fantastic comes with a price of course
nothing for free the price is that you
have to write a property you have to say
what a property about your software like
this operation or crash that's a
property of the software and you can
think of lots and lots of properties i
will show an example later but you write
the property about your song that
property is now central for
automatically generated test cases from
so difficult is given to quick check and
quickly then says oh i generate a number
of test cases at oops i have a failing
test case here so this destination
generations don't know basis of
randomness there's a random process
creating data that fits this this is
your random test cases and one of those
test cases may fit now failing test
cases are normally the things that test
is really like whereas developers prefer
to have been
both gasp cases that that speeds up the
world lunch bag so you have a failing
test case but since this is randomly
generated such a failing test case could
have lots and lots of lots of data in it
or lots of things in it which are not
really relevant for making the property
failed which which are there any way
because you have this this random
process so what we do then is
automatically simplify that last case to
the simplest possible desk as a minimum
that case that provokes a failure right
so now you have your debugging so
normally if you get a log for example Oh
something went wrong my system crashed
is the law that's kind of drained that
don't work to go to the look and find
out what has happened wouldn't it be
fantastic if the log is automatically
decreased to five state and saying hey
this is where your program goes wrong
now that's what we do with a check
automatically and we do that in order to
get the real signal out of the noise
that you get when you put randomness in
the generation process so that's
fricking in a nutshell i will give you a
little example later on this invention
of quick shank was making it was
published in the year 2000 by John deuce
in coon class both from john's
university in sweden in Gothenburg they
wrote this in Haskell quick check and
they presented that at our chef p2000
later on 10 years later they got the
price of most influential paper of that
conference because it really spent well
and the first paper look at this and
come back to the vocabulary that you
mentioned before right is it oh I love
the runs on forever can you see some
vocabulary hear that kind of if industry
reads this which is a sh not for me as a
no more nap right
next by random random that's true there
was only between formal specification
down there and all something really
industry likes randomness not really not
so lots of words in there which for one
or the other reason and particularly a
two thousand human remember Haskell has
evolved a lot in the sense of adoption
within the year 2000 Haskell's really
there was the ivory tower there was
never a thing so yes lots of words those
days that would scare off industry to go
on with that so oh it's a bit and it's
nicer on this screen but anyway so
there's this Haskell invention this is
that the olive mill you can have
delicious olive oil if you put it in
that milk and then there's the
money-making world on right without any
mill and there's some cities here but
there's no mill right but this is this
invention you can make olive oil and
some tastic all of all action so
delicious very good but it's faith and
academia in this way right so how do we
get it out of this Haskell Monod world
and make it applicable anywhere else
suggestions Menelik
return yeah did you add an extra word to
the monadic and then people say oh right
this is great yes it would be yeah
fantastic but people are scared of that
so and they were spared even more that
song so how do we kind of get that down
using practical functional individual
you are to slice ahead fantastic that's
one way of doing it javascript
implementation right the javascript
imran also something with fall yes what
else can we do so there are lots of
things that you can do you can also say
well let it stay in academia why would
we want industry to use this at all it's
far too nice right why would be both of
people in the industry working with this
week you're going to make people
unemployed lots of justice will not have
a job anymore so that's bad we will give
pleasure to testing which is not good
because you learn you can't punish bad
developers to do the testing so it's
kind of not nice to do this so let's
keep it in academia and make a pathway
group true that's another option that
you have and you can have the option of
doing in a line and make people adapt
and adopt is in and grow from there so
that's there hey so one way of getting
industry interested was doing it in a
different language javascript wasn't
around at those days I think at least I
hadn't heard in two thousand about two
jobs it probably was alone but and Java
was the big thing of course and we need
in order to implement quick chek you
need a lot of functional primitives
higher-order function think
I was simply not going to be done in an
imperative language like Java so Ellen
was come more normal joys of it in
particularly since i had an a-line
background I come from the computer
science lab from erickson it was kind of
natural for me to to do this in LA but
it all was kind of based on simplifying
one you have to simplified because an
airliner would be simpler there would be
no mourners right and it was gone for
the culture and deduction and we all
believed in those days that if you have
this delicious olive oil and you make it
simple to produce it and people will
take that for dinner now I know that was
kind of the idea that we do we have
those days so what did we do John I'm
wrote critic for Ella that was full of
really fun we had a good time and then
we said let's go to the Allen use ago
and spreading it and this is second or
the third slot in retrospect right but
probably not the best slide to present
but hey a little shattering but you
imagine this this is another 50 people
from telecom industry sitting in it
okay you all know what's at to your race
you say what anyone not familiar with
superior okay so set here is is
basically the theory about celibacy come
on set theory something they're talking
about for cavalry on if you have sex you
can have these junctions for you look at
what the difference is in service you
can Union set and there's a theory
around what all this should or down so
in set theory you have a number of
actions and says if you take the union
of the two sets so if you combine two
cents it does it make a difference if
you combined in one way or the other way
that's what set to your it blows us
Ellen at that time has a SAT library
still has the same library hasn't
changed since then I think and in this
set library you could ask yourself the
question does that property of the sets
halt right there's a Union operator
there's a talk in normal logic secondary
logical very good logic you could write
something like for all X which are sacks
and all wise which is another set if I
take to union of those two sets and it
take to Union the other way around then
it should better be the same fine
everyone agrees there as long as you
know a little bit about some theory you
were similar that that makes complete
sense so we would now like to test this
that this holds for Ella what can you do
then you can write three test cases the
empty set and some momentous after you
turn that around and you can do it for
say you set it to elements make a
separate 500 and then you're really
really bored get this ho testing works
all right and what kind of elements do
you take while you take 011 probably
seven because that's very random set 42
because from your support to see you
make those contests and then you write
just property and I want to demo you
have that this was this
a jump of presenting at that our user
conference and he showed the following
demo approximately the quickcheck
version we had that was slightly
different but so this let me first show
you them the goat here we are slightly
larger it's really almost direct word
for all sets as one and another set as
to you should have quality between the
Union and of s1 s2 and s2 and s1 and
this sets library is the implementation
the airline implementation of the sets
and how do we get sets well now we know
better but in those days you took a list
an arbitrary list of integers and then
you apply to the sets from list operator
to it and this is what we call a data
generator so quick check causes the
properties and properties in data
generator to generate the data and then
they can do something with that so this
is this is what is happening so now we
could kind of trying to see if an
airline this property holds only sets
library now so what we do is we compile
this gold that works fine and then we
can we can do a sample with there's
something called EBS you can assemble
where you can ever look at at one or
done or whatever I can do what I can
pick one example of a set so this gives
me a random set and the set has three
elements but this is the internal
representation of sets so I don't I
normally don't want to see it is but the
airline chefs reputation has an internal
representation it has three elements 0 3
and minus 3 deity and right and it's a
model kind of bookkeeping variables and
lots of lists in there it's pretty awful
so this is another one that's two
elements and you cease minus five minus
three over there so this is how airline
internally represents sets so let's run
the property
that I want so running the property
means generate a hundred running test
cases a hundred random sets for actually
two hundred and combine them in the
property say it's the Union indeed the
same and what you will see oh this was
very falsely so what you see is that it
past 78 test cases all the dots of
passing test cases but then we failed
and this is the fading exon so we have
this settle which is the internal
representation of that set we scroll
down a little bit we have another set
and then we have a lot of junk here
saying that those sets the unions are
not equal they are different right and
then you see a lot of crosses here and
this is where we try to make that jump
it something smaller do we make a
smaller example what goes on okay and
then we see that the smallest amount of
sample and wider that's not correct and
hard to read but the idea is here in the
internal representation those things are
not people so they are equal if you
would go if you would have an equals
operator in the sets library and would
work but they still let still no no
equals operator in satisfying even
though we showed this in 2005
so people are not using the SATs library
right it's not important it's a fun
thing to have but why would you use that
the sports service all those kind of
things people simply don't use that so
that's the other thing so now you've
seen how afterwards okay I just wanted
to make one more then one thing here so
we saw in the top those of you which one
sucks talked just before we saw that did
not close all that stuff is fantastic
stuff to create programs we can equally
well as generating that's picking a
random set we could pick a random Aaron
program so we could do epc airline our
program this is the generator for a
module of well my month or something
like that so I make a new Ellen module
and I will see boof this is a light coat
and it's not very nicely written so I
can make a string of it and then you can
actually read it because all the new
lines here so I can make this into a
nicely formatted one by doing
proximately like this printing the
string so here we havin a randomly
generated Allen program and it is
comparable to provide this program
cabal's it's a bit strange the program
but it should get through the compiler
so this is another thing you can do with
generations you can generate all kind of
data okay so that's just good let's go
back to the presentation after this demo
after that you learnt about sat theory
how do you feel about this invention it
is useful would you say yes I take this
whole i will start using it to me
oh I see no hair okay Rangers agree you
just said that they don't use the set
library so why would they care about
this result hello so this is a very good
remark was probably knocked and on the
Mac the remark was what they don't use
satellite why would they care about this
result why would you care about this
result well hopefully they see past this
solving sets issues little testing sets
and possibly see the potential removing
tons and tons and tons of brain-dead
tests over in their code hopefully but I
don't know how what hypocrite we're
history went the history goes so the
idea is that they should see that this
is actually just an example this is not
the only code written test but the
conception very often is oh that's the
biggest said they can test set but we
don't you set so it's not useful for us
I've seen this over and over and over
and over again no I think also you might
have the impression that this isn't
useful for testing imperative programs
and then it only works for a sort of the
functional subset of the pure functional
subset of the language what you may not
care much about okay so thank you for
that observation as well so what we did
of course take look guys testing
concurrent software we can do it well
it's not just it's just pure boy so in
the same talk John then starts telling
defining a little server which has the
number of purchase a resource locker it
starts a surfer claims a lock and get
free the lock and this is on slide 25 50
says oh look we can we can have this
server and then he explains all the
country and then in the right Cornell
slide 35 you get the property right
that property is hard to read but
doesn't matter if i make it larger
because you want to be able to read it
anyway it's a bit too complex someone
write a check okay we can do it we can
show that we can do it but the property
you have to write may kind of scare you
off and it did it's really scare people
off the law this is fantastic but it
seems not useful because I don't have a
resourceful i normally write a free
software all right this is hard to get
the best children so what we try to do
now is we had this invention and we have
this money making smaller world because
the ellen was much more than than the
real big world there's less money but
who cares right it get bought that so we
made a bridge to this smaller world and
we thought oh this is fantastic we open
sourced it which look you sister it's
great stuff with this is the reaction of
industry it was not used it was not used
because there's no need to use this we
don't have sense and we don't have lock
up it's simply not very very useful but
more more often we don't have a problem
that fit is fixed and then that's key on
the need of something is there something
that fits and any one of you experience
this why would we need to change it
works as a diss yeah
in my experience is not so much that I
don't have a need for it is that it's
very difficult for a non-trivial
application to come up with the
properties to express what I want to
test difficult simplicity is the key
here so it's hard to see how this would
apply to your field and every device is
it worth the investment that we have to
do to get so that's discipline so okay
one that I'm frustrated with this for
example i dwelt a web programming and it
is Miss pattern that has just establish
itself and you can't get rid of it is
persistency testing and what you're
doing is you are setting up a data is
you are doing stuff in the business
logic and that stuff gets saved and then
you go like okay this object and this
object should be in the database now and
this leads to all kinds of problems
difficult to write is difficult to test
and but even if you do it you gotta
drink properly properly because you are
not your testing real Twain cases we
just store a very small subset of what
you're going to win on live production
and I've discussed this idea many times
my colleagues where you go like you try
to discover a space of what's possible
what could happen is that code what if
the user does this what if the user does
that but never happens I don't know why
maybe because people are frightened that
might find a bug while they're still
developing the code yeah thnkx thankful
observation so there's lots of different
scenarios that you have to test and that
is normally not caught in normal testing
even though people probably want it it's
not taken up dog because they are scared
for the work probably the workload what
involves what so although no quick check
at that time was really taken up by
industry we do see research really
actively
some things in with great check even the
airline quick check virgin Haskell quick
check for chances on tractor lots of
publications out there very nice stir to
read but also at the India one side we
we did something and ma long things hun
suspense on he verified with grit check
or tested with grip check the leader
election implementation it by wolf and
Ethel there's much more industry sister
that's just part of it but he did formal
proofs and he did all kind of model
checking stuff but overnight we wrote
when I was still working at the erection
we wrote a leader election protocol for
distributed systems and he tested that
with quick check and we talked to hilton
little results and and that has also had
a good impact so that had as a result
that oof bigger got really convinced
that this was cool stuff and he got went
to his management cell we should wish it
fries it's an open source protocol and
we are far too busy to try these kind of
things they changed the policy they they
had this telecom life cycle where they
had one release after he won won a half
year approximately and now they had to
have seven releases in a year and this
uh this is a probably familiar picture
for you with it at the end you detect
lots and lots of errors constantly and
then your arrows dropping and so we're
here you release the product and imbibe
Thunder customers using it you're here
right so very kind of hard thing and
they said we have to get rid of it
because we have this development project
ends not an agile project we can't do it
anymore testing is always kind of the
problem because Dusty's at the end and
if you do testing at the end we will
find you out at the end if you can't
squeeze that we can't say oh that's like
less errors yeah we can do that so and
he was convinced that that quick check
would help yeah so that's good so we had
an advocate in industry and to make a
short story book store story short he
said okay let's come to us and implement
this stuff and and let's do this on a
real product the media gateway
sip SI Peter the Latin either they had
they had a media gateway let's test that
stuff because we have hopelessly behind
schedule so guess how much
specifications such a media gateway a
media gateways a very simple thing so
you get the telephone call in it has an
IP address you say okay that might be
others may go through oh no that ideas
may not go that's basically what that's
desiccator fine so how much
specification is thinking that that kind
of system ass okay auction 20 once
you've got 6,000 6,000 pages say cheese
shop that's a bit too much but you're
close you're close it had to 11 12 page
it so this very smooth the celica very
similar but on those those two hundred
our pages you have 183 pages no it's an
internal kind of addictions of the
protocol so fine the control software up
the whole thing is hundred and fifty
thousand lines of God LM code it's like
wow so we said okay you call the sec
come to Stockholm help us we are on
trouble so calm John now i SAT here for
days and we tested the stuff and most of
the time we discussed the hours we found
and most of the time is it oh yeah fix
that Thomas you're out of time should
sorry any questions before or should we
just let me continue any questions okay
so we get down to the conclusion that
while doing this what they really needed
was not the olive mill because they have
microwaves there and they might they
need power for micros right so we made a
completely different mill that gave them
what they needed the ebc stadium that
that's a state machine specification
language for discount problems with what
I wants to go to is that this is fun
because now we have actually the
possibility to write another article
really applying pressure on real
examples and this is a very well citing
article it said permission to Ellen
workshop at that besides there's really
nice work and there is no more nuts in
there anymore and now has skill in there
anymore although there still there's
words that they like like reduced
testing observe obscure burbs product
quality industrial implementation right
that's that's kind of things and it also
wrote another article with other people
from academia about the cycle of when
invention schedule potentially
successful so we had lots of data of
other projects that we started and we
could from those this data kind of
derive a mobile in what is needed to
make an invention into something that
has a sustainability inside companies
there's also complies reading I will not
go through it but it resulted in us
having a very strong application for the
EU in new project fp7 so if you think of
as a researcher this is great because
now you can you have shown it you're
applicable you can get research money
networks and we got and not a lot of
testing challenges from erickson we
extended quick check for testing
concurrent systems instead of just come
to the normal systems and then we
validated our IDs with for example
companies like Lana and Marshall and
there was very very nice so as a company
cured company it was nice that we could
enter new markets by offering them the
things that we did research on but it's
also very much this innovation motor
which is going on because we talk to
industry because we get a problem from
industry because we can do the cool
challenges from industry we actually
meet people at entry we talk to we can
publish and we can get new ideas going
and one of them is this article that
Isis be in
not where we present bills as as an
example of that how much more time do
you have okay any observations questions
directly from here so I'm wondering how
do you I don't know if you know this but
how well do you think the concept of
fuzzy checking quick check in general
how well as that penetrated outside the
realm of functional programming
languages so the question is how much
first checking is there around and it
depends a bit on how you define busy
checking lots of people do random values
in the best cases they just call the
random function and they they make
something right is that fussy probably
not but in sea in the sea world that
that's quite well known but almost no I
don't really know how much it has taken
up a quick chat the very life in
academia and still has and Germany
successors like small check or the
symbolic execution note and so on do see
any of these like trying to make a step
shoe industry oh yeah will do I mean
Facebook is using great checking and all
the companies use it quickly so really a
lot of probably do use all kind of open
source versions of quick check this
quick check for job or there's great
check for oh I don't mean quick check
itself but rather the successors that
sort of criticized which I can try to
improve upon it somehow and so on like
small check all the symbolic execution
frameworks and so on so in my kind of
view of the world that's all the same
technology to penetrate industry yes if
you can't do that easier than with them
something else it's still the same way
of writing properties and
so I think they all helped to make this
be adopted but some flavors I needed to
get people tasty thank you so I it seems
to me that in general when you when you
when you when you generate test cases
automatically the really hard part is is
how to so what will be the expected
results so how to how to generate
generating expected recent recent
results or an Oracle to test for that
will you comment on this absolutely so
the examples I showed here are too
primitive in nature so what you really
normally do in this property based
checking issued generate your test case
according to an state machine which
embeds the Oracle bi encoded as post
deletions so the post condition of a
goal should be distance and some
internal state and you you could almost
say it's a reference implementation
although on a much higher abstraction
level testing against the real
implementation so that's that's your or
voltage at the real real difficulty in
using tricks is to write that Oracle
that's that's the difficulty and that's
what a lot of people see as the barrier
for adopting this technology is it how
do I do that for my specific
implementation and what a lot of people
do wrongly is they re implement the same
thing once more which is normally not
very successful I may have missed this
but how do you test the specification so
there's always this this beautiful you
just write your specification than you
generate your test cases how do you know
that your specification is better than
then the implementation well you don't
but if you get a mismatch something's
wrong it's all your test case or your
new implementation very often in the
domains where we were we have either
people that know what it should do or
you can at least ask what you should do
or you have a paper an RFC or something
else as fact that you can relate to and
can say okay this is an explanation of
why our test case is correct there for
the implementation wrong or the other
way round in Italy or the other way
around where you say okay after the tap
of mine specification so basically what
you do is you write us back you you
write code and check the one against the
other health wise yeah okay
if you found that industry is scared
most of defining the properties up front
if they look frightening if they don't
know how to do it I'm assuming your
company can come in and help industry
bootstrap some test suite by writing
those properties initially and then hand
over ownership to the to the company's
afterwards have you found that that
helps adoption yes that's exactly what
really helps adoption so I have an
example of the Volvo company making cars
Dave masters will not function programs
they have lots of seed goat in the
course they want to check that and they
said come to us and say look can you
help us write the specifications so
that's what we did so we got from them a
little bit of spec and it's a pretty
face alyssa is a number of protocol
stacks we need to get this soul right
and that's where we had lots of fun
doing this stuff and it's all written in
c and an hour please check them kind of
generate see test for for them and
that's really cool because it was big
this project as you can see from
specifications and this is explaining a
little bit how it works but the good
thing is that you get another bridge you
get another bridge to delta motive
industry so that helps a lot where they
are not interested in writing the specs
themselves they ask us could you please
do this because we don't want to do it
and then again this is a very or your
board comes back how do you we don't
know anything about cost apart from the
cover I can't distinguish anything from
a call so how do you know it it just
your implementation is correct you your
test cases well you have your paper step
spec you can discuss that and a lot of
discussion has come up in that sense all
in the backyard question
so more generally do you have a comment
on how to make the transition from the
stage where developers find your tool
they use your tool they like your tool
and then make this transition from that
stage to the stage where a management
wants to invest money in your tool and
wants to enforce the use of your to
limit yes so there is two different
strategies you can get the tool into and
difficult tools you normally have to go
ultimately you have to get me engineers
kind of interested in using the tool and
ask their manager can be waived all
right otherwise it's not going to happen
but you need management in order to have
it sustainable so what we normally do is
we have kind of a sales package that we
give to the engineer and say show
history you managing and then what okay
not good to note though so we it's much
better if you can make the engineer take
you to management because you're after
all the best salesperson for you to and
you know most about the complex etc so
we we asked them to invite us for a
discussion with management and if you
have had that discussion we can see
where it goes but that's the the better
strategy I found out so in the beginning
was just focusing on engineers and
that's fantastic and those people really
liked it but they also they did they
don't like to talk to their manager and
does not ask things to the manager and
if there's a hurdle they would rather do
something different then go that way so
you really have to make them part of the
game and a difficult yes yeah I follow
kind of a follow-up to the previous
person here so this specification
language is a whole new language on top
of the implementation one right so how
hard it is to teach that to the industry
people like they need like a whole other
universe to care about it's probably
more fun than writing tests but it's
difficult isn't it
it's extremely difficult to teach new
languages to establish the industry's no
no I'm just asking how difficult it is
well we fail when we succeed it's a it
depends very much on the people you have
to teach too if what we say to
management office don't let us teach
this to your testers it's too difficult
not because of the language with
abstraction level is very high and if
they have selected people that do not
have such a high of such a level and put
them into the testing department which i
think is wrong anyway to have this
distinction but some companies do have
that then you're going to fail it's it's
the tool which should be used by people
that are used to program and they're
like do new stuff so you have to
identify is that in the company present
if not you have to go in all the route
point we have to so maybe people don't
have like enough competence in the
company to actually adopt this and
testing is better for them that I mean
manual 10 more manual testing than this
right yeah okay because that good could
be yes ok we'll do one more so testing
is a beautiful part of the natural
process that seems to be rather popular
these days and that is done by
programmers have you are you gone into
environment people
agile is there an easier of Titan
environment it's definitely easier to
have an uptake in modern companies where
people are not afraid of doing things
things differently and agile companies
definitely I think by show and Connor
are using agile methods to develop the
software and they have a better uptake
definitely better of dick okay well do
this last okay yeah so I know you guys
have got both on board a cubic of act of
fame hmm is he doing actor just because
he's really convinced that everyone
should use dependent typing on
greenville projects and therefore avoid
this whole fuzzy checking or or
conversely is there anything interesting
that can come out of this so I think
both approaches are really great but
it'd be good if they were maybe somehow
combined or was is completely different
there's not completely deficit all works
part-time for us part of university in
this is choice you want to do both
things find he wants to maintain hug
that and he wants to work for us and he
likes both things this is your very much
it contributes to all those countries
fantastic Heidi's that we have
implemented in quick check it's
unrealistic to see the world move to
other in a short term it's a fantastic
language we all agree on that but it
simply if you talk about difficulty in
learning people who think it's difficult
there's also steep learning curve so I
haven't seen kind of the synergies too
much to say oh let's do everything and
not Hannibal the world will be better so
in order to serve the majority of people
we have to make it simple simple simple
and not what underwater mornin right
that's the take we have
okay let's thank the speaker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
