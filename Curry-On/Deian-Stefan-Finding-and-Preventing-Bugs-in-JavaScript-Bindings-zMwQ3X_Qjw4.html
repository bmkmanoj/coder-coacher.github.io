surprisingly hotter here than there and
I'm wearing black but you know it is
what it is so I want to talk to you
about JavaScript engines and in
particular finding bugs in these runtime
systems and kind of a new API for how to
actually address these bugs this is
joint work with a bunch of folks at UCSD
one of them is over there so you should
hunt them down Ranjit and a bunch of
folks at Stanford I don't think any of
them are here unfortunately okay so
let's talk a little bit about JavaScript
so unfortunately everything runs
JavaScript now so it's no longer just
browser is your your web servers running
JavaScript your desktop app your Spotify
slack and whatever you're using that's
running JavaScript your devices that are
measuring temperature and maybe
something more important than
temperature are running JavaScript even
satellites are running JavaScript and
that should be scary but it's also
pretty cool and one of the reasons it's
cool is because it's super easy to run
JavaScript on all these platforms
advices so here I hope you can't read
the code but and I hope you trust when I
say it's 62 lines but actually 49 SL Oak
C's so in 49 lines you can use v8
Google's v8 JavaScript engine and you
can now have your application run
JavaScript as well so you can start
writing your applications in a way that
I you know they're crash safe so your
program won't actually seg fault there
typesafe right so like in JavaScript you
can't misuse or have out-of-bounds
arrays it's also memory safe so these
are all super awesome things that we
like and we love from high-level
languages that we don't get from C and
C++ kind of write JavaScript alone is
not actually giving you much it's
completely useless actually LS what
you're trying to do is build a heater
which you might be nowadays because it's
IOT thing and in practice what we
actually do is we have this thing called
binding code that makes JavaScript
useful right so JavaScript has no way of
performing IO in fact it's defined by
the ECMO script and only thing you can
do is have
super simple programming constructs like
loops and so forth and it has mutable
arrays but other than that it can't say
talk directly to the network they can't
read a file it can't do anything that
you might want to do in a real program
right so in order to do all those things
what you do is as the thing that's
embedding the JavaScript engine you
extend the JavaScript environment with
this thing called binding code to expose
the slow low of functionality these
functionally that we have and C and C++
to do useful things right so for example
on the server side for nodejs one thing
you might do is expose the filesystem
and this is what the FS library does or
you might export expose say net the
ability to talk to network devices or
say access open SSL with crypto library
and a browser side which is something
that you might be more familiar with
well Dom that's one example of a useful
API that we extend a JavaScript runtime
with right so we send it in a way that
we can modify page pages and elements on
the pages and render them and so forth
similarly we have two XML HTTP requests
API right this lets you talk to remote
servers and now we have web workers and
a bunch of other really awesome new
things but all these things aren't baked
into the language in part that's good
but it also means that we have to extend
these languages with C code okay so
let's talk a little bit about like what
binding code actually is right so
binding going lets us do useful things
and the way it does that is by exposing
new functions or objects as prototypes
on existing JavaScript objects like say
the global object and when you say call
one of these functions it calls into the
C++ layer and the C++ function there can
actually say talk to the network after
say looking at your argument to modify
different properties of the object that
you call this function with right so if
we were to have say diagram explaining
what binding code looks like well you
have the JavaScript app code running at
the top and this thing talks to some C++
code and binding layer which itself is
written in the JavaScript runtime system
that has this v8 API for manipulating
say JavaScript objects and talking to
the network so let's look at an actual
example of binding code let's suppose
the thing that we want to do is write a
I'll to write a string to a file right
so JavaScript doesn't let us do this and
we're going to use binding code to
expose this so here i've broken down my
slide into two parts one is the
JavaScript side at the top and then the
bottom is C++ so in C++ let's pretend we
have a function called write file you
can imagine using iostream or something
like that instead and this thing takes a
string and a file name right so it
writes that string to whatever that file
path is so this this is all pure C++ and
the binding layer code comes around it
so it wraps the C++ code to expose it to
JavaScript so what is this code actually
doing can you guys actually see this if
you can't I'm totally screwed
ish okay let's go - okay so this is
using the v8 API but there are other
api's like Mozilla SpiderMonkey that you
can use instead so what this function is
doing is it's taking say JavaScript
arguments and these are all of one type
this is the function call back info
value so they're all values they're all
treated as one single type internally
they might be say strings and the first
thing that we do in this function is
look at argument 0 and argument 1 and
treat them both as strings so we cast
into these string types and now we have
these strings that we can then use in
our write file C++ function to actually
write the strength to the file path now
this is a binding function and you would
use the v8 API to expose this function
as a JavaScript the way you do this is
you take say the global object and you
set a property on it called right store
to file and give it the function that
you want to expose to JavaScript and now
in JavaScript we have this function
that's on a global object that we can
just call as we normally would by just
passing a JavaScript strings and then
these whole things just trickle down
into our actual right file
implementation okay so we have
JavaScript code that now calls into C++
and of course C++ is not safe like
JavaScript is and binding binding code
introduces the same old problems that we
had in C++ like use after freeze or
autobahns reads and writes to JavaScript
code right so this happens all the time
and the reason for it is because you
have to really battle these three things
when you're writing this binding code
right you have to preserve JavaScript
crash safety right JavaScript doesn't
set
so when you write this binding layer
function you need to make sure that it's
not actually hard crashing and what that
usually means is if there's a failure
mode you have to throw an exception back
to JavaScript now the v8 API that you'd
have to use to actually do this is
pretty gnarly because you're managing
basically JavaScript control flow in a
C++ language that doesn't actually where
you normally would not use exceptions
similarly we'd have to manage type
safety right whenever we actually use
one of these JavaScript values we
actually have to check its type and
before we use it make sure that it's the
type that we expect it to be and of
course when we're actually using say a
pointer we have to make sure that this
pointer actually points to a live
objects when we use it even though the
binding code function itself might go
back and forth between JavaScript and
C++ land and of course real code doesn't
actually do this all the time
right like what this means is that we
now have the same passive bugs that we
haven't seen in C++ that are now
introduced to JavaScript code which you
know by construction should not have
actually been there and the whole point
for using one of these languages is that
it prevents you from shooting yourself
in to face with things that were we're
scared to use in C++ and write like you
don't expect as much from a JavaScript
developer as you would from say a C++
developer so it's slightly even scared
and normally is okay and in the context
that we've been looking at is basically
a untrusted code right like now you have
this untrusted JavaScript code that's
running say in the browser this code
might be say a JavaScript ad right now
this ad might call into the binding
layer through say two Dom API which
calls the binding glair function and of
course might take your tab very sad now
this is say just a form of a crash but
it crashes you actually matter
themselves right so if you're talking
about web servers I can now take down
your web server but oh it's crashing a
process maybe more scary is that these
things are running on like hardware now
and exposing hardware so I can
potentially take down your IT system or
your satellite so crash safety like a
new browser might not matter because
rather people have actually thought
about this for a while but in other
settings it starts to matter
type safety on the other hand still
matters in inter browsers and it matters
both say chrome and PDF um-- and even
chrome extensions and the reason for it
is because you might be able to execute
arbitrary code so if you can execute
arbitrary code i could potentially steal
say your tax document that lives in a
different PDF or i can bypass the same
origin policy and read your banking
information and same goes with memory
safety bugs right so out of bounds reads
and writes and use after freeze these
are really serious problems and you know
the least that you can do it's on a
service a leak ssl keys or you can undo
browser bypass the same return policy
but you're simply setting a bit and of
course you can start now executing
arbitrary code as well depending on what
kind of bug we're talking about okay so
these bugs can have security
applications and if you're curious about
the particular ones and the runtime
systems we looked at i'd be happy to
talk to you about that but the thing
that i want to maybe a hammer on a bit
more is that these bugs are super easy
to actually introduce in real code and
this is because it's easier to hard
crash and your c++ binding code than it
is to say handle an exception and throw
it back to javascript right like you're
now having to mix and match javascript
control flow in the c++ binding code
somewhere it's easier to just cast a
JavaScript value two primitives two
objects and so forth without actually
checking to type first if you check the
type and it has the wrong type what you
have to do you have to throw an
exception back to JavaScript why would
you do that when you can just cast and
maybe worst of all is that you can
really use these API so shoot yourself
in the foot by calling back into
JavaScript and you do so because this
control flow is not actually made
explicit right and once you call back in
JavaScript if this JavaScript is
controlled by an attacker well it might
violate invariants that you've set up in
this binding function about say c++
datatypes and has results and reentry
into c++ and you might be reading or
touching an object that's no longer live
but you don't have to kind of trust me i
think like the people that you might
want to trust more are the chrome
developers that have looked at this
binding code for quite some time and
their summary of it is basically that
it's just super hacks and it's so gnarly
that they've gone through the effort of
implementing your garbage collector and
c++ not to actually worry about memory
safety
and chromed on binding code but not
everybody has the same amount of money
as Google so people are still managing
member you manually and you know getting
into trouble with that okay I want to
tell you a little bit about those people
I guess so what we did was we started
looking at binding code really hardened
and we're like okay can we actually
write static checkers that will find
these bugs for us and I'm going to talk
to you about a few of these static
analysis that are super hacky but
nevertheless find real bugs in real code
we've looked at four different systems
nodejs which is the server-side
framework but it's also used now in all
these other devices PDF um so that's
your Chrome PDF render that if you
didn't know it actually runs JavaScript
because PDFs as it does everything else
it runs JavaScript and the Chrome
extension system which itself has a
bunch of binding code to actually let
you manipulate say tabs pages network
requests and so forth and blink so blink
is Chrome's rendering engine that's the
thing that actually gives you say the
Dom object okay so I'm going to talk to
you about the static analysis tools and
then a new binding API that addresses
the problems that are inherent to the v8
API I'm only going to talk to you about
two systems in this talk if you're
interested about the other systems we
have a paper on this you can check out
bindings programming dot systems um but
I'm also happy talking about it after
after chalk okay so let's talk about
some static analysis this is the
pipeline that you are all familiar with
so we are basically taking a super
simple static analysis framework that
takes a bunch of code parses it gives
you tokens and then creates an ast that
we don't check for particular patterns
that we've come up with after looking at
a bunch of CDs basically but it
basically comes down to like all these
three different violations right crash
safety type safety and memory safety at
the boundaries where you cross between
JavaScript and C++ now the specific tool
that we're using is called micro checks
and it's really just meant for finding
these kinds of bugs it's not sound at
all in fact it only parses a subset of
C++ and a subset of these idioms
right so between
spdf um-- blink and chrome extension
system they all have wrappers around a
v8 engine and we basically want to focus
on finding patterns that are specific to
those systems as opposed to having a
very sound and precise and general
static analysis tool that would make it
kind of harder to actually figure out
like what these bugs look like and these
checkers target again the three things
so one is hard crashes so we basically
look to see when are you using a hard
crashing API or when do you have an
assert that you probably shouldn't have
an assert that can be triggered by
JavaScript code we also check for type
confusion so when do you actually use a
value without checking its type so when
you do casting and of course
out-of-bounds reads and writes and
finally some use after freeze in the
context of the PD help IAM api now
overall we've flagged roughly 155 bugs
but we didn't confirm all these we only
look for 81 mostly because we were lazy
and I need to maybe spend the rest of
this week in Barcelona on the others but
anyway we still actually found like 80
81 confirmed bugs and a bunch of these
are actually pretty serious so let me
talk to you a little bit about those
bugs okay so what did I actually look
like well here is an example of a no js'
binding layer function this function is
part of the core library core part of
the core buffer library which is
basically as core as you can get and
this function fills a buffer with a from
0 to 10 so internally this function
basically takes those two arguments
trees them as integers computes the
length of the thing to fill and then
calls mem copy to actually fill the
buffer with the values that you wanted
to fill now there are no checks that are
actually really performed in C++ and so
what this means is that if we can call
this function directly from JavaScript
with evil values for start and end then
we can perform an arbitrary memory right
2 to memory right so if we can control
the start and end we can just set it to
evil values and then demand copy will do
whatever we want it to do right so this
is pretty standard so this is what the
exploit actually looks like in fact you
could call this function
in node but note doesn't want you to use
this function directly so node actually
has a wraps of the binding layer with a
thin JavaScript layer and this is
actually a really good idea and its idea
I think that they might have borrowed
from the Chrome extension system and the
basic idea is like hey like we're going
to write as little C++ as possible right
the rest of the core libraries in
JavaScript because JavaScript is safe so
we don't have to necessarily worry about
bugs that happen in c++ land the problem
is that in practice they didn't really
do a good job of isolating this
JavaScript this binding layer from it
being accessible to arbitrary code so
you can call these binding functions
directly and what's worse is because
they have this thin layer of JavaScript
of checks and performance like say
things like that bounce checks they
didn't do these checks and C++ as well
so it's not actually defensive so their
actual binding layer functions are not
defensive
and they're still directly accessible
most of the time you can really like get
at executing these binding layer
functions directly but like we can
pretend that one day they'll actually
hide these a binding layer functions and
the only thing that we can actually
touch are the exposed node libraries and
given that we want to actually still
trigger that previous buffer fail
example and this is kind of like the
thing that we went through after finding
these binding layer functions is how can
we actually trigger them from the core
exposed API okay so to go through that
I'm going to take the ball fulfill
example again and I'll show you what
it's like and what it's actually doing
internally so when you call but fill
this will call the buffer dot prototype
that fill function and this function
basically has a JavaScript function that
performs the balance check and after
performs the balance check it calls the
binding layer fill function that we saw
before yeah so this is basically what's
doing it's just passing through if
everything is good but if everything is
not good then bounced check and
JavaScript we throw an exception for
example now how do we actually bypass
and get this exploit working well the
thing that we need to do is make sure
that we
pass the JavaScript bounce check so when
we call bounced check with start and end
we want to make sure that like it says
yeah good to go it doesn't throw an
exception but we still want to when we
get to the C++ binding layer function
actually give it two evil values for
sergeant and so we can perform our
arbitrary memory right so how can we
actually do this well we're going to
leverage the fact that JavaScript has a
bunch of really crazy and awesome
features so one of the things you can do
is you can override a the implicit
casting function definition which given
an object would say convert into a
primitive so in this case I have one
object called odd and when you use this
object as an int it will call my
function here that will do crack crack
and then give you 55 yeah and internally
this U and 32 function that we saw
before well it will actually call such a
user-defined function when given an
object like this it won't say
automatically give you a zero as the old
version of JavaScript used to do so what
this means is that now we can call BA
fill with these two objects and our two
objects just do evil things in
particular what they do is the first
time around they give you start values
of zero and ten but the next time around
do our evil say values of negative one
and maybe ten and that allows us to get
to mem copy directly and write any part
of every debt we want so what should
they have done well they really should
have type checked in JavaScript and
probably C++ but okay that's that's what
it is I want to tell you how we kind of
generalize this and what the actual
static checkers look for in our system
so the idea is actually pretty simple as
I think you can imagine from from what
you just saw which is like once you have
user JavaScript that can influence
values if these values actually
influence a mmm copy or any other
dangerous operation we're going to flag
it and then go back and inspect it and
see if we can trigger this bug directly
so what we're basically doing internally
in the checker we check we're keeping
track of two things one is the unchecked
types and these are values that come
from JavaScript that you might not have
yet checked and then for each of these
values that end up being in this uncheck
type set when you use them
say mmm copy operation we done flag okay
so going through our fill function what
our checker does is it immediately upon
entry says like hey args is something
that's coming from JavaScript land let's
add it into the on check types because
you haven't looked at any of the
arguments then we go through the
function body and one thing that we see
is that we're using args to as aun 32
value right so we're adding start
potentially dangerous values and we're
doing the same thing for end and then
once we actually get to demand copy we
see that start is actually in the
dangerous value set and we flag this as
a bug now this is not always going to be
a bug because sometimes you can't
actually trigger from JavaScript these
DT C++ functions but most of the time at
least in node they do
manifest as real bugs but know does not
know did the only one that's doing the
wrong thing here PDF view is another
example that has a bunch of bugs that
we've managed to flag and here's one
example over use after free and PDMP now
with the check that the checker does for
for PDF iam is it Flags any pointer if
this pointer say was allocated in a
function a pointing to an object in a
function that lives in JavaScript land
and then after that you have a call into
javascript that might have actually free
that pointer and then this pointer is
used again so to give you a concrete
example here's the annotation name
function and here what we have is this C
J's prop value so you don't actually
need to understand any of these types
but the thing to understand is that this
is a user supplied value the same things
as we had before with a function call
back arcs okay so when we enter a
function what do we have well we have a
pointer to this annotation this
annotation is a C++ pointer but it's
actually back it's backing a JavaScript
object so what this means is when we hit
this line here VP greater than greater
than
I don't name well we can potentially
free this pointer and the reason for it
is because this greater the greater than
operator the PDF you guys have well
overloaded it to call into JavaScript
what it actually does is
to string internally and to string you
can always redefine and within the to
string function if we're malicious we
can force a garbage collection of the
previous object and then when we get to
the next line and still use that pointer
well this will be an invalid pointer and
if we've had just the right alignment so
we can get it to execute arbitrary code
for us okay
so that particular bounty with that
particular bug that like chrome actually
recognized as a problem and it's one of
the few ones that we reported and I
guess it's a signal that they actually
do care about these kinds of use after
freeze but of the others of the 81 bugs
that we confirmed they roughly break
down into are mostly crash safety so -
roughly 70 crash safety bugs and then a
few type safety and memory safety
violations now I want to point out that
these are bugs in runtime systems right
they're not bugs and applications and
what that means is that all the
applications running on top of these
runtimes
are vulnerable to these kinds of attacks
so you can take down a server pretty
easily with node and the thing I want to
kind of highlight a little bit more is
well who are we to blame here is it node
and PDF um-- for misusing the v8 api or
not writing safe code or is it somebody
else my take is that well the binding
API design itself is what's at flaw and
here's I guess some fake evidence to
support that claim the first one is well
if we look at like what we've actually
flagged well we managed to flag most of
nodes core libraries so pretty much if
you take a node core library you can get
it to crash in fact you can get it to
crash even when node runs on chakra core
which is a different v8 well it's a
different engine but it wraps basically
provides a v8 like interface at least
for node and similarly for PDF um we've
managed to crash most of the aps that
they exposed to javascript as well right
so that means that people are seriously
misusing these api's and we need to
rethink how these api's are presented to
developers and this is exactly what we
did right so we designed a new binding
layer API that helps us prevent these
kinds of bugs by construction and we're
calling this safe v8 so safe EA is
actually just a wrapper around v8 but
you can imagine implementing
directly above the JavaScript VM as
opposed to what we did and the three
kind of takeaways that we wanted to
instill in this API design was like well
one let's force developers to actually
handle errors right so there are a lot
of safety violations well let's make
sure that whenever you call into the
binding layer you're not actually
allowing developers to easily hard crash
that means our API should not let you
easily crash right so we're not exposing
any function that hard crashes and gives
you a way out that's easier than
handling the exception similarly what's
not actually allow developers to use
values without first checking types so
our API our API only provides these
primitives for marshaling values from
JavaScript to C++ line after you've
actually perform a type check and
finally to address memory safety
concerns well to make sure that every
time you cross the language boundary
this is explicit and this forces you to
actually think about the environments
that might be violated as a result of a
call to JavaScript okay so given those
constraints this is what the fill
function actually before it looks like
with safety eight so we didn't want to
change the semantics of the fill
function and in this case a implicit
cast actually still calls back into
JavaScript but it does it
assuming that you get back at you in 32
and if you don't then you should handle
the exception and actually just throw
back to JavaScript and similarly we do
for the second argument and so forth now
you might be looking at this and it just
looks like callback hell and that's
actually intentional and this is meant
to look like JavaScript because when
you're writing binding code you're
essentially writing JavaScript code but
using C++ API s so write what you intend
to write not this ugly broken thing
granted callbacks are ugly too but
that's a separate conversation okay so
we will go into this on how do we
actually evaluated well we have
basically three things in mind one is
can we actually still implement
everything dead v8 implements and Nords
test this we just poured it all of node
to our safe binding API and in fact
we've managed to do that with partially
having a tool rewrite the code for us so
we've written all of nodes binding layer
with with this API and we've ran their
tests to actually check for
compatibility right we don't want to
change the semantics except for say
crash safety and things like that so to
confirm that we ran the test past all of
nodes test and in fact we ran all of
nodes regression tests which includes
running basically packages from the node
package manager
there's taking those packages and
running those tests so it's like unlike
roughly 74 packages but you can imagine
going crazy and taking more packages
from NPM and running those tests and in
that case we also passed the tests so
that's a compatibility and
expressiveness
the other one was performance of course
like if this thing is super slow there's
no point in ever actually using it and
we've ran again nodes regression tests
here and the performance measurements
are on average negligible the max was
around 11% but these are micro
benchmarks not necessarily super
meaningful and nerds it has something
more meaningful we ran a bunch of
real-world benchmarks maybe the most
notable one is Express Jas which is a
web server and we measured it
performance to be less than 1% okay so
that's safety eight and we're still
working on this project there are a few
things that we're kind of trying to
tackle one is can we automatically
generate exploits across these languages
right so we've looked at 81 bugs out of
the 155 that we flagged well the
question is can we take the rest like 70
whatever they are and actually do that
automatically or have a way of signaling
that this is actually not trigger bold
from a JavaScript land but beyond that
we also want to look at other platforms
right so there a lot of v8 platforms one
of them is electron which takes
basically chromium and nodejs and gives
you a way of building desktop
application so that makes it also
interesting is can we look at electron
and see like what kind of problems arise
there at the binding layer or these IOT
devices that are exposing hardware
directly to to JavaScript like what kind
of binding layer problems arise there or
what kind of binding layer problems
arise and things like nan which is a
wrapper around v8 yet again but as is
widely used by mostly third-party
packages in
ecosystem and of course we can take
other binding layer api's and look at
those as well so looking at Firefox
servo even Jerry would be super
interesting and something that we have
under roadmap so that's kind of looking
at the checker side on de safe pH API
side we're looking at automatically
rewriting this on safe code so we've
already done part of that but we want to
show that when you do the rewriting it
actually preserve semantics and gives
you correctness and kind of part of that
effort is also formalizing these
multi-language systems and actually
looking at this API from a formal lens
okay so with that I guess I talk to you
about super simple but and system
specific checkers that found violations
and three core things but three core
things when it comes to safety one is
crash the other one is type and the
third one is memory safety in these
JavaScript runtimes and I've presented a
fast backwards compatible API to ideally
addresses these things there's a lot
more to do like one of the things that I
think is like interesting about this
work is that it hasn't really been
touched by the academic community it's
largely been work done in industry by
Google and Mozilla so I think like
actually trying to connect with these
people and figuring out how we can help
as academics would be super interesting
so that take any questions
okay thank you so if you have questions
please come to the microphone in the
middle and we have space for a couple so
as you know maybe there is a current
release nowadays they standardized nodes
and API and probably it seems like it's
the very close work to what you're doing
because cycads way to standardize
writing C extensions for node.js have
you touched like communicated with them
like with committee knows commedia
something like that because it seems
like it's a lot of work now in that
field from the official note team there
is so like we've been dealing with it
from the security kind of workgroup
largely not from from the
standardization process there but I
think it'd be interesting I don't know
if they're actually dealing necessarily
with these safety concerns largely
because I think it's easier not to but
yeah I think we should probably actually
touch over them so yeah they al are like
working on more mostly on back on
compatibility between versions and dat
but it would be nice of course to see
security mitigation things yeah yeah it
would be super awesome to actually like
the fact that our thing like worked on
chakra was a surprise to us and reason
it worked is because chakra chakra
basically implemented this v8 like
wrapper on top of chakra and that's
totally different VM and if you
standardize this thing now and it's
broken it would be like maybe even more
so yeah I think we should do that
okay so if there are no more questions
let's thank the speaker let's thank the
speaker again and the next session will
be here in 20 minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
