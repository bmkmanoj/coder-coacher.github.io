pacing you seems a very well coordinated
thank you
so before I introduced the closing
keynote speaker I wanted to say just a
few words
first is thank you to all the speakers I
think that we should all thank the
speakers for producing such wonderful
talks
for coming all the way out here and in
general just sort of gracing us with all
kinds of cool and interesting ideas and
being the one half of the hey we should
talk equation and on the other side of
that you know we're going to have to
clap again because I want to thank
everybody who is here for coming all the
way out we have people coming from the
US people coming from the UK most of our
attendance is actually from farther away
than putting in nearer so first thank
you all for coming it's it was an
amazing event so thank you and and
finally if you did you guys have fun was
it was it good did you enjoy yourselves
goal if you're interested in doing it
again next year we're going to be in
Amsterdam around the same time next year
what why are you freaking out like it's
not even just one or two people freaking
out it's like eight people in different
parts of the auditorium what's wrong
with that is that good or bad
okay you can tell me later all right at
this point I will introduce our closing
keynote speaker who is known for a
language that lots of you have used
probably more people have heard of then
used it's a little language called Lua
and so Roberto Roberto e dot please
please welcome Roberto
well good evening or good afternoon I'm
not sure now my name is Jerusalem scheme
I guess and then according to some
Russian friends that's how we say my
name eros Alinsky's so prepared too
easily so I'm going to talk a little
about scripting with Lua so as she said
lower I think it's a language that a lot
of people heard about but not many
people know so I'll give a more general
overview of the language first when I'm
talking about scripting I'm talking
about the original meaning of scripting
like in in shell languages or in TECO of
this idea that usually you can structure
your program using two languages a
system language and scripting language
and you use the system language for the
hard parts of your problem for for data
structures for complex algorithms
usually these are the parts that change
it less in your program any use
scripting for the flexible parts of your
application like the AP like the user
interface and things like that that
things that change much more frequently
and you need a more flexible language
but I'd like to emphasize that we use
this idea of scripting both because the
scripting language gives you some more
power in some aspects compared it to the
system language but also because it
restrains you much more in some other
aspects this is a very important part of
any language what the language prevents
you to do like all type systems that the
main idea is to prevent you from making
mistakes memory automatic memory
allocation is the idea that prevents you
of damaging the memory and scripting is
also mainly with Lua it's also very
frequently used to protect parts of the
application because frequently more
often than not the scripting is used by
non-professional programmers like people
that are mean they are of course program
programmers but they are not by
formation professional programmers they
are more involved with the domain of the
application and so scripting is a good
way to protect for instance in hardware
in embedded systems is a way to protect
the hardware literally protect the
programmer for birding the device and
the in software tool scripting is a way
to avoid the descriptor to interfere
with the internals of the software they
are scripting a very typical example is
in the world of rock World of Warcraft
game that they offer scripting in Lua
for the players and the idea of all of
this Lua interface that anything that a
player can do in Lua is not considered
invalid in the game anything they do
outside LeWitt can be cheating can be
considered violation of the Terms of
Service of the game so scripting is also
very commonly used in that in that role
to protect something from from
unauthorized or wrong use this is a text
from the lead developer of grim fandago
grim fandago was the first trip away
game that used lewin a long time ago and
it gives an idea what we are talking
about here when we talk about scripting
this is very typical ready tech chure of
any scripting or of many scripting of
programs that use Lua that you have a
kind of some
kind of colonel some kind of engine
behind it as I said that take care of
the indicating the case of games it take
care of graphics take care of physics
all those complicated parts in terms of
algorithms but the bulk of the game
there as he says in the middle paragraph
descriptors wrote most of the game
everything about the game is written in
Lua on top of that kernel what makes the
game are descriptors and as I said
scriptures are people that are very
familiar with the game they are not as I
said professional programmers in the
meaning they are not concerned about
programming they are concerned with the
game itself what the game does what are
the characters how they react in
different environments and so this is
their the whole idea of using Lua in
applications so a lot of areas use that
kind of scripting and in particular
looper
that kind of scripting in particular
I'll talk I'll show some examples of
scripting for applications on embedded
systems and of course games so here is
just a short list of some programs that
use Lua for scripting and that kind of
scripting that you have an application
you can run the application sometimes
without scripting or with little part in
scripting but you can extend a lot what
you can do with the application using
scripting in particular there is a
politically incorrect example there that
in the write down coroner is a malware
the flame mirela that is all the
all the software to invade host is
written in C C++ but once is in fact a
hose you can send scripts in Louisville
to do whatever you want to do if that
also against that kind of flexibility
that we'll offers it's not a very good I
mean as I said it's not a politically
correct example but I think it shows
that they're the kind of users and the
kind of power why they chose Lua we'll
see later but they chose root for the
same reasons there are a lot of people
choose Allah Adobe Lightroom is another
example that it is more politically
correct it's a huge program and again it
has a more than I mean most of the
program is written in Lua but it has
also a big part written in C C++ for all
the graphics all the picture
manipulation etc it's all written in C
C++ and on top of that we have Lulu and
there is a lot of integral DS is also
very very common in scripting that it's
not that idea that you have the program
written in script in the scripted
language and you have only libraries
written in C C++ you have a lot of
communication of sequel calling Lulu a
calling C and all kinds of data types
being represented sometimes in lua some
time in C sometimes you have proxies in
one language to represent objects in the
other languages and the communic the
communication is usually much more type
than the usual idea file you just have a
library that we export functions for
other language that is typically used in
order script
scripting languages embedded systems
there is a lot of embedded systems also
using luo we have world TVs or on
keyboards on routers and
car panels and etc all them use Lua for
again if they these kind of views
embedded system is mainly as I said to
protect the hardware to make easy
because again a lot of people
programming those devices are not
professional programmers they are more
concerned or the users or even with the
hardware itself and Lua here protects
the harder and also it makes it easier
to update the system is much easier to
change as the script then to change the
whole the whole software l of course
games is a area that fluids quite famous
form there is a gun a short list of
games that use a loom you have some very
famous that the list is always outdated
because I don't keep with new games
comings all these usually set some more
old games but it's worried it's a lot of
work to keep this list updated so while
you were white people Jews Lua wide all
those applications use looool there is a
lot of reasons but I had among the main
reasons that I would mention that I talk
here are because Luis portable we small
blue it simple and it has this emphasis
on scripting so what does this mean
portability means that looool runs
almost everywhere almost all platforms
we heard of it runs in in mainframes and
IBM all kinds of console game consoles
and all kinds of devices that I talk to
their liking in car panels it runs in
keyboards and in cameras and all kinds
of anything that has a CPU and a minimum
of memory you can run Lua in it can run
Z it can end runs inside OS kernels for
instance the net bsd distribution now
comes standard
we flew inside the kernel so you can
optimize some tasks inside the kernel so
you don't pay the price of crossing the
kernel barrier all the time so for
instance for package filtering and
that's what several other kinds of
applications you can scrape the kernel
and you have there is a module for linux
this is an external module but also you
can link it to the kernel and you can
script Linux with blue and it runs on
the bare metal I mean a lot of several
devices that don't have an operating
system images just run lewin on top of
the of the harder size this is a history
of looing lines of code even today the
whole distribution with all libraries
etc is less than ten twenty five
thousand lines of code or less than ten
thousand lines of logical lines of code
that translates to for instance in my
machine this is a Linux 64 bits
Ubuntu this is the size of the of the
executables less than 200 kilobytes and
this is the whole again there it doesn't
have extra libraries this is everything
link it statically with all libraries
that it uses etc this is the the whole
of you'll anything need that we can
remove some libraries that people don't
use for instance embedded systems people
usually don't need io libraries so you
can make that even smaller
simplicity is something difficult for us
to argue but a good proxy for complexity
is the size of the reference manual this
the reference mono is quite complete in
lua we usually reconsider that water
what is not in the manual should not be
used so it's not something the manual is
not something illustrative it's really
the reference of the language some pipes
sometimes people can I use that and say
oh via to the manual doesn't say doesn't
ensure that you can use but you can
change the next version etc so actually
what most people use on the language is
written there and this is the spine this
is all you have to learn about you and
this is again the entire language the
API the libraries everything is
described in these hundred pages and the
idea of scripting Lewis since the
beginning has been developed as a
scripting language Lewis implemented as
a library is not a language that we put
an API as a afterthought it is developed
as a library the standalone interpreter
is just a client of this library just
any other client so the idea of the C
API plays a central role in all the
design of the language and for that
reason it's very good for embedding
exits and extending that it's and some
people have this distinction between
whether you have the mainly whether your
is your main loop if your main program
is C calling some functions in the
scripting language that it's called
embedding or extending is this other
direction that you have the main program
in the scripting language just calling
libraries in C or C++
M Lua has been embedded not only in C
C++ but in all kinds of languages and in
particular this is funny Lua it's
actually used to script programs written
in scripting languages for instance in
Python once I gave this a talked similar
to that for a Python audience and
exactly a guy in the audience called say
I am using lui and then after that I
learned that a lot of people exactly for
this reason of protection because if you
have a Python program and you offer a
Python console for a user he can do
whatever he wants with the program and
so if he offers a lower console then he
can restrict what the user can do he can
only call functions that are registered
that are offered and that's not because
Lua is different from Python that's
because it's very easy to do that in
Ruby if you were doing a for instance in
Lightroom that the whole program is in
Lua you can write stuff in Lua and it's
easy to protect your parts in Lua from
there other parts of the program so a
lot of people would say reasonably that
those goals that I mentioned are more
about implementation then about the
language Frances size or this idea of
the API of being portable and my answer
well they are not about the
implementation of of course they are a
little about the implementation but
there is a lot about the language that
allows the implementation to be done in
that way there is a lot of in the
project of the language both related to
size related to portability and
specifically related to scripting that
makes the the API makes that it makes an
implementation much easier and more
more viable to be done so the our
principles we have we of course if the
language has to be small we have a few
but powerful mechanisms in particular we
use the domain of Lua is built on top of
very old and tested principles and
mechanisms that are associative arrays
functions or closures or lambdas
whatever you want to call them and
coroutines and we all have all as I said
this emphasis on what we call the eye of
the needle is this idea that we have to
pass all constructs of the language
through an API with C in particular our
basic API I mean we have API for a lot
of different language but the basic API
we've see and everything that in Lua
should be able to pass through this API
you should be able to do things in C and
the same thing in lewin as I said the
communication should be easy should be
bi-directional and should be in all
levels of abstraction so you have a
quick look at tables tables are the name
that Lua gives to associative arrays
this is just mostly just associative
arrays but with very some specific
features first as any associative array
you can use any value as key Union is
value to associate with any value
because always dynamically type table
can associate any kind of value to any
kind of value and what it's interesting
is that tables in Louisville just with
some synthetic sugar and some
implementation techniques implement all
data structures in Lua we have just
tables for everything so structures or
records it's easy
synthetic sugar to use strings as keys
in particular Lua internalizes all short
strings so they work at symbols in other
language so indexing with short strings
it's very fast listen and erase we just
use integers as keys and Lua has a very
interesting algorithm that it detects
that the table is being used as an array
and stores the data as an array it
actually each table can have two parts
one part in is an actual array and one
part is a hash table and Lua
automatically decides how to distribute
the keys so for instance if you want to
do sparse arrays you just write sparse
arrays and LU automatic differences if
you add element with a huge index Lua
will not allocate a huge array
completely empty we just put that the
index in the hash part and if you start
adding other indices if you put in the
hash part and kill some time you decide
so there is a lot of numbers in the hash
heart maybe it's worth moving them to to
an array well lower offers closures I
mean his in quotes because closure is
actually an implementation way to
implement what strangely doesn't have a
proper name but it's anonymous functions
as first-class values with lexical
scoping now it's becoming more common in
non functional languages and have sent
when we started using closures in Lua
that was not that common in a lot of
imperative languages or even
object-oriented languages and even to
date a lot of things people call
closures in imperative languages have
some restrictions some language do not
allow you to update outside variables or
there are some restrictions whether you
can escape the value etcetera Lua has
just what you expect from closures to be
and in particular because who has so
very few mechanisms Lua use funds I mean
the power of functions of being
anonymous of being first-class values of
being lack of having lexical scoping in
a lot of places much more frequent it's
not in a lot of languages closure is a
kind of advance a topical is something
extra in the language in moods almost
from day one if you start programming in
Lua you'll be using that kind of stuff
in particular like in scheme all
functions are anonymous in lieu and when
you in the top is the typical syntax we
use to declare a function in Lua in the
bottom is the top is just syntactic
sugar for the bottom so all functions
are anonymous just assign it to common
variables there is nothing special in
the name of the function and all
functions in Lua we write are nested to
when in Luud instead of an eval that
it's common in in dynamic languages we
have a load function that actually
returns a function that went all it runs
the code you gave to to to load so we
have that kind of translation the road
would be more or less equivalent and
eval that evaluates your code inside an
anonymous function so there is no notion
of main program all code you write is
always inside some functions of course
you can declare local variables that
work more or less like static variables
and see because there they are only
visible inside that piece of code but
they because they are outside any
function they if functions use that
variable that very will persist among
Falls to those functions and modules for
instance is just a combination of
functions and paper just a bunch of
functions inside a table a module so for
instance when you read write math dot
square root of 10 math is just a glow a
common variable that contains a table
and that table has a few square root
that contains the function there is the
square root so modules come from for
free and a very important point here is
not only this is very cheap I mean very
easy to implement but that's very easy
to pass through the API as I said
because I didn't mention that but of
course associative arrays it's very easy
to pass through API you just have to
offer operations to create the array to
access in this season to store indices
functions are trivial you just have
functions to call stuff and so it's very
easy for C code to create modules or
versi code to to call functions inside
modules declared in lua or you can have
modules some functions written in c some
functions written in Luud so that
communication is very very flexible to
you so you can have all kinds of
combinations here and we have several
facilities for free because everything
is first-class value so you can give
local names to modules you can give
local names to functions etc objects
it's just a combination again if you do
if you join associative arrays and
first-class functions you almost got
objects there are some missing
ingredients so the first link lua
provides is just a synthetic sugar there
is the column syntax that provides a
self both when you call a function and
when you declare a function so for
instance e when you write a column for
is a synthetic sugar that means called
the full function of a passing a as the
self parameter and you can write the
function again using the columns in tips
like here function a column full and
again it puts a self parameter that that
would receive the the object and
operates on top of that object so this
is the main part and the second part is
that something extra we have system of
delegation in lure but delegation is not
related to object orientation it doesn't
we don't have delegation of methods we
have the legation of field accesses only
this idea related to associative arrays
to tables not related to two objects or
anything like that in the ideas that you
can say that a table delegates access to
another table it only means that if you
get a field from table a and it doesn't
have that field then it delegates to B
and ask do you if you have that field
you just returns that to me and this is
all we need to to implement object
orientation and to implement sync single
inheritance for instance here is the how
things work we have an object a that
delegates to object that behaves like it
classes that because it class that it
provides the methods for this object so
when you write a column foo that
synthetic sugar for a dot foo so it
tries to get food in a a doesn't have a
food it goes to the class class does
have that key so it get that function
and that the function then is call it
with a as the self and everything works
as expected and again as I said it's
very easy to translate that through the
API again we don't need anything extra
it's very easy for from C to call
methods or to declare methods in C etc
because everything are just functions
and tables environments is something
that it also is quite nice in lure
everybody knows that Global's are evil I
should not use Global's but Global's are
very handy in particular in scripting
languages for instance you write a
equals three and then you write in the
next line print a to the 12 power and in
lua each line is compiled as a chunk as
an independent piece of code so if you
do you can declare a as local but in the
next line that local is gone so it
wouldn't be very useful and if a is
Global's okay you can use that in the
next line and print itself as I said
every function in lua is an animal so
print itself is just a global name of a
variable so if you want to use print it
would be good that we have access to
global variables so what we do is that
lure does not have global variables but
it goes to great lengths to pretend it
has so it is a kind of at first loop
it's a kind of quite complex thing that
it does that in the end gives you global
variables so this is what actually
happens when you load a function as I
said this any piece of code not a
function it's that piece of gold becomes
the body of an anonymous function that
anonymous function always have an
external variable polit m's it's an ugly
name on purpose tits underscore MF is a
special name all functions are always
compiled with this local m and then
there is a almost synthetic not
synthetic sugar because it needs
semantic information but it's just a
synthetic transformation that all three
names
in the chunk are translated to fields in
that M name where so this is completely
syntactic oh it just did it doesn't need
M becomes just a completely normal
variable the only special thing it has
is that it's in is initialized with some
value and so by therefore when we don't
give anything to load load passes a
global table that is reserved in inside
lua and so by the foe all modules share
a global table and when you write any
free name that name becomes a field in
that global table and the soul all
modules share this idea of global
variables but for instance we when you
load a module you can provide the table
that it's going to use so for instance
you provide a empty table then that
module has access to no functions at all
you can provide I'll talk about that
give more examples in a minute of course
you can also use environments by
yourself not through load because as I
said M is a regular variable so for
instance if you want to write modules
you want to protect your your code you
can do that kind of stuff you declare
locals with the stuff that you want to
import then once you do end it goes
something then from that point on
everything all Global's go through
differences if you put F equals new you
just raises all global names you can
only use the names that you import
before in the import list so some some
common typical uses you can put as I
said M equals nil then you just makes an
error any kind of access to to Global's
you can put m because a new table empty
table and then you you still you cannot
use Global's but you can
aged around Global's I mean you use
global names and sharing that table of
course you can populate that table with
some functions so you can run a piece of
code that can only all some specific
functions that you you gave the right
for it in the last line we use the
legation you can for instance um be a
new table that delegates to the standard
global table so all reads you can read
all global variables but if you write
anything this goes to the this private
table here and you cannot write to the
global table there is all kinds of
tricks that you can do with this
construction and again as I said because
this construction is done on top of
tables and functions it's very easy to
translate that to see it's very easy in
C I mean it's everything is compatible
of course in last I'll finish with
proteins hora teens is always a very old
like tables and functions very old
concept but with several variations it a
lot of people understand different stuff
when we talk about proteins and in
particular those variations are not all
equivalent we cannot convert one to the
other in particular here we are we are
worried I mean we want horrid things
that are equivalent to one shot
continuations those are at what we call
the good proteins proteins in loops I
mean the basic ideas I said it's very
common you just create reporting with a
body the body is a function can be any
function and then you inside about you
when you resume for the first time the
protein starts running and then the
protein can use and then resume returns
and then you can resume again in use etc
etc that's very basics
in in carotenes what it's special
what's changes among different languages
related to Puritans is that first color
things lure our first class values that
means you can create a quarantine and
you can call that you can resume that
quality anywhere in your program of
course proteins are just you can store
them in variables etc passes parameters
but in particular we can resume them
anywhere in your program and it's what
we call stack foo that means that a
quarantine can yield anywhere in
execution so protein can its body can
call a function and calls another
function and it have five ten levels of
calls and then you yield inside those
ten levels and when you resume your back
inside
those levels that's also very important
for a lot of important uses that people
do with goroutines in lua and in
particular proteins in Lua are a
symmetrical because there is this
version of color teens that are
symmetrical we have a kind of transfer
that is a kind of boat tool and in
quarantines in Lua we have the resume
and yield two separate functions that
are more like call returned but it's
very easy to transfer not very easy but
it's possible to translate one kind of
proteins to the other so they are these
two kinds are more like mostly
equivalent and so go routines are very
very reasonable simple implementation
mainly are just different stacks this is
nothing very and the resume is just just
change in stack both resume youth is
just changing the step you have what we
called complete proteins as I said it's
equivalent to one shot continuations in
particular we can implement all one cc
in Lua we can write as function call one
CC with exactly the same semantics of
other languages
I have this kind of one-shot
continuations but we think that proteins
present one short continuations in the
format that it's much more familiar to
most programmers I mean one shot
continuation sometimes it's hard to
understand even continuations it's hard
for people understand and goroutines
it's very intuitive it's a kind of its
kind of mood cooperative multi-threading
so and what is interesting is that most
uses of continuations can be coded as
one-shot continuation then of course as
proteins in particular one of the most
common uses is who has the main loop
problem there I mean in programs
sometimes if the producer-consumer is a
typical example and sometimes for
instance you have a program in Lua you
have a program in C and you want to
write both in the style that you don't
want callbacks etc so protein is the
perfect thing to turn that around and
avoid all kinds of callbacks and you can
do programming I mean you have an API
that is event oriented but you write
your program as it would be just a
sequential program and it behaves in
everything fits quite nicely and of
course there are a few applications
usually strange but some very
interesting applications of multi-shot
continuations like oracle functions that
you cannot code with proteins you pay a
price but it's much easier to implement
goroutines than multi-shot continuations
so that is it so scripting still
relevant technique for any programmer to
boxes you use it in a lot of its old but
it's still very useful language
interoperability is not an
implementation detail of course you can
solve that with a lot of effort but Luis
I said for instance all those problems
they were talking about here about
JavaScript and the API in
one API safe since the practically they
mean for 10 20 years at least all those
problems of memory memory management etc
was solve its end in part because of
this integration of the language with
the with the API and as I said Lou has
been designed for scripting the main
uses of Lua are all that kind of of uses
of with scripting in some interesting
part in C and some interesting part in
Lua and as I said the main constructions
in Lua are very easy to port and to pass
through the eye of the needle tools this
is very interesting there is a lot of
more that I didn't say but it for
instance memory management weak tables
and finalizar this Lua has a lot of
bunch of other details that help this
integration of Lua and C but the main
stuff is listed I presented here so
that's it
so what is this current status of the
logit and what it is placed in the
ecosystem wow this is this is complex
Luigi tees are completely separate
implementation done by a brilliant guy
that we sometimes suspect our 10 people
merged in one nobody I mean I did the
closest I got to him is that once I met
a guy that claims to have talked on the
phone with him once so he can be 10 guys
quite easily nobody saw him I mean it's
a very strange story and he got a very
good JIT in part because Louie it's as I
said it's very simple that helps a lot
JIT is a tres JIT and but it's and but
he's crazy and now we are having some
problems with legit because one of part
of the craziness of legit is that is I
think it's unmanned paintable at least
without him
I think even him it's having problems
too I mean he's he says he's he's living
for all the reasons it can be true but I
think it was becoming difficult because
it has a lot of for instance he wrote
the interpreter of Lua here old
interpreter in assembly just so it's
that kind of craziness so it's really
fast and it's really it's really
unbelievable fast but now looking for
alternatives I mean we we are looking
for something that it's not that fast
but we can maintain or someone can
maintain that mean
he's stepping down and nobody up I mean
there is a lot of people crazier a lot
of companies craze about Rajat and they
cannot find anyone to do to even to
understand the code I think it's hard
and it's not big that's not the
unbelievable I mean it's hard because
it's hard not because not big is not
it's not sighs yeah
this is a quite naive question from my
side but I would be interested in that
what do you advise to someone who is
getting into this whole like language
building thing because for instance I am
NOT like a computer scientist I didn't
like study this topic but I would be
really interested in like trying to
build my own language or like getting
into this topic what would you recommend
to do you mean to to to start
programming for know more like since
like I'm talking more about language
design and like the more computer
science eat up page so if you say okay I
would recommend you definitely read this
book about oh designing this about
language design and implementation what
is the I don't know I think it's very
much designed I think that they I must
say I don't like very much books about
language design I prefer to read designs
I always thought it's very interesting
to to learn languages I mean to learn a
lot of languages this is really
interesting and after some practice and
it for beginners is not usually very
good but after some practices you should
get the book of the the kind of the
author author it ativ book for any
languages who should get any category
enriched for Xion stroke group for c++
and read read those guys I think it's
the best guide for I think an
implementation is something way
okay so with that let's thank the
speaker
and one one quick thing before you go we
have a few more curry on t-shirts if you
guys want one I think I've got a few
men's mediums few men's smalls and a
couple of sizes left for women so if
you'd like those meet me at the
registration desk and I will I will hand
out the rest that we got with that thank
you very much for coming and I hope to
see you guys next year in Barcelona I'm
sorry in Amsterdam
you
