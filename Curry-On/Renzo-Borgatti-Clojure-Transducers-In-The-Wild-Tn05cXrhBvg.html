little bit of a logistic I also
struggled to find the entrance so that
some more people are coming as well so
very good we can start thank you
so transduce is a funky name it has I
think at the core they are a simple
abstraction and we're going to see this
abstraction and going through that a
little bit about me I'm developer au
switch is a company in the UK based in
the UK I'm writing a book in my copy of
spare time it's guided to the closure
standard library it's kind of a
monumental book is going to be thousand
pages eventually are going to be going
to arrive at the end of that there's a
discount code if you are interested in
that kind of things
I'm also author of screencasts those are
on YouTube if you if you type if you
search for closure pills you find the
closure pills are very nice 20 minutes
pills about one function of the standard
library and they're teaching you about
closure in the process
I'm co-organizer of the paper we love
meetup in London and if you have any
questions you want to get in touch of
this this conference I'm very happy to
listen to you that's my email account
and also at reborg is my twitter handle
okay so transduces they are a
fundamental abstraction of a functional
abstraction like maybe similar to
patterns in object orientation they
decompose sequential processing and they
recompose it so that is modular and
independent it's inspired by the
universality of fall there's a paper
about that and there are there are the
links at the end in the fact that with
fold you can express many of the
sequential sequence processing operation
it was introduced a while ago enclosure
I think it's mildly underused and I
think it might deserve more attention
that's why I'm bringing it to you today
to have a look it's also because it's
available in many other languages and
I'm going to talk about a few of the
tricks and experience with trans uses on
production application
I had in my projects so compared to like
passing a lambda to a map operation or
on top of a collection that you want to
process there are more composable that
can compose with comp instead enclosure
you'll be your force so to speak with a
threaded operator which is a macro to
compose them up for this reason they are
also more reusable you can adapt them to
different transporters so you can use
them in the collection that the standard
library and giving is giving you but you
can also use them in other on other
things it's also faster because it
removes the intermediate sequencing and
it's also easily parallelizable and
we're going to see all this today so why
are we even talking about this if it's
so great because there is this common
thing in thinking that in my you might
need them ollie
in certain particular cases instead I
think they're more Universal and people
are already used because the enter
closure is so late the people already
used at with like a sequential
processing the the standard traditional
way so they are more reluctant to change
to jump or something different there is
something else enclosure called reduces
which as a name which similar to
transduces so it remembers something
that is instead specific so people are
maybe confused and they're introduced
late so let's go through an exercise now
think I might have jumped this one first
to try to find these four aspects in
sequential processing we go through map
and filter which are easy functions to
define and to see and we try to see
where those aspects are and if we can
extract them apart and build something
different with them so but we're going
to see access to a specific data type
and enclosure its first or rest on a
list for example we we see the
accumulation of the results for example
with operation like cones cones Plaza
feature reduce a recursion Megan
because this function are recurring in
one way or another they can do it
implicitly with the stack with an
implicit stack or explicitly in an
iterative way and the answers the
essence of a operation so if you're
mapping we want to increment into number
again a collection Inc is the essence of
what we are doing so let's grab one
example I hope you can all see over
there I thought it was big enough that
is not so in this map we can say in this
map operation which is taking a function
in the collection and that is the
implementation of map those are circled
in orange are the type specific
interface so it's using some kind of API
and that API is dependent on the
collection so the collection needs to
know how do you give me the first
element how do you give me the rest of
your elements or when the collection is
empty I'm saying it's equals to the
empty list for example and that is
specific you cannot use that with
another data type then we have the
building output part that's cons there
which is taking the map of F on the rest
of the collection and is attaching that
to implementing the operation F in this
case to the first element in the
collection that is building the output
increasingly building L then we have the
recursion mechanism we have an exit
condition when it's not that recur if
it's that don't recur because if not
we're going in infinite loop and of
course we are invoking our self map is
invoking map again so it's a very simple
case of recursion but it is fine for the
example and finally the transformation
so there is where if we say we want
increment each number in the collection
that F is going to be an increment
operator and F is apply so these are the
four aspects let's do the same exercise
again on filter slightly faster try to
see if you can see those four aspects
yourself so type abstraction where a is
the type abstraction here we still have
again first rest and not equal to an
empty list similarly we are building
again the output with cons
we have same recursion mechanism when
some exit condition is met stop the
recursion if not recur and filter
calling again and now the only thing
that is really different is the mechanic
of filtering which is if some predicate
is true then let this item through the
results if it's not don't let it through
the results so this is what really
changing between map revealed and then
we can go and you don't need to
understand this but just to show you
that if we had to implement the same
mechanism as we have to for other
transports which are not collections
like lists or vectors this is for
example a channel crossing which is a
concurrency mechanism closure you want
to do same similar things you want to
map or filter elements going through a
channel or coming out the channel and so
you'll have to kind of reimagine how
would you do that on top of a different
transport and here we are again so you
need to understand this but I'm going to
tell you that is the data type interface
extra things from an input channel
sending down to an output channel
checking if the channel is closed and so
on mapping map is the top filter is
about is below and again this is
building the output when we send things
in the output Channel this is the
recursion mechanism is slightly
different than before
there is this go loop macro and there is
the recur but is similar is doing like
do it again until there are elements in
the channel and finally these are the
essence of the different transformation
we have a transformation at the top and
we have filtering operation at the
bottom and you can see they are the same
but they are kind of decorated with a
lot of things around them which is
different than before final exercise
there is another library enclosure
called closure rx which is implementing
observable reactive programming and they
have sort of similar two channels the
code they're called observables and you
observe a stream of events coming
through and you want to do similar
things to this stream like you do to the
channel logic to the collection you want
to Maps stuff you want to filter stuff
and many other operations once again
datatype subscriber or next building the
output doing with this lift thing not
sure 100% how it works because I'm just
an user of this library and recursion
mechanism is creating this operator that
is then given to the lift operation and
once again and is the same as before
transformation for map and filtering for
filter they are the same operation just
all the surrounding has changed so what
happens is that there are not just map
it filter there are all sort of possible
sequential operations the more you have
usually the more you are expressive in
your language so your language may have
many more member or different ones
enclosure there are some of these and
there are more than that so if you
imagine to implement this on top of H
each different transport every time what
we get is a community oral explosion of
some sort right there are too many
aspects conflated in map or filter we
need to do this again and again and
decorate with different code what if you
wanted the same transport so sort the
same operation on different transports
which what we want to achieve so
essentially what I'm asking is how can I
extract the essence the transformation
or the filtering from those operations
so I can reuse them in other context and
this is what we are going to now in a
few with like simple refactoring
operation and we what I think is the
discovery in this case is the reduce
operation so reduce operation is
essentially a pattern for recursion it
is a recurring operation it is iterative
because the results are built and passed
through the arguments so you can see
that is reducing is calling itself it's
passing the function that it received
and it's also passing the results so
it's
accumulating them and is passing them on
the parameters so it's a different kind
of recursion but is a recursion and it
works reasonably like that's an example
you want to sum up all the element from
0 to 9 it is 45 we pass the plus
operator which is the reduction
reduction function so the discovery is
that when you start to build the results
or to build those operation on top of
reduce you can extract the essence of
operation let's see how it is done and
all right so this is map the same
operation as before but built on top of
reduce let's visualize what are the
operations that we discovered before
when we were looking at before so the
essence now is in the color of that
function because we need to pass it in
the function so it came down and map is
about there building the output also
came down into the color of the function
because the way reduced words and the
data specific types are still inside the
mapping function the what we call map
there which is reducing function and if
we look at filter we see the same things
we can rebuild filter on top of reduce
and when we do that the function that we
need to pass the color we create this
function needs to pass the function to
the filter operation now embeds the
essence of the ready the essence of the
filtering so in this case is a condition
if the predicate is true then move on
same for building the output cons and
the vector
building on top of reduce but I don't
see any cause to reduce no so yeah next
slide shoot down so the two functions
the one that we called map and filter
and I said they are built on top of it
use our reduce so I just change their
name they are the same if you have
allowed them the only thing that is
changing is mapping filter if you
replace that with reduce that is reduce
so we are just using reduced to build
them you can if you put reducing on that
it's going to be reduced is it
it is a reduce operation this is reduce
that is reducing with F DC function and
that is f5 to the result and the
accumulated result so far and the first
element of the collection and up boom
zone so that is is reduce enclosure
lives so as I said the color is now
embedding those two walking what is
still missing so if you look at that we
are still embedding the essence of the
operation there we want that to be
generic so today is an increment
tomorrow is a decrement it could be
something else or or the predicate is
odd it's just an example that should be
really an F so and the other thing is
the the accumulation of the output is
specific to sequential collection is a
conch also that is specific I want to
extract that out because if I remove
those two things what I what I have in
my hands is just the essence of mapping
or reduce so let's see how we can do
that we just wrap it in a anonymous
lambda sorry yeah it's an anonymous
lambda we wrap it and then we call the
lambda the way we did before
so we extract in this case we are
extracting the with the output
accumulation we call it our F is a
reducing function
and now that appears here as a grinder
and this is returning a function of
results and of an accumulation and the
next element that is the reducing
function that we had before and just
wrapped it with analyzed anonymous
functions around and we can do the same
for the other piece that is specific
which is the transforming operation or
the predicate or any other kind of
operations that you're doing and we do
the same operation again we wrap yet
another lambda function this time the
lambda function we have till then this
is the reducing function of emulator and
element this is extracting reducing
function which was the conch and this
one is taking the predicate or F there
was instead before was embedded inside
so we have two constructors for our
mapping function and the filtering
function final step we are done so with
that with those two definitions we place
them in reduce and we can use it as
before so we have a mapping increment on
range of 10 and the filter odd on range
of 10 and they work exactly as before so
what's the difference
we let me show you something before you
so the difference is that now the
essence of the operation is a parameter
which possibly outside
whereas the accumulation of yarn so we
near these two things extracted out you
can use them in different transports now
we're going to see a few examples when
you do that kind of abstractions you can
start doing these kind of things so this
is a very long chain of those
transducing functions so they are a
similar to map and filter there and they
are the top not even and there are all
bunch of them that are doing that kind
of thing
since they have the same contract so
they are reducing function they all take
an accumulation and an element it means
that they can be composed with comm so
it's just functional composition each
one of them is returning a function of
two arguments you can compose them all
so that whole chain of comp is doing all
those things but that is quite long
maybe not very reusable or difficult to
understand but now that you have comp
you can just take it apart so that is
essentially enabling you in your program
to have very long pipeline data pipeline
processing pipelines and you don't need
to think about how how do i decompose
them because they are too long I don't
understand they aren't difficult to
debug if you have comp to do these
things you just tear them apart so that
is the same chain we saw before
I'm just taking like four functions each
block give them a name still using calm
and well it just contains two
compositions so you can apply comp on
top of combo comp as many time as you
want and then you can split these things
apart so they are different concerns you
can test them test them separately in
isolation it would be difficult to do it
with like traditional sequence
processing based on macros the threaded
operator this is the the concurrency
concurrency facility course ink that we
we saw at the beginning and uh now that
you extracted the essence or sorry
extracted the accumulation of the output
you can use the same old ex form so
again compositional filter or mapping
just as an example and you can attach it
to completely different transporters as
you can see our you need to understand
what this doing but that channel that
I'm creating there anytime is receiving
an event or an item is going to apply to
the transducer chain to that like if it
was a sequence or a collection another
thing that it was helpful was to use
this composition to introduce the
bargain in tracing so if you have a long
chain of a non-traditional sequence your
resort to like do manual editing of that
chain to introduce print line or maybe
stop the programming at some point so
you can see what's going on in a certain
stage of the pipeline but if you have
the composition through comb you can
just assemble that in a different way so
just want to talk about this before so
this is the xform back before the only
thing I change is i suspended the use of
comb so it's just a list of those
reducing functions comp will be applied
later on so now that I have this power
is I can just treat it as data
essentially and what that dvg X form is
doing is a transducer itself it's just
not one of the core ones is one a custom
transducers and that he can be
interleaved into this list so when each
item passes through the pipeline I can
trace it and that is happening with a
wrapper that I show
there where that TV GX form is
interleaved to the exact spot but I
think what is important to know is when
I money I can see what's going on and I
was able to assemble that at at runtime
it wasn't like statically encode in any
way so I could I can do that based on a
parameter that is coming in the program
if the bag is on I can start tracing
things through the data pipeline now
going parallel about talking about
parallelizable things since the the
there is a facility in Java that closure
can use is called fork/join is part of
the JDK and this facility can be seen as
another yet another kind of transport so
when you give it a vector this facility
is able to chunk it up into pieces send
in two different cores two different
threads depending what you have and then
assemble it back together so if we agree
that there is a different kind of
transport and we want to go parallel
with our transducer that we saw before
that chain of many things we can just
apply it to the new transport and how do
we do that
we do that with something else that is
again inside the code the closure
standard library is called fold this
part of is enabling this fork/join
mechanism and my ex form the usual all
that form is here in a client I can
apply here by just passing what should
be like the accumulation function in
this case is a conch videos
v.24 exactly
is passing through here and it's coming
down there and when I do that that
becomes a reducing function and this
fall will take care of chunk of chunk
the collection up into pieces of 5 512
by default and just making it explicit
pieces sending them in parallel do the
computation each transducer chain is
going to execute on a single call the
results is going to be combined back
with vector now I think the takeaway is
that this X alone is yet again the same
thing and I'm using it in different
contexts said that is so a final remark
about speed so I said also that they are
faster because they don't produce
intermediate collections and this is
what I call the traditional sequential
processing which is changing the map so
they look very like the same but you see
there is a arrow operator of the top
that is doing the the concatenation so
when you do that each each one of those
operation will go through the data and
then pass the transform data to the next
that would go again through the data and
so on and so forth so each of those
lines is a pass through the sequence in
its entirety what induces does they work
differently they compose all the
operation into a single bit composition
that is doing all at once to a single
element so the sequences can only once
and for that reason this is a very
simple example with no data essentially
just 20 elements also and it's roughly
50% faster so the more your transducing
the more your data pipeline is doing the
more advantages that are in making it
parallel and since you don't need any
library to do that just like need to
require a couple things
you can do it quite easily it's really
available so that is powering one of the
parts of our website is there are there
are these feeds of 10,000 mortgages and
these mortgages are huge maps with a lot
of keys and a lot of values of them and
they need to be processed there are at
least 10 filters sound financial math
calculation need to happen they are
quite intensive by doing all that
through transducers and going parallel
we went from roughly more than 10
seconds they request down below 2
seconds and those are like conservative
estimates in the sense that is an
average but I think is is faster if you
measure it not of a web level but at the
transition chain level I think that's
all so these are a few a few links so I
appreciate that I mean you might not be
used to closure and a figure of the
technology I mentioned so I hope you
could still grasp a little bit of what I
said those links will help you out the
the two presentation by Ricci key
buttons uses are a gentle introduction
that I recommend the two papers I'm
mentioning there are more rigorous and
they are essentially responsible for the
introduction of transducers sorry they
are responsible for the concepts inside
transducers that were introduced
enclosure finally there are a few
interesting projects that are like
expanding on those ideas xforms at the
top is collecting a few of those trans
uses some that are not yet in the
standard library or maybe perhaps will
never be the reactive extensions I
mentioned transistors in other languages
so after they were announced many people
where
at least curious about understanding
what they are and they went on and
translating them in their own language
and it turns out it's possible to do it
in many languages and I'm mentioning
three of them and there are others so
they were also done in Haskell as usual
I think when you mutate an abstraction
from one paradigm to another you learn a
lot in the process most of the time the
obstruction in the new parting is not as
powerful as the originating party so my
guess is that Haskell transducers are
not that used because there are other
instructions that are matching much
better for us that's why I guess that
was all a freeze anything any any
question I'm happy to answer now later
on at the party did he close it together
so can you tell us anything about the
type of matte pink but it's not is a new
source of that it's not over this visits
collection dependent yeah you don't know
I've no idea but just a function right
so yeah arguments
he's a tag like something I don't even
know how many argument to take that I
missed it up yeah well they are very
addict right so there are like answer so
these transitions they're all they're
all the same
yes yeah exactly so I mean what I can
tell you is the kind of function they're
returning which is what make compose to
work properly
yes is the is the signature of reduce of
or fold is a function of an accumulation
you don't know the type of that
accumulation it could be anything
and so the accumulation is a list so a
function of a list and an element which
is instead as color
at least tech least not as a specific
yet don't take list as a specific list
not at least list I should talk about
collections in general so it's a it's a
function of a collection and an item and
the only thing you know is how to use
them like is a reducing function so the
function you use to accumulate needs to
obey this rule so it will take two
arguments and you are supposed but
nothing is forcing you in any contract
you are supposed to take the
accumulation that the item do some
transforming operation on the item and
put it back in the in the accumulation
it might in my work I mean the compiler
cannot tell you anything about what's
going on in there if you if you send it
down garbage you will receive backyard
reject some sort in this list of
transduces sake
is about yeah so when you say trans you
say you say like the value those things
the result of the evaluation of this
yeah yeah yeah yeah that's because
they're all the things that is yeah that
is returning that is returning a
function of two arguments it's the
collection and the item
yeah I mean it took me a while it's
three years in right and I'm talking
about you today it took me a while to
use them I just wanted to show you when
we did that abstraction right when we we
do matter that air F what is returning
is a function of two things
I hope I hope it's clear we said that
ink is all right yes oh well I'm sorry
no religion we need to know that we did
another step after that Marty is that oh
ok also takes three arguments are these
confusion or my when you call math of F
that is affirming an act of 100 so this
is what you tell us which to bore so the
different condition there is on top of a
fraction of one and then the reducing
function is applied at the college for
the premises
anymore
well so there are there are a few things
to consider regarding like a big data
you cannot load terabytes of data
through a transducer chain like I'm
doing apparently here so you need to you
have a few a few things you can do
depending on the kind of computation you
have to do if you go parallel that
chunking is helping in splitting a
bigger collection into multiple pieces
over a certain size I think though
you'll have problems unless you have
thousands of course but I think at that
point you're scaling the wrong way
you should probably scale recently with
more machines and not trying to scale on
CPU cores because but on I mean there
are just some finite number of them and
usually it's not huge at this point even
if you have 1,000 if you have terabytes
of data you cannot I mean I wouldn't
suggest to go with a transducer chain
and split it in parallel over the
multiple cores anyway because it might
still be too big to do but at least at
that point the what you can do is to
delegate at the transducer level the
loading of the chunk of data so you can
decide on big it to champions so maybe
if you cannot do it in the first pass
you can do another pass after that and
like apply that user in the loop on
until you're done essentially so yeah
that's that will be a limit yes please
wasn't power too
there is
yeah we kind of like at the same level
so we we all look at new technologies as
they come out and we experiment with
them so there was no real step of
introduction people are sort of expected
to know that there is this new feature
if you don't know it you ask and then
we'll probably go through something like
this if you really want to understand
how it works the inner side the inner
part of it I will probably do something
similar to this because I think as
refactoring steps are quite easy to to
do the final result is still some
learning curve if you don't know the
concepts but still is functional
composition and a couple of lambdas on
top of each other
yes yeah it is it is connected to yeah
you won't be able to use it from the
outside so if you pass ampersand
Tracy go through to the to the website
it will trace and you need to you can
trace one like ID at a time at least
this is what we need then you can do
what you want
all right what's next I think it's the
break okay so I was on time again no
well then unless there are other
questions I'm done thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
