you today about fronting programming
essentially making user interfaces using
programming and I'm gonna I thought I
start right at the very basics and I was
the question how do you actually build
the user interface and in almost all
cases it's just a matter of an event
loop and a tree structure or components
so you have the tree and you have the
loop around the tree man this has been
going on since essentially forever since
the very very first graphical user
interfaces I used to program on this
thing I I think we didn't have tree
structures yet I think this was
essentially just a list of the
components to be rendered and there was
no rave concept of stacking exceptions i
win days ah we moved on a bit they this
is the moon wooden and more traditional
a desktop oriented user interface
library called cute and it's designer
tool you can see the tree structure now
you got like the window on top when you
got my various boxes to compose sub
components and then eventually you got a
couple of buttons at the bottom and this
isn't really what most of us tempted to
do you for user interfaces nowadays so
because we got this thing called the
internet so we are seeing maced
applications that we use nowadays I'm
sort of migrated into the browser mostly
we use them to phone pictures of little
cats with a tongues out preferably I
like them that way but you know there
are different applications to like
applications that enable us to shout at
each other and we get mad but
the thing that these applications that
can post out of its called a document
object model now I struggle a bit to
find an appropriate illustration for the
dolmen how I feel about it fortunately
the auto hieronymus bosch finally
delivered the dome well I'm going to be
polite to say it's an interesting thing
it's a very very very object oriented it
came about in India essentially the
Golden Age of Java in the mid-90s and in
fact the language that it it was sort of
written to be used by it's called
JavaScript because it's not it's not
really got anything to do with Java it
was just that when it was developed at
miss gay java was very cool and escape
was hoping to make a deal with sun about
java SE they decided we've got to call
this javascript so people think it's
related and and the simplex much change
is sort of look to adopt the the sea
tradition and the current state of the
driver syntax and it's really a mess of
mutable state it said it's very much
adopted drivers ID of object orientation
so you got every component and cups
release his own state that state is very
much up in the air what it is at any
given time and well we would very much
like to do u UI development in the
functional style and that doesn't really
translate well the dome is i would i
would venture to say it's largely
incompatible with making in a
traditional functional style because the
ideal of functional programming is that
you all your code should be pure now
will actually accomplish this normally
because it will occur this pure it has
no side effects inside
heat some of injuries like likes to say
you know we get pragmatic but we want to
ensure that as much of what good as
possible as possible it's actually a
pure and has no sign of fact so we can
reason about it and look more easily and
karishma nicholas mutable state is
rather the opposite of that you spend
all your time changing the state of Dom
object then you're not being very pure
which is why we have been exploring ways
to mitigate this we have this thing now
called react which facebook launched a
couple years ago now this is this
illustration is i think another sort of
react and reacts introduces the virtual
Dom the idea of the virtual dome is that
we create a data structure in our
functional programs which is completely
immutable and when we're done doing this
and in our event elite we just pass it
on to react and react us all the if a
bit some of sinking that text structure
up with the actual dome so that we can
manipulate data structures so it so that
we can manipulate the Dom pretending
that is actually an immutable properly
pure data structure it isolates mutation
essentially to the rendering faith so
that's everything in between your your
input events and your actual output to
the dome can be theoretically pure
function programming except that it
doesn't really react is cool and all but
it still uses JavaScript neutral data
structures it's still mutate state
inside components it's looked clean and
other than it used to be but it's still
not quite that so yeah what I just said
it's still neatly managed but still not
quite why we want to be functionally so
that was this fellow called David Nolan
who had this idea that what if were to
react
and we sort of took out the mutable bits
and replace them with closures immutable
data structure and intentionally
closures way of thinking of that writing
application a closure script in
particular of course so um is the
framework that I came up with own
doesn't have a logo cited the liberty of
making one for them I hope they
appreciate it essentially oh is reacts
where the closure philosophy applied so
that means we got all immutable data
structures a guarantee of having just a
meet up with a shoe shops data
structures because they use the
enclosures for its leverage for them and
enclosure strictly how to actually
struggle a bit too these javascripts
normal immutable structures it's not
entirely pure but aspen closure itself
it provides a sense of left foot it's
idiomatic that you write pure code and
until you can't anymore and then at the
very least you mark your functions with
a bang at the end saying this function
will have side effects please don't use
it unless you really mean it so yeah
I went to say a bit more about omen
closure script actually before I move on
to the next thing it has some
interesting features i didn't think i'm
going to have time to talk about them so
i took the slides out but it just things
like curses which help compose
subcomponents because it's a sort of
like lenses not entirely but it remains
a closure application essentially and
with closure you do sort of mutate state
at some point sort of a clean an
immutable normally but you usually end
up having your application state hidden
away in Assam and that is sort of global
mutable states yeah i mean just gonna be
12 elm m is interesting though we're
getting somewhere I think um is I said
it an elegant you are specialized
haskell kassam it looks look like a
skull except if you take all the the
messy part or Haskell out and all the
all the complicated bits essentially
like the the M word and whatnot and
you're left with this very very clean
language that one thing it's very easy
to learn it's very easy to teach and
that's been a design go Lavelle and
there's no unnecessary category theory I
couldn't point a data suggesting this
but I have a feeling that you can take a
JavaScript developer and and sit them
down and show the madman with within a
couple of days they're going to be
completely productive in a language that
is considerably safer to ease than
JavaScript given you have a type system
is not quite as advanced as Haskell's
but it's definitely crazy
and you have unforced purity there are
almost no side effects in our and in
your own programs at least of course
they have to be side effect it's a very
nice language and I'd like to discuss
the the application architecture that is
normally using a bullet for a little bit
essentially it's start up with a model
which models your data your application
state we got some events which can
affect that state and you got an update
for function to process those and you've
got a view what right at the end which
essentially takes the model and turns it
into an HTML document and and renders it
on screen using the same principles as
react the HTML type that you can see at
the bottom there is represents a nation
and document in a virtual dome style
data structure and an would just take
care of that for you but it's in the
actual Dom fetch events out of the dome
and put them back in into your system um
this is based on Fox reactive
programming or at least functional
reactive programming is the thing that
was formulated by microsomal day at
microsoft research in 97 of their house
and we had a lot of iterations on the
idea but functional reactive programming
as a term I don't think we're allowed to
use that and anything except the
original implementation and in any case
at least I think because nobody can
quite agree on the definition here
that's m's implementation is probably
the closest to FL PS you can get using
javascript but mrs. it gets only like
ninety-nine percent that in any case l
is at least very close to the original
intention
and it looks sort of like this
essentially have a signal type and the
signal is a value that changes over time
so it has an initial value and then at
certain points it will change that value
and you can you can react to that when
it happens so you have things like most
position which is the signal which
contains of the coordinate path you have
mouse buttons which are just boolean
saying whether they are clicked or not
you can have a time signal which just
count upwards at regular intervals and
so on and usually you know your input
signals will be responses from from the
user to your application and it can take
the signals you can you can map of them
treat them like punk tests you can fold
over them the fold p here is slightly
interesting it looks exactly like a
phone they accept it yields intermediate
results so it doesn't it's not a cat a
morphism it doesn't compress everything
into single resulted yields intermediate
results so you can use its autumn you
can use it to manage your application
state essentially you start with an
initial state and then you feed the
events into your fold and it updates the
state for you and yielding intermediate
states so an application will look
something like this it's rave just a
signal of HTML documents and you have a
model which is a signal which contains
the immortal and you have a view
function which takes a model and turns
the model into an HTML document when it
when it changes and then you have a sort
of tie the loop with actions and you
have a signal mailbox and signal
risk things that which I'm looking for
the with the details of this but
essentially you can from inside the or
HTML document you can feed actions back
into the main loop so you start over
again and these actions will alter your
model potentially and we go around and
it's a very very nice and clean model
it's like just just a a pipeline
essentially that is expressed by very
few functions so I drew your diagram
just to recap you have the dome which is
something you don't want to deal with
and which adam asks very neatly for you
so don't can generate actions actions
will affect your model when your model
changes it will it will affect you and
when the real change is it gets fed back
into the dollar and that's your
application essentially that's your user
interface at lease the problem here is
composition it gets a bit boilerplate e1
you want to make subcomponents out of
this because you will want to have
reusable components you can't just put
everything in your entire application
which can get quite big into just just
one update function and one render
function you want to reuse them you want
to have like bottom components and so on
that you can just put him anywhere but
tying the knot there is it gets more
complicated definitely not but it gets a
bit boilerplate because you have to make
sure that you look at your handle
passing all the events down to the
subcomponents getting them back putting
them where they're supposed to be and so
on
it's it's not entirely as neat as I'd
like it to be but research is ongoing of
course and I expect by the next version
alone and that's going to be a nag a
perfect solution right now absolutely
some boilerplate which is unfortunate
now I'd like to talk about pure script
hath go strip is a better Haskell than
Haskell I'd like to say it's a very very
birth date Minh my argument here is that
it's sort of learned from the mistakes
of Haskell and and has started out with
a clean slate and avoiding them were
obvious things like it goes actually
hospitai think you did that that funk
tomo nothing wrong there should be an
applicative in there somewhere and so
it's just has grown so big now the thing
they hope to avoid but it's hard to
change things they still do it
fortunately but with a thing like your
trip which has I think probably it's got
a hundred years I'd be surprised it's a
lot easier to break things i'm gonna do
it all the time we just had a release a
couple of days ago which broke literally
everything i'm using the previous
version for this presentation or I
wouldn't be able to do it a case of our
types even more than Haskell dos that's
the birth segment 2 i'd like to say at
least of cares a lot more about types
and anders elm aims to be simple and
understandable for mortals whereas pure
strip lights to go all out from the
category theory and and five line type
signatures no that's just because at
least it ensures absolute correctness
doesn't it or at least like we like to
think so
what I'm going to be doing for the rest
of this talk is show you a pure syrup
halogen which is the UI library that is
sort of heading towards dominance in
impure script it's based essentially on
the same principles as album exactly
goes somewhat further the application in
at looks essentially like this it's a
signal that each station with documents
whereas we would like to enrich that
with an event type so that we can
essentially ensure that we know what
sort of it what sort of events would
come out of the HTML document further we
take that and we actually split it up
into a signal of input events to a
signal of outputs in this case the event
type is similar which is what your
normal is the at the top level taking
that a step further we can actually
generate this a bit as but this is a
sort of a signal function a function
that will take one signal and use
another essentially mapping on it and
record that as a signal function it
takes an input events and a document
yielding up returns the implementation
of signal functions looks like this in
practice you won't see them die work
diverged much in functionality from from
am signals when you use folds but but
they essentially are you can do always
anything with this the sort of finite
state machines but infinite state
machines you can change the behavior of
the signal and midstream
social but it remains the single
function from input to output and what's
exciting about that it's these actually
formed pro functors to which means that
ideally you can do a lot of interesting
things in the way a composition between
components and sub components given that
they're Propontis you can you can use
you can sort of die map from from the
super component to the sub component and
back at least that's a real it what you
end up doing for the most part is you
just do exactly like a now the stateful
function is essentially the full p from
Al and it takes an initial state it
takes a full function which processes
your inputs and it generates a signal
function of outputs other state just one
more thing I would like to do to this
before i'm quite satisfied i'm going to
introduce the m into this type
essentially we put the em right before
the output event there because obviously
everything is better with a minute of it
so the reason we put a monad rights
right there at the end is because you
might want actions to cause a
synchronous actions so you can have
something like an IO monad to go and
fetch something and produce an action
after that
and that Eve's something that we can
start building applications with we got
a we take these signal funders and we
make a component out of them a component
Oh clarifies this we we still have the
am as we got at the am and you got a
request and a result which is
essentially the input type and the upper
type so it were clarifying that the end
burden the epitopes can be separate and
will be with some components so that
leads to the question how do i can pay
his components look at the puppy puppies
adorable pup is playing in the snow
think about the question the problem is
it turns out that even though the ideas
behind these white were very ambitious
the current implementation actually
doesn't improve on Alma tallest so it
gets very complicated you get to use Pro
factors which makes it feel slightly
smarter but that's about it still gets
very messy and I'm in promise actually I
was really hoping to be able to show you
how this would work today which I've
been promised it's going to be ready by
next week wealthy I am at least going to
show you how to write an application
I've got having actually got 20 minutes
left wow I didn't expect that I'm gonna
have ample time to write this then
because they're going to switch to some
live coding an amicus right watching me
talk it is rather boring I'm sure
i'm going to write an application for
you using halogen so you can see social
how it works in practice because i can
talk about categories here all day but
it doesn't really match to the real
world unless you see it i think so a map
location in halogenation looks like this
the main function just runs one
components or should call you I and the
run you I function takes this component
and initializes it starts off sick going
and it returns the need the dominate
that it's going to be rendered in and a
driver function the driver function
allows you to feed events in externally
but we're not going to be using that
bonobo we essentially just take take
that and put it inside the HTML document
so let's get coding there is quite a
number of imports which I've written for
you already you don't want to watch me
type this out I got the offender body
function which just tasted I'm dominated
and puts it in the HTML document and
then I've written a very basic
boilerplate up here which this renders a
document has no state I'm just defining
an ADA to here to contain the state and
alert is it has none and I've defining
another agency here see to contain our
events right now we just have the new
payment which we don't care about and
this is the UI component it essentially
takes a stateful signal with an initial
stage of the mdl estate and maps it over
the update function and maps all that
over the render function so the update
function does nothing currently just
returns the state as a pastor Tim
doesn't care about the event and the
render function just upwards this
document here in the sort of the earth
out for four
your mouth so what this one means is
this is a div element with the
underscore it says it won't take any
arguments it won't take any issue well
arguments without the underscore as an
image here we can pass a list of
arguments otherwise we just put a list
of children in this case we have
arguments and children but there are
none so this should get us started see
if this called pious takes a couple of
seconds just a little type checking and
lots of dependencies there we go so
we've got this framework to build on I
hope you like ponies by the way because
we're going to been doing a few of them
so I'd like to just write a very simple
application which lets you make a list
of ponies list of your favorite Paley's
presumably so to start off I'm going to
take away this very obvious statement
here and replace it with a list the UL
of taking the render pony function and
mapping it over a list of ponies now we
need to actually get our types in order
before before you go that far so we're
going to start up with the most crucial
thing we make a pony type it'll just be
a string which will contain the name of
the penny and for our state now we want
a list of ponies and we have to add this
to
youth hostels lovely style of indenting
let's hear so let's start off with
Applejack
Fluttershy
if you've got a favorite pony I'm gonna
consider adding rarity just start off
with the ponies for the only one one
word in their names so we need to
actually now get the list of ponies
outer last eight in our under function
and
and we need to run the penny function
take the pony and returns hmm
takes the pony p and returns a list and
this item of the text inside the pony so
I wonder if that's enough you're all
conversant in Haskell yes and did you
see me make any mistakes because if I do
I am absolutely blaming you see fingers
crossed now it worked there's our list
yay now I'd like to add some more ponies
interactively so going to need to enrich
my state a little bit I want an input
field essentially and the application
needs to track the contents of the input
field so I'm going to add one more thing
to our state I'm going to add just one
painting which is going to be just the
string that represents what you've typed
so far and we're going to need to add
some events first of all you know so the
way I'm going to make this work now is
I'm going to have just a new pony event
which does not contain the name of the
penny because we're going to make this
as a fool and the input field inside the
form is going to be tracked in pony and
when it changes we want to fire uncle'
updated which contains the pony which
goes into our state and when you then
find new pony by submitting to the form
we don't have any easy way to access the
input of it so we're going to have to
rely on what our state claims it to be
so new pony will take this pony and put
it inside the list of ponies first then
let us add the form
and we're going to add an event handler
for that you can submit properties good
for that it's going to be a function to
get an event then care about the event
but we're going to prevent default on it
so it doesn't actually reload the page
because we don't have any database
backing here so if we just reload the
page all up in is they're going to
vanish and after that we're going to
learn the new pony event ok and inside
the forum we're going to have an input
which is going to be of type type
underscore text
and value of entry which I need to get
out of our state country this is the
pony at the end and on value changed
changed changed kodama there we go okay
whenever the value changes inside the
input we are going to yield an input
events and this input property takes a
function which will get the new value as
an argument and that function is just
going to be our type instructor for
entry updated so that's going to
generate an entry objective in event
which contains what you've typed
currently let me just see bank balance
all these horrible things and no
children and there we go alright say I
think we're good up here oh no we also
need to add that extra pain into our
initial state is just just going to
start off as an empty string because
your own / feel is going to be empty at
first sleep that component
I'm assured that the the next the newest
release of the compiler is a look faster
and so I can type say Rainbow Dash and
nothing happens actually something does
happen all my events get fired but I
don't respond to them in the update
function so when I who tend to hear I
will get an an update of the UI but the
the entry fields in our state hasn't
been updated so just returns to the
empty string we should think the days so
we're going to need to add some events
here so let's get princess of this one
this update function takes the state the
current state and the event of a process
so I pattern match and get the ponies
out of the state where I'm going to
process entry updated which provides a
new value for the increase that I'm not
going to I don't care about what watered
currently is and I return a new state
which contains our ponies and the new
entry and then I want to add new ponies
so I'm going to handle the new pony
event in this case we want the ponies
and we want the current state of the
entry books and new pony
equals let's state of I'm going to give
them sorted you're very clean about that
and then I just take the current pony
and cons it on to the rest of the
pennies and what should I make the state
of the the input box here empty string
because now I'm done entering I want to
reset it so I can answer more pennies
because it can never have enough pennies
let's see if that works
okay Rainbow Dash cool Twilight Sparkle
very cool and Pinkie Pie oops i mistyped
it so I'd like to be able to delete that
and and adds it properly for let's see
if we can do that just going to add one
more event that's cool it we move pony
and the name of the pony to be removed
and then going to add to the render pony
function actually because I would I want
a button next to each pony that I can
click to delete it so I'm going to add a
button and the weapon is going to have
an onclick handler
which generates an impediment remove
pony of the current p and it's gonna
have text annette and i'm going to get
really fancy i actually discovered while
writing this talk that pure scripts
string type string literal doesn't
handle unicode and i want to know the
unicode cross that i'm going to get
really fancy corrected from character
code and ten thousand seven ok so let's
see if that works a lot
yes we have a button doesn't do anything
yet though I have to update the update
function so list state oh nice entry
remove pony pony i'm only getting down
tree out here now because i want to
preserve it on the canoes it the pony
that comes in through the event is the
one I want to delete and I just go
delete pony ponies the letus term is a
function in the array library which
takes pony out of the piggies array and
the current country so now I can go
hopefully if this compliance can start
deleting things so Rainbow Dash try
sparkle pinky mistyped pie then I can
delete pinky your wife and I can type it
in properly and make it by
right that was the whole application you
might want to plug in a database and all
that to make sure you that makes any
ponies aight outlier here listen at the
end a nice boy well that was that was
halogen ladies and gentlemen and some
nice penis at the end of the day that's
my favorite player thank thank you very
much happily we can do some questions if
you have some if you can um when you map
the model to the Dom are you my writing
and understanding you are replacing the
whole Dom object with an entirely new
one and it's so if so there's that
expensive that would be insane yeah
because there's nothing I think in the
history of programming that is quite as
Louis as modifying the Dom so what's
happening that this was reacts race
innovation it does a diff from what it
currently is and what it's expected to
be or rather what it used to be
previously for performance reason and
what it's what needs to be so it will
generate that the difficult will
generate a minimal set of changes needed
to take the dog from his current state
to the state you wanted to be in which
is remarkably more efficient actually
usually more efficient than writing it
by hand so that's what's going on that
do you think dependent types or some
light form of dependent types could help
with the composition or the modularity I
haven't actually given that much thought
I would assume that because obviously
dependent types can do absolutely
anything better SAS there might be
something that now the problem is that
pierce who doesn't have dependent types
neither does album and I would suspect
that and really doesn't want to have
them but for example Haskell has the
Thai promotion and I saw say for a sort
of extensible butter matching that or
typesafe extensible pattern matching
they use that I'm sure there's something
in that I was I'd really like to see is
because it R is has to change back end I
would like to see some of the day
there's a new dress and see how much
better it gets okay okay yeah thank you
honey and he research to show young
master is it really necessary to type
all those types or is it just like
limitation of the compiler well Phillip
what Allah did tell me that span you
should try all the types to make sure
that you get the program you expect but
of course a pill scripters type in
phones to some extent justices Haskell
does sometimes you have to take the map
it is to get wrong the wrong types of
hurt but you know this is this is the
world we live in essentially
in really the question do you have like
any problems with performance of pure
script or is it just I mean is it works
in practice yeah it compiles down to
very neat JavaScript very close to the
pure scripts except of course for the
times so yeah there is I suppose a very
marginal performances because pure
script is a current language so the sort
of code that it generates actually is
JavaScript functions which don't take
several arguments but will take one
argument returning a function taking the
next segment and so on so there are more
functions called function calls then
first recruit that in JavaScript but
mostly it's it's entirely on the pocket
with JavaScript hmm as you said as you
already shown with cow again and the
same thing applies to elm when you need
to add some new features usually you eat
a new action and the code that processes
it via the inside the update right and
this is actually seems like a problem
for me because a you are forced to have
only the these actions and this is okay
when you deal when you are working on
the um well completed application but is
not really acceptable when you are
working on some components what are the
actual solution for this well I
mentioned that because the companion no
no how would it actually look like
tyrion pls well the saturn support for
hydrogen is with it raining here yet
we're hoping to see it next week in
allen and essentially looks like a
series
functions that just do the mapping for
you so you have sub components will be
isolated they will have their own event
types but you need to know which
component to set to send which event yes
you do and that's the boilerplate I was
complaining about we don't know a
solution that yet think I know I knew
the halogen guys that are thinking very
hard about is now and I would be very
surprised if if the analytes don't
already have a solution plant thank you
this question okay I a final note my
slides are right there on that URL if
you want to check them out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
