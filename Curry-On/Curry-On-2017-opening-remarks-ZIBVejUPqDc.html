has the person that is the local
responsible for everything here and well
what I want to say is welcome to our
University actually on behalf of
director I'm having happening to be
resurrected
so I'm saying welcome to you on behalf
of the of the of the president sir well
II I organized some conferences
previously like eat herbs and all of
them we had terrible weather
big showers so this time I asked
strongly for good weather and I think it
was too loud so well eh have a nice time
something that is good about these
weather is that probably you would
prefer to be in the air-conditioned in
this empty listening to the talks rather
than going outside
so I'm at that comment from inria and
general G of PDA you can find more
information about the proceedings and
the web access on this slide and
everywhere else so don't hesitate to ask
if you have any issues I would like to
thank our sponsors who have very
generously made this event possible and
I will acknowledge them throughout the
the conference and I would like to give
them a round of applause right now
please so as you may not know some
people here actually came from some
conference and don't care or don't know
I don't think they actually know
anything about the other conferences so
one of the goals of this collocation is
actually to make people talk in from
different communities so many
conferences like academic conferences
are used to this kind of collocations so
maybe some people here are used to this
but not everyone so very briefly so we
have conferences talking about compilers
programming languages program
verification debugging virtual machines
embedded systems like memory management
runtime systems a wide area of
programming language oriented topics
also depth which is working on
programming language and distributed
systems so it has a pretty broad area
and Korean is a quite new model which is
essentially driven towards by this goal
of making different communities talk so
Heather will say a few more words about
this but definitely there are people who
don't necessarily our expects experts in
programming language there may be more
practitioners and maybe more working on
the development rather than on research
and vice-versa so please be open to
discussions with all kinds of people
with different backgrounds and interests
that's the goal of the conference so I
am NOT going to say the numbers but we
are very happy with the total number of
registrations and also with the student
participation again this is thanks to
our sponsors we could support all the
red shirts you see in this room our
thanks to our sponsors now okay I'm not
going to release the names of people but
obviously this kind of event is
organized by lots of volunteers and also
some professionals so I would just just
like to advert to to say a few words
about Anabel setting down there we
actually could not come because of
personal
health reasons and but she has been
really been the the main person
coordinating everything behind this
disco located event and again I would
like to send a round of applause to her
so some of the events will be open later
so on Antonio was sitting down there
will will open a coupe and I didn't see
the depth chair yet so that this will be
opened a bit later and I also would like
to thank yin and Sofia for essentially
making this collocation possible so
there are a bunch of workshops 70s 16 of
those lots of tutorials so thanks again
for all the organizers this is thanks to
you that we can also bring all these
people together so there will be in
different rooms you can find all the
information in the program and now
Martin please talk about hi everybody
so I'm Martin I'm the PC chair for PGI
this year so I just wanna quickly
summarize the PDI program related events
here so we have free keynote
presentations some of them are joint
with Korean so Martina deskey who is
going to be here after this presentation
Martina body today and Frank wood from
machine learning on Wednesday we had 48
presentation so 47p ODI papers accepted
and one topless paper and they're
happening from what I understand in two
different buildings the tops so here in
the rooms we have the student research
competition which is tomorrow at 5:30
the first round so you guys can check it
out some great posters in there and the
finals are on Wednesday finally we have
various awards associated with PGI we
have four distinguished paper Awards
they're going to be a noun announced on
Wednesday known we have won best
artifact award and new this year we have
three distinguished reviewer Awards okay
and 300 words for the SRC student
research competition for
analysts are going to be announced again
on Wednesday lunch I think you had okay
so one more think on Tuesday we have the
sick plan town-hall meeting this is
going to include a PCT report from me
about biostatistics on POV I accepted
papers areas since and so on also
introduction to Peoria 2018 by Dan
Grossman and Jeff Foster and also it's
going to be some discussion on PA CM PL
the new Journal and whether POV I should
join are not so command voice your
opinions there so choose dead 5 p.m.
okay so that's it for me
okay there is here there is next oh my
god I'm not shorter than everybody else
okay so I'm not going to to talk a lot
about Korean I think that if you've if
you've registered for curry on you kind
of have an idea of what what Korean is
all about so as Albert mentioned the
whole idea is to try and bring different
communities of people together and start
a conversation so that said I sense
everybody an email last night about sort
of what to expect we have really a super
varied audience we have people who are
just beginning in javascript programming
then we have tenured cs professors and
some theoretical thing that you know not
everybody knows about so we have a
ridiculous variant sort of people here
which means it's really okay if you have
any questions if you have no idea what
somebody's talking about it's fine to
ask just everybody should you know
understand that we all have extremely
different backgrounds it's much more
diverse than maybe some of the
conference's you normally go to so
really I encourage you to not be afraid
to raise your hand and ask questions in
fact for these these chests and
representations that we're going to have
this afternoon I'm sorry
throughout the next two days it's
actually required for you to be involved
so 20 minutes of the presentation time
is actually audience asking questions or
20 minutes as the speaker so you're
really going to have to try to ask
questions really the whole point is to
try and get people who normally don't
talk to talk to each other so that's the
general idea of chorion in like I said I
really encourage you to ask questions
and be open
I had one more announcement and I think
I I put it in the presentation before
you before you froze it so I had a map
that I was going to show you so this
morning there's a change in the Korean
program so the the third track on the
website and on your badges this is going
to be in the sala Agora room we have
maps at the registration desk it's it's
a few minutes walk from here it's
probably around five minutes walk from
from this main auditorium and that's
just for the morning sessions and after
that it goes back to where it's planned
to be which is not as far it's across
the street so if you're interested in
any of the first three talks on the on
the third track of the Korean program
just note that it's in Sala Obara and we
have a map at the desk if you have any
questions just go ahead and ask and
that's all I have to say thanks for
coming
so just I forgot to say that there will
be presentations very short
presentations we call them 1 minute
pitches or one minute of madness talks
right after the keynote this morning so
the speakers should line up they already
know this on this side of the wall right
after the keynote or while during the
during the Q&amp;amp;A this is for period
research talks sorry yes and also the
the other rooms are so near the the
lunch area so if you're looking for
lunch you'll find the other rooms and
it's it's it you see ones all kinds of
balloons all over the place so some some
information the most important one is
that I you know there's this metro
strike and these causes that the metro
will not be working at that I needed for
going from the conference to this
weather the dinner is going to take
place so there are three ways of going
here you have a small sketch of model
description of the three ways to a by
bus another one taking a kind of method
that we have to work in the afternoon
session I will give you more details
with including maps and so on in
addition to that a coffee break
immediately afterward not immediately at
10:30 I think is going to be partly here
in the outside part in the garden that
is in front and then lunches will be
close to Allah Master there's a big
marquee and the Lancers will be there
also there you will have the student
research competition reception that will
be tomorrow in the afternoon right
all right and so at this point we're now
going to start with the the joint PL di
Korean keynote I hope that many of you
know know who he is
he's the creator of the Scala
programming language and today is going
to talk to us about a rather mysterious
feature of Scala called implicit so
Martineau darsky please thanks for for
speaking
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
