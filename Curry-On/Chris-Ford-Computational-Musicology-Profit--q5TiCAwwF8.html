thought works and I'm going to talk to
you about something that's completely
different to that so I'm quite
interested in the concept of making
music by writing computer programs so in
answer to the question of the title of
my talk I'm going to give maybe four
ways that we can profit from using
computational musicology the really
obvious one that programmers always get
straight away is using computers to
analyze music a slightly less obvious
one but I think is really really useful
and productive is to use computers and
computational information theory
thinking as a way to produce music and
produce our and third one is that as I
mentioned I work for a company so I like
a augment we just quickly pitch that so
we have an office in Barcelona now so if
you come to Barcelona for carry-on
you're desperately looking for a way to
stay here forever we're hiring right so
just to give a bit of context before we
get to the other point where we can we
can start some questions um this is
music like this is music notation that's
dots on a page this is the way that
Western musicians in particular annotate
what they do so you could use the
techniques and the thinking that I'm
going to describe to work with actual
waveforms and kind of the continuous or
pseudo continuous properties of pitch
and performance and lyrical meaning and
things like that I'm not going to start
with that because that's quite a bit
more detailed
I'm going to work with basically the
natural numbers of music so the dots the
discrete music so if you don't know how
to read music it doesn't really matter
it won't really come up again except for
maybe the next slide but just as a rough
approximation each of the horizontal
lines reads like a graph so the vertical
position of the dot tells you how high
or low the notice and the horizontal
position tells you when it happens so it
just really is a simple geometric
representation so the key idea of the
talk are like over key complexity theory
idea of the talk is the paradox that
there are things that are really big
datum
that's really big that can be explained
by a really small amount of code so if
you look at the expression here that I'm
highlighting and that says enclosure a
lisp please print me a string of a
billion G's so if you actually tried to
stall that as a file I think it's
actually considerably larger than the
iTunes library so it's a big amount of
data but obviously I've been able to
describe it in not very many characters
at all so you know it that's kind of I
think maybe we look past this
programmers but I think that's a kind of
a paradox but the way that maybe
complexity theory handles is is to say
that the essential complexity of a datum
is defined by the length of the shortest
program that can spit it out so if
there's something that you could write a
hypothetical program to do then and that
program is really short that tells you
that there's a lot of redundancy in the
datum it actually doesn't have very much
essential complexity with a lot of
repeated structure if something takes a
really big amount of computer program to
write that's almost the same thing as
saying that has a lot of essential
complexity there's no way of boiling
stuff down so this is actually quite
similar concept of compression so you
could almost say the compression and
understanding are quite related concepts
so if I if I can't evaluate the whole
thing obviously that's prior to massive
if I evaluate just that bit of it
obviously we've got masses of geez
that's 10,000 GS so it's another G
string just like a box here on the g
string so I'm using this partly because
there has good facilities for making
music but partly also because we have
macros which lets us talk about both the
unev alyou aidid program and the
evaluated program so this macro here
description length takes an expression
converts it to a string and just counts
how long it is so that's that that's
kind of by definition the length of the
expression to produce the datum there's
almost a dual expression here result
length that is not a macro it's an
ordinary function so it evaluates the
code and and then measures the length of
the result so we've got these two
expressions one that tells you how long
the description is one that tells you
how long it
spans - oops smell again so you can just
look for example at this example of this
expression here where we repeat the g65
times so that only takes 13 characters
to do but if we expand that a string of
string of G's - the result it takes 131
characters so it's quite compressible so
you could say that the explanatory power
of a particular expression in terms of
information theory is the reciprocal of
the compression ratio so I have a really
small expression that captures a really
large dejan then you could say that that
expression explains it really really
well so in the case of this this little
string of 65 G's it's got basically a
ten-to-one
you can you put a 10 to 1
power-to-weight ratio with 13 characters
you can describe it but it takes 132
actually represent it and incidentally
this gives a really good definition for
random so randomness can be defined in
terms of whether or not there is an
expression that is shorter than the
literal data so you've got no way to
compress it by writing something that's
smaller we say in this particular way of
looking at complexity but it's random so
one of the problems with this kind of
complexity analysis coma glory of
complexity is that it's not computable
so there's kind of some paradoxes you
actually create if you could work out
how to have an expression that is worked
out for any inch data how long the
expression would be that you typed it so
that's a little bit of a problem for
using it obviously maybe there's a use
cases where we can work it out but in
general things not being computable as a
bit of a problem but one of the things
that David Meredith who is a
musicologist worker is that it's not
with music that we necessarily care
about what the essential complexity is
if we're a musicologist and we try to
explain the music what we care about is
the quality of different ways of
explaining the same piece of music so
perhaps we have one way that looks for
certain common errors in the structure
and that achieves a medium compression
but we have another way of understanding
how that music is put together and that
achieves even greater compression so
it's a way of actually a
DubLi measuring the quality of different
analyses of the same piece of music so
davidmeredith has this system where he
actually starts with the dots on the
page transforms them into numbers and
looks for common sections so he's
actually doing a automated analysis
there so you can see on the left there's
a few patterns of the dots where they
repeat in the same way so in this this
is taken from a paper called analysis by
compression but if you look on the other
side you can actually see it's not
exactly the same dots because they don't
happen at the same height but they're
repeated structure that can be exploited
so that's I mean it's a very interesting
paper largely because it it does
circumvent the problem of computability
because we don't care what the law is
possible the best possible explanation
is all we really care about is which of
the explanations we have does the best
possible job now I'm going to give you
just a little bit of an example of how
to do that in enclosure code so this is
the The Rime row row row your boat which
is like a children's rhyme and I'm going
to build it out of closure expressions
not literally so not note by note but
expressions that expand to form the
actual piece of music so let me just
find need to plug in and I'll actually
play it
sorry for the buzz bites but I'll try
not to leave me too
Ashley
now the special thing about row row row
your boat is it's a cannon so in musical
terms what that means is there's two
copies of the same melody and they're
played overlapping each other with a
simple delay so by using the fact that I
can write functions that transform the
data structure I don't have to write the
melody out twice I can write that once
and then just use a translation to it to
do it twice so that means that this
explanation of roller you both
understand the structure of the cannon
pretty well because it achieves you know
quite a high amount of compression so if
we actually look at the ratio between
row row row your boat the description it
took two hundred and seventy five
characters um but if I expanded it would
have taken more than two thousand so
it's not quite as good as the string of
65 GS but it's pretty good because we're
able to exploit the structure so I'm
able to defend the fact that that's a
good explanation of that as a piece of
music um
incidentally this analysis as you might
have picked up is sensitive to what
you're starting language is so that's
one of the things that you have to think
about if you're trying to apply this
kind of analysis so if you have certain
set of primitives in a language you can
write something more succinctly that if
you have a different set of primitives
so simplicity in this particular case is
relative to the set of primitives and
there's some interesting things you can
do without actually because depending on
what your base set of concepts are you
can talk about how simple an idea is so
it's not really objectively simple
necessarily but it's simple relative to
this base language so so far I've only
really talked about analyzing music
almost as a phenomenon that we could
analyze in scientific terms so what I
also want to talk about is the
production of music using these concepts
and also not just in music with another
art form so the library of Babel is a
famous bore head story where there's
this effectively this massive library
that has many many books on the shelves
and the idea is that that library is
actually filled with all the possible
books of a certain way so it's kind of
like a clean star and if you're familiar
like rejectors or things like that so
it's actually he's described a really
complex data structure a library filled
with
all possible books in a really simple
description the paradox there is which I
find quite interesting from an artistic
point of view that the library of Babel
is kind of a TARDIS right because the
description of the story itself is much
shorter than any one of the books in the
library itself so you can have those
kind of paradoxes with complexity theory
that are quite a small description even
can be contained in the output but you
have a very big result another really
interesting book work of literature that
exploits these computational ideas is
Carl Sagan's contact so in particular
the bit I want to cite is the bit where
they have the number pi and they
discover a message encoded in it so
obviously we don't really know that much
about the number pi or maybe not
obviously we don't really know the
patterns to the digits we don't know
whether every subsequence is present in
pi or not but the premise of this story
was that there was a race of people so
advanced that they were able to transmit
a message by altering the structure of
the relationship between like the radius
and the comforts of a circle jerk line
quite an interesting concept and the
reason why I'm citing this is this is
not an example of using computational
thinking to analyze a book I haven't
done a word frequency analysis of
contact but the author the artist is use
that thinking in their presentation I
also want to talk a little bit about
some computational music that has
actively affected the world so this is
one particular case that's very
interesting by a UK band called Autechre
a band of electronic musicians and by
the way if you're looking to ask
questions feel free to in front of
jumping as we are into the question zone
but there was in 1994 there was a an act
passed where there was kind of a moral
panic so there was a stage where there's
a lot of dance music parties happening
in fields and the government wanted to
ban this but they had the problem where
a lot of wholesome traditional British
music is also done by people dancing
around in fields and so distinguishing
between these two things became quite a
an interesting paradox so what they
ended up doing was defining and
repetitive beats so if the music had
repaired it beats it counts as a dance
party and you know let's do it if it
doesn't have repetitive beats then it's
presumably folk dancing or some
like that so what AutoCAD II which I
thought was fantastic is they use kind
of like a diagonal argument in a track
so they went through and created a piece
where they had no identical feet in any
one piece so it still sounds like a
dance music track but they basically
made sure that on no no beat at all was
ever actually repetitive in a
computational sense so it's got a one up
but complexity theory reveal but
obviously they did have a practical out
of this and you know made people promise
that they would actually have a lawyer
in a musicologist presence so that if
people off their heads dancing in a
field in 4 a.m. if the cops did come
they'd obviously have some trouble
making a nuanced argument about about
them
another interesting case and this is
where your base concepts come in is
blurred lines right so and there was a
controversy because this song was found
to infringe on the copyright of a Marvin
Gaye song look too similar but the
trouble is we really don't have a very
good idea of similarity in music at
least that's not widespread it's
generally like what judges think is
sounds kind of the same so this was a
case where perhaps if you had the idea
of conditional comma grow of complexity
so the idea of the distance between a
particular datum and Alda could actually
be used to objectively discover the
difference between between pieces of
music which maybe could not but not that
blurred lines that happens as a very
kind of weirdly misogynist Lee tainted
tune so yeah there definitely are there
particularly mind that a bad thing
happened to this particular song but as
as a way of analyzing things just having
judges work out what the feel of a pop
song that a 10 year olds listen to is
probably not very meta logically sounded
as there any any kind of questions from
what I've covered so far because I'm
going to move into a slightly different
section yes
um yes because I guess so the question
was is the notion of compression related
to entropy so if you have entropy you're
effectively unable to compress it
because you have no way of explaining it
so if you had entropy that was just
alternating digits that was one zero one
zero one zero you would be able to
explain it and so it would not truly be
entropy so yes the tongue will go out
complexity if the idea is it's an actual
essential fundamental way of explaining
what entropy is you could say yes but
then often sorry often you can also use
like functions that you defined yes oh
macros a define - yeah describe the
piece of musics are so do you count the
expanded versions of those functions or
do you just count the names of those
macros like what yeah what rules do you
use so that the question was I guess if
you have functions that refer to
functions or macros that expand how you
how do you define the rules and I would
say it's a little bit arbitrary so as
long as you're consistent it doesn't
matter and in my case it's a very simple
macro that just looks at the top level
expression because I've deliberately not
divided it into sub levels but the
proper definition would of the comb code
complexity would effectively chase down
all the references you have to some base
level so is the base level library of
musical concepts that everyone already
agrees they understand well if that's
the case then you don't go belong that
below that wall alone if the base level
is the standard library you don't go
over like if it's that you know it's
just scheme so you get kind of similar
relative results but you obviously get
very different absolute results
depending on depending on how far you
going
and cool so I mentioned that apply
we don't actually understand well I
started ok Lucy yeah no I mean you would
sorry you would but you would preserve
what generally you would preserve the
same relative complexity between two
pieces although it would be possible by
choosing a language of base concepts to
make a thing that you thought was
complex simple because it's simple when
expressed in there exactly so it's I
guess it's similar to compression
algorithms so if you're in a case where
you have a certain you know an image
with a lot of flat color then pngs
understand that in some sense and can
exploit it really well but other
algorithms might not but if you had
something that was actually I guess a
JPEG natural image a PNG algorithm would
not understand that natural thing very
well well there's more of an answer so
the sort of usual statement is that :
garb complexity is defined only up to an
additive constant you can always prepend
a translator from one notation to
another as part of your program and so
it doesn't matter what notation you use
because up to the constant of adding
that translator therefore as the song
gets longer and longer the constant
becomes dominated by the cost of
encoding the song but for short songs of
the sort that you're looking at the
relative honor might very well change oh
very good answer
thank you so the particular thing that I
want to talk about now is other
constants besides pi that are a little
bit better behaved so PI we suspect is a
normal number so we suspect that
everywhere in every sequence of digits
appears somewhere in pi I think it's a
the same frequency that's something we
speculate but I don't think that's been
looking through into the audience I
don't think that's been proven that's
something that empirically we seem to
come across it seems random in that
sense but there are other constants that
are also like the library of Babel
lexicons or they like the library of
Babel
I have everything inside them but
they're much better behaved that we can
actually do stuff with we can speculate
on begin we can calculate on so the one
I want to talk about is briefly is the
champion onward so this was discovered
by a champion and I think when he was an
undergraduate and really it's just quite
a simple concept it's to take the
natural numbers serialize them digit by
digit and just concatenate them all
together so if we look at the taking the
first 16 digits of that will actually
the champion M word because we're just
talking about the digits rather than the
actual fraction but it just starts you
know 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 so
it's a very simple number but you can
also probably see from yourself that
every sub sequence of digits appears in
that number because you can actually
just get to that point in the natural
numbers where you come across that
sequence so one concert consequence of
that is that if we concede a process
artistic or whatever from the champagne
out constant then we will eventually
also hit all possible combinations so
long as we have an appropriate
translation so as my own little kind of
comment on the way copyright works but
I've defined something I call the
copyright infringement song so it's kind
of a decoding at the champion our word
so in turn musical notes so what that
means is that as you play through the
champion on work you'll eventually come
up with every possible subsequence of
other music so what that implies is even
though it's quite short that it contains
every other song within it at some point
as I was kind of thinking about the
commercial possibilities of this this is
kind of a hidden profiteering um I
realized that I guess one of the
downsides of this is it isn't some non
legal I'm not a lawyer sense infringes
on the copyright of every existing song
um but I think that's probably offset by
the fact that every future song
infringes on its copyright so as an
investment there might be a little bit
of outlays
for the first little while but
eventually I'd imagine assuming that the
recording industry wasn't completely
disrupted by the process and it will
become interesting yes yeah that is a
problem and I played a bit of it yes
they saying you're saying that idea
doesn't count actress but well that's an
interesting thing but does it have to be
broadcast I mean if you think about a CD
it's an encoding of song it's not the
actual sound there it's encoded in
certain way well it's a lovely place but
you've got to read it well I can write I
can write down this program and send it
to the Copyright Office
it's just a more efficient encoding you
could say and let's start playing it
because it's at least at first it takes
it takes a while as a song to warm up so
going back some kind of cycle so we're
back down to lower pictures and so
basically eventually we'll hit we'll get
everything so I guess if I do need to do
that I need to get running now
one of the inconveniences of it
obviously is if you like a particular
part of this song that's going to take a
long time to get and that's the
particular part you like is the bit that
we just listened to you so there is a
skier go yep we're all right exactly
yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah I believe
you but just do can you just I believe
you but can you just like show me
specifically so I know for sure yeah
that's a very good argument here so it
works as a defense oh yes
but there's another there's another
dimension to this is wearing it good too
with the length of the notes right yeah
so is it the same song if I go row row
your boat row row your boat and are they
the same as a different song so I'm not
an experiment that there is actually a
difference between the musical
composition and the tangible output but
I think so let's say so long as a CD can
infringe on the copyright of another CD
let's let's assume we accept that's
possible so you know that you could use
the same process to go through every bit
combination on a CD boat so in theory so
long as you accept that we're going to
get discreet at some point it's possible
but in the case of blurred lines I think
actually the controversy was that one of
the reasons why it's controversial is
that Marvin Gaye hadn't registered the
copyright to the composition itself just
the recording but I think in some
jurisdictions the the abstract discrete
notes on a page representation can be
distinguished from a physical recording
of a particular version of it so in that
case if I say row row row your boat with
a slightly different voice or someone
else sang it it would still be the same
underlying composition if we quantized
it and there is obviously judgment as to
how close these have to be together
entirely subjective and unreliable
judgment in my opinion cool so in order
to make this song more effective to work
with them I did a skip to part of this
this particular song so you can skip to
the part that you want which is kind of
convenient so I've discovered something
I call the gay Williams thick constant
which is the point that you have to skip
to in the song to uh to hear your
bloodlines
so I'll just play that today as well
I write the bass bit
sadly in terms of length and playing it
all through I think I've worked out once
that there definitely a son would
expanded and they'll destroy the earth
before you got to listen actually just
playing it in real time so the skip
feature is definitely one of the users
would be would be interested in yeah
yeah that had a how do I come to it some
people might have already figured out I
don't know I'm yeah the the key is that
the way I've turned the digits into
music is a predictable decoding scheme
that is reversible so if I started with
what the music looks like that would
allow me to work out what sequence of
digits I was looking for and because
it's a nice well-behaved sequence it's
not quite this was PI it would be really
really hard but because you know where
to find any given sequence of digits in
the number by skipping you can do that
so actually if you're going to look at
it closely this this number is actually
encoding all the information necessary
to produce the song that's a bit but it
is just playing to something that
natural that's a natural naturally
occurring consonant just happens to be
maybe more is very happy well it depends
which laws I guess that I guess they're
happy regardless as long as there's
controversy and oh I may have made them
happy I don't know I like making people
happy yeah oh yeah so is this is your
algorithm somehow tuned is it better at
finding bloodlines than say we're really
boat um it's actually just a the
question was like well is it better for
some finding some songs than others are
not really because it's more just an
encoding and decoding so this is not a
it's not going through our numbers until
it encounters it there's not some kind
of like binary thing it's taking a list
of discrete notes which I said I do at
the start because it's a bit simpler
converting that into a sequence of
digits and then just treating that as a
natural number and jumping to that to
that point so anything I'm I'm
exaggerating slightly when I say every
possible song potentially because
as you I think Wazir pointed out earlier
depends what features of a song you find
relevant so it's anything that's in the
image of the decoding function counts
which by my judgment is close enough to
include everything that you might be
interested in
so like since we're on eight minutes oil
oh yeah sounds good I just AM yeah like
the number of voices yes this is another
another dimension so yes the boy I've
did it with three voices there's
actually something that Papa Jun I'm
pretty sure you could define an encoding
that had an arbitrary number of voices
as it happens if you look at the source
code which is available if you want to
mess with it this has three specific
voices but I took the pragmatic decision
that for the purposes of copyright
jamming three voices should be enough
for anyone as okay tomorrow put it but
okay no that's underneath and doesn't
and only covers pitched instruments as
well that would be another another
element of this particular example yeah
so chalk you want to try to publish this
you might have trouble but you may be
able to publish a version that filters
out all sequences that are too close to
know in music alright so all you need to
do is get a library of known music and
just get right get rid of all sequences
sub sequences that are sub strings that
are within a small Hamming distance of a
Nintendo to other published EndNote
sequence right and you can do that
automatically so I've had that ABA's
those a your generator unfortunately you
know the problem is when you try to send
your generator you get your generator
code will include all these previous
well thorns on it so I can get rid of
them or just network access if there was
a service for it you know yes I don't
you know every time it found it look up
in the iTunes database or something with
a certain distance yeah yeah does that
count as being fixed in a tangible
medium so that the problem is that the
printed out version doesn't violate any
copyrights and you could you could mail
had all previous stuff that way your
problem is your description of it will
pilot all previous copyrights in order
to know what to exclude wow these
publishers now is looking at they're
dead but yeah that's gotta be crazy
pays attention I think it's the
condition the distance between two songs
like we say Hamming distance I think you
could actually capture that as a common
god of complexity problem as well if you
use a conditional combo of complexity
where you actually use those existing
songs as primitives in your encoding
because then you would just need to
track you'd start with you start with
blurred lines and you'd apply
transformations to it until you've got
to got to give it up there are many
transformations that people wouldn't
regard as similarity but want to get
cognitive similarity of something
yeah well yeah what you're not given
tree do worry about community molarity
obviously then you into a world of much
more complexity than you need to model
the is the psychology and the listening
apparatus of the people involved yeah
well it sounds sounds like an excellent
topic for further research um so there's
one other thing that I want to do just
of the content that I have and then and
then we can get back to kind of as a
conversation about it for whatever we
time we have left is that yeah well I'll
tell them something for about two and a
half three minutes them in and then get
back to that so people do actually use
this to perform so I've got my I only
just got it has just been printed my
elbow a t-shirt on so there's a bunch of
people I think especially in the UK but
around the world what some pretty cool
folks who do kind of live coding in
Emacs to perform dance music basically
which is which is a fantastic phenomenon
I think I hope that goes somewhere it's
not that old it's only a couple of years
old so I'm not going to do what people
might refer to as kind of the hardcore
of algo rev which is just start with a
blank buffer which is obviously very
creative but takes a long while before
you get anywhere interesting so I do
have some of some some elements I
already have here but in particular this
piece is designed to kind of have a
commentary on so we saw Dave Meredith's
earlier work where he had translations
and clones of the same melody that's all
at the same semantic level that's just
geometric transformation so what I
wanted to try to do was use
transformations that kind of cross
semantic boundaries because I got into
this music stuff from reading the book
go Alicia bar so what I'm going to do is
take the letters G B and use them to
create a little bit of a
Hanan we're we're interpreting both the
letters G E and B as ASCII codes and
playing this MIDI and as the notes
themselves and then this kind of some
elaboration order on top of it I think
it can sound be interesting G basically
the ribs this
just about the start has kind of pseudo
complexities I was actually singing but
it's
using a mixer
it's great
his obsession
yeah
sure
yes sure
ah
so I think with your patience I've
slightly exceeded my allowance so so so
we have some more questions yes um I
haven't but actually it would be it
would be fairly simple I think it's
probably in general the length of the
natural number grows obviously with the
length design so it would probably be
and even probably struggle to put that
on the screen at once I think
but yeah I'm sure it's there oh yeah of
computational analysis of vogner was the
question um I don't know I've done a
some stuff around back because obviously
bob has a very stuff like an ins the
concept of having reflections and
transformation and those patterns in
cannons and fugues that bark does is
very repetitive so that I think can be
done quite productively I personally
don't know that gardener
yeah on it so the witch was just
mentioning was that there's a lot of
analyses of these different composers
like Gardner I would in general expect
that if there's an analysis that
actually is precise enough to make sense
you could translate it into code if you
had sufficient patience
so it's not necessarily having to do it
from scratch you would just need to work
out what's the computational equivalent
of a English sentence with regards to
the the comments you made earlier yeah I
have you or the company that you work
for looked at monetizing this as a
method for copyright infringement
lawsuit as a tool to to objectify these
kind of claims um so one thing I should
mention is that my day job doesn't
really resemble what I'm doing right so
I love my company a lot and we do a lot
of interesting work but this isn't
particularly one of them um no so I
neither neither i other than the other
than using the concept to help get the
hospitality of carry on and and similar
conferences i haven't exploited it for
personal gain the actual like a
differential differentiation between
songs for copyright I think works gotta
be a quirk expert witness kind of
content I think would actually be a
genuinely interesting thing I don't know
whether you would I don't know whether
you would be able to get away with doing
it just against the composition because
you could get people to translate the
raw song into the composition or maybe
you need to do waveform analysis but I
think I think it's interesting yeah yeah
oh yeah so yeah yeah well you think it
can't get any worse well but I but I
definitely that the legal technique or
program is saying I don't see why it
doesn't work this way isn't always
produce it accurate legal analysis
unfortunately as Slashdot and hacking
news and so on but it would show you
very strongly that was great from and if
the if anybody wants to hear more of
this kind of thing yeah it's a regular I
CFP yeah so there's usually an after
party at the end of ICF P was a whole
evening of people doing this in a club
and there will be again at ICF P this
year yes blog come to up come to Oxford
for ICF P and that there's a whole day
like this farm is a functional item
modeling day of ICA P it's one of the
Constituent conferences so generally the
performance that referring to is
expended the culmination of that so if
you're interested in not just seeing the
performance but also possibly some
papers that might be more serious than
mine about people exploring function
programming art there's a whole big
section of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
