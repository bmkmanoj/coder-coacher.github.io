in this room yet today we're taking
questions at the center Mike rather than
running Mike's just due to the size of
the room so if you have questions I'm
sure John will be happy to answer them
for you if you just line up for the end
of the talk okay and so take us away
okay thank you
so I'd like to start my talks by asking
the audience a question so here's the
question who really really loves testing
okay maybe maybe half a dozen little bit
more that's not bad
so you're pretty typical as an audience
testing it turns out is not the most
popular part of software development so
I just want to start off by thinking
about why that is why is testing hard
well imagine that you're writing a test
suite for some code that has n features
what are you going to do you're going to
write maybe three or four test cases per
feature that's perfectly okay that's a
linear amount of work but we all know
you won't find all the bugs if you do
that because some bugs only appear when
two features interact so what are you
going to do are you're going to write
tests for all pairs of features well
that's a quadratic amount of work that
doesn't sound so good and even if you do
that then not all bugs ago to appear if
you test for features in pairs some bugs
only appear when you use three features
together and that's a cubic amount of
work and this is now starting to sound
really pretty bad and of course it goes
on from there but because it erased
conditions as well so that errors don't
even appear every time you run a test it
just gets harder and harder and in the
end it's hair tearing ly difficult you
can never test enough so what's the
solution
simple don't write tests
generate them because we still want to
test our code right so I'm going to talk
about quick check test case generation
tool I've been working with for quite a
long time now which originates from
paper by Coon classes and myself we're
up on the top right corner there and the
way that we normally use it is that we
start off with some API and a test and
then we generate random sequences of
calls and we keep doing that until the
test fails and now when a test fails
usually this the sequence of calls may
be quite long and it's very rare that
all the calls in that sequence
contribute to the failure so the next
thing we do is try and identify the
calls that are responsible and shrink
the test case down to a minimal failing
example and that's what we then report
to the user for diagnosis that's a bit
abstract so if you haven't seen it I'm
going to do a demo quick check now so
I'm going to demo a circularbuffer if I
can get the code to appear here that's
not valid curses okay so this is a
circularbuffer in see most of you
probably right see better than I do but
10 in mind so here's a struct to
represent the buffer we've got a pointer
to where the date is going to be stored
I'm going to keep track of the next
index put something in the next index to
take something out besides the buffer
and so on here's the code for creating a
new buffer we have to allocate memory
for the data initialize the fields
allocate memory for the struct assign
that return a pointer and so on here's
how we put something in we write the
argument to the data area at the at the
input pointer and then we increment the
input pointer modulo the size very
simple obviously no bugs
but it's a nice example to test and
here's how we get something out we read
from the data area at the output pointer
and then we increment the output pointer
modulo size and I've got one more
operation here that just tells us how
many things were in the buffer just take
the difference between those indices
modulo the size so that's my code and
I'm going to test it from air lag so let
me just compile that code it's in the
file Q dot C okay and now I can call
that C code from the airline Shell's let
me just demo it I'll create a queue with
space for five elements there we are
let's put one into it let's put two into
it okay let's ask how many elements are
in the queue at the moment
- that's good let's take something out
there's the one there's the two there's
on initialize memory and some more and
some more oh look there's the one again
there's a - it's a circularbuffer so
it's C code add it and it behaves
exactly as C code would expect so now I
can test this code from Ed Lang and it's
the airline version of quick check I've
got a demo so what I'm going to do is
generate some tests for the C code which
I will do by calling quick check oh wait
let me just compile my test code and now
I will call quick check and give it my
specifications an argument oh no a test
failed but you saw it really working ok
so what's happening here what's
happening is that we generated a random
test case and what you see up here this
was what happened when I ran the random
test and I think we can agree you
probably wouldn't want to debug that and
then quick check has searched for the
core of a test case the mineral example
and down here
this is the part that I want you to read
okay this is this shows us what happened
in the test that actually fake so what
happened I created a queue with space
for one element I put a zero into it and
I asked how many values are in the queue
and size return zero but I just put
something in okay so I want you to I
want you to help me now here's the
source code for size what's wrong okay
so think of the example I created a
queue a size one I put one thing in what
happened that I did that hmm oh yes yes
the size is one so the size function
returns the difference between two
pointers modulo 1 but that's always zero
in fact but I put something in I
incremented the input pointer modulo 1
so that's also zero so oh dear putting
something into the cube didn't change it
at all and if you think about it
actually whenever I make a queue size N
and I put n things in the input points
go to wraparound it's going to look like
an empty queue so I can't distinguish
full from empty queues that's the
problem here and so my representation is
inadequate any suggestions for a fix
what
well I am storing sighs I could yeah I
could for example store a boolean to
keep track of whether the queue is full
or empty but then I get lots of special
cases in my code that we horrible so
there's a lovely hack which I'm going to
show you so the problem only arises when
the queue is full right so here's what
I'm going to do well I'm asked to create
a queue of size n I am actually going to
create one of size M plus 1 what does
that mean that means for something to
observe the bug they must put n plus 1
things into a queue of size N and that
means it's their fault
and I have successfully avoided blame
which is the goal of all good software
engineering so let me recompile my C
code and then I will just run the last
test again I can do that if I just move
quick Cheers
so this will run the last failed example
now it passes and now I'll run random
tests and let's see what happens
oh it still didn't work there must be
another bug okay so look what happened
here I created a queue of size one
that's really - I put something into it
that was okay I removed the thing by
calling get so now now it's empty again
I put something else into it that's okay
how many things are in the queue now I
put two things in I took one thing out
one and so size returns -1 oh no what
happened here well if we go back to the
code for size right what happened was I
put two things in the queue is really of
size 2 so the input pointer has been
incremented twice modulo 2 it's wrapped
right back down to zero the output
pointer of taking one thing out it's
been incremented once so here I'm
computing 0 minus 1 that's minus 1
modulo 2 what is minus 1 modulo 2 I did
I've studied mathematics I know what it
is is plus 1 right let's just check with
their length minus 1 modulo 2 oh no air
long doesn't implement modular
arithmetic properly it returns -1 and so
to see so that's the problem
right I thought modular would always
return something positive but if this
our expression is negative I get a
negative result from size and that's
clearly wrong so I've got to make sure
this expression is never negative how
can I do that
yeah thank you absolute value okay
let's just make sure that works I'll
recompile the see rerun the last test
it's fine
so where are my now I found a problem on
my code I created a test case that
provoked it I've fixed my code
I've rerun my tests or my tester green
I'm done right would you like me to run
some more random ones just till we feel
comfortable all right let's see what
happens oh no it still doesn't work
what's happened here okay now I made a
queue size two
that's progress that means cues of size
one work now we know that because it's
minimum okay so what does this test
gauge do it puts three things into the
queue it's really size three and I take
one thing out so how many things should
be in the queue to what a size return
one why is that because the input
pointer has wrapped around again so this
is zero I've taken one thing out this is
minus 1 modulo 3 that should be to
mathematically but if I take the
absolute value I get 1 so what I need to
do is not take absolute value that's a
easy mistake to make how to make sure
this is positive in some other way and I
can do it by adding queue size here and
that will ensure that that is never
negative and everything should work
let's see a recompile the see rerun the
last test that passes should I run
random ones just be on the safe side
maybe yes 100 test passed 200 300 400
500 seems to be working now okay well
thank you very much for helping me with
my debugging
and let me go back to slides here so
what we've seen here is that with the
random tests and the properties that
haven't shown you the test code but my
test code was able to find a variety of
different bugs with the same test code
that's really nice isn't it and what
you've seen also is that when bug was
found then it was shrunk down to a
minimal failing test case and I hope
you'll agree with me but those minimal
tests are quite easy to debug it's great
to know that everything that appears in
the test case is relevant to the failure
that's an enormous help for debugging if
you look at the first randomly generated
tests they contain a lot of random
rubbish think of it as noise why it's
their purpose random rubbish is very
good for provoking failures but it's
very bad for debugging them so this
shrinking process that simplifies the
test case as much as possible we think
of as like extracting the signal from
the noise and it's I think it's key
technique for making this approach
useful okay
so I've shown you testing a very tiny
piece of C code I didn't show you my
test code it's actually as large as the
C and if that were true for larger
pieces of software then the whole
approach wouldn't be very useful so you
might be wondering does this really
scale so let me tell you about the
largest project that we've used quick
check to test and that is part of the
outer SAR basic software there's a
diagram of it here I'm not going to play
this in detail what is it though this is
the structure of software that runs on
every processor in a car that follows a
desire so you can see here there are
lockers each colored box is a module and
then the boxes that contain colored
boxes are subsystems so you can see
there's an Ethernet stack on the right
there
the second thing is a can bus stack the
can bus is a network that's very
commonly used in cars most of the
communication goes over
canvas and then the other stuff does
routing there are some other protocols
and so on the point is just that there's
quite a lot of software in the outer
star basic stuff and there is a standard
specifies how this should behave
why because car manufacturers like Volvo
cars want to be able to put subsystem
together containing code from different
providers now you might think that the
right thing to do would be to have one
implementation of an Ethernet stack for
example but you that everybody just
shares in the car industry one open
source solution would ensure that all
the different components work together
but that's not what they've done what
they've done instead is they've
standardized how these components should
behave so that there are many different
suppliers of canvas stacks and so you
can be running can a canvas stack from
one supplier you know in your gearbox
and from a different supplier in your
engine controller and they have to talk
to each other and thanks to the standard
then everything should just work well
guess what it doesn't and in fact when
you first put a car together
you can't even boot it let alone drive
it and a part of the problem can be that
the suppliers of this basic software
didn't follow the standard and so their
components don't work together so Volvo
cars paid us to develop quick check
models of all the outside basic
components and to test the software from
their suppliers see if they we're
following the standard or not and I can
show you one of the books that we found
here it is this is in the canvas stack
so the canvas can carry one message at a
time and all the messages on the canvas
have an identifier which also serves as
their priority so this test case first
of all sends a message with priority one
and what happens where we can observe
that it says message one so now the bus
is busy then it sends two more messages
with priority two and three
okay so now you can imagine that the
client software has called the canvas
stack saying send these messages but of
course it can't send them yet because
the bus is busy so they get queued up
then the test case calls transmit
confirm so sending a message is normally
called from above
the protocol stack transmission
confirmation is called from below by the
hardware bus driver and in this case
it's confirming that the message with
identifier 1 has been set so now the
stack has two messages queued up and it
must choose between them and the trick
about these priorities is that the
smaller the number the higher the
priority so which message should be sent
next the one with priority 2 and which
one was sent the one with priority 3 so
that was kind of interesting and in this
case we actually had the source code of
the can stack often we don't have source
code of software we test but in this
case we did so we could look at it we
could find out what the problem was
cycle it slated to you in the canvas the
message identifier serves also as the
message type and in the first version of
the canvas protocol there were 11 bits
allocated for storing the message type
but if you think about that that's like
saying you can have 2,000 different
types of message in the entire car
it's like saying your java program can
only have 2,000 different classes it's
just not enough anymore so as a result
the the can standard has been extended
so you can now use an extended cam ID of
29 bits and that allows what is it well
enough different message types a even
for today's software but you can still
use the old format so when you send a
message you have to remember what kind
of identifier have I got should I use
the small format or the large one and if
the numerical value that determines the
priority in this particular canister
then this identify was stored at an
unsigned 32-bit integer and look the
extended field is only 29 bits long
so you've got three spare bits and the
top bit was used to record whether the
message should be sent with an extended
ID or a standard ID so guess what what I
didn't show you before is that the
message with priority two was encoded
using an extended can ID and the C code
that was deciding which message to send
okay the developer forgot to mask off
that top bit before comparing the
priorities so it was treating the
message with priority two as priority
two to the 31 plus two and that's why it
was sent second and not first so I
really like this example and partly
because it's a very low-level bug a C
programmer forgot to mask off a bit in
this protocol stack but even so you can
provoke the bug with a short sequence of
API calls and you can find that short
sequence by generating longer random
ones and shrinking them as quick Chek
does so it's very nice illustration for
technique working for much larger scale
also it's an important bug the canvas
has priorities for a reason everything
in a car pretty much talks on the canvas
the stereo the brakes so here's a tip
next time your emergency braking don't
fiddle with the volume on the stereo so
in this project we read 3,000 pages of
PDFs containing the specifications of
all of these outer cell components we
turned that into 20,000 lines of quick
check code which i think is quite good
ratio we only needed 6 lines of code to
test what one page of PDF said we used
that to test in total about a million
lines of C code from 6 different
suppliers and even though when we got
the code it was supposed to be working
already we found more than 200 problems
of which more than 100
we're in the standard itself I found one
of those myself where first of all there
was a requirement in the standard very
clearly stated and then afterwards there
was a paragraph explaining what it meant
that contradicted what the requirement
said so you know what are people to do
the other thing we found was that in
those cases where we compared our test
code to existing test code I was nine
times shorter and more over tested more
so does it does this technique scale yes
it scales I also want to show you I
can't resist show you my favorite ever
bug this is a bug in the database that
comes along with air land and to provoke
it here's what you have to do first of
all you have to open a table and then
you have to close it and open it again
no really
after that you do three things in
parallel one lookup and two insertions
and about every hundredth time you
execute that you crash the whole
database so the database concern it was
it was crashing in production at one of
the biggest users in Sweden about once a
month and I knew about this bug I
thought it would be really fun to hunt
it down so that's why I went when
looking for it but by the time I found
this then the guy who was maintaining
the code had spent more than six weeks
working at the customer trying to figure
out what nerve the problem was and at
the end of that time their best guess
was it seems to happen when the file is
about one gigabyte maybe it's something
to do with rehashing now we know you
need a database with at most one record
and only five or six function calls to
reproduce the problem and once we once
I'd found this very small test case that
I sent it to the maintainer and next day
he sent me a text version and this this
bug really shows the enormous value of
shrinking and getting a small test
and what a dramatic difference it makes
and how easy it is to debug these
problems the other thing I really like
about this bug is that there's no way
anybody would write this test in a test
suite right I mean there's there's quite
a few calls in the API why would you
test this particular one and yet this is
the smallest example that can provoke
this bug so it's a kind of bug that you
can really only find by searching for
them ok I just want to go back now to
one of the counter example I showed you
remember this one so this is of length 5
ok it's 5 steps and so you might think
if you're searching for a small example
like this maybe you should be running
tests of length 5 but that isn't what we
do I measured the lengths of tests I was
running and here's the graph that shows
what I was doing when I was calling that
devil for you so you can see that the
tests test cases I ran varied widely in
length about 8% of the world length zero
which might seem a bit excessive but
it's not so serious
those tests run very fast but then there
were much longer tests the longest ones
were more than 200 steps so why do we do
this why do we run much longer tests
than the counter examples we're looking
for in fact the average here is is over
15 steps so 3 over over 3 times the
length of the counter example that I
actually wanted to find so the key thing
here is to ask ourselves well how
quickly can we actually find faults by
running these random examples how does
the length of the test affect the
probability of hitting a thought so I
measured that too so look at this this
is the probability of a test page
failing on the y-axis and on the x-axis
it's a number of steps and test cakes
and because there aren't so many test
cases of greater lens it gets a bit
noisy towards the right but nevertheless
when you look at it you can see well
actually all the tests
the past so I didn't manage to hit this
bad case in a random test of length 5
but then as the test got longer and
longer so they got more likely to fail
well now you might say of course a
longer test case is more likely to fail
it's doing more stuff so there's more
chance that we'll do something wrong and
of course that's true so this graph
isn't really the one that you want to
see what you want to see is as I do more
work running a test how does the
probability of of failure
per unit of work change so what you want
to see is this graph divided by the
length of the test right because each
call is you know on the assumption that
cost about same and this is what that
graph looks like ok so this is the
probability of one command failing in a
test case of varying lengths and you can
see that for the shortest tests
there's simply no point running them
they all pass because the shortest
failing was five steps long but after
that tests are only a little more than
five steps or though most likely will
pass but once we get up to the 20 to 40
commands range that's where we're
maximizing the probability of each
command revealing a failure and this is
something that we have observed again
and again and again in many different
contexts but generating longer random
tests and shrinking them back down is by
far the fastest way of finding short
failing examples so why is that well I
can give you some intuition I'm waving
my hands here I'd better but there's
some truth in what I say anyway so this
represents a long test case suppose it
fails well as I showed you when the test
case fails it's usually because of some
sub sequence of commands maybe these
five commands were responsible for
failure so what about all of the rest of
them well it turns out that quite often
the other commands of the test case
don't matter
in other words as long as these five
commands appear somewhere in the test
case is quite likely to fail with the
bug that we're looking for so now ask
yourself in a long test case of length n
how many ways are there of embedding 5
steps into that sequence it's
exponentially many right you're getting
exponential benefit for a linear amount
of work is that good or what so that
that explains why reason really this
kind of testing is unreasonably
effective and it's quite quite amazing
to see okay well if you want to know
more haskell quick check was the
original version of quick check there's
a paper from 2000 that describes that
cubic quick check is the one that I
demoed today and we have a company that
supplies that along with services but
there are also many many other tools
that have been inspired by quick check
like test stop check and closure scarlet
check FS check and have sharp and so on
so I encourage you to go and look at
some of these tools and try them out if
you haven't done so yet then you will be
amazed
don't write tests generate
we have some time for questions I could
just use the center mic there Bryan
Newton for MIDI Anna hi John all right
so aside for him to take away that I
should not get in a car one of the
things I was wondering about your talk
is about shrinking test cases in the
context of non-deterministic failures
like the database one that you demo
because at that point each shrinks step
may or may not yield
there's no true that a question of
whether on the strength succeeded or not
do you simply set a threshold for how
many times you try it each time you
shrink right so suppose you are trying
to debug a non-deterministic failure and
you've got a complex case it fails and
you're doing it manually what you do
you'll try to simplify it but you won't
run that test just once to see if the
failure is still there you have to run
it repeatedly that's what we do we just
automated and how many times you run a
test before you decide that this one
doesn't fail that depends on how rare
the race condition is that you're
looking for and that's something
typically that the quick jet user will
adjust so for the database examples to
get reliable shrinking I ran each test a
thousand times okay thanks it can be a
little slow but it's a whole lot faster
than trying to figure out what's going
on without doing that Thanks so what
happens when you use a quick check
within a first or second year
programming course I have used it on the
very first programming course and I told
the students method for writing
functions where they wrote down and the
type they wrote down the names of the
parameters and I got them to write down
a property before writing the code and I
was you know it was really the students
did what I told them they wrote a lot of
properties they got a lot of benefit but
I think that was perhaps the wrong place
to do it because at that time it was not
easier for the students to write a
property that it was to write
the function so I think it makes more
sense to introduce quick check testing
once students are writing code that's a
little bit more complex so that their
properties can be much simpler than the
kilted they're testing hi thank you very
much for creating a quick Jack I am a
little curious if you have any
recommendations about how to use it to
explore like very large state spaces and
in particular I notice in the equipping
quick check it seemed that perhaps you
start with really small ones and
iteratively move to bigger cases
basically I found it difficult to
generate good examples when I'm dealing
with large like very high dimensional
data structures yes
so I think random search is very good at
exploring very large spaces because what
other approach can you possibly take to
space is very large you can only sample
from it and random sampling is quite
effective but what I don't have time to
get into in this kind of talk is to
discuss the measurement of test cases so
one of the downsides of using a tool
like quick check is you don't see the
tests and as a result when you
generating complex tests it might be
that almost all were rather trivial so
you might get a false sense of security
so it's very important that you collect
statistics about what the tests are
actually doing look for example how well
am i covering my source code if you're
missing part of it entirely you need to
adjust the distribution if your we
measure all kinds of things so for
example I often use a test or the
process registry that maintains a table
of process identifier and the most
simple way of generating those tests
generates a table that is almost always
empty right I know I measured the size
but of the table and I adjust the
distribution so that I get a nice spread
of sizes
you using it too like this doesn't free
you from needing to think about what you
want to test but it raises the level of
which you think about that you need to
think about what should I measure to
have confidence in my tests and then
once you've measured it
how should I adjust the distribution so
that I get the measurements that I want
so there's there's a lot of skill and
experience in doing that which I don't
have time to discuss in a talk this
length Thanks hi um so I was wondering
in particular it sounds like at a high
level the goal of a tool like quick
check in some sense is to find counter
examples to some theorem so you state
some property of the program and you're
looking for a witness that that theorem
is false so I was wondering in
particular if you had considered I don't
have a great sense of sort of the
overlap between this and the formal
methods literature but if there are
techniques from say s and T solving that
could be useful here or vice-versa
yes so that's right so what we do is we
formulate a property of our code
correctness condition and then we look
for a counter example that shows that
it's not correct quite often what we
discover is that the property is not
correct right so in general what happens
is that funnily enough customers write
their code before asking us to help them
test it and that means that in practice
you not usually test some code that has
already been tested to a certain extent
and that works to a certain extent which
means your test code is a new code so
your formal specification is the new
code of course that's where the first
bugs are and so one of the nice things
about using a tool like quick check is
that there's very little manual effort
involved in discovering a discrepancy
between the specification and the
implementation and then you can quickly
see okay here's a counter example there
you have to ask yourself is it a real
counter example is it a bug in the code
or is it a misunderstanding my spec
and usually go through a process of
refining the speck until you actually
have captured the intention and from
that point on the books that you find
are in the implementation so if you if
you try to start off with your spec and
assume that it's right and then try and
prove that the implementation meets it
then you're going to be doing a lot of
proof work but that may end up being
wasted because the specification was
wrong in the first place so I see using
a tool like quick check as an
appropriate step you would take before
putting in the effort of trying to do a
formal proof because I think you get a
lot of the silly mistakes in the speck
out of the way and many of the silly
mistakes in the code out of the way so
you can start trying to prove that your
implementation is correct in a good
position where it most likely is correct
hey John um last talk so I guess one of
the interesting things from my
perspective you know you're working with
Haskell in particular and you know it
doesn't provide a first-class support
for expressing the kind of properties
that you want to look for and but there
are programming languages which I do
provide support for expressing you know
pre and post conditions and other
properties that you want to check and
I'm wondering you know what you think
about languages like that as they would
help tools like quick check because
those things would be written into the
code maybe from the beginning hopefully
okay so the devil that I ran it was
actually with the add line version sure
sure sorry yes yeah and then I didn't
show you the test code but what consists
of is a state machine model of this you
know the circular buffer including
preconditions and postconditions and
state transition functions and so on so
that we've built a framework for
expressing specifications in that form
because when we started the company we
discovered our customers didn't have all
that much purely functional code and you
know the customer's always right so so
we worked on the state machine modeling
formalism so I think you're perhaps
referring to languages like Eiffel that
have contracts built in I thought would
be a good example yeah yeah and so
that can of course be helpful if an
assertion fails in code under test then
that tells you the test has failed but
in quick check we use the state machine
models not only for deciding whether a
test has passed or failed but also for
generating tests and so that means that
we need to use these preconditions in
particular in a slightly different way
if they were just if they were hidden
promise by being written in the code of
the system under test it would be harder
to use them for test case generation but
you could extract the preconditions
right having then that's what I'm
imagining yeah possibly what are the one
of the things that has worked well for
us is that quick check the version of
picture that we use is entirely black
box and that means that we can test code
in Java or C++ or whatever the very
first customer we had we managed to
crash a base station which we knew was
programmed in C++ generated from ROS RT
and the most serious crash we found we
looked in the log and it was full of
Java exceptions what whether they come
from so it turned out that we had
corrupted the state of the base station
and violates the fundamental invariant
but the base station also had and
operators GUI that was in Java and that
GUI is the first thing to fall over when
the state the base station was corrupt
and so that's how come they appeared
there and we could do that because
because the testing is blackbox all we
have to do is invoke the system on the
test using the same test interfaces that
anybody else will use for testing it and
that limits what we can do we can't
process the source code but at the same
time it gives us a great deal of freedom
in the kinds of systems that we can test
ok
let's thank the speaker again
okay and so now there's a coffee break
so we'll see you in a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
