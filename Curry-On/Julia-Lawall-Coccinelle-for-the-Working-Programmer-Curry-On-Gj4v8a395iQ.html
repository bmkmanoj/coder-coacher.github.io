and also NL is a program matching
and transformation system for C code so
the talk is going to be in two parts the
first part is going to be presenting
 and I'll showing how and pretty
here how we can use it for finding bugs
in Linux code the Linux kernel and the
second part will be describing a case
study that we did using the tool to
study the quality of Linux code over
about 10 years okay so our focus so I
would say the focus our particular
research is on linux kernel code linux
kernel happens to be written in c and
the tool is actually applicable to any
kind of see project you may need to do
some configuration to get it to your
parts project for the parsing
particularities of your project but in
general it's applicable to see in
general but we work on linux code so the
case of bugs in linux kernel linux is
critical software everybody relies on
their operating system to do the right
thing it's embedded systems desktop
servers everything from there from your
phone basically to your supercomputer
the Linux kernel is very large it's over
21,000 see files 13 million lines of
code and it also changes extremely
quickly so there's been an increase in
the code size of 32 per cents in last
four years and another feature of the
Linux kernel is it has a very very large
developer base and some people come in
just to work on one particular device
driver for example other people have
worked on the system for many many years
there's a very wide range of experience
and in this situation we can say that
bugs seem inevitable so here's a very
very simple example but one that has
come up over and over again over time
not just in Linux kernel but in other C
code bases so this is a patch so it's a
bug fix it comes from someone named
Alvaro who is someone who has long
experience with linux kernel so he can
say the ! x and y bug strikes again
so do you know what the bug is you can
see the fix so it's fairly easy to see
the problem basically the idea is Linux
programmers they work with see every day
but that doesn t mean that they actually
know how she works so there's a priority
problem the ! has higher priority than
the bit end operation and in see this is
a sort of a boolean but actually it's
just the integer and this one is also
working on integers the compiler is not
going to complain about it at all but
this value its range of values is only
going to be either 0 or 1 and that's
probably not the thing that you wanted
to be and with the other argument it
might be this is not always a bug it's
not necessarily a bug it's probably if
it's not a bug this is probably not the
best way to write it if you really
wanted a boolean and you should write a
boolean and bitmap bit and is for
selecting bits in various places and
seeing if any of them are turned on or
not so the fix as you've seen already is
we just want to remove the line on which
the problem occurs and then basically
add it back in with parentheses in the
right place so it's a very simple
problem it can have since it's changing
the flow of control I can have a strong
impact on the way your code actually
works if this particular condition
actually arises so this graph shows the
occurrences of the bug over a number of
years basically we have one line per
occurrence of the bug the blue lines are
where the bug actually exists the black
lines are where the file that contains
that bad code site does not exist yet
and the white lines the other white on
white so the white lines are where the
bug has been fixed so basically what you
see is a certain number a certain amount
of time a lot of these bugs existed then
a lot of them were fixed but then you
can see at the top of the graph that as
new particularly as new files get
introduced then people make this mistake
over and over again so what we like
would like is the idea
we've stolen from so the Java world of
write once run everywhere we want to
find once fix everywhere so you're
looking for your code base you see
something strange you fix the problem
and you think that among the 13 million
lines of code that you're trying to
maintain this part of this problem
occurred once it probably occurred a few
other times or maybe many other times so
you would like a way to find those
situations quickly so one way you can
find certain situations is use grep but
grep is not very satisfactory in our
case because the ! is very common the
anson is very common ! and an sign it's
also very common when there are two
enzymes in the boolean situation so it's
not easy to grab her and get exactly the
things that you want so we proposes a
tool called coxon l it's freely
available it's also available in a lot
of linux distributions it provides a
static analysis to find patterns in C
code it provides automatic
transformations so that when you find
bad things you can fix them at the same
time and the I think the main important
contribution of this work is that its
user scriptable based on the patch
notation so we want you we want a very
easy a low threshold to start using the
tool we want people to be able to
express patterns in terms of what
they're familiar with which is the C
code itself and we saw the patch
notation before where you remove some
things and you add some other things
this is very familiar first you lose a
diff then you can use patches also uses
the same notation and so we want people
to be able to express things in the way
they're used to already reasoning about
their code so the goal is to be it's
accessible to see developers as possible
while still being able to do interesting
things so go back to our bug so we can
think about this is a particular
instance of the bug but if we search for
this obviously we're probably not going
to find any more of them this is somehow
over specified what we would like to do
is who would like to keep the important
parts of the problem and abstract / less
important parts so that we can find
other instance
is of the global pattern and actually
Alvaro has helpfully shown us what we
should do it's basically an exclamation
point followed by some expression well
by bit and and then followed by another
expression although if you're familiar
with linux code or maybe other kinds of
code that uses bit mass for various
things you might realize that often the
negated thing is going to be a arbitrary
expression that's the thing you're
interested in studying and the other
thing is typically just the constant
that's the bit mask that you're
interested in comparing against so
basically we have for any pattern that
has this form ! e and c where e is
arbitrary and expression and c is a
particular constant we would like to add
parentheses in the right place so that's
our idea of what we want to do so in our
language basically that's how you
express the idea we say we would like to
remove any occurrences of ! NC and add
them back in with the parentheses in the
right place and we would like to also
say the e can be any expression and C
can be any constant so the idea is you
have some typical pattern of of code
some things are in our it important some
things you just want to describe some
properties of them maybe they can be any
arbitrary integer or maybe they can be a
arbitrary expression or maybe there
should be a type in a particular place
or different different kinds of patterns
of code and so we want a mixture of very
concrete things and more abstract things
so here's just example here's some
existing code here's the rule we're
going to apply this rule to our entire
code base which contains this code and
it's going to transform it into this
code yes
say so yes that's a good question so
this is exactly what it does with the
formatting of the code so one thing you
can observe up here this is extremely
strange formatting somebody felt obliged
to stay in a very small number of
columns and so it's going to match this
pattern that's all this e is going to
match this entire thing here
irrespective of new lines and spaces or
whatever so in that way since it's
different from ordinary patches on the
other hand when you remove this e and
when you add it back then it's going to
just follow its own conventions for how
to write out an expression so in this
case it has taken that the thing that
had the new line in the middle and has
put it on a single line so there are
other ways that you can write this wall
where you avoid this pattern of removing
some expression and adding it back so
actually the only thing we really need
to do is we need to match ! and then we
need to add a parenthesis and then we
need to match enc and then we need to
add parentheses and if you did that then
just the parentheses would be added in
the right place and the expression would
be left the way it is are there any
other questions just
no 4l values and our values you have to
make patterns that reflect their lvalue
pneus for example of there's sort of a
mixture of things that you can you can
refer to so one thing you can refer to
in particular is you have tight access
to type information so if it's able to
figure out type information about things
then you'll be able to reason about it
you can see you can find out that this
expression has some type T and then you
can search for t will see that later
actually we're not actually maybe we
won't but oh yeah you can reason about
the T so in sort of we fi the type and
then you can use it you can also match
some if you want all expressions except
for zero you can specify that so it's
sort of a mixture and it could be that's
something that could be extended also in
the future other questions yes
okay so you raise several issues I'll
try to address them individually so we
go back here if we look at this code
carefully here we have some things in
lowercase letters and Linux code
lowercase letters are typically
variables field names and things like
that over there we have a thing in
uppercase letters in Linux code things
in uppercase letters are typically
macros in in our particular case we
don't care whether it looks like a CPI
wmi method or not in terms of our
matching rule but you might have some
problem with this acpi wmi method
variable name and you might actually
want to match against that and turn it
into 27 maybe its current value is 0 you
don't want to turn all zeros in 227's
you only want to one turn the ones that
look like that so the Cox'n l parser
actually doesn't expand any macros
whatsoever it tries to reason about the
code in the way it looks to the
programmer so that the programmer can
write walls that match exactly with the
way the code looks there's some other
reasons for that not expending macros is
faster not only do not have to spend
time expanding macros you also don't
have to find the definitions of the
macros and if you have a very loud code
large code base with a very complicated
build system it's hard it's not so easy
to find exactly the right definition of
each macro and also actually in our
particular case we are we are removing
the constancy and then we are adding
back seat and the developer would be
quite surprised if this macro blah blah
blah ACP why whatever would turn into 27
that would not be a desirable feature so
we would like to be able to preserve
macros as we're transforming the code in
general we're placing ourselves in the
middle of a continuous development
process and a human is going to has
written the code in the beginning we
having a tool that is going to change
the code in them some intermediate step
but then humans are going to have to
manage the code after that so we want
the code to end up looking up pretty
much like what it's
with except for the thing we changed
other questions okay so this was the
first example so now I will show another
example is a bit more complicated and
shows some more complex features of the
language a bit so here we have some code
this is a issue that came up fairly
recently here we have a function and
actually there's something unsafe about
this function I don't know if anyone can
tell what's unsafe about the function
yeah
oh it does no it doesn't yeah it's
strange these are clearly two different
sizes the idea here is that we're
reading some data somehow I don't know
the details in 2d and then we want to
copy out only a part of that data into
this out variable and then we want to
clear out all of the because this data
that we got is sensitive in some way so
I think these two things should be
different one could wonder why this is
64 and why that's is it seems like it
should be much better at some particular
constant right yeah so yes there's
something I just mentioned that you
probably you probably you would rather
put the macro up here instead of 64 it
would be much safer yes so that's not
that's not actually what the problem is
the problem is here we have we do some
things we have some sensitive data in d
and so we want to clear out that
sensitive data and then we leave our
function and we have a very clever
compiler linux kernel's run with
compiled with a certain number of
optimizations our very clever compiler
says you're doing a mem set of a local
variable which is about to go out of
scope you should not be relying on there
any of the values of this local variable
why are you wasting your time traversing
all of this memory to put zeros in it
and so we will just optimize this away
yeah
yeah I don't know apparently I'm not
sure what this thing is either actually
maybe it's a macro that expands to
something that allows the compiler to
tell that nothing dangerous is happening
because it's true this is an array well
I don't I mean this is an array you are
passing it to some other function but
still the variables going out of scope
so if you have saved the pointer to this
array in some other way that's really
your problem see is not I mean it's not
a the variables which are local
variables are not allocated on the heap
so they become invalid after the end of
the function no matter what you have
tried to do with them yeah yeah
so that we have an easy solution for
this yeah optimize this away there's an
easy solution that is taken in the linux
kernel which is to define a new function
called mem 0 explicit here we do our
memset and here we do something and the
something probably depends on what
architecture coma highland is for what
compile are you using or something like
that but it doesn't matter what it is
basically we have some other function
and we want to do this use this other
function we want to use it when it's
necessary we don't want to use it when
it's not necessary because it's a sort
of strange-looking function name it's
not going to be as familiar to
programmers as memset it's probably
blocking some kind of optimizations as
well so it's it's not desirable to use
it unless we actually need it so we want
to use Cox NL to apply this
transformation to the entire linux
kernel again we can't just grab for
memset that's not going to be very
useful because there's probably millions
of mem sets and there's probably only
about actually it turns out there 30
that are actually relevant to this
problem so we don't want to look through
all the millions of them by hand to find
each one whether what should be done so
the beginning part of the transformation
is just when we have a mem set of some
identifiers X of some size that we want
to change it to memset mem 0 explicit
the X and the size we don't need 20
anymore it's not relevant so that's
pretty straightforward then we have to
declare our meta variables so I'm sort
of going through this in the way that I
might think about think about things so
I don't know you might think about doing
the transformation first you might think
about what meta variables you need first
or you might go back and forth you make
some transformation you add some more
meta variables and so on so X I have
said the X is an identifier x is not
going to be an arbitrary expression
because we want X to be a local variable
so it's just going to be an identifier
it's the only possibility and the count
is going to be some expression
so that so this is going to make our
transformation at the moment it's going
to make it everywhere we have a mem set
of a variable 20 so that's that's not
exactly what we want so we want to do it
only when it's necessary so one issue
for being necessary is that X is not
being used after this memset so we can
specify in this way so here we feel see
a feature that we didn't see before
before we only saw we're placing one
piece of code by another piece of code
here we have a dot and that dot here it
just means we start at the memset that
we find and we look at all the code that
comes afterwards and we check that there
are no X's so that was sort of idea we
need to do this transformation when this
is the last use of X before X is about
to go out of scope so then another issue
is what this X is of course if X is some
he pal a global variable for example
it's not going to go out of scope just
going to reaches the end of the function
so we need a bit more to declare what we
have done here i have now i have a type
meta variable and i declare x to be an
array so this is and i have got that out
so this is all going to be contained in
the same function so the in general each
rule applies to only a single function
if you need to do things in multiple
functions then you can define multiple
rules they'll be applied one after the
other so here we're saying we have
defined our local variable and then we
don't want to put any particular
constraints on what happens between the
Declaration and the mem set and then we
find the men sub and then there's no
more references to X afterwards so this
might look a little bit verbose what
happens by default when you say dot dot
dot if you say a data that be what it
tries to do is it tries to find the
shortest path between a and B so if you
think about locking if you say lock and
the dot thought that unlock probably
what you will get lock and unlock that
you want to match together the ones that
are closest to each other even though
your function might have quite a lot of
locking and unlocking
so that's why we have that default that
is the shortest path but that's not the
thing that we want here here what we
want is we have are going to have our
variable declaration somewhere near the
beginning of the function and the call
to memset will be that that's our goal
is that should be probably very near the
end of the function so that's why we
have to put this one any annotation yes
so the data that it just follows
whatever the control flow is so if it
has nothing to do with source code know
if there's a go-to or loops or I think I
mean it doesn't it doesn't manage the
computed go tues so that's one thing it
doesn't do but for a direct go to label
it will follow in the proper way other
questions okay so there's a little more
to this example so there's some other
issues we have to address one of them is
when you have data that then we're
saying all control flow paths or we'll
talk about control flow paths in general
and in general when you have some code
you have some x equals y a e equals B
and so on that's just going to be
straight line code there's just one
control flow path but you also have f's
you want self loops you could go around
the loop five times or four times or one
time or you have if you could go this
way or you could go that way and so in
general that when you go through a
function the control flow is going in
tree like way there are many different
paths that you could follow and so then
you can you ask yourself when you come
to this do you mean to follow all the
control flow paths or do you mean to
follow one of them what do you mean to
follow several of them what do you mean
about that and the same thing here so if
you think about this one this one seems
to pretty clearly need to be all of them
because we want to be sure that there
are no other references to X after
memset so we reach our memset and then
we want to look everywhere and see if
there are any exes so actually when we
do transformation that's what the
default is because when we do
transformation there's some sense that
we should have a consistent
understanding of our code and so we
should have the same pattern existing
along all the control flow paths so this
one will be for all but this one here
actually doesn't need to be for all this
one can just be exists so you have your
your variable reference your better
variable declaration at some point and
you want to see if there exists a path
from variable declaration to the mem
send if there exists some such
path then at the part of that memset
then you want to search in all
directions and be sure there no exes
that come afterwards and then that's
fine so here we want to exist and here
we want for all so that we need to
specify that on this day thank you so
here I just say when exists saying that
this thought should match if they just
exist a path with his property and here
i also have another annotation which is
when strict so by default actually the
next code often remember and see there's
no raising exceptions or things like
that you basically in general you go
through your function in a straight line
sort of wine perhaps with some eps along
the way but sometimes things fail you
have a if and then you return you aboard
the function and so if you want to
search for a sequence of things then you
can take some of those things fail then
it will not be the case that along all
paths you'll find all the things so we
want to ignore in general we want to
ignore the failure paths but in this
particular case we don't want to ignore
the failure paths we want to follow all
the paths because any of them might have
X in it and so we say win stripped so
now we have our rule and so we can apply
it to our code base and in general so
toxin all it does transformations for
you but in general it's a good idea to
look at the result of the transformation
see what happens and see if you're okay
with those results so in this case we
come to some code where it does the
transformation I haven't showed the key
transformation here just the code and
actually we're not satisfied with the
result in this case so do you see why
somebody said something
yes so Evie is a alias for buff because
actually we want to change the type and
so this does satisfy the pattern in the
expected way we have our variable you
have our array declaration here we have
our memset here we have no more
references to buff but since we have EV
here afterwards we do have preference EV
and so this memset the compiler is
clever enough to figure all this out so
there's no reason why we have to change
the memset that's here so to do that we
basically we have our path from the
declaration to the memset and then we
can add on some more annotations this if
we remove all of this then it will just
match anything if we want to protect
against certain kinds of things then we
can add more wins that protect against
the things that we don't want to see so
here the thing that we don't want to see
is an alias and this is has would have
the for me if some other expression is
assigned to the pointer X and people
write those point 2 x's in different
ways so coxon all it knows some things
about the semantics but in general it's
fairly tied to the syntax so if you want
to specify if there are different
possibilities then you have to specify
these different possibilities
and so the spines around my fair uses
and research
and so patches were submitted
I think there are three cases that
many more missions
like eating these are poaching a
speculative program that also basically
pattern matching second of our way to
rewrite the Silph scope they do pop and
meta means but sometimes they the rules
to do the bottom edge had somewhat
complexes so it's not feel the true I I
think to like this kind of button so I
think as you study at intermission the
purposes were different so the gold
aspect went to program is a certain goal
of modularity of concepts that you
in your code and
in this case we have neither concepts
nor the goal of this is much more the
love or we want country-specific
vulnerable patterns and
who is we want to adjust them as
p
the future forever so we don't have any
mold for example maintaining
specifications for some concepts being
separated
and I think since the goals are
different than the kinds of things that
you can express facilities
the things that we think like this might
be harder to express an esper 20
programming human aspect
Lexi flow rate
the attorney expresses
so there's some relationships
oh I suppose it should be
simple question
I think any random person okay but it
was some some person I give me some
Percival to write the the support for
the holdings in another guy would try to
to check the school with some profits
using proxy men so that's not it it's
not necessarily I mean the examples I
channeled are for about 20 when it's
just a language for expressing transfer
parenting transformations on see all
these people use it for what
so on the one hand inside the Linux
kernel is that directory that contains
about 15 rules and they're getting
applied to an external every day and so
that's because one usage case another
usage case that i found out of battery
recently is somebody he maintains a
device driver or keywords in health
devices the right device drivers and
actually this is highly grounder
confident that he's community but
actually he only wants to write one
device driver and then he wants to
automatically make a Linux version and
windows version and
other situations
and so he uses cops enough to take his
generic device driver and principal
so who knows his coke he knows what
country right
he writes his own code in the beginning
rules to transform them into different
targets
feel just as a community people surface
in tourneys into just use intelligence
it s like a ditcher
liberal in my project titles and people
to contact our people this book or
something thank you define some of the
truth let us check my link check my
micro play ball in the test yeah so
that's I mean the hope of finding idea
is something like that so you can make
fairly elaborate rules you can harden
them over time because maybe is positive
as you find them you can adjust these
rules easily to avoid those cases and
then you can hook them in with your med
system and then every time you run your
here
so that's one use actually the original
uses not for work funding and all the
original uses to support a software
evolution and so if you have certain
functions and you want to modernize them
it's always so maybe a function the one
of the original examples is function it
takes a new argument to find whether
it's being called weather with
interrupts well turned on or turned off
and so then you want to add the new
argument and then you have to do
something like what I've done here with
the doctor thought the context
properties to see whether the interrupts
have been turned on or turned off so
that you can choose what the new
argument should be so that's that's not
something that you would want to
integrate in your commit system that's
something you want to write your world
and you want to just apply it to your
good and then you
is gone there's different uses
in general it's useful for any time you
want to interact with C code and you
don't want to figure out SP for your C
code or want to invest it your language
at a very low level people things that
it's not good for other things like
alias analysis implementing an alias
analysis personnel would be kind of
you can't propagate things over
arbitrary distances so you can propagate
the value of the variable phone you can
say x equals a and then you can
recognize later a use of X as being a
representation of it but that's not
going to get you from x equals a B
equals x equals B and so on an arbitrary
number becomes that image
much more complicated so we're not
trying to replace you suddenly space for
handwritten analyses that do
we're trying to make a lightweight
language so I had a visit about the
weight of the style what you're doing
and to me it seems that being extremely
selective is a core point you can
tolerate to have some negative because
they are basically going to stay in
happy I found and when
tomorrow you can tolerate to have false
positives because you're looking at each
of these
even exchanges not only looking at the
dick and in selecting them but that
basically means you have to select in
such a way that we get dirty hits of 13
million lines of code not 30,000 so he
can work with this trade-off between the
possible positives and very very
selective results very small result sets
yes it's a good point
crear sorry this is a big deal to just
work on linux code including
ways and in general I have some idea I
may write a fairly generic pattern idea
and I may find out just like it's going
to give five thousands of something the
lazy and I interested in
but then I look through something that I
co the real problem is when there's an X
in the first argument at this moment so
then you can easily adjust your wall to
throw an X in the first argument a
project and then maybe you've got down
to 15 results in between texts internet
there's actually some wise people linux
kernel
if you send a catch that affects more
than 15 files something
things in small way
works well with that because you would
be as you're saying you can be very
specific and then you
another one of the difficulties faced
these particulars they have massive
master
able to pour all these different left
yet only some of those configurations
will ever actually occurred on you ever
running wolf on Android and something
else was a nun does continental have any
particular support for configuration
models to do with if I have a lot of
false positives that occur if you assume
that this devastated this one is that
but that's not actually a valid
configuration yes so we do nothing
however we all do nothing we going to do
anything the relationships between
that's basically what happened is able
nicely organized then example you just
have a statement then it will make
something powerful back that reflects
that you can't actually fall through
but if it's not able to do that then it
just keeps it festers comments and then
it won't think that you can walk to the
other and we will get some positive so
again there's a great off the advantage
of the personal approach is that you can
scan really really can't scan the entire
purpose not just to x86 and you can find
bugs in poverty C code or other more
obscure our first offense many people or
study or
as many cause want to run a secret
process
to get full type information
just a mystery
so it seems as far as i can tell the
language the consonant support isn't
seeing her safe but rather see extended
with certain kinds of uses of
preprocessor to develop fair
characterization so there's some taxes
to with your SSN ok what's the problem
then this is paper actually it's written
about these accidents and the CC
conference musical
if something that being a paper means is
my fax anymore there is a life basically
you can't actually give a configuration
but it gives you definition suppose so
we got some strange macros that are
interfering with a parsing you can cause
them to just ignore and that's a way
that you can generally get lots of
different projects
this is very similar to one want to I
don't know a long time ago I use the
tools sill I don't know if you're
familiar with that or not and it's a
tool written by George Nicola you have a
st you have some visitors and anything
you want to do you first you think about
what you want to do you want to match x
equals y and someone like that and then
you spend maybe half an hour looking for
through the documentation to find out
what are the different AST nodes that
correspond to the thing that you want to
do so if since we wanted to talk to real
Linux developers as opposed to
programming language developers or
compiler writers we wanted to get away
from AST we want to get away from
documentation we wanted to be as
intuitive as possible so I don't know if
we've succeeded or failed but we do
actually have linux developers who use
the tool and other developers of other
software who use the tool so I think for
at least some courageous people we have
succeeded maybe we could do better in
the future on the other hand put in they
from the completely different
perspective clang has access to a lot of
analyses that we don't have access to
and that's either positive or negative
depending on what you want to do so the
people who work on worked on and
i'll come from a long program analysis
program manipulation sort of background
and there was a feeling that analyses
are good because they give you
information but analyses are also bad
because analyses they're necessarily
incomplete or in Sun sound or have some
deficiencies necessarily and it's very
hard for users to understand exactly
what the analysis does and users can get
frustrated when they don't understand
why they're not getting the results that
they expect out of the tool so there's a
quite a trade-off if the more
sophisticated your analysis the less
easy it is for the user to understand
what the analysis can and can't do and
so our solution was dunno analysis
everybody can understand no analysis is
done if you want some kind of alias
analysis you can do a cheap alias an
hour
sis by specifying exactly what happens
in the code but the only thing that is
going to happen is the things that you
see in the code so but it's it's a
different design decision it's not one
is better than the other see we are
running out of time okay this point I
need more questions yes so especially
coming back to the exclamation x and y
bug so let's say I've identified it in
15 locations in my code and out of that
I'm not sure there are like five
locations which some developer has
developed so would woodcuts anel kind of
give me a log of the places that is
changed so that some developer who comes
in and says that this place I really
meant exclamation x and y so I don't
want this change so will there be a log
of these changes that were made okay so
what happens is by default in hell
does not actually change your code it
just prints out a patch and then you can
study your patch and then you can apply
the patch to your code so if there's
some parts of the patch that you feel
doubtful about then you can just remove
them the patch syntax it's extremely low
level naive and flexible and so if you
just remove part of a patch it's fine
there's no checksum or anything like
that you can just apply the rest of the
patch to your code and it goes away
simply
