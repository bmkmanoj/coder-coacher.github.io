email from someone with a pretty amazing
offer and I had to like read it several
times because it just seemed too good to
be true
and what this guy told me is that he's
managing the bank account of the late
Muammar Gaddafi and it has 20 million
euro in it and if I just worked with him
like he has no next of kin so if I
worked with him then he'll give me half
the money he just needs me to send some
money up front to to help move the
process along which is like it seemed a
bit dodgy a bit like I'll get 10 million
for it so it seems fine right and like
some of you already figure out of course
this is a scam like this a classic type
of advanced fee scam I give them the
money I'll never hear from them and if
you see this right it's obvious no these
will be just email you saying like here
have 10 million euro and and it's not
just that it's obvious to us it's at the
very idea that someone might fall for
them too many of us it's just a joke
it's like it's laughable we discard them
straight away and when I started telling
this a lot of you already figured out
that like there's clearly some kind of
scam going on and that it's probably a
joke but the reality is that people do
actually vote for this and they fall for
many other kinds of things like phishing
emails with lots of typos and other
dodgy looking things and the reason it's
funny to many of us that work in tech
and that it's
you
and that means that it creates a
responsibility for all of us to be
empathic to other people's needs and
situations which is really hard and
which we do very poorly in fact and they
are very difficult problems like none of
this can solve none of us can solve all
these things on our own but we do all
have a chance to make an impact and in
this talk I want to show you some of the
why and how so I jumped right at the
start and many of you don't know me so
I'll quickly introduce myself if you see
me on the internet I'm either of those
two squirrels they have a long story
ask me later day to day I work for -
care which is a small Python and Django
development company in Amsterdam I also
do a lot of work in the community around
Django which is the most popular Python
web framework so I'm a general team
member I ran X conferences and part the
code of conduct team for Django and I do
a lot of other things and the best way
people have ever tried to insult me on
the Internet is when they called me a
neoliberal emotional crusader because I
cared about people's well-being so the
first thing is that empathy is something
that all of us already know like it's
something we all experience when you
feel for someone who is in emotional
physical pain if you have no empathy at
all this I can't help you with this hope
because your problems are more
complicated but for example if a
developer that you work with they've
been staring at their screen
uninterrupted they're wearing their
headphones Earnest they don't see this
moving are their fingers then many of
you can for me to figure out what that's
like they are just very focused writing
something and this is a very poor time
to disturb them
empathy though is also definitely not
something exact because our perception
of other people's feelings and their
experiences and their emotions is
horribly incomplete and inaccurate in
all of us and that means we will make a
lot of errors even if we try to do our
best and it's worse because it's not
just full of error it is also full of
error in a particular direction because
it's full of bias as well because when
you try to understand someone else's
emotions you consider them from we
consider from our own perspective and we
all have our own experiences our
memories and the feelings and emotions
and situations that relate to that and
it is through our own experience that we
understand that we relate to those of
others but introduce a lot of bias
because how we relate to other people's
feelings is biased by the ones who
experience ourselves and the bigger the
difference between our experiences and
those of someone else the harder it is
for us to understand them and the more
likely it is that we make that
assumptions across confucian or even for
people like my example of working focus
with your headphones on and am busy
typing and you work in office
environments maybe you're used to people
not getting it and disturbing you and
you might think like why don't these
people get it right
surely and and of course like it's
obvious to you if you've done this and
it's obviously someone who does the same
kind of work like you it's someone it's
obviously when your colleague does that
because in that part of their behavior
they are similar to you but not everyone
is like people who don't do this kind of
work they don't always realize what
they're doing like it's much harder for
them to realize what the impact is on
someone else because they don't have
that shared experience
and that creates a lot of frustration
it's like one of the most common
complaints I get from developers that
they always complain about if they
worked in offices um but I don't
actually think these people that this
rug others work are malicious it's more
like that they lack the experience that
someone else has and that makes it much
harder for them to empathize it makes it
easier for them to forget how important
it is to someone
unless they put in a lot more effort a
lot more effort than they would need to
empathize with things they have share
and this is a really common issue and it
goes both ways all the time like we're
hurt by people that don't understand us
but we do this to other people also like
teaching someone something
this is especially something you know
very well yourself it's hard to imagine
what it's like for someone who doesn't
know anything about it it's why I am
reluctant to take part in places where
beginners to learn how to code this
really there's such a distant experience
I have no idea what that's like
for me that's I don't know 10 15 years
ago so it is so remote for me that it's
much harder for me to understand someone
who does this for the first time but
there's a lot of this outside of tech as
well
there's yearly holiday in the
Netherlands which is where I come from
and it's called sinter Klass and this is
simple class and by definition of the
holiday es a white older bearded man he
writes his white course over the roofs
of all the houses and then his helpers
take gifts down the chimney to the
children and his helpers also by
definition I look like this so we have
all these people working for someone who
by definition is a white bearded dude
and all his helpers wear
pitch black makeup often with bright LED
lips golden earrings things like that
and this is a very old holiday I grew up
with this as a child and the story
people tell children is like oh yes yes
they're black is no it's nothing to do
with skin colour it's because of the
suit of the chimney it's a little
dubious any reason you have been a lot
of protest against this which I think
super totally makes sense that there's
like even if it wasn't intended that way
this has really strong racist undertones
below Dutch people they don't understand
thoroughly and they say aiyah
but I didn't mean it in a racist way
like this this might be basically a a
white dude who owns a bunch of slaves
essentially that even look identical to
the slaves from Dutch colonial history
which is I don't know we didn't mean it
racist so it isn't racist it's fine
there's no problem here
but a very important thing when we when
we do things that affect other people is
that intense essence magic it's like
intense can explain so much behavior but
it doesn't suddenly make it okay there
is an important difference between
people who behave maliciously and people
who are just inept that don't realize
what they're doing and there's also not
a binary division like there's a large
gray area also but I think the
distinction is useful because
maliciousness and in-app behavior happen
for different reasons and they also
benefit from a different approach
for example this from a chat or someone
said hey folks do you think it's safe to
use third-party apps to integrate with
PayPal and so on I said yes unless
you're taking them from not to China
Russia or Nigeria
I don't consider racial stereotyping as
being racist but you wouldn't be wrong
to be suspicious about it and I think
this is a great example of what I like
to call maliciousness or these behavior
where no reasonable person could argue
this was within the code of conduct of
that space or in any other way okay
these people are just the a bit
up and I don't actually think any of
them believe that their behavior was
welcoming or the kind of the kind of way
that we want to treat each other inside
the community I do believe they didn't
care but I don't believe they didn't
know so these are the kind of people
that would call me a new liberal
emotional Crusader another example is
someone who said I bet even Pro
developers have good intentions and
someone replying they are good at hiding
it and it's like I like this example of
enough people because like imagine your
core developer and you're considering to
start doing Python also and the very
first thing you see your first
interaction with our community which is
often amazing this you see this and it's
like yeah I'm going to keep doing this
it's like will P can I still do pro and
Python it's like I just also don't
really get to joke but it's also just
and welcoming it's not it's not the way
we would want to approach especially
newcomers in our community but I think
these people weren't maliciously trying
to exclude Pro developers I think they
were just a party to Livius to the
effect this can have on other people and
like I said intent isn't magic doing
something because you didn't necklace
doesn't certainly make it okay but it's
different from doing things maliciously
it's why in code of conduct you always
see that there's a whole range of
resolution options and many things are
handled with very light measures and
speaking of codes of conduct I do feel
very strongly about having them I
wouldn't have come here if this converse
didn't have one and I'm a very vocal
after that and my position is basically
this if you refuse to adopt a code of
conduct it displays an appalling lack of
even the slightest interest or awareness
making people feel safe or welcome in
York
because to me like if people can't be
bothered to write down that harassment
in the community isn't okay
you are basically permitting it and
because of my somewhat strong views
sometimes I end up in discussions with
people who have somewhat different views
SMS every skeptic on the whole idea
conduct is full of sexist and harassment
and gender that people really act as
savages before these last few years wave
of political correctness isn't be kind
be polite towards other people enough
and know people didn't actually act as
savages before this wave of political
correctness and in an ideal world
telling people be kind be polite
wouldn't it be enough but I've noticed
when I have these conversations with
people that when I explain them more and
share more experiences for myself and
other people they sort of start
understanding why it's such an important
starting point but not enough on its own
but a good place to start and I found
that a lot of these things come down to
a fundamental aspect of being part of a
community that least before/after
unaware of and that that an awareness
and their lies about their initial
skepticism things which are so obvious
to me that I didn't realize other people
didn't know so that's also an empathy
issue and this this missing
understanding relates to the examples I
I talked about before of the scams that
is also a failure of empathy in a way
not because people are malicious but
because it's really hard and maybe it's
something you haven't noticed before
either which is that things can be very
very different if you're part of
minority or marginalized group whether
it's a visible or an invisible way
because like I said understanding people
who are less like you is harder that a
lack of understanding disproportionately
affect marginalized people both inside
tech and without this issue goes way
beyond technology and has a fundamental
but often overlooked role in the way we
interact with each other because our
empathy towards others is so biased from
our own experiences and if you haven't
experienced this then you can be
entirely unaware of it even with your
best intentions and have a very
different interpret
this isn't a binary thing either like
there are many kinds of marginalized
groups there's massive variation in the
people inside them already so everyone's
experiences are still individually very
different and also people who are part
of some marginalized groups can forget
all of this when referring to other
groups also and one of the reasons for
this is that our community doesn't exist
in a vacuum which means there are things
that happen outside of our community
they influence all the attitudes the
experiences and perceptions of people
inside the community and that happens
even if inside the community space
everyone is being nice and for a little
much nice groups it's like things inside
our communities aren't always so great
but things outside our community can
often be worse in many ways for example
this map all the countries in dark red
if I enter these countries there I may
not leave them alive because they have
legislation to execute me all the
slightly ridership slightly lighter red
will have imprisonment somewhere between
10 years and life and there's like a
bunch of other dodgy places too and the
reason for this is that I'm not straight
I'm queer I like people and that is a
reason for all these countries to want
me that and if I enter them that is a
real possibility and this is even
extremely optimistic feel because you
see the u.s. here in green even though
the by the President believes I should
be electroshock therapy into becoming
straight the Vice President and of
course Chechnya which is has actual
literal concentration camps now that
rival the once the Nazis had so that's
like this map is very optimistic and
slightly outdated another thing you may
follow is how many states in the u.s.
are trying to make it unsafe for trans
people to use a bathroom and it's
something that bothers me also because
other than being an emotional crusader
I'm also a non-binary which means the
under means nothing to me I just do
whatever I want and that also means i
express freely around gender norms and
it's gotten easier than me sent away
from men's bathrooms and the other day I
told you the tenant nearly fell off her
seats because she couldn't figure out
which bathroom I should go to it's like
it's not necessarily with how I appear
now it'll still even as confusing
because I did a lot more like that
picture than that one
and I don't actually have any violence
yet that I definitely have very
threatening behavior and casual or
estimate is just by pretty common and
when I say that way it might sound
pretty dark and sometimes it's yeah it's
not so much fun but I'm still in a very
privileged and lucky position compared
to a lot of other people and there's
nice things to which I'll get back to
and you might wonder now like why am I
even talking about this like surely like
house is relevant to you because I think
it's actually quite likely if nobody in
this room wants to execute me for my
sexuality or gender identity
I think it's pretty safe bet some people
might disapprove but whatever but even
if everyone's perfectly nice it's still
not the same because that experiences
they don't just disappear when you enter
the conference building it's something
that you carry with you and also in your
expectations and it can make it much
harder to feel welcomed or included or
safe which is not only for typically
marginalized groups but also for people
who for example had a history with abuse
it can be hard for them to trust people
or to trust certain kinds of people even
if all these people are perfectly nice
and I saw a tweet recently have captured
as well so it's a little dark there's
nothing worse than being able to hear
the hate in your own head even before
anyone has had a chance to speak when
you can't escape it even when everyone
around being nice because it's
everywhere
this is a bit stronger than I feel but I
recognize this general theme and I think
it shows why sometimes in order to make
people especially marginalized groups to
feel really welcome it's not just don't
actively harass them it is going beyond
just being nice it is winning their
trust
even after bad experiences in spaces
that are very similar to ours and the
long list of actually all examples of
awful behavior but I had to cut them all
out for time my first draft of this talk
was 1/2 hours
and also if I would do that we would
stand here the rest of the day and
everyone would just feel miserable so
let's not do that
but I can talk about these issues for
hours so if you're interested in
learning more than ask me later but what
I am trying to say is if you are being
nice to everyone then that's great and
you should keep doing that because it's
good but it doesn't mean that we're done
there the Edit applies to me as much as
to anyone else in our community because
even though I may be part of some
marginalized groups I'm much as much at
risk of forgetting about others and
having bias in my own empathy the issues
I also talk about they're not something
that you can just opt out of like
whether it's about situations for
marginalized people or empathy with
people different in general some people
have told me like oh you know like we
both this we just want to focus on the
code and can you and your friends just
fix our community in the mean time and
that's not how it works because there is
no such separation because we're all
part of how everyone else feels in our
community and we're part of every
interaction and that doesn't limit the
self necessary to our community and to
our social interactions because it
affects our products to the things we
design and make are just as much
effected and they also they also set
examples values to other people and ever
I think it's essential that we really
strive for diversity and inclusivity in
every aspect because if we know that the
more different someone is from ourselves
the harder it is for us to empathize
them it means if we make things or
design things or resource things with
teams that are made of all the same
people we're going to make things that
work really well for exactly those kinds
of people and much likely to work for it
for anyone who is even the slightest
difference and I say every aspect lives
there are so many angles students even
beyond race and gender there's things
like health status income situation
housing education opportunities having
children and ton of other things that
that make people's experience different
and I really like this hiring approach
I'm pushing people to think less about
culture fit and more about culture adds
how will a new hire adds to the culture
because a lot of us including myself in
in still quite a few ways are in very
luxurious and privileged positions like
I don't have to worry about how I'm
going to pay for my dinner tonight I
don't have to worry about who's going to
take care of my children while I'm at
this conference and so having diverse
people on a stage on your team in your
community and actually listening to them
gives perspectives that would never have
occurred to you and would never have
occurred to me because f is harder to
understand people like you is harder for
me to understand people that do have
issues about how are they gonna pay for
foods tonight on the other hand there's
no way I would ever build anything that
has a gender selection field that's not
inclusive of queer people because that's
something very close to me and I know
that it's important so we design
products in teams with poor diversity
and therefore for empathy were more
likely to create things that work well
for us and fill for others in which can
sometimes have very serious impacts this
is the photo of a driveway of a house in
Fort Wayne Kansas in the US and this is
a broken toilet which was left in their
driveway as some sort of vague threat by
an old strangers and there the house in
the back there has also been a visited
or shirt by the FBI by federal marshals
looking for escaped convicts by IRS
collectors by the police looking for
runaway children and all kinds of things
like that and they find like random
people walking around their property at
least every few weeks so one of these
people do to deserve that they must be
horrible people it turns out there's a
geolocation database called max minds
and they they estimate locations for IP
addresses are like where's this computer
actually located and for about 600
million addresses they can actually
figure out anything more than it's
somewhere in the US like we don't even
know which state like summer in the US
and they also have latitude longitude so
they pins right in the center
geographical center of the US ran with
the numbers and that's this driveway and
these view of course don't know about
this
relocation databases they run a farm and
so they even seemed off to generalists
who discovered all of this and they went
to max mindset like hey you know like
these people have been harassed for
years because of you and you said aiyah
you know it didn't occur to us that
you'll use this database to attempt to
locate people down to a household level
we have always advertised it as being a
city or zip code level so it didn't
occur to them letting people query your
databases for IP others and you give
them a location the police will raid
that house Silicon Valley is full of
wonderful examples of all of this one of
my favorites is Apple health which
members is health care data things like
and when it launched its recs things
like heart rate and weights or the
obvious also less common ones like blood
alcohol cholesterol inhaler use but
there was something interesting missing
which wasn't just metric relevance to
some obscure disease but something very
obvious because somehow the entire team
that decided what to include in here
forgets to include that about half the
world ministries as somebody in their
life because it didn't live to track
that which is something people have been
tracking longer than the telephone has
existed but it took them a full year to
actually add this which as one of the
most commonly tracked health statistics
there's a lot of issues around security
also if you dismiss threats related to
local access or knowing a victim's
password spend 15 minutes with any
divorce lawyer in 2017 because security
design is also often full of assumptions
about what is important what is a likely
scenario because the scenarios that
affect me and the products I make they
can be very different from those 400
people in ways that are just not obvious
to me at all
and also they are love assumptions about
the impacts if people if security is
compromised
so Ashley Madison is a dating site it's
marketed to people who want to cheat on
their partner data use this slogan
anymore so I had to dig this out and in
2015 all their account data was breached
there was 30 million people with
accounts there and most of it was
published also and your first thought
and definitely even mine at the time I'd
be like I know this people is deserve it
for cheating on their partner right it's
just like ya can't do the time don't do
the crime and that was definitely the
group the site was marketed for but they
were not the only people using it
because as a site for finding partners
discreetly it was also used by gay
people especially in countries where
they're not so accepting so the Brits
have data and the published data
included over a thousand accounts of men
looking for other men in countries where
just the fact that you're looking is
punishable but crocheting prison
whipping or death so yeah that changes
the perspective a little and there are
so many more vulnerable groups where
even with the best intentions it is very
easy to harm them
so one of the things that's also very
important for the health of a community
is having role models and representation
because a huge factor for those people
and figuring out whether they can do
something is whether they see someone
else do it also and that the closer that
person that other person is to you in in
terms of who they are the more that
believe is instilled in yourself and
especially people who grew up in a
culture of exclusion or like a place
where you were told you can't do things
you're not supposed to be this way which
might be because of gender because of
the place where you grew up because of
unsupportive parents people who have
been through abusive relationships and
that can make it really hard for people
to believe in themselves and and their
abilities to do things and that makes it
so important that especially these
people have someone to prove that even
in their circumstances it can still be
done this is like one of the main
reasons for me to be open about
sexuality and gender identity because I
know there are other people in
communities that can relate to that and
that's why I'm open despite the risks
because I know that it might help
someone else feel less alone than I once
did and it has in the past and also show
that you can still do all these things
and I talked before about this in a dark
way
that one of my favorite things at once
you do things outside of traditional
expectations of gender is that it can
really change other people's perspective
on it's - and one of my favorite things
is that some of my friends when they see
me do things they certainly feel
themselves more comfortable expressing
the way they actually want to they've
always wanted to do that they just
thought that wasn't something you could
do and as soon as they see someone else
do it there oh wait if I can do it
yeah if I that they can do it too
because they see me do it but I can only
be a very small part in that but for
every person that is a role model
someone else other people perhaps that
you'll never know about they will feel
more comfortable being themselves in
this community and being part of it and
they will throw in others too like them
and that will make it so much easier for
us to find that culture act right
culture fit another way to make a big
impact for groups that we easily forget
is to try to be someone's hero from time
to time and those are it sounds like a
very big thing and a huge responsibility
but it doesn't really take that much for
example if people say hurtful things
about someone it can be very hard for
the victim to bring that up I know this
well from experience and it's an
opportunity for other people to rise up
and offer assistance and it's also
something that I've experienced before
like they can talk to the person who
said hurtful things they can help the
person it was set to talk together it's
something that basically is also one of
the roles of a code of community and so
just about marginalized groups and in
the individual cases but also to any
group that we easily forget like I know
it's not actually realistic to represent
every kind of group in every possible
team because there are just too many
diverse people but when your team makes
something you can be the person that
says like hey you know we could just
like if we invest another hour to we
could fix all the accessibility issues
in here and it can be used not just by
people who are blind but also people who
are visually impaired people who have
yeah all kinds of issues so in a way
anyone can make the amplified voices
from people that are part of those
Forgotten groups it's basically like
this sweet love to everyone in my life
who is actively trying to change you
guys to something more inclusive it's
hard and it means a lot to me and in a
way I would like to encourage you to
make use of your privilege as an
opportunity because having privilege
makes it easier to be inept and
oblivious even an intentionally and I do
this too a lot I'm sure but it can also
give you a lot more power because it can
mean you can get away with things that
others can't that they will accept a
more aggressive tone from you that they
won't dismiss your opinions so easily
which means you can be a more powerful
hero for others like for me because I'm
sort of self-employed people complaining
to my employer about me is not a concern
at all so I can say a lot more
controversial
things because I don't have that risk at
all where other people moderate
themselves a lot because people might
complain to their employer I'm not
saying that privilege is a good thing
it is very endemic to our society so but
it is definitely something that we can
use for good as well and when you're
trying to be a hero for yourself for
someone or for some group or just trying
to understand people more different from
you there is a very important skill
which is to listen and when it comes to
this subject there one issue that I
almost always see coming back and it's
the reason I stay quiet very often about
things which is not believing people
there when someone says like oh you know
this thing happened and it was very
hurtful to me that's one else as well if
I were in that situation it would not
have hurt me therefore I don't believe
you were hurt this is not something we
do consciously this is something that
that's just like it is also a fear of
empathy because in your situation you
will have been hurt by that and then
it's it's easy to jump to the conclusion
that they are wrong that they are that
they can be hurt or people get doubt
that a thing happen at all because like
surely that would never happen or they
get blamed for it themselves because
like surely you asked for it in a way
and you might be surprised or perhaps in
all those you've been through how
typical it is for people to simply deny
experiences and feelings that happens
orders of other people and as I saw
recently in a tweet if you don't hear
about your friends and colleagues
experiences with sexism chances are they
don't think it's safe to share them with
you if you think the explanation rather
is they don't experience sexism they are
right to think so and this also means
that we need to make it safe for people
to ask to ask for help to ask for things
because a lot of people including
definitely me can be very reluctant in
asking for things we need it's actually
it was a whole section of the tour of
talk I tore it last year but we need
more than just me telling you to
dedicate to ask for help
we need to make actual spaces where it
feels that way where people trust
they'll be listened to
where they won't be ridiculed and when
we ask for help people might and they
probably have sad or implies that you
were dumb for not knowing this or that
if there's relates to feelings they
might have accuse you of being
oversensitive or easily offended you
shouldn't talk about this and it makes
it harder to do it next time with but it
also means that to make changes in all
these kinds of aspects we can also start
small like it doesn't always have to be
a massive multi-year project it can be
as simple as something like saying
that's that we want to underline that
carry on is a place where you can ask
any question competently whoever you are
and I really like seeing this mill
because this is something like it that
comes from the organizers it sets a
standard it sets an expectation of
behavior that asking questions is okay
now I mentioned a lot of examples in
this talk of people who might be more
sensitive or more vulnerable to certain
things that we do people that we forget
about in our communities people for whom
there something about their situation
which can be such a variety of things
that makes it harder for other people to
empathize with them makes it harder for
them to feel at home in a community and
I've shared some of the things that I
think can help but I can only be a small
part like there's a lot more stories to
tell there's a lot more to learn and
with every person that shares their
story we gain a bit of new perspective
and that's lets us gain a bit of empathy
let's just understand the next person
better and when I wrote the abstracts
for the first version of this talk I
thought I was just going to get like
here's like the 10-point to-do list on
how to be an empathic person and like
you just do these things and we're done
and as I started writing it I realized
that it was nothing like that at all and
it was nowhere near so simple because
people aren't actually quite so simple
they're really complicated and so what
I've tried to do here is not just give
you a simple to-do list for like do this
and you're empathic rather I hope that
some of the stories are shared some of
the ideas that I've told you will
inspire you to think a bit more about
people who are different from you people
from different backgrounds having been
through different things in their life
just sort of think not only about how
you would perceive something that you're
doing that how people from different
places might
that and I also hope that came an
inspiration to others perhaps you to
share some of your own story to share
what the world looks like from your
place and how it might be different from
from mine and sharing these kind of
stories opening ourselves up to learn
from other people's stories is a kind of
vulnerability which is often something
we consider a danger at that word and
weakness but I don't think that's always
true there's a TED talk with this title
and of the part I like is I know that
vulnerability is kind of the power of
shame and fear and our struggle for
worthiness but it appears it's also the
birthplace of joy of creativity of
belonging and of law and I'm not trying
to force you to be vulnerable like it's
always okay to set your own boundaries
choose for yourself first
it's a not selfish to help yourself
before you help others and none of this
is easy there's a lot of gray areas I
don't have simple answers to a lot of
these things at least not as simple as
I'd sometimes like but compassion and
empathy can be their most valuable
exactly when they are very difficult and
sometimes it's also easier to treat
others with that kind of gentleness and
compassion than to do the same for
ourselves because we will make mistakes
when it comes to this life even if you
have the best intentions if you look at
this and all the other talks around this
area we all make mistakes I make
mistakes and people might call you out
on them they might suggest ways for you
to do better and then sometimes that
feels like they're attacking you it
might feel uncomfortable and then maybe
our first response is easily to to try
to fight it and to try to fight them for
what they're saying sometimes you might
end up calling out other people because
they knew things which which don't feel
okay to you and I've been on all sides
of this plenty of times and I can say
that it is definitely hard and we will
absolutely make mistakes when it comes
to empathy but when we do let's try to
look at them as opportunities to learn
and to grow and to gain a new
perspective that lets us understand
other people better in the future
because for us to error to to learn to
grow is simply the cost of being human
so I almost made it there's just two
more things I want to share with you
together with this is vaguely related
together with my friend
I run a project called open source
happiness packets is a it is itself an
open source platform as a very simple
platform to reach out to people that you
appreciate or to whom you're thankful in
open source or research or whatever
communities you can send your messages
anonymous if you want and some people
prefer that we have almost 500 messages
sent so far if people opt in it both
sides opt in we publish the messages
also and so we have a happiness archive
a few dozen messages and I'm sure there
are people in this community in your
work in other interaction that you have
that you are grateful to that you do
admire and so I encourage them you to
send them a happiness packet because it
makes a huge difference not just to that
person but also to yourself and also I
had lots of happiness packet stickers
another thing is there is a list of
non-binary gender like me or Envy for
short speakers in tech there are 63
people on it I don't run this list to be
clear but if you're running a conference
I have a look at it and see if there
there's people with their expertise
listed there and there's literally
enough people in here to fill three
entire conferences sort of look at that
I won't be taking questions now because
questions about the service are usually
too complicated to do in setting like
this but feel free to approach me
anytime I'm here the rest of the day
with any questions about anything I
touch upon at all if you can find me
tweet me and thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
