started but i wanted to really quickly
explain the the chest timer rules so
despite with this chest hanger here says
really the speaker has 20 minutes in the
audience has 20 minutes chats timer is
stupid and says 25 so five minutes is
zero just remember that but so 20
minutes 20 minutes and the rule is in
the first five minutes the audience
cannot interrupt the presenter because
he needs a little bit cyan't explain
what talking about but after that you
know basically it's your job to help him
get to the full 40 minutes of the of the
top slots so please interrupt them I
mean if there's anything slightly
unclear it's your opportunity to jump up
be like nope I don't get it please can
you try again and then you can you know
go through it again or you know there's
some interesting things that he didn't
mention maybe he did this deliberately
so that you ask but this is supposed to
be interactive so after sitting there
just like sleeping you're not doing it
right you're going to kind of jump up
and try to try to try to get something
going some conversation going so at this
point I will I will see to Frank hi
everyone my name is Frank and I'm a PhD
student mitc sale so thanks for having
me today at curry on so I'm gonna
present on my research a system called
sieve and it provides cryptographically
enforced access control for user data in
untrusted clouds this talk is based on a
paper that was published in this year's
NSD I conference so I'm going to provide
an overview of the work and some little
bit of technical details of course i
won't be able to go through everything
and you can find more details on the
paper on my website which is Frank
wearing org so to motivate sieve so
let's consider the following scenario so
user has a Fitbit that collects data on
her fitness like her heart rate number
of steps miles run etc and this data is
now stored on the Fitbit server which
acts as the user's storage provider now
she wants to share a different
subsets of this data with various
services so for example she might want
to send only her running time for the
New York Marathon to New York Marathon
service to participate in the
leaderboard where she might want to send
her running times for other marathons to
the Boston Marathon for qualification
purposes and she might want to send
parts of her fitness data every month to
her insurance company to receive a
discount and the list can go on however
there's a major security issue in that
model a curious storage provider who's
logged in or an external attacker like a
hacker can leak sensitive user data from
the server well one naive approach is
that users can always encrypted data
before storing it in the storage
provider however in order to give the
New York Marathon access to your data
she now has to give the New York
Marathon her key this is problematic
because now the New York Marathon can
access all her data because has the key
for all the data so this approach allows
the user to securely store her data but
the question is how does the user
selectively disclose your data well the
user can always another approach is that
to encrypt each piece of data
individually and distribute subsets of
these keys however a Fitbit is
constantly generating new data and all
that data needs to be encrypted with
different keys so now the user is stuck
managing all these keys so the question
is can we build a system that does is
better this leads to our research system
which is civ it's a new platform that
allows users to both selectively and
securely disclose their data some of the
features of civ is that it protects
against server compromise it hides key
management from users as reasonable
performance we support revocation and
it's particularly useful for services
that analyze large amounts of user data
so here's an outline for the rest of the
talk I'll talk about different
components of civ the protocol some
optimizations we make
revocation then I'll go on to talk about
the implementation and valuation so here
I'll present an overview of the system
not with all the kind of crypto elements
involved yet but just to kind of give
you a sense of what the system looks
like overall and what components are
involved so SIV has three main
principles there's the user the storage
provider which stores the user data and
web services which analyzed the user
data there are three main components and
civ there's the sieve user client the
sieve storage Damon and the sieve data
import module so to relate this back to
the original example the storage
provider would just be the Fitbit cloud
server and the web services are the
Boston Marathon service New York
Marathon insurance companies etc etc so
first the user using the civ user client
tags and encrypts your data with
attributes that represent access for
future web services and sentences data
to the storage provider so this data can
either be generated by the user directly
or by a device like a wearable and when
the user first visits a web service
generates a decryption key that
corresponds to a policy on the types of
data the service can access and gives us
key to the web service so later in this
talk will show how we can revoke the web
services access so now the web service
has the ability to download and decrypt
users data so the user send the web
service sends a user data request to
download the encrypted data and since
the web service has a decryption key and
the data it can now decrypt the data
using the civ data import module so the
web service now stores this data in its
own servers and storage and could use it
for different types of analysis one
thing to know is that all these
interactions can be asynchronous in fact
the user doesn't even have to be online
after she gives the web service the key
for it to access the data
yes yeah so um actually get to a later
in the talk but but you usually uh so so
the system we had to be using is a
public key system so you encrypt with a
public key and then you give a private
key which is the decryption key to the
web service so the restriction happens
when I in curt the data sorry yeah your
cryptically the key you give prevent
only allows you to decrypt a certain
subset of the data it has a special each
web service has a special private key
that only allows it to decrypt certain
parts of the data yeah you can't prevent
the web services from sharing the secret
keys oh so sorry so the question was how
do you prevent the web service from
sharing the keys so we assess the web
service to to hold the keys that and
kind of we trusted to to not give it to
other web services or if it does you
know those web surgeons can't access
data that in though users given no one
access to yes
11 to be able to access without d and
the other ones back says didn't see he's
there to lead share it with other ones
is there any you gotta jump encrypting
twice Dxtory me twice
yeah so to summarize the question so you
have you have three pieces of data and
there's one commonly shared piece of
data between two web services on do I
have to encrypt the data twice you so
we're going to use a special
cryptographic scheme that makes it so
you only have to encrypt the data once
and then I'll talk about that in a
couple of slides yes yeah so yeah so the
question is is the user the end user or
is it theoretical client um so we assume
that if you were to use the system in
practice the user itself would use this
client or download this client that
allows them to share the keys and
actually do it in in reality like in
practice the users would create the key
in sure but of course is all abstract it
away from the user cool so now I've
given you an overview of civ we'll talk
specifically more about the security
problems in the threat model so we
assume that the storage provider is a
passive adversary which means the
adversary can read all the data on the
network but still follows the protocol
we assume that web services are trusted
with user data once they're given access
to it and we trust the users and her
devices so this kind of answers some of
the questions people have asking so how
do we do this so our approach is to use
this cryptographic primitive called
attribute based encryption we assume
that there's a user specific attribute a
be public and private key pair and there
are three main functions for a B there's
the generate decryption key function
encrypt and decrypt so first generate
decryption key takes in a policy and an
a B private key and it outputs an a/b
decryption key and so policy is a
predicate connected by ands and ORS for
example years less than two thousand
thirteen and type equals fitness
yes so the question was can you just
consider the policy as definition of a
set yes that's that's one way to think
about it um so to kind of add on to the
question of why we think about policies
and tags is because users already kind
of tag their data for example I tagged
photos and stuff and so I guess users
will probably think of them as kind of
just specific attributes rather than
kind of a set definition but if you're
have a more security and privacy savvy
person think of it as a set so if you
have these situations where you want to
calmly encrypt like one thing be yes
you can use negation and and and it
handles both integers and strings
equality and less than so the second
function is encrypt which takes in
attributes clear text or takes in
attributes clear text data and the a B
public key and it outputs a ciphertext
so examples of attributes are key value
pairs like location equals us on your
equals 2012 and type equals fitness and
finally there's the decrypt function
which takes in a ciphertext and a a B
key policy and it only decrypt the
ciphertext if the cipher text attributes
satisfy the key policy and one important
thing to know is that the attributes and
policies are in clear text so now let's
look at sieve with a be involved as you
may have noticed a B fits very well into
this architecture so first the user uses
the a/b encrypt function to tag an
encrypted data then she sends his data
to the storage provider when she visits
a web service she generates an a/b
decryption key and she gives the a/b
decryption key to the web service and
now the web service can just go to the
storage provider download the encrypted
data and use its key to perform a B
decryption to get the clear text data
however there's still a few challenges
with a be specifically performance and
revocation so since a b is a public key
cryptosystem it's slower than symmetric
key cryptography so you want to reduce
the number of a B operations are being
done in our paper were specifically
employed to optimizations in this talk
I'll discussed hybrid encryption now
refer you to the paper for storage based
data structures or so just an extension
of hybrid encryption that packs more
data under under 111 metadata block
which I'll explain later
so in hybrid encryption first you
generate the symmetric key and that key
is used to encrypt the data and then the
a B public key is used to encrypt the
symmetric key and the good which
represents the location of the actual
encrypted data block and this way
symmetric encryption the faster
encryption method can be applied to the
larger data and ma b is applied to the
smaller small and fixed size data and
encrypting goods are important for
storage based data structures which we
explain more in the paper and both these
encrypted objects are uploaded to the
cloud for the wrestlers hawk the block
that is encrypted with a beaky well
we'll refer to it as the metadata block
and in the storage provider the data
block is indexed by the goods and the
metadata block is M index by the a B
attributes so for future updates yes so
the question is what's a good a good
it's just it's just an ID number so
whenever you load something for example
to Amazon s3 or Amazon AWS you store
something there it spits back kind of an
ID you can think of is just a hashed ID
that that can get you the location of a
specific object very quickly so for
future updates i require uploads by the
user or downloads by the web service um
the user and web services can just cash
the symmetric key and goo it so it can
go and just look it up directly without
having to download the metadata block
again and they can use the GUI to access
directly to just pour perform symmetric
key operations only for future for
future gets so now I'll talk a little
bit about revocation so let's go back to
our initial fitbit example so suppose a
user now wants to switch insurance
companies so she wants to revoke the
insurance companies access however what
if the old insurance company becomes
compromised in the future remember that
the old insurance company has cash keys
from hybrid encryption that it can use
to access the users data
well that's problematic so we need a way
to re-encrypt a data to provide a
cryptographically strong revocation so
how do we do that so we need to both
re-encrypt the metadata block and the
data block well it's easy to BRE encrypt
a metadata block we which is smaller
than the size of the overall data we can
just download the data block decrypt it
and upload it again and since a small
amount it doesn't take that long um so
how do we r Ian crip data object which
is might be much larger well we can
always just download that rien Krypton
upload the data object that requires a
substantial amount of bandwidth and
client-side computation so the question
is can we do better yes so the question
is how does the user know when the
insurance company has become malicious I
so so usually the flow of events is that
I want to switch so so the point is that
I want to switch insurance companies or
I don't want to use anymore so the user
has to initiate the replication so the
user may or may not know maybe they
don't want them to have access anymore
so we should think about is now for
example use facebook oo-aah to grant
access to a variety of things and so for
example you might not know something as
malicious but you might want to revoke
their access anyways or if you know it
becomes malicious then you want to take
away their access right away yes
Oh
um so so I'm talking about so the
question is how slow is this encryption
method so the encryption itself is very
fast but the problem is during the re
encryption so downloading the data
decrypting re-encrypt and uploading
again is pretty slow because you have to
pay this like round-trip latency cost
and that can vary based on your network
latency which could be a lot or slow but
we imagine like a user might just use
her home internet or another way of
thinking about is like it could be your
mobile phone also so it could be much
lower if you're on something like 3G or
4G yes
so the question is how does kind of
downloading Andrey encrypting help with
preventing the insurance company from
accessing that in the future and so oh
so you the point of kind of downloading
Andrey encrypting is you deal with a
different key yeah so yeah cool so we
want to be able to do this without
having to pay the bandwidth costs and so
the solution is to use this
cryptographic primitives called keyhole
morphism which allows changing the key
and encrypted data on what what I mean
is that it creates it gives you a
symmetric cipher that provides in place
rien crip shin without decrypting the
data and the guarantees that it gives
you is that um you don't learn the old
key new key or plain text yes so the
question is by in place do I mean that
it happens on the server it does so we
trust that the server performs action
but the server doesn't learn anything at
any information about the data block
during the re encryption process
how does it like any place they have to
take original encrypted data encrypted
okay uh okay yeah so the question is
when i read encrypt I don't need to kill
the key at all yeah I don't need the old
key at all yeah maybe the next slide
will clarify the whole process but you
feel free to ask a question
so each so the question is the
organization's get new keys and the
answer is so so it's a little bit more
subtle than that so certain
organizations get new keys and certain
organizations or keys can stay the same
it depends on what data you're revoking
access to I think this next slide will
help people but if you're confused after
that one I will I will be happy to
answer questions so so here I'll
describe the whole revocation process so
in a sieve simple sieve data object
there's a metadata block with a
symmetric key and an encrypted data
block that's encrypted using that
symmetric key which is encrypted using a
PE so one important detail to note is
that if we user wants to have revocation
in their system Chester do introduce an
epic number as an attribute when she
generates and tags data so similarly
chefs include this epic number as part
of a policy for the web service keys she
gives out this number just represents
the number of replications that has
happened it could be something more
clever but just for now let's assume
that represents the number of
applications and the purpose of this
epic number is that during revocation
allows users to re-encrypt just the data
with attributes affected by the web
services key policy on that's being
revoked rather than rien crypt all their
data so then the user generates what we
call rekeying token which is just a
function of the old key and the new key
and sends this token to the storage
provider who applies it to the
appropriate data block and then deletes
the token this causes the data block to
be re-encrypted next next we want to
re-encrypt the the metadata block so the
user just generates a new metadata block
based on the new symmetric key that she
used to re-encrypt the data block and
that's encrypted using a be public key
with the same attributes but with an
incremented on epic epic and this now
replaces the old metadata block so the
user does this process for all the data
blocks that the revoke web service had
access to
and finally the user issues new keys to
web services whose data access has
changed and been affected by this
revocation yes um so so the question is
this does do I deal with on this system
deal with with authentication so we kind
of like putting off dedication to kind
of like the user knowing that this is
the web service they actually want to
access so that makes sense oh yeah so oh
you're talking about the authentication
for the year so yeah I didn't actually
mention this in the talk so in the data
the data includes a date the data block
and a signed version also in encrypted
data so there would be a piece of data
and then something signed with the users
private key
yeah so the the data the data right
there like that says data that includes
actually the actual data block and a
signed version encrypted like they're
all so the signatures don't get affected
during rien crip shin because the
signature itself is also encrypted yeah
so it's encrypted it's um it's encrypt
sorry it's a it's signed an encrypted
yeah which is which is fine because it's
it's differ from a Mac cool now I'll
talk a little bit more about the
implementation and evaluation so for the
civ implementing we use for cryptography
this a be library called lib bank which
uses the Stanford pairing base
cryptography library and we implement it
with two different symmetric ciphers AES
which has no revocation and randomized
counter mode with Ed 448 which has our
vacation and so the civ user client has
about 1,400 lines of code the sieve
storage payment has about a thousand
lines of code and we use MongoDB and
Berkeley DB in the background and the
save data import module really depends
on the web service you use which leads
to our evaluation which is which looks
at to mange or questions is it easy to
integrate sieve into existing web
services and can web services achieve
reasonable performance while using sieve
and for the evaluation setup we use a
multi-core machine with 2.4 gigahertz
Intel Xeon processors and the web
services we ran on machine loopback so
numbers you see will have almost no
network latency so we can see what the
cryptographic overheads are and we have
two major case studies that we integrate
it with one is this piece of software
called open em health which represents
small data and helps you visualize
health data and a week's worth of health
data is about six kilobytes and we have
another photo service called P we go
which has much larger data and the
service allows you to edit and display
and one photo is about 375 kilobytes and
so we show that it's pretty easy to
integrate receive so the lines of code
required for integration it's about 200
lines for open em health about 250 lines
for / we go and so here are just some
results for open em health and p we go
using ed 448 with key cashing we have
acceptable performance for both case
studies we see that reading writing a
week's worth of open em health data
takes less than a second and the read
and write time for poo goes longer
because the data is larger and so
there's a performance gap between AES
and ed 448 yes so the question is how
many photos are there in this benchmark
there's only one photo so so here we
just show there's a performance gap
however this is because ed for phrase
the less optimizing AES which has
hardware support but we expect this
performance to improved in the future
with more research and better hardware
support and I'll mention you the end of
the talks and more engineering
optimizations that we can make and we
looked into after we published this
paper to to improve the numbers a little
bit and so the server / core throughput
is pretty good we can get about 50
megabytes per second for open em health
and we can import about 70 users worth
of data per minute for Puig oh yes yes
so the question is why would you want to
use ed for for a instead of AES so AES
doesn't allows to do revocation whereas
84 for it does so yeah so yeah the
reason is because ed for phrase is key
homomorphic and so as a result with more
structures can be a bit slower so the
question is can aes can ever become key
homomorphic answer is not in its current
state I'm not it won't be a yes you have
to be something different you can't use
AES because it yes yank cool
awesome so I so the revocation
performance is also reasonable we can
rien crip the metadata block and point
63 seconds we can rekey 100 kala by data
block and point in 66 seconds I'm going
to generate a new ten attribute key in
point for six seconds so I wanted to
kind of make some last remarks about civ
in the performance so first this is not
restricted to just Fitbit cloud data the
question is who are these servers source
providers the storage providers can be
ms on ec2 google cloud facebook twitter
or really any system has large amounts
of user data that can be shared and
second i showed you some performance
numbers but those are for research
prototype to just show its practicality
and the performance can be substantially
improved in I think two main ways first
we can build faster a B libraries they
use assembly base-pairing libraries so
my initial benchmarks for this new
library called dcl xvi so it has a lot
of potential it takes about point 5
milliseconds to do a pairing but I'm not
sure how this will translate into the a
B world and next we can build faster
large integer libraries I'll make
revocation much faster currently we use
a lib GMP but it's not really clear to
me with the limiting factors for faster
large integer libraries is it's
definitely worth looking into and
there's these are just kind of a couple
of ways to optimize and improve I'm
improve the performance of the system
and it's important that we know we work
with industry to focus on engineering
efforts to reduce cryptography
bottlenecks here are just some yes
okay cool yeah just to conclude I
present a new access control system that
allows users till selectively and
securely exposed to private cloud data
to web services it efficiently uses a B
to manage keys and policies there's a
complete revocation scheme that's
compatible with hybrid encryption using
key homomorphism and it's easy to
integrate and has reasonable performance
and I just wanted to thank a few of my
collaborators James from Harvard you
know client vinod from MIT who helped me
bring me one one paper closer to
graduation and there's more information
about this paper on my website Frank
wearing gorg and you can follow me on
twitter
so the first question is about oh this
is your first question is about how does
the web service know about the schema
yeah so that's one issue we kind of ran
into and the answer to that is we kind
of assume that everyone ends up using
may burst and rice schema or the web
service tells the user yeah you should
store your data in such a way or there's
some standardized schema that everyone
uses you can imagine people using some
form of XML or JSON or kind of like
working through different types of
schema but yeah it's something we
haven't really looked into is the short
answer
so the question is if there are two
services that have the same policy or
the same oh okay so the other question
is of supervisors access to the same
data if I revoke one access will the
other ones still have access and the
answer is yes so the way we do is after
you revoke you have to send on new keys
a new key to the the one that had access
to that you want to access the fitness
data so the non revoked one you said in
a new key which is just the same key but
then there's an epic number and you just
incremented by one
so the question is is if the policy is
the same as the key the same if the
answer is yes if the policy is exactly
the same not include like everything
including the epic number then you get
the same key but if there's any small
variations of different key so that's
why the epic number gives you and you a
different key yeah
so the question is I talked about mostly
access control forgiving selective
assets that the question is does do web
services know about data blocks they
cannot access so um hypothetically they
shouldn't unless the storage provider
tells them so the storage provider has
kind of mapping from kind of different
tags to the data so it maps attributes
to the data and so for example one way
the service provider could learn whether
that's access to certain data or not
it's just like ask for data it's not
allowed to access and then try to see if
you decrypt sit and I mean they're the
short provider could offer some form of
kind of like filtering in that case but
uh but I but yeah it is possible for
them to discover what block state can't
access but they can't actually access
the actual data even though they
discover like I don't have access for
fitness data for example but they can't
decrypt the data for that yes so the
question is how confident I am about
using this in production not my research
prototype but I'm I'm pretty confident
on at least piece of the system actually
working so I've been talking to kind of
variety of people there's some interest
with certain groups actually at Google
and at like eth zurich which are
actually interested in kind of like
using this into like different
production systems or like into their
other research projects
can you sorry can you repeat the
question
okay oh yeah so the question is is the
curriculums schemes i'm using or the
methods i'm using are they provably
secure or or kind of i I'm or or you
know if I feel confident about it they
are provably secure so a B is a provably
secure scheme it's been pretty well
studied it came out in 2006 and people
have kind of studied it for the last 10
years in different various different
settings and it's based it's all
provably secure is same with kind of ski
homomorphic encryption that we're also
using
so the question is what provably secure
public key cryptosystem my real i am so
a bee's actually a provably secure
public key system that that we're using
in this game yes yes
um so that so that so the question is so
this isn't used in production right now
can I use it anytime soon and the answer
is maybe and i think the the point is I
think parts of there are very
interesting on two different people I
think it's just a matter of finding the
right applications for people use it I
think a lot of interest is actually
around on using the rien crip shun
system which is pretty convenient
because a lot of times like data state
sits on the cloud and it's encrypted and
people don't want to decrypt down the
cloud andrey encrypt it in the cloud so
if you use something like amazon right
now they actually have key rotations and
what they do is that they generate a new
key decrypted data we encrypt it kind of
all in the cloud so if you have kind of
a malicious person just hang out in the
cloud they can kind of see they wait for
you to decrypt the data or the key
rotation to happen I think there's a lot
of interest from that end I think like
people are interested for example
there's this new system called key base
and they're very excited about like
