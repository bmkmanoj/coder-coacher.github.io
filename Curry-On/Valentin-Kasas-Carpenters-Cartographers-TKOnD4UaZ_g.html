appealing to you to be sitting why
talking so I'd certainly see what see
what it does
so um that title doesn't make any sense
right we have 40 minutes for for that to
make sense so keep that bear with me and
it might make some sense at the end it's
not really a technical talk at all
increasingly it's almost the opposite
talk from the keynotes we just had from
Brian goats so we have some contrasting
ideas but it's mostly a talk about a
word because I'm I'm quite a lover of
words I love the way they interact with
each other their payoff tracking their
lineage through values languages and
through history and we'll be spending a
few minutes talking about words and how
they interact with a way to to to
program so to to start we we should ask
ourselves a very simple question what is
the essence of our job as software
developers of software computer science
researchers it's a really simple
question right and it should have a very
simple answer so someone come to us with
an ID of something that could be done
with computers we light up our very
powerful brain we feed it with some hot
beverage and in the end we end up with
we're mostly bugs so it's probably more
complicated than that so let's try again
so someone comes to us
an ID of something that could be done
with computers we were rewrite a bunch
of text files in a in a programming
language we fit that text into some kind
of build system and we end up with a
binary that is executable of course
because we are lazy we reuse code that
has been written by other developers
before us which comes from the network
and then we we end up with our binary
and we ask the OS to make the CPU
execute our curve and during that
process the the CPU will talk to say
database or other computers across the
network or even if we are still working
in the 20th century it will talk with
printers but no intention see and our
CPU will talk with devices that a user
can interact with because in the end the
the whole purpose of that process of
producing software is to bring value to
users and we hope that in return users
will bring profits and revenue to us so
all you know it's a quite complex
process if we were to completely
understand it we we will need to to talk
about physics and electronics and
computers computer language theory and
mathematics and even sociology or
psychology because there are human
interaction in that in that process and
so it's quite extremely complicated and
to cope with that tremendous amounts of
complexity we use the only tool we have
to cope with complexity which is
attraction as
allows us to go from something that is
contacts into tinier bits that are more
simple and once we have abstracted away
the useless details we can work with our
simpler abstractions and then we compose
back this abstraction to keep get back
the original complexity so abstraction
is a tool to make the complex simpler
but in the meantime new abstraction are
often difficult to understand in the
first place and absolutely and we we
have another tool to help us understand
newer sections in this tool which is
very often used is metaphors metaphors
work by collecting a system of analogies
and mapping from something that is
complex and abstract into something that
is more concrete and more easy to to
understand for example if I say a high
well blue like the sky it's only an
analogy because there is only one
mapping but if I had I mean these orbs
twinkle a thousand stars so first it's
the proof that I should leave poetry to
professionals but then it becomes a
metaphor because you see multiple
analogies work together so on a
schematic representation of that
metaphor we should see that there are
highs that has the color blue and that
contains twinkles on the suffix and on
the other hand we are the sky which has
also a color blue and that contains
stars and the metaphor maps from the
left to the right
and I don't know if you are familiar
with functional programming but this
looks like our Center and we should say
that metaphors are like a functor from
something that is abstract and
complicated into something that is
concrete and not simple but these are a
little bit far-fetched because we use
the abstract notion of Center to as a
metaphor to the abstract notion of
metaphor and it's maybe too much so
let's take an creat example when we
learn to count and to do basic
arithmetic we we use we all that ended
in that spoon I've used a very pervasive
metaphor which is the fingers we use the
finger to learn to count 1 2 3 4 5
rising one thing the finger is adding
one lower lowering one finger is
subtracting one and thanks to that
metaphor we start to grasp the abstract
notion of numbers but of course at some
points we have to unlearn to use our
fingers counts because you cannot do
proper mathematics with your fingers for
example we cannot do a multiplication or
division so metaphors are like a gateway
to new affections it's just a way to get
in but at some point you have to cut the
rope and go straight in into the right
abstraction in order to completely
understand it and since we have a time
we should know that digits the world
digit in English is an analogy from
the fingers in Layton Digitas is the
word for fingers so somehow the English
language we call the fact that we use
our fingers to count in the first place
there is another little digression I
like to make in that fault this is the
the most hipster metaphor ever because
it it's a metaphor from before the word
even existed because this is I don't
really know the word in English it's a
nevelot it comes from Mesopotamia like
three thousand years before our era so
even before the Greek existed so the
metaphor word which comes from the Greek
didn't exist it was a system to to do
basic accounting and to collect to
verify that the texts that were
collected we're correct in their amount
so people used to rap a little a bunch
of these little stones on the on the
lower right
that's where metaphor for numbers in
cattle or grain or something like that
you had to pay as taxes and then they
read them into a bowl of mud and then
then they inscribed a field to prove it
was their envelope and so these little
balls were used as metaphor for the
quantity of cattle or grain they were
sending to the the government but the
problem was that to count and to verify
that the unknowns were correct
you had to breathe break these little
balls of mirth is an envelope and to
count
to get back the lethal stones and to
count and compare the numbers and by the
way a little stone in Layton its fade
calculate and this is where the world
calculus come from and so at some points
they were quite bored in that process of
breaking these envelopes and Counting
and so on and so they started to make
little marks on the envelope
to denote the quantity of stones there
were they were inside and that's
basically our human invented writing so
that quite interesting to see that this
kind of metaphor for accounting opportu
to to to provoke the invention of
writing so that was a little digression
aggression to to lead us to understand
how important metaphors are in the way
we think it's so important that some
scientists like George the curve which
is a linguist is a student of non
friendly youth probably of the others
and he has these as phases that the
whole process of thinking and speaking
is completely metaphorical we always do
metals from processes that occur inside
ourselves and inside minds to explain
and understand processes that occurs
outside it's a little controversial
pieces but even if we we don't agree
with that we we must agree that
metaphors somehow shape the way we think
and the way we understand our
surrounding
so let's summarize a bit we we have a
section that allows us to go from
something that which is complex and
difficult into something that is simpler
but still difficult and then we have
metaphors that take something that is
abstract and difficult into something
that is more concrete and more easier to
to to grasp so by the rules of
composition should we understand that we
have fun find some kind of Holy Grail
that takes things that are difficult and
complex into things that are simple and
easy that should be cool right actually
it isn't because there are quite a lot
of problems with with metaphors
metaphors do not abide any laws which
means that from the metaphor you cannot
extract new knowledge it can help you
understanding something that you don't
know by connecting it with something you
know but you cannot use that connection
to go further into the unknown
also metaphors that pertain to a
specific cultural context for example if
I say to you learn that there are like
Doritos but you know nothing about
Mexican food this metaphor is absolu use
to you and actually this metaphor is no
use to anybody but that's another
question
so metaphors are blocked into some
cultural context and you cannot share
them with anybody with everybody sorry
and finally metaphor that they tend to
stick you you will easily become trapped
into a metaphor because it makes
something easy so it's really tempting
to
get perkins in that metaphor and try to
push it ever and ever forward and beyond
the boundaries issue that we have had in
the first place and that's probably
where my thought begins to to diverge
from the keynote of Brian because there
is one metaphor that has struck much way
too much in that in that in this
industry and it's the metaphor of the
object you probably have at least heard
about this book it's design patents from
the well-known Gang of Four I have a
series of concerns with that book and
these concerns start right on the cover
I like her sure and is drawing so it's
not a problem with the picture on the
cover I have nothing wrong with the
authors so it's not about them it's
interactive about the word design on the
title and I don't think design should
apply to software development that's
because I am I am quite biased I'm
French so my brain works in French most
of the time and in French we have a very
precise definition to the word design it
denotes something that is meant to be as
beautiful as useful it's the when you
join beautiful and useful this is
designed okay it's in French we don't
use the word design to the
to speak about the process of building
steps it's a very very concrete and
precise meaning so for example the chair
on the right yeah that's like our by of
course the chair on the left is an
instance of design whereas the chair on
the right isn't okay and so when we in
fact included faces we put too much
emphasis on the notion of design in
software I feel that we we inserted in
put emphasis on the beauty of what we
produce and I don't think the beauty is
a property of code code can can have
multiple properties that are desirable
like readability maintainability
scalability and so on but not beauty
beauty is not property of code usually
when I say that people try and start
throwing stuff at me but I think you are
still digesting the the veal so it's ok
but that was only in the problem I
hadn't learned the cover of the book and
when you look inside it there are a lot
of things that they call design patterns
I have listed them there and all that I
see is well metaphors I have no idea by
reading the ad in the book and our
should be able to compose this stuff all
right what is a composite command
mediator I have no idea of that because
this these are only metaphors to you
know help me understand what I should do
with object-oriented programming
these are not
and more of a in these herbs in these
metaphors sorry now a lot of them that
are drawn from the vocabulary of
construction right decorator builder
bridge and so on and this adds to the
fact that we take a lot and lots of
metaphors from this folk library of
construction we have architects we are
blending and building blocks and
software craftsmen and and so on and if
you remember I said before that the
metaphor we use they have a tremendous
impact of how we think about the world
and so this possessive use of
constriction really related metaphors
they tend to provoke and create a
certain mindset about developing
software and this mindset I call the
Carranza mindset in that in this mindset
we tend to be obsessed on building stuff
creating designs we only focus on the
creative part of our job right we create
codes when we arrive on work on the
morning there is no code and we created
and we get back to home at night but
it's only a way to see us to see it and
it's a way that has some negative impact
first when you create something you you
become attached to it and so when the
business comes and say well you know you
should put that button there and change
completely the schema of the database
and so on you can become quite upset
because you've worked a lot on
specification and you created a designer
it's your design
and it's not cool when you have to
change what you create we've created
there is also another aspect of the
calendar mindset which is uncool which
is that in French we have a saying that
say that you can evaluate the skill of
quest man just by looking at how it
takes care of these tools it's much
further in French but anyway and so when
you when you are in the capital mindset
you always tend to focus on on tools as
an example a few years back I was in a
team that was tasked to build an
application that should connect people
that needed some kind of service at home
like babysitting or building ekl
furniture or stuff like that and
connecting them to two people who will
be able to provide these services and at
that time the this kind of business was
quite new so it was completely
unspecified and so we took that absence
of specification and we said to
ourselves well we don't know right now
how it will be represented in database
so we should use MongoDB and so we we
went straight on on MongoDB and it was
Chanel s so we were able to update the
schema quite easily and and so we went
all in in in MongoDB and then the
business started to evolve and we had to
had some kind of recommendation engine
based on the time between a provider
I'd received an offer and the time he
had answered to that offer and
gamification and stuff like that and so
we had to had some kind of history into
our documents in MongoDB and it quickly
became a pure nightmare and so we we
went to a big phase of refactoring and
we basically we were we wrote the system
in a Avensis events austere way
situation and so on but it was a
nightmare because we were completely
committed to our tool which was MongoDB
in the first place right we should have
maybe use another kind of approach to
that problem so to sum it up the the
carpenter it builds stuff and something
fixes broken things and you know it's
always that metaphor of cap'n tree right
but remember the metaphors we use and
which in turn shape the way we think
they were only there in the first place
to lter understand new abstractions and
these are section this is the real thing
that matters because these attractions
and when I say abstraction I speak about
mathematical abstractions right they
have a whole bunch of cool properties
they are universal right a functor is a
functor for anybody on the planet and
probably if we ever meet an alien
intelligence they probably have some
kind of mathematics and we make nice be
able to to share some as sections it's
very unlikely they call them central but
we can compare them add sections are
permanent once you've proven
um it will not be improved and there
will not be a category Theory version -
that will make obsolete our functors and
monads and a tickety's and so on and
more tonton c-sections are lawful they
come with a set of flows that help you
detect dissection in the wild and that
tells you how you will be able to
compose them or what you won't be able
to compose right given the lows of a
monoid I can look into the specification
of my business requirements and say
there is a knowledge there is center I
will be able to do stuff with that
without aiming having written a single
line of code right and in contrast with
the the capital 9 sets when we focus on
discovering abstractions we end up with
another mindset that I call the capital
resonances the castle refer considers
that is primary primary task is to
discover as fraction inside the business
requirements
okay the ID that the people came to us
with we when we we are carpenters we are
eager to to completely compose that
problem into simpler abstractions that
we will then be able to compose back
right and if the business requirement
change it's okay we just get out again
and discover new attractions and that's
perfectly fine right this kind of
abstraction discovery process as a good
prediction are in the in the in the new
industry where
the the DVD method of developing
software DDD stands for domain driven
discovery right because no there is no
design yeah that people say it's
designed but I prefer to say discovery
and there is this excellent book that
should preferably replace the design
pattern books which which is a book from
the by Finnish gosh which is in Scala so
if you are not inside the the scala
community you probably didn't heard
about it it's basically a DVD with
mathematical abstractions it's really
cool and it's like the the categorical
manifesto even if cartographer is my my
word so that you there in be no capsule
graphing in that book but DDD it's
completely about finding abstraction
inside the the the domain the domain the
business domain and trying to Mottola
materialize this abstraction into code
and so we have both nine sets the
cartographer and the carpenter and both
are not completely antagonist and
actually we can in the same day
be a cartographer on the on the bombing
and then become the carpenter on the
easy right it's not I am a classic a
panther or I am a cartographer is like I
use my kappa kappa kapppa enter skills
or i use my photography skills and
actually if we push that even even
further we should say that both are like
jewel of one another right the carpenter
projects harder onto complexity and the
cartographer extracts
abstraction from the same complexity
right okay so if you've been following
with me without throwing anything to me
you should recall that I said that
metaphor we should be wary of metaphor
we should be suspicious and after all
Catherine Catherine third this is
completely metaphor right so maybe I've
been fooling you from the beginning
right actually abstractions honored the
the silver bullet right I don't know if
you heard about Alfred Korzybski it's it
was a Polish scientist from the 20th
century but before he moved to the
United States he was actually an
intelligence officer in the Russian army
from during the First World War and
someday it was with the troops and the
officers and they went on a path which
was blocked at some point by a river the
map showed a river and so the the
officers gathered gathered into tents
and unfolded the map and they were like
in the meeting for a few hours wondering
if they should go south for like 20
kilometers and try to cross the river
using the bridge which probably was had
been destroyed by the enemy or if or if
they should go north like 30 kilometers
and try to cross the river at the point
where the weather was more shallow and
so they were following that and
discussing
and so on and at some point because if
he was like a bit fed up with that
meeting and so it would horse neee
went forward for the few kilometers that
separated them from the place where the
river should have been and there there
was no river anymore because it was a
summer and the river
tried out and so the legend says that at
this moment he had this revelation that
a map is not the territory which we
should understand that our abstraction
they never completely reflect the
reality so at some points we cannot
completely rely on abstraction and so
the the cartographer cannot be the only
way we look at our job at some point we
we have to make our abstraction concrete
that again right so even if these two
mindsets are not antagonists we are
oblique we are forced to use both at
some point and so to conclude when we
tackle a new new problem we should first
try to extract as most a section as we
can from that from that problem and only
then when we are extracted and used all
the abstraction the possible abstraction
we have to get our tools out and use our
crafty skills to make that these
abstractions concrete and so if there is
only one thing you
take home from that distort is always do
cartography before you do in Catherine
tree that's it
thank you my name is
you see these two instructions that
programming is a vault or maybe like ah
probably notes actually I like these two
because they are you know like jewel of
one another that's probably on another
axis the other metaphors but that's not
important because you know metaphors or
trouble and should be you know wary of
them
actually probably that's the problem
when you work with metaphors it's always
library and mixed but the the thing
about Joseph's key that anyhow your
abstractions
they will never be good enough to
completely represent reality so but yes
it was also a metaphorical sentence
about cartography so maybe the choice
was not the best one but you know I like
when things are like tied up and
completely broke thank you
I I tend to be more on the side of the
the cartography but you you have to move
on the line every every day and even
within the day you you cannot be stuck
on one point you have to choose the
right you know mindset depending on how
deep you are in the in learning the
project you know in the beginning here
you should try to to find the
obstructions but at some point you have
to have like side effects
a good example will be you knew about
three minutes yeah so first you you are
a cutter refer you write the algebra of
your feminine but at some point you need
to be a carpenter and write the
interpreters right so you you use taught
to you start praying to to remain as
pure and as abstract as possible but you
do have the choice at some point you
will need to be concrete so you have to
move back and forth between the two but
I personally I prefer the abstraction
part
thank you
you
