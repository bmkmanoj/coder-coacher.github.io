chest timer talk I don't know I have
experienced at least or have not yet
experienced I have no clue how this is
going to work but I've been asked and
I've been told it's awesome so let's see
as Heather said it's it's crucial that
you participate and there was this rule
of no questions in the first five
minutes which I think does not make much
sense for this presentation because in
the first five minutes I'm going to
introduce actors and things and if you
don't ask if something is unclear then
the rest won't make sense to you so ask
questions please but before we dive
right in I'm Roland Kuhn I work for
typesafe type-safe is the company behind
the scholar language the aqha actor
implementation the Play Framework slick
and things like that and just as a short
explanation why that company can afford
to pay me for working on open source
software we sell support subscriptions
for that but that's the only kind of
explanation for why I can be here so who
here in this audience already knows
about the actor model please oh that's
great and who knows about session types
yes you will be most needed because I oh
I also don't know that much about them
that was the point four of the talk so
first a brief recap so since everybody
knows the actor model it was presented
in this paper by Kyle Hewitt and his
colleagues in 1973 already it models
distributed independent agents that's
the core to it it models distribution
and nothing else and when an actor does
something it can only do something in
response to a message so it's purely
message driven and in response to a
message it can send a number of messages
it can create a number of actors both
finite and it can decide how to treat
the next message this is the implicit
guarantee that things are processed
sequentially which makes it also
suitable as a concurrent
the abstraction if you want to use it
that way no I think this property was
just crucial because Kyle wanted to
prove that there is this guarantee of
service and you can only guarantee it if
well a single step doesn't take forever
I think that what that's my layman's
interpretation in practice you won't
write programs that send infinite number
of messages I think you can have
circular messaging topologies but that
is fine because in response to every
message it just sends one more so this
is a finite number of messages one per
iteration so to speak but that's a
pretty common pattern that people lose
so you probably even though you know the
actor model you probably have not seen
much of a car programs of course i'm
using acha because that's the thing we
develop so first of all this is skyler
syntax we define a message class which
is immutable that's the default in Scala
so case class greet contains a string
then we define an actor a greeter and
def receive defines the initial behavior
that the actor starts out in when it
gets a great message it will send a
message to the sender of that message it
will create another actor from the
grumpy props which is a description of
how to create a grumpy actor at the
bottom and then it will change its
behavior for all the following messages
into this grumpy state where it just
delegates the handling of the greet
message to this new actor which Wilson
send go away instead of hello so this in
a nutshell demonstrates all the features
of the actor model now you can see here
several problems you have the Greek
message that is defined over there and
you have the pattern matching inside the
actor but on the actor there is no type
description or anything
so the message that comes in here could
be anything whatsoever there are a few
other problems for example the sender
method here that's a method that is
called on the actor on the actor class
actor actor trait and that gives you
back an act or if to which you can send
messages but since it's completely
dynamic sender I mean it could be
whoever it is completely unclear for
whom the active actually is what kind of
messages this actor of can sensibly
receive what kind of messages you can
send back to that spear so there is
nothing statically typed checked here
actors are very much dynamic this is
well it's active objects but dynamically
typed a few will in a statically typed
language so this brings me to my
motivation for the work that I'm talking
about we have observed that when people
write a car programs they well are
successful in writing quite complex
programs but as they grow refactoring
becomes more of a problem because when
you change something over here you don't
get all those nice static compiler error
messages over there where you forgot to
adapt accordingly so making actors
refactoring friendly it was the initial
motivation and of course avoiding stupid
mistakes in Scala you can send the
companion object to the grid class
instead of a greet instance and that's a
different type and it won't be handled
by the actor and you won't know it
because the actor will just discard the
message so this will provide some very
weak safety properties so to introduce
the work that I have done for acha to
make it a bit more typed this has been
going on for the past three years or so
of for even since basically before I
started working at type safe and being
paid to do this I thought how can we
make this more type safe and trade the
various things and most of them failed
in the in the beginning I was completely
clueless and then
in the middle time I was too ambitious I
used macros to express all these type
relationships but it was too clunky it
didn't really work and the reason was
that the sender method that which I
intended to keep is just it is dynamic
by nature it doesn't fit into the type
checking so it needs to go and then also
actors can receive multiple different
kinds of messages they speak some
languages with other actors actors are
about interacting and so on and I used
an approach using H lists to formulate
that this can recieve integers or
strings or greet messages or whatever
but that was just too complex and didn't
really work so Union types would have
been nice but I didn't have them so what
then what I did now this is just a
setting for the rest so act RF itself
that is the handle that you get for the
outside on how to send a message to an
actor has become generic in a type T and
that describes which messages it accepts
then the behavior of the actor that
receives these messages also needs to be
parented parametrized in this type T and
then changing the behavior needs to
retain the same type T because it's a
static property it's dead in the sense
of the keynote so to speak and well this
type is propagated in the creation
process from behavior to act RF and so
on and currently it's just implemented
as a very thin layer on top of the
untyped actors to explore the properties
of having a typed actor implementation
minus T is the scalar way of saying that
actor ref is contravariant and T so you
can restrict the the width of the of the
channel that you provide but you cannot
enlarge it yeah so if you have a an
actor f4 for fruit you can expose it as
an actor if for apples but not the other
way around yes
the problem with union types and Scala
is that color doesn't have them simply
Martin order ski is working on the dot e
compiler which might become Scala 3 and
that should solve that because it
contains intersection types and union
types natively now they are attempt at
introducing that by yeah using H lists
and similar things but it's just not
really tractable as an add-on yes so
this this type T would be the language
that the actor implements I can just go
to the next slide to explain what that
means can you read it in the back or I
can read the the important portions to
you so this this is the this is declares
an actor basically in the middle of the
slide there is value initial which is a
behavior for commands and this is the
type T command is the type T in this
case and command is a sealed trait which
means it's an it's a type where we
statically know which is closed so only
within the same file can you have can
you declare sub types of this type we
declare the commands put and get which
extend command and then this behavior
that we declare here which is
implemented in the lower part of the
slide just needs to know how to handle
commands and nothing else so this is
this is the the way you go about it you
define the set of all messages that the
actor understands as some common super
type of possibly many subtypes that are
the different parts of the protocol that
the actress peaks and that is the type T
that you bind the actor too
yes i'm using subtyping in as a
replacement for a union type yes
normally you could also say this is a
behavior of get or put but since we
don't have that well let's just make a
super type and use that instead of
course that breaks down yes yeah sure
yeah sure and if you create an actor
from that it won't understand put and
that will be statically now that that is
true there is one obvious problem with
this namely that well I need to know all
the types that I can handle here and
they need to be able to write them down
here such that i can make them subtypes
yes so changing behavior um excellent
question that is demonstrated here as
well in the untyped acha there was
context become for explicitly changing
the behavior this has been the source of
some errors and mistakes so now it is
implicit every step in so in this
behavior declaration here we have the
case for a get and the last thing that
you do is you always need to return the
next behavior if you say same that's a
magic marker which does not introduce
allocations and stuff like that for just
not changing the behavior but in the
case of put we need to change the state
to incorporate the new value that was
put into this map what is ID that's a
correlation ID so when you send a get
then the client needs to know to which
the the got corresponds so typically in
protocols request reply you have some
sort of ID
well actually it does because you say
it's a first of all the behavior needs
to be total I didn't I don't have that
on the slides that's an implementation
detail I consider it so the the behavior
of an actor is a total function from t
to a behavior of t plus some internal
signal things that you also need to do
and then there are different ways of
formulating the behavior one of them
says total and that means that this
thing needs to be a total function and
you get all the scholar exhaustive pneus
pattern match up the Edit matching
chicks that you would expect yes the
pattern matcher is pretty good at
telling you if you forgot to handle a
case so i think i think i'll need to
quickly go over some of these what can
we do with this because i will also want
to get to the session types and then the
contrasting part so one interesting
thing i looked at is we have actors and
we can view them as active objects now
we have the mobile objects in Java like
languages and Scala and so on where you
have a class with methods you can just
replace this with an object that
contains the message classes which are
which now fulfill the function of the
methods and you can even do more fancy
things with restricting scopes of who
can see which methods by having
different traits and so on so I think
with this scheme of doing things we can
have a language that describes actors as
with the same power as modules with
method methods in them I didn't see
anything missing but I also do not have
a computer science degree so tell me if
I'm wrong please then the interesting
comparison afterwards so if I have a
close I use dots to select methods and
for actors i use the
! for one-way message send where the
return is void or unit or I use the ?
operator for a square I get back a
future so this is well an interesting
correspondence to me but even more
interesting is and we're getting in the
direction of session types here we can
do protocols so let's say we have these
messages and they are understood by some
actor get session contains an actor f of
get session result and then this actor
that implements that will sit back and
get session result which could either be
an active session or a new session and
then these contain other actor riffs for
example after new session you have to
send to an authenticate handler and the
authenticate handler will reply with an
authentication result in stuff like that
yes so unfortunately so this needs to be
written down like that there cannot be
inference for that as far as i know in
scala at least you need to say what type
of actor if you expect here because
otherwise where would this information
come from so these types cannot be
inferred as far as I know oh yes Scala
is statically typed with local inference
it doesn't do a whole program inference
but when it knows the expected type of
something it will figure things out
locally expression by expression there
was a question
yes so can we stash that question so the
question is if there are multiple agents
and they talk to the same interlocutor
how how our session types useful I think
that's the question let's get to that
shortly after this because instead of
okay I have lots of slides with
questions I can read the question right
okay okay so so you can take this text
and you can represent it as this image
where you draw a box for each type and
the arrows means this contains an actor
f of that other type and in this diagram
you can see how the overall protocol
progresses or can progress in two
different states this I think is is
correspondent to global session types as
I understood them so let's quickly go
there so I don't completely mess up my
understanding is that the session is a
unit of conversation it describes a
conversation between well two or more
parties well let's first look at to the
session type is the structure of that
conversation between these two parties
as sequence of I send something I
received something this was originally
done in the 90s and then in 2008
multi-party sessions were introduced and
that's where this interesting question
comes into play and the primitives here
are sending receiving sequence of
actions choices and recursion as far as
I understood them yes
kohei honda this is worth mentioning
because he unfortunately died a few
years ago people should remember the
great contributions very good point
kohei honda that was the guy who
invented session types and yes I've seen
the name on many papers sorry for not
putting it on the slide then there's a
language for defining these protocols
called scribble where so this this goes
I'm I'm interacting with this question
now so so you define a global protocol
like this diagram I've shown before and
then you make local projections as seen
by every constituent or interlocutor and
then you can check whatever these agents
do against their locally projected
protocol pieces to verify that whether
they abide by the protocol or not and
the check whether or not the protocol
makes sense so whether or not some of
the participants may get confused is a
check that you can do on the global
protocol as far as I understood this has
been proven to be safe that you can
globally verify a protocol that it does
not confuse any of its participants is
that true okay
yes so first you paint the big picture
and then you scope it down to the
individual parts so from here on I only
have questions yes linear types oh yes
that's an important detail linear types
means that you can basically forget
about things in a car or Scala this is
unfortunately not possible so when I
receive an actor from somewhere I
retained the possibility to send to that
actor if until I mean time in the future
and there is no way to invalidate that
knowledge you would need to invalidate
that knowledge to express that the
global protocol has progressed to the
next state where that doesn't make sense
anymore linear types can express this so
you have used this ability to send in
this protocol step now it's gone you
can't use it anymore that would would be
possible with linear types unfortunately
it's not with well almost all practical
in mainstream languages they don't have
linear types unless I mean anyone have
good ideas what we should rewrite acha
in rust just like when support linear
time I was just gonna say the key thing
in linear is what a linear function uses
its variable exactly once that for the
linear type does it uses the very with
that
feel the channel you want to know you're
going to send to it once at the given
type and if you copy that channel if you
used it twice you could end up sending
it to messages which would violate the
type discipline so the key easy thing to
understand about linear types is their
use once times okay use once types and
copying is a special operation that is
mostly forbidden unless I guess you okay
so now we can try to progress into
territory which I have not yet charted
so questions only when I looked at
Scrabble I saw that well you define the
participants to the conversation and
then you did fine how they converse but
what about where conversations where you
dynamically add or remove participants
for example you create new actors that
start participating in this conversation
has anybody do you have any ideas or is
there something in the literature which
helps us understand this or is that even
supported by scribble and by multi-party
session types
these statically foreseen scheme
discovery to enter into scenarios that
are known to be good
so the suggestion is to just there is a
microphone I think it would be better
for the more discussion part that you
actually speak into the microphone for
the recording so the the the suggestion
was to carry the type information of the
channels send them around with the
channel so you can dynamically check the
types yes that would be possible I think
it leads into another question yeah this
is this is kind of the question that it
led me to because I thought about that
well in scarlet transporting types means
sending type tags around and you can do
operations on them you can do subtyping
checks and so on scholar type system is
touring complete so these type checks
might not terminate well so I I thought
about this and I thought so this is this
is all about nominal types that you can
capture its it you have a name for this
type and you have a name for the type
that you expect and then you can check
them against each other the thing is is
it really necessary to have this normal
attire nominal types is it conceivable
to have a system that is more dynamic
I'm asking because in scribble you
define the messages always by an
operation name attribute and then the
rest of the values which to me means it
has a name it is nominal i typed in that
sense because you always require this
name attribute so what are you what is
your take on this it's distributed
computing fundamentally requiring
nominal types
raised eyebrows heavy thinking because I
have no clue
just rip it out of there okay so i think
the nominal types can carry a lot of
semantics that are meaningful for people
in the real life so a if you want to
throw away the nominal types you're
going to throw away all the informal
knowledge that programmers will have so
just getting rid of them because you can
do more stuff is not necessarily a 0 a 1
dot 0 plus you know it could be like 05
because you're misinterpreting the
structure that looks like some other
structure that you could recognize yes
so my own conclusion is that you need to
designate the semantic meaning of this
blob of data even when you have
stretched expressed it in such a fashion
that people can just interpret it
without a schema like Jason right you
can you can write down a message that
can be parsed by everyone but it it's
not clear what it means unless you have
some designator for the semantics so I
wanted to ask what are the current ways
of so the question is does just does it
fundamentally need nominal types for the
semantics what are the current employed
ways of solving the problems of
agreement on semantics are there any
current ways of solving it which do not
involve nominal types not not beknownst
to me so what we normally do is we have
a jar file that contains the protocol
definitions which are just Java classes
all nominally typed and then you use
them at all the places in your cluster
and so that solves the problem you will
need some discipline to evolve protocols
of course you can't just change things
willy-nilly you need to add versions and
stuff like that but that's how it's
normally done nowadays but there was
someone else
what's the definition of nominal types
so I'm a physicist so bear with me I
think a normal-type is one which has
been declared with a name and
identifiers so that the compiler knows
what it is by just looking at that thing
it doesn't look at the full structure
because from the name it knows the
structure that's the nominal type is the
user ID there and that it is it
structural type is there yes it's the
string underneath yeah I think that's
that's an interesting aspect with
nominal types you can have a string or
you can have a rap string that is
actually a user ID and you can
distinguish them even though their
structure is the same so I've got an
answer the question that's loud so in
answer to your question do you need
nominal types I would guess the answer
is no because air long is very
successful and has no types whatsoever
yes but in practice you always send a
symbol that denotes the semantics of
what you want to do in your tuple that
is a message so now we just argue about
what nominal means and we could do that
forever okay and so I guess the
conclusion is you don't need nominal
types in the type system meaning of the
word but you always need to denouement
to de nominate the semantics of your
operation okay to maybe if you just say
we need names I guess so yes right that
we don't need to be so fancy okay um
different question you went through
ordinary session types very quickly and
I'm really curious to know great i work
with session types and yet i sometimes
feel like i'm a guy with a hammer
running around looking for a nail
session types being my hammer what i
want to know is how many nails have you
encountered do session too high ordinary
bog standard session type yes they don't
do everything they don't do dynamic
extension that would be nice but within
what you've looked at half session types
actually seemed useful and where did
they seem particularly useful
so I I must confess that I have not yet
actually implemented all the stuff that
I would like to do I have just
implemented this very simple way of
capturing that one session 11 message
may lead to another and that is
extremely useful it is also well I have
not yet quite concluded yet whether it
is fully static or a bit dynamic already
I think it's mostly static in the sense
that the structure of a picture that you
draw of an interaction like that that
wouldn't change because that's written
at compile time so this would be fully
static what is not static is the
allocation of who does which part of
this protocol in my solution yet that
that's the difference to scribble where
that is static you just define that well
what is really useful in this is making
sure that you define a protocol which
does not confuse anyone and you have a
way of checking that everybody abides by
it and that is very valuable as far as I
can see so yes I think just normal
session types have lots of value thanks
that really helpful by the way I work
with the scribble people be happy to put
you put you in touch with them oh cool
yeah talk to you afterwards um so I
don't know what are they yeah this is
one of the questions I to ask of the
academic population so who here in this
room counts themselves in the academic
side of things okay yeah interestingly a
minority in this room but anyway the
scribbler has this feature of saying
interrupt where you say I'm waiting for
that message up from over there but now
I'm not interested anymore because
something else happened this means that
the local decision needs to be
propagated to the remote point where it
actually also affects things because the
the states where we are in the global
protocol well people need to kind of
agree on what that is in order to
meaningfully interact and not get
confused this is very simple in theory
when you say well we have guaranteed
delivery so it does work in practice we
do not have guarantee
delivery so any any number of papers I
read like actor model itself and so on
everywhere we have guaranteed delivery
assumed how much of the theory actually
depends really crucially on it or would
it just be more complicated to allow for
message loss this is this is this is I
think a big impedance mismatch between
industry and academia because yeah I'm
afraid I don't quite understand it
dropped it seems like it might do
something much worse than prevent
guaranteed delivery because of all the
non so an interrupt can happen while
some other messages currently running
and we have no idea what the state is
going to be so it's hard for me to talk
about much what interrupted do when I
can't even figure out what it does no
interrupt means I ask you something and
now I turn around do other things and
then I to figure out I haven't heard
back from you but well I I made my
decisions already so stop whatever you
were doing meanwhile you have gone and
checked some other things and we're just
about to get back to me and these method
messages that you are to interrupt and I
get your response they might cross paths
on their way the interrupt message might
be arbitrarily delayed so you might
still carry out the work and respond to
me but I don't expect that anymore
because well I interrupted you didn't I
so this in practice this is really hard
to implement
yeah so so the suggestion was to
explicitly incorporate time and the
timeouts well if you have atomic clocks
and you implement something that Google
spanner and you have the millions to
make it happen yes of course that's a
possibility no I what I mean is the
notion of time itself is also local at
for a physicist I mean it's that's clear
Einstein and so on right so I I guess in
general this has to do with distributed
algorithm so there's lots of papers of
synchronization in the distributed
algorithms paradigm where you where you
can say well I for example vector clocks
are a way to synchronize but those might
be too heavy for actors I don't know the
use cases so if you want consistency and
then you usually pay a price and there's
many distributed algorithms that can
give you some sort of consistency that
is true we are using vector clocks for
example in the implementation of a
cluster unsurprisingly because we need
consensus of who is in the cluster and
who is out and who got kicked out just
now right so so there we use it we have
reasons we have very expensive handling
of TCP reconnects and stuff like that to
just be able to guarantee eventual
delivery of a message but it's it's just
so hard to implement correctly and
therefore i'm asking is it really the
right default to design your algorithms
for
or it may be a local decision are to
ignore our response and that's that yes
so in scribble it is a local decision
and it will ignore responses but it will
also inform the other party so that the
state doesn't diverge so I keep doing my
I start doing my own things then because
I make this breaking decision kind of
and and you keep doing your things and
because you didn't hear of my decision
and then the participants might think
that they are in different protocol
stages unless the interrupt is actually
delivered and these matters for this
global check in right yes so the the
global check I think assumes that the
message will be delivered but I'm not an
expert on exactly that time for one more
so I was wondering about for these
multi-party sessions you might be able
to skip in the inner scheme so you could
basically say that here's one of the
players who is skipping these two steps
and what does that correspond to in all
the others yeah so in that sense I think
that's that might be very difficult to
get right because skipping over certain
things could just completely confuse
matters I don't does anyone else have a
good idea
yeah so that's when I I cannot answer
Chris do you have an idea uh no okay so
now you know at least what I'm very
interested in so please find me in the
hole and if you have things to discuss
on these matters then let's just have a
chat thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
