this way out to this remote building I'm
glad at least a few people have made it
I'm John pretty I don't know how many
people how many of you work in the
Skylar community or work with Scala but
I've been doing scala for about 13 years
now and I've I've spent my my career
doing lots of interesting well at least
I think interesting experiments with
Skylar and some pushing it to breaking
point a lot of the time and today I'm
going to talk about a library a very
maybe even framework but it's a very
very tiny library that works with
provides a synchronous functionality to
scala with a nice API and a lot of
safety and I'll I'll spend a lot of time
talking about that but actually the talk
is not so much about the asynchronous
framework that's me the basis for the
talk but I'll spend more time talking
about dependent types and how you can
use them in Scala so just a quick poll
around the room how many people use
Scala is your primary language so that
but about half ok how many of you have
never used Scala never used Scala so
you've all used scholar at least you
have some it's some experience of it how
many of you have had some experience of
working with asynchronous programming
okay so I think that was almost everyone
great so there's really only one idea in
this talk the idea is to use dependent
types as they exist and to the extent
that they exist in Scala to make writing
async code safer I'm going to talk about
this this framework and I I'm still a
little bit nervous about calling it a
framework because it is it's fewer than
40 lines of code
for signs of Scala that gives us one
fundamental feature which is safety over
over-ordering I'll explain what that
means in a in a second so welcome
welcome to the people who have just
arrived and found the room you didn't
you didn't miss much so when people talk
about frameworks a lot of lot of the
time they get asked questions like does
your framework do this or does your does
your framework do that and I I think the
answer to a lot of these questions is
often okay I'll go and add that feature
where is what I've tried to do is I've
I've got this this very lightweight
framework which is in many ways
orthogonal to scale the language so my
answer to a lot of those questions will
be you can implement that in the
language however you want all I'm doing
is providing these guarantees of safety
so what do I want to do what are the
goals of this library to make
asynchronous code easier to write and
syntaxes and everything but it is
important people want to have people
people want to be able to write code
that is readable that they can
understand they don't have to read
through lots of boilerplate or even to
write lots of boilerplate so these are
these are important things when when
both reading and writing code but in
addition to that I want to make it
harder for you to write code which won't
run and when i say difficult here what I
mean is I want the compiler to stop you
before you get before you compile this
code I want the compiler to say actually
no this is impossible change the code
and then maybe we can consider running
it but not not before so that's that's
what I'm trying to do I'm trying to
encode using the tools we have available
in the in the compiler in the type
system the constraints we want to have
in our system that we can reasonably
know at compile time things we can know
what certainly won't work and make sure
they don't ever get compiled
so I'm going to have an absolutely
trivial example for most of this talk
it's it's it's not interesting and I
don't want you to be distracted by what
what this this is doing it's it's my
simplest possible example of some
asynchronous code what we're going to do
is we're going to take a number from
standard input so there's a there's a
blocking task which is requesting input
from a user that can be a long-running
task there's another task which will
generate a random number now I don't
know how you don't know how you generate
the random number but we're going to
that asynchronously so we can we can
generate several at the same time and
then we're going to wait until both of
those tasks are finished and multiply
them together so I've removed anything
interesting from the code there it's
doing tedious boring stuff and I want
you to focus on the what what's being
provided by the framework in in reality
obviously generating a random number
could equally be replaced by some
synchronous code which does something
much more complicated more interesting
and I'm going to leave it for you to
substitute that in I don't want to
distract you by right by the unnecessary
details and although there's only three
in in my in my grass graph of tasks
there's only three edges what I hope is
obvious is these will compose you can
create a quite complex graph of
dependent tasks so let's say you wanted
to do this using futures in Scala is
anyone not familiar with scarless
futures feel feel free to raise your
hand cause I'm happy to have to do a
quick overview No okay so yeah
so futures in Scala when you create a
future you give you give it a lambda and
it will immediately start executing that
lambda which might take a while but it
will return a value immediately which is
the future now at any point after that
you can try to get the value of the
future
it might succeed if the lambda has
finished
if the computation has finished or it
might fail if it's if it's not ready yes
so you maybe get an exception maybe you
get a value so it blocks on a different
thread so it it sends the execution to a
thread pool or what's called in scalar
and execution context and in your main
thread that you create the future in you
you get you get a response you get a
return immediately it doesn't block your
dispatching the work somewhere else does
that make sense okay so if we wanted to
write this this really trivial example
using futures this is one thing you
might do I don't know if I can use my
pointer there so okay things I can't see
the pointer so we create an input future
that is getting the the input from the
user and that will wait until the user
type something in on the keyboard and
hits enter we have another task another
future should I say that that will
generate a random number I mean that
that that one will probably complete
very quickly and then we have the third
one which is using this future dot
sequence method and what that does is it
takes a list or a sequence of other
futures and it transforms the list of
futures into a single future of a list
or a single feature of a sequence so it
turns it inside out when they've all
when they've all completed so because
it's a single feature it has to wait for
all of the all of others to complete
before it returns it's single fat a
single list value which contains all of
the values within that so we can do that
and then once we've once that future has
completed and a future is monadic so we
can map across it so upon completion
we know all we sort of know that the the
values from these two dependent futures
are complete so they have values in
there and we can get them out so this is
how you would write it in in Scala scope
the scholar concurrent library yeah so
yeah I was going to say that so we have
the future than is the value inside the
future which is an option of a try of
the value so we get it so given the
future we get the value the value
returns an option of a try option is so
we said we so the first get will assume
that the option contains a value and
that it's not none so that's unsafe
well-spotted
the next get assumes that the value was
successful the try was successful so
there wasn't an exception thrown so we
made that assumption again and we get so
the both of these calls are unsafe and
to to int is also unsafe but we're going
to ignore that for now we assume that
the user types in digits so we finally
got the value we want out and we have to
convert it to an integer because it
comes in as a string and and in fact the
the future is typed as a string so
that's that's kind of to be expected let
me do the same thing with the random
value and then we multiply them together
and then the result that we get from
this this output value if we wait for it
now remember all three of these are
creased instantaneously more or less and
this one is dependent on these two so
when when output has completed so when
we've awaited the result of output and
we will wait infinite time this this
syntax here is part of Scala standard
library and it's it's a little bit
verbose
I think as a deterrent to people to say
this code is going to block we're going
to make it slightly less easy for you to
do the blocking so try and do things are
synchronously I don't really care too
much about that but we wait for the
result and then at the end of this we
will get an integer which is a random
number times whatever you typed in it's
not not very exciting but this this will
this will work but I'm relying to a
large extent on the guarantee that this
input value was definitely completed I
could write this input value get or get
outside of the output block and that
would fail because it would be
attempting to get the value before
before we've waited for it or
potentially there's a race condition but
in the general case this this would not
be safe we only happen to know it's safe
here because we carefully remember to
include it in this sequence here we
carefully mapped across across the value
here so I'm not I'm not entirely
satisfied with this now there's an
alternative way with with chaining
futures together where we using the map
method same as before in in the previous
slide I actually threw away the value I
said I don't care what the value is but
I'm going to map across it so
essentially I was only taking the fact
that these are completed and then using
that as a justification for continuing
in this slightly different version I'm
going to pattern match on the results so
given that I've got the input future and
the random future here I'm going to
expect there to be an input value and
the random value coming out of that so
route if you remember the future
sequence turns a sequence of futures
into a future of sequence and this is
the sequence that's inside that that's
the result but in order to make this
work I have to cast this is really
horrible code
why do I have to cast well by putting
the future of string in the same
sequence as a future of ins I'm sorry
I'm I've got the cursor on my screen I'm
showing you where to look but you can't
see it of course which is useless with
the with the future input in the same
sequence as the sorry the future string
in the same sequence as a future event
these get converted into futures of any
so the type is lost because they have to
have a union type or at least upper
bound and in Scala that that works out
as a list of sorry future of any which
is not ideal because it means that later
on we need to cast them back into
whatever types we we wanted and that is
of course unsafe so that these these
casts here are a little bit risky if we
if we change the order of input and
random over there then this would all
break and the compiler wouldn't help us
at all so again not ideal so there's
also you can also write this in a for
comprehension style this is it's
everyone familiar with for
comprehensions as a yes or a yeah so so
this look this is a way of using the
monadic the melodic features of futures
and saying where's the cursor do do this
then do this and then do this with those
two values does anyone know of any
problems with this yeah yeah yeah so
these these is the input and the random
and not yet not carried out in parallel
there disturb their dispatch to a thread
pool or an execution context which is
which is great but
the second one doesn't get dispatched
until the first one has returned so
we're losing parallelism there so in
each of these three examples there's
something lost here we've lost
parallelism and it seems like these
three options I've presented forcing us
to choose between the safety of the
ordering that was the first first one
type safety the second one I I had to
abandon that when I I merged everything
into a single type in order to pass it
through futures or sequence and here
we're losing parallelism so the question
is can we get all three so I could
and then then put the results in a tuple
or something
as a result from FIFA sorry
Mike Mike us inputs you oh I see
sorry yeah yeah that works actually I
you that'sthat's true but it's I still
think that say that's a reasonable
solution yeah yeah yeah no sorry that
yeah that that's yeah this is lacking in
that respect and does it what does it
work in the general case you sure you do
need the additional bindings okay
II yes right right yeah that's that's
that's a limitation of that's a
limitation for comprehensions
okay well this talk isn't about acing
frameworks it's about dependent types so
I will thank you for that I'll move on
to the well is oh so I I wrote these I
went back and so the author I although I
developed this I I wrote the framework
and then I went back and wrote the
justification for the framework which is
these slides here this this
justification fell short anyway this is
how you write it using using my
framework so we have async blocks these
are a bit like futures except they don't
start executing immediately so we the
first to look very similar the third one
what happens here is that we say that
the output is dependent on the to two
previous async blocks input and random
and what we what we don't do is we we
provide it with a lambda and don't worry
too much about the I'm doing it again
with my cursor over here
do you kill yeah so ignore this for the
moment but essentially we're going to
coolly get the input value and the
random value inside this inside this
this lambda block and then we await the
result so it's not much different yet
and you may we'll ask what is what is
the point in this and it's actually more
interesting for me not so much the code
that does compile but the code that
doesn't so if I if I made this small
change so if I forget to declare input
as a as a dependency this will no longer
compile because calling input in here is
it's now a compiler so the rest of the
talk will be explaining how that works
more or less is there run okay with the
the thing that I've shown here yeah
right okay so let me show you my next
slide which answers your question this
is a subtle distinction or maybe subtle
maybe not there's a distinction between
the unev alyou ated async object the
thing representing that that
asynchronous computation and the value
you get out of it
and it's these these prends here and
they the key thing is they only work you
can only apply these empty parens to one
of these async objects if you are in a
context where it is safe to do that that
is the safety guarantee that the library
is giving giving you so we going off the
slide a little bit but there's there's
nothing interesting on the right hand
side so we can call the eight the apply
method inside the output block because
there is an implicit and available there
is you can't sit so well there but this
there is this n object here and if we
explicitly apply the implicit this is
what the code looks like so I've put
some some types in here so you can see a
little bit more what's going on I'll
I'll provide more refinements on these
types later but this is this is a async
will be generic right right now it is
yeah it I'm just gonna pretend it's it's
some generic a synchronous thing generic
in the so yeah it'll get a type
parameter basically that is that is what
I'm trying to say and we will so the end
parameter gets applied here and here so
that that is to say that the Scarlet
compiler oh great time to install new
software remind me later
okay so scholars implicit they get they
get pulled in whenever they're needed so
if you have a method which requests a
implicit parameter of a certain type the
Scarlet compiler will go and look within
scope for an implicit matching that type
that happens to be one defined in this
block implicit N and it will get applied
to these parameters here so if you look
at the definition for the apply method
this is the one that gets called on
input and random it's expecting an
implicit end there and what that will do
is it will actually get the value out
but I haven't shown the implementation
at all okay so far I haven't haven't
really explained why it works in some
cases and not others yet so the type
parameters have arrived at least
partially so the easy part is the the
return types this one returns a string
this one returns an int nothing and I
think exciting there but the quest is
what type goes in here it in place of
these question marks there's the
definition of a sink below and I'm also
going to say that the the end parameter
has a has a type parameter as well and
this is this is going to be critical in
working out which values get the end
they want and which ones don't
so if you remember to the right of the
slide where with the code that didn't
work I didn't declare input as a
parameter to the the post method and the
n could not be applied there was an
implicit search failure so it couldn't
find an appropriate end for for that
that value so how are we going to do
this hello to people just arrived
so what I would actually want is some
representation of something set like and
I want that representation at the type
level now why do I do that why do I want
that
well the compiler is running at the type
level it doesn't have access to the
values yet so it doesn't it can't go and
check whether a value has been completed
so we only have the type level to work
with and we've got these set like things
to represent the set of dependencies of
each async task and that's that's an
arbitrary size set of dependencies might
be a single value might be no values it
might be might be 100 potentially now
for every async value which I assign to
a named value named identifier there's a
singleton type associated with that so
for input there is input type is anyone
not familiar with singleton types again
thank you raise it raise your hand I
will give you a very quick overview a
singleton type is the type that has only
one value namely that type itself so
every conversely if you like every value
gives rise to a type which is its
singleton type so you assign a thing to
a to a value in Scala you immediately
get a type available available that the
compiler is able to work with to talk
about to do computations on type a lot
of computations on so reach those acing
values we do have a singleton type input
type we've got random dot type and we
like to get output type and one thing we
need to be able to test again at the
type level is this condition that the
the async task we're depending on is a
dependency
is declared as a dependency so the
question is how do we do this what
machinery do we have in scarless type
system to to do this well there's one
very well known way of doing this which
is use H lists
well it's quite well known in Scala but
H lists are very there they're linear
there they're defined recursively in
order to was that time five minutes okay
okay I'm I'm about halfway but they
define recursively there they're not
ideal whereas intersection types so to
speed up they have a lot of the same
semantics we want from from sets so the
type a would be at least in scholars
type system is considered equivalent to
B with a there are some soundless issues
but we won't encounter them and I can
guarantee we won't encounter them so
they're considered the same type a with
a with B or a with B with a is the same
as a with B it D duplicates as you might
expect but you have a type int and so
and you find the intersection of int
with int well it's just in the same type
so this is this is kind of what we would
expect so we've got reordering and
deduplication semantics these are the
same as sets and you can observe that
the type a is a super type of a with B
the type B is a super type of a with B
type C is not a super type of that so we
can use subtyping as a membership test
for these sets these type level sets if
we represent the sets as intersection
types and we can have an intersection of
singleton types now you might think well
if I have a type representing the the
single
instance input and another one
representing the single instance random
what does it mean to talk about the
intersection type because obviously
that'll be the empty set
there'll be no members of that that
doesn't matter we don't need to have
instances for the type to be useful the
type can exist the compiler can talk
about the type it can do computations on
the type without ever needing to create
an instance it remains as a phantom type
so we can have types like int with
string there are no instances of int
with string but it's completely fine for
the compiler to work with them so that's
I think quite nice in a way it means we
don't have to provide evidence that such
a thing can exist and they're they're
useful the types are useful as bounds so
we can make this type a with be abound
on another type and I'll show you how
that how that might work so this is what
the types look like when I've replaced
those triple question marks with with
actual types you can see that the
dependencies of output are encoded in
its type signature as an intersection of
singleton types the code is the same as
the previous previous version of this
but we've now got that that intersection
type specified and also inferred and
that the type inference is very
important I don't want to have to write
this as a as a user I want the compiler
to work it out for me now in order to
get this type inferred the variance is
important so well input or type is in
this example always a super type of this
this intersection the slow guarantee the
end of
the environment of input or type is a
super type of env input or type with
random blood type unless they're
covariant so covariant means n if n type
parameters covariant it means the type
end of something behaves at least with
respected subtyping in the same way as
the types themselves and in order for
this to work we need to make sure the
end is covariant we indicate that with a
plus two the dependencies type parameter
there if the if the subtyping works in
the opposite direction so if if it gets
reversed when it's in a type parameter
position that is called contra variance
is that two minutes before questions or
Tim's before time up ok I'll go over
into the questions so we want to have
these types inferred we don't want to
have to specify the merrier so I use a
little trick in Scala which is sort of
walking the walking the delicate line of
what's possible with with the language I
think so you saw this post method which
takes a list of dependencies each of
which is some async type now I've
specified it here as the depth parameter
with with varargs
so you can provide multiple dependencies
in this in parameter position here and
it will infer a type depth accordingly
but if we just took the least upper
bound the lab of those dependencies we
get a type that is not useful to us it's
a sink of any returning any probably
it's not it's not what we want
we want this depth type to be inferred
as the intersection because we need to
use that later on to provide the
subtyping bounds on the end implicit and
we need to do that with contravariance
now this is this is the first step to
water making the syntax quite nice when
we call a post method let's say we wrap
each of these parameters in a dependency
so we say new dependency I'm explicitly
specifying the type there but we can
create a dependency around input around
random and then within we can infer a
type based on the contravariance of
dependency or the D parameter which is
the intersection type if it was
covariant then we'd get a lab of those
but we're using contravariant so the
type we get is the greatest lower bound
and that is the intersection type so
that that's fine except this is
incredibly verbose and we really don't
want to have to write all of this every
time you might as well just sort out
some other way so we use implicit
conversions in scala to automatically
apply that dependency wrapper around
each parameter so we request a type
which is dependency and we put an
implicit conversion in scope which
converts from an async type to a
dependency type and in the process wraps
it so this implicit I've called Auto
wrap it takes an async returns
dependency and we have to be careful
here we we specify the type explicitly
to be the singleton type because by
default Skyler doesn't infer singleton
types it will it will naturally widen to
the sort of next the next type up which
would be just the async type because
that's generally more useful we're
generally not working with depend with
the singleton types directly so we'll
get the type we want and
the async so the the type parameter on
this async post method will get inferred
to be the the intersection type which is
what we want if you look at all the
hidden syntax in there that that is
inferred by the compiler this is this is
pretty much the same as the three or
four lines I showed you at the beginning
the first the first example for
impromptu it's horribly verbose all
these type parameters all of these
implicit s-- this is this is what scala
hides from you and this is what it this
is what it becomes now i've said this is
almost boilerplate free because there's
this piece of code or there's something
here which annoys me every time i have
to write it which is this implicit end
part of the lambda it's the same every
time
we know that whenever we use one of
these whenever we call the post method
that the lambda it takes will have an
implicit environment it'll be the same
every time so it's frustrating as a user
of this library to have to write that
yep I've got three more slides so in in
dot e we have a feature called implicit
functions which allows us to define
rather than specifying at the call site
where that post method is called we
specify at the definition site that that
that will be an implicit lambda and we
can simply omit the implicit end there
so we lose that boilerplate so dot e has
hoped to make this even even neater and
this is I think shorter and safer than I
think all of the examples that we saw on
the first slide even even the even the
the for comprehension one
oh did you talk about yesterday it is
this it is the same yes I I didn't I
didn't go to as keno because I've seen
it a couple times before but it exactly
the same thing yes these are implicit
functions yeah yeah so now it all makes
sense now here is Eustace that I think
Martin didn't really envisage possibly
but you can yes uh I haven't yet but you
could protect you well I see it I think
you don't need that
I think the future sequence is not
required anymore you simply refer to the
you say you say I depend on these named
async so yes so yeah yes
I'll be around the rest I'm gonna be
around tomorrow but thank you
you
