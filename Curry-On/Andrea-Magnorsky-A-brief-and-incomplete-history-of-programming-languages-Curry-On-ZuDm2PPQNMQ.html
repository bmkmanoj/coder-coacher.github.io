cuts it's about history programming
languages and so history programming
languages is it's a thing that you know
it's one of those things that as you as
you're going a software developer you
kind of first you're just doing your
thing because you're learning to program
and whatever and then you are learning
more and then you start assuming things
that you know right for example I
started programming in Pascal and then I
did Delfy and then I did C sharp and
when you know people tell me about
Anders it's like oh yeah of course and
it's like and then I started thinking
that other people should know the stuff
that I know because they were also
programmers but it turns up that you
know we're all different and we have
different backgrounds and you know
learning about our peoples backgrounds
is kind of cool
so you know I kind of thought well
that's something that you kind of have
to do what intention so you have to
learn that right and and then I thought
well why would I spend time my pressure
my precious time instead of writing code
or doing something like playing with
cuts and why would I just spend it
writing boring you know history books
and the well the only way to find out
things to do it right and so that's why
I'm here and I kind of do it with the
retrospection on me because I also
assume that our people shouldn't you
should know so I hope that you're you're
interested in what I gotta say so my
name is Andre I'm ignore ski and I work
in a company called workday and it's
funny because this is an enterprise
company but we have their own language
too which is kind of cool and so they
have a slightly more you know enterprise
but they they have an interesting
programming language which is absolutely
not what I'm going to talk about today
so and the thing about history is that
there is all this like each one of you
has a vision of what is going on and
some of your picking up on you know some
stuff some more I'm freakin up to some
where's the history is the same and
there's a lot of things that contradict
each other
so maybe I feel for things that I'm
gonna say contradict your knowledge and
understanding of what happened and
that's okay and also I couldn't minute
name all your favorite languages or even
the important ones I just chose some so
you know good I'm with luck and so yeah
where am I going to start I'm sure some
of you might want wanted to be wondering
what am I gonna show first
so we're stopped here right okay so I'm
gonna start with David Hilbert because
well in and around that this guy had
like a lot of background on mathematics
and logic and but the thing is like he
was trying to come up with they're like
foundations of mathematics he had a
really cool a social circle namely I
mean order I was a church a school curry
you know like really like calm people
that didn't know what they were doing of
course and and like his assistant was
John for Norman and like the list keeps
going this is like ridiculous all these
people were literally in the same place
occur like and so imagine someone like
that and at the same time there was a
philosophical movement and by a minute
of water a nose or something and that
they were going with we don't we do not
know and we want now so imagine all
these cool people go like yeah I want to
learn all the stuff and at the same time
some or group of people going like with
it's okay we we just don't know and
we're fine so the response that they
would Hubert had to that was that
actually you know what we must know and
we will do it which is kind of very you
know from a philosophical impetus point
of view this was very very cool in and
around the time he said this he also
started talking about a problem slash
question and I'm gonna totally kill the
german-language here and go team
Charleston problem which I'm sure you
know sorry German speakers but basically
this is the decision problem and
basically this is about trying to figure
out this logical you know if a logical
statement terminates
if there is a guest no answer to
something and that's a better
explanation of what I just said this was
Lenin around 1928 and in about 1931
crude gurus say no and so Goodell is a
low decision and probably in with Fraga
with with Aristotle and and fredle or
whatever his parents in this the same
name as the or JVM language terrace in
haskell and top top legislation people
so that's cool so crude curdle said no
but the things like we still needed to
like device what really was meant by a
computation like what is an algorithm
right and so to the rescue our friend
mr. Church right and to do that he
devised a formal system for expressing
computation and that was lambda calculus
cool stuff right in and around the same
time and I'm being nonspecific on
purpose and our friend Alan Turing came
to the rescue and the created the Turing
machine and I really like this
representation because it's kind of like
what I imagined when when I think of the
definition which is a an afferent
computational device that you know kind
of my mention can figure out the
limitations of what can be computers
right and by the way for every bit of
stuff that I mentioned here or paper
that I mentioned here there's resources
at the end of these slides and there's
links because I know people what did you
get - and so this is in and around 3637
a church in lambda calculus and Turing
machine and and actually had a lot of
discussions and they work on animated
and then one of the side effects of that
was the church-turing thesis which
basically meant that both the lambda
calculus and the Turing machine were
equivalent so meaning those two things
are hey this actually makes sense
and there are two different things but
they're they do the same thing which is
really really cool and we're talking
about the year 36 37 and they were in
Germany which is a bad spot and because
there was nothing and you know that's
terribly unhappy so people had to go and
and this is kind of like the least weird
/ side in which I could come up with to
talk about that and but what that meant
is that I'm just gonna avoid all day all
that time and just say that during that
time there's a lot of development in
hardware right and Turing was involved
as all of us know in some of that and
you can go to the Bletchley Park Museum
in the UK for at least a couple of you
know months more as far as I know and
and and so we know that he's there and
then we come to talk about Bryce Harper
right so I'm going really fast on
purpose because you know lots of history
and stuff
but you can feel free to like laugh and
also fall asleep this is really boring
and so anyway we're doing about Bryce
Harper and and we're talking about more
or less the years 43 49 she was involved
in a lot of early machine development
and she was running a lot of machine
code to the point where she realized
that maybe it was a good plan to stop
writing this really easy to make mistake
stuff and abstract a little bit and so
she came up with the first compiler
called a serum
and a couple of years later like not too
much after and not so much long after
she came up with an actual programming
language called flow-matic this is the
year 54 55 this wasn't the first
programming language but it was just
very very close in and around and just
just for reference this is kind of what
it looked like right this is flow-matic
and I mean even some of the beautiful
Erlang syntax say early on there right I
know I know it's Robert is not here so
it's okay and I know I'm sorry
and so this is some little bits of
chromatic which brings me to john backus
right so we're talking about packers and
this is a guy that one of the first
things that he was doing was after
graduating he was working on calculating
the position of the moon which is a cool
gig if you can get it kind of anybody
knows about that totally interested and
in and around this is the person that in
and around 1953 gave us speed coding so
just a little bit before and phlegmatic
and then he kept working on that and at
IBM and with a team of people came up
with it for Trump this is the same
person that a couple years later and
gave us the Baptist in art form and a
very cool paper called and can program
and liver be liberated from the one mind
style and which is seen as like an
apology to for for writing Fortran and
but it's good it's good that he wrote
for trans he spent a lot of time and
should be trying to come up with this
but also it's good that we went and
wrote his paper because he's like hey I
learned from this stuff which is cool so
for those of you that are wondering what
Fortran programming looked like looks
like this we actually had to do it in
the sheets initially and this is kind of
what it there is stuff going on there is
I don't you cannot there is there some
some online things that you can go and
check and actually writes important
though not the first one
watch me this brings me to obviously
John McCarthy
now I'm there's a lot of people that do
list here and I have a lot of respect
for this man and so you know you all the
to a lot more less than I do
would probably know more about this
stuff so I'm just gonna keep it like and
say that you know heads up
and so this is the guy that came up with
the term AI and and witless we got like
garbage collection time sharing and
incredibly time structures this is the
year 58 1958 or 59 that's just
ridiculous and so with that we go to em
I'll go now okay that picture looks
terrible there and it looks much better
in my screen and basically it's a bunch
of people sitting down and so this is a
the ACM committee and saying hey people
let's all get together and actually you
know try to come up with a common
language and and that was good because
you know McCarthy was there chuckles was
there Peter landing eventually joined so
the people that were involved in the
languages that we were just talking
about COBOL Fortran list we're all in
kind of one room or at least talking to
each other right and that meant good
things so okay now this is where I wish
that I had pictures and this is a graph
from a paper called a programming
languages past and future by Jean Sammet
she wrote his paper in 1972 and kind of
you know describing the 20 years of
programming language history and this is
a this graph I particularly like because
and you can't see it but basically this
is 1960 so this is like the languages
that we just talked about and where they
are and it's like afterwards it's just
one completely crazy because
languages started influencing each other
and just things happen so this is what
people start learning from each other
and I'm gonna make this impact emphasis
on people all the time because it's a
very obvious trend to me and so so
that's cool and and you can see that a
lot of that influence comes from that
Algol committee and the 58 and the 64
which is cool so this is like the first
part of the talk were where I kind of
talk about people in particular but
after this it becomes impossible because
it's just too many people so now I go I
will go through and every decade and I
chose some languages for five languages
each and we just described all of these
languages and three of those languages
are mostly imperative declarative
languages one of them is a functional
language as you can see they're close in
time just go and this is a list what the
Senate look like and there's parentheses
and the way you read this is slightly
different to what you would be used to
in our languages but I know some people
laugh about this one and go like Oh
parentheses the worst I think it kind of
got used to it it's fine like it's fine
right and also this is supposed to be
common lisp and which is not the
original list but you know again I'm
just trying to throw you into water and
porno - that you say something like
there's no point in be precise about
something that you don't know much about
and this is what I'm trying to do I'm
just trying to throw up on you and you
kind of go like okay now I have a fuzzy
idea of where things are and I can go
and dig deep if I want it so this brings
me to a really exciting decade right got
a peer who loves APL come on come on
cool you guys are cool so the three of
you and so and so APL it's a really
interesting language will work for a
couple of reasons but the first thing
that they were trying to do is kind of
say well we want simplicity and the
things like well simplistically kind of
comes after complexity really you know
something is simple maybe turns out
there and simple but generally as Alan
Perlis capitalism is basically stuff
first as complex and then you simplify
it so I think that we're going for
something like this
and so this is a language that you read
from right to left and that looks are
not like mathematical formula in fact my
view on this is that the only reason
this language is not more popular is
because they have that weird constant
key word I think if they would have gone
for a normal keyboard they would have
won but that's my view personal view and
stuff then this is 1962 then we have
basic and we're thinking about micro
computers and they were trying to bring
programming to everyone I mean does that
sound familiar because it really
resonates with something I saw on our
newspaper yesterday
so then we come to so APL is a
functional language and basic is kind of
imperative e stuff and logo who
programmed with the Turkish cool come on
we've never I was I grew up in Argentina
and we had logo there okay so I'm sure
that most of you if you didn't use the
turtle it kind of been wanted and it's a
great educational tool and it had it
actually had great success I think if
the it Corinth you know and also from
foreign language and I confront them
multi-paradigm language then you have
Pascal and this is one of those
languages that came straight out of the
alcohol 68 the committee which so I'll
go kept going as a thing that people
made up and talked about and this is
Nicolas worse programming language he's
mostly based in Switzerland now if you
ever are looking for papers to read just
pick any that he wrote and it's unicorn
ain't gonna be in for a treat and but
anyway the creator of Pascal and my
first language so I love another time
for that so I'm sure you you know since
there was only three people that like
they appear and nobody PL this is what I
programmed it just a pure looks like now
remember they were talking about
simplicity and elegance and and then the
first time I looked at this I went like
what I mean it simple I just have no
idea what's going on but so what this
thing does is it's a it's fine stripes
you know up to a number so if you have a
number R and you want to find you know
all the primes there I've low it what
what you say it's like you know what I'm
going to do I'm going to create a vector
I'm gonna drop the first item then I'm
gonna do this matrix multiplication then
I'm with this negation stuff I'm gonna
drop everything that is not in the
diagonal and what's remaining
it's a prime now
I know this is like when you follow it
after you followed the first time it
starts actually making sense and I found
myself going like this is really simple
and elegant and I'm not joking
I don't know if I would do it for reals
all the time but it does something very
very nice to your brain so I recommend
you try and in a good way
come on I know what you're thinking so
anyway that kind of gives you know I've
been trying to show the strangest
languages as a way to say hey look at
this cool stuff that happened in the
past
and so then you have the seventies now
and probably the most influential
language that the channeling is not used
in Smalltalk and this is 1972 it's a
alan kay it's written by Dan Ingalls
this is the beginning of a world and one
of the things I love about this is that
it was a language influenced by
something completely out of computing
and that is like cell in microbiology
interactions and stuff and that's really
exciting and so I also fluent by
singular and in a dynamic language so
that's 1972 then it comes to a family of
language that I have a lot of
interesting and that's ml and this is
where we see the first type functional
language which is very cool and and you
should check it out if you haven't used
an ml I mean who has used any amount
like for example a camel
Sandra ml attract good people the rest
of you should totally check it out cuz
it's amazing and then we go to product
1972 the probably the most well known
for a logic programming language and
it's declarative like that's the best
thing to think and then we have C and a
language that as far as I see
as far as I see it was kind of it
emerged from like seriously I need to
like manage this as a system and I need
something that can touch the bare metal
in a without crazy abstractions
seriously I need this so this is Dennis
Ritchie and consumption and we'll call
it all over campus them a little bit
later so freakiest language we'll talk
about the clarity programming what does
that mean andraia what are you talking
about that's me so and you can say I'm
gonna give a relation between things I'm
gonna give another relation between
these other things and then you ask for
like hey what's going on generally
Prolog replying like false but of course
sometimes it reminds me of some types of
crashes and well at least it's been
really fun today and mostly because I
put you know you put in doesn't work
anyway you get what I'm saying it's
still kind of cool to know very
different way to think of our problem
and still play that so that's cool and
so we're in the eighties when some of us
were born some of us might be born later
and we have five programming languages I
included one today you get zero points
if you guess which one
and so it may be true in 1996 and Erlang
was created and the funny thing about
this is that this is an interesting
language because they were like you know
we need zero downtime we need to
hot-swap things we need to think to be
like working all the time and the three
crazy people one more place is
imperative and created this beautiful
beautiful thing I'm highly influenced by
Prolog in fact a lot of the syntax is
product and concurrent functional a lot
of message passing they implemented the
actors actors without actually knowing
what actors where and they figure it out
later who by the way we discovered
actors too and so that was cool and so
that's our life and then this is the
only no domain-specific
that I talk about in this talk at all
that's equal and this is basically a
practical implementation of relational
databases and this is like God's
theories from the 74 or whatever year he
published that paper this is like hey
let's actually use this 83 and then we
have Miranda Miranda this could be fun
and so this is the one of the many
language that language is that david
Turner implemented and very very
inspirational for Haskell and lacy
purely functional programming languages
that side effects and imperative
language features so you know that's
cool and then we have C++ which is also
your friends by similar kind of like a
small tapas and basically they want ok
CI let's see it's very cool and I need
some classes and it's some strong typing
and our stuff with it they need to grow
this I need to do more stuff and that's
pretty cool but the thing that I thought
it was you know oh ok I see a trend
again following that thing of systems
programming languages doing something
slightly and strange and one of the
philosophies things that they have on
that I found about simplified is that
they were like we want to keep the users
advanced features even if they can be
misused literally we don't care about
safety but we want to be able to do
things I I want to get things done I
don't want this thing to get in my way
and finally and we have bird and this is
it's a postmodern and I really like what
Larry said this morning about hey we
know there's these languages that are
kind of like fast we've been here for a
long time and and you know I thought
that was that was really cool and it
kind of goes well with where I'm going
with this
maybe and so again because this is the
strangest language that don't that least
I think and this is an example of
Ireland
here's that syntax that I talked about
and we call in semi colon dot Robert
loves it when people like that and so
what you do is you define a module if
you want to show something and make it
available to something else you say this
is my function this is the era T of
those functions and then you pair match
if you want you do your operations if
you want I think it's kind of
self-explanatory but at least if you've
never seen their like Pearson this is
two functions declare a module boom and
so we get to the nineties and in the
nineteenth there's like these three
languages at the top and their languages
oh sorry high school it's a standardized
language and committee based this is the
language where we see type classes the
first time which is really cool and and
a bunch are really really nice features
now the pre language it at the top are
kind of standardized or driven by a
group of people the language is at the
bottom they're driven by companies and
not alike teeny tiny companies they're
driven by it companies trying to do a
lot of stuff and and and that that is
the trend very I kind of detective if
you put more more languages there you
can add visual FoxPro and/or stuff and
that's pretty cool I'd kind of think
that is in this room it's a bit not
necessary to go and Peter's clothes are
different what what I do see a trend
there as a imperative or some features
of follow trying to GUI eyes yourself
and stuff like that and be able to write
gooeys or some sort of UI interface with
people and whatever things none of those
language are fringy I decided to go with
the most popular one and that even just
for your enjoyment you're welcome and
and now we're getting close to today
right and we have the penalties right so
we have
all these languages these languages that
are multi-paradigm
in general and there are can they have
some functional aspects to it there are
you know literally saying they lunch is
really over and and our designers have
realized and we're trying to do
something about it which is cool and
then we have something like beam which
is a system it's basically someone
saying well C++ is not enough and and
creating something pretty amazing
something that allows you to do some
very very cool meta programming stuff
and then you have go which I'm sorry but
I really know nothing about and I
honestly no it's not I didn't throw it
on purpose it's the language by Google I
know you can do very cool stuff about
deploying to stuff and there's a cool
program a new programming language
called Odin now that I mean I'm
interested with that that's cool and so
because this is the we're just talking
about I decided to show something right
so you can to type classes indeed that's
cool and well I guess it's probably just
close to that classes and so that's
pretty nice and this is the weird bit
that you want to look at if you're
looking at this is this is how the magic
happens I guess the rest is pretty seen
like and so that's really nice I'm just
gonna leave it there so only you can go
see you later because actually we're
closing time we're in this state right
right and now the four of these five
languages are driven by a benevolent
dictator benevolent others and and then
we have rust which is a really nice
systems language driven by Mozilla and
and so two words that in a throughout
the decades that we've seen we seem like
there's always one system programming
language there's something functional
about stuff a little bit more or less
but here we see a very very and maybe
because you know the take it is not over
maybe would come back tomorrow magically
in last in the next three years surprise
and hopefully not and what we've seen
all these languages is there is really
nice algebraic data types power marching
and all the languages you know all the
stuff that actually you know you can get
stuff done which is really really really
nice or at least I think so and so we're
in this this decade so of course I have
to show a trace right and so I do I said
what okay it's okay I know it's boring
Silas calm down and the waitresses are
abundantly tight yeah a programming
language and what you can do is
basically do more with us in the way of
you can say I'm gonna prove stuff in
fact I don't know if that's gonna work
but um but you can say stuff like I want
this respecter to be this way and in the
words of Edwin Friday
it's a pacman complete programming
languages I seen you can create a
pattern nobody cares about this is what
he said so you know your code and its
husk it's written in Haskell and you
should go try it out and or get the get
the book that he wrote about it which is
really good and there is really good
tutorial for all these languages you you
get a lot of really good talks at least
about getting started which is really
nice so you might be wondering where am
I going with all of this because we had
part one where I go to that things how
it all started then I prove you through
all these languages through all the
decades and I'm gonna try to turn around
it up which is hard so
this is my move my beautiful art I'm
sorry pay the science that I did so what
I've done here is basically went through
all the languages and said down here in
this yellow area there's like imperative
oil stuff in the middle you have
functionally stuff and in the very top
darker you have logically light stuff
again completely inaccurate and slightly
and purpose slightly because apparently
I don't know how to draw and we don't so
I was trying to find friends what is
going on and of course if I was doing if
I would have done this a little bit more
precisely and you know we would have
found things like oh I should have put
how many developers we thought we had on
each of the languages because that would
have given us a lot more data right and
you can see this cleaner trying the
people of people and language is going
more two words here you can also see
that trend of okay maybe some of these
languages were more researchy you can
start thinking about this a little bit
more I I'd love to like think about this
more I I did this partly because I
thought I can't see this thing that I
see in my brain with all this data so if
you can think of Paraguay's to
illustrate this I'm torn in welcoming
feedback and or help so that's one
people you have this idea of um
paradigms over time and how an RB of
this it's something like this this is
from concept techniques and something
else off computer time it's a it's a one
on book with the side by Amelia on the
cover it's like 13 euros on Amazon I
shouldn't say that right okay anyway
it's really good if you want to learn
about programming paradigms and it gives
you this are beaut right so in here you
have logic programming languages in
these you can't read this but it says
product there as well and then in here
you have imperative world languages and
in between you have functional with some
different flavors of lazy non lazy and I
thought you know what that's great still
I'm not I feel like I'm losing some
information on this right
so that's that's kind of what I see that
this is still really useful and it's
really good to reason about because
what's what's happening here is that
some and it is the turn up here turn up
somewhere else as well so you start
learning about what does it really mean
for a language to be independent like
what are the side effects of that for
real and then they got this right so
this is precise this is as precise as
Wikipedia they Peter gets but I can't
click on it really useful and so whoa
that's great I really love this this is
a great experience
okay so okay we're going to imagine what
happens here right and so this is a
graph generator Wikipedia data it goes
on and kind of goes over all the data
about languages and finds what was
influenced by and what influenced it and
you can click on one so imagine I
clicked on it like and a bunch of things
connect and I told you what what what
was influenced by and you also know
which language your favorite language
influenced and the funny thing is that
you see this the bigger circles are
obviously the most influential in the
loop function and that that means you
know I kind of started thinking about
this talk when I was thinking about what
why programming languages nuke us they
do today
and obviously they influence the
syntactical of semantical influences are
obviously significant and this graph
kind of shows that on average so it's
nice to click about when you can it's
really amazing when you can you should
you should totally click on things and
whenever you wait no totally was this
was working five seconds before the talk
anyway so we have three views of this
programming languages none of which I'm
extremely confused
so I was trying to okay let's hurt these
cuts and so this is all this ideas
they're slightly like not very you know
coherent maybe maybe they shouldn't be
coherent
maybe that's what we're supposed to so I
see yeah I see a growing trend towards
and attention to tooling and developer
productivity but you know what I'm like
I think that's been there all along it's
just that not always you know language
designers could actually pay as much
attention basically the phone thing
wasn't very they were like are just you
know just do it and maybe that was the
thing maybe it wasn't
I don't remember don't I'm actually
talking about this in code much last
year saying I should have paid more
attention to tooling or I wanted to pay
more attention to tooling you see I'm
going that way etcetera etcetera but
this is this is a concern and it's
really none of this one is one that
actually we're talking here with some
people yesterday and this is the tension
between good languages and I'm doing
quote please note the quotes and stop
throwing things at me just in case you
were thinking about it and I'm getting
stuff done I can see an obvious tension
and actually I kind of want to reward it
as a tension between languages that are
inspired by the Machine and what the
Machine does in a kind of natural way
and things and languages that are
inspired by literally everything else
there are more abstract and that have
this design ideas and so you know that
that's that's a thing that is there I
don't know how to express it better but
I think there's something that I'd love
to like keep thinking work firmly it's
people and communities developing
languages I see more on that definitely
the trend and that's really really cool
and when we come to people as I
mentioned a bunch of times before people
are now really the creators of two
languages and the languages are tools
for our brains as developers right so
if the tooth shape our thinking tell if
that makes that programmers at you know
foreign languages designers are actually
philosophers you know kind of like
garlic which is nice so what will we do
in the 20s
what will we do in the twenty some in
the 2020 you know singularity and I have
not yet actually there's a really long
kind because I know of course I know my
question though um your list of
languages from each technique where they
sorted in any way they were they were
and so I selected them based on I did
want to show some level of strangeness
and but the way they were sort of where
according to what I like because I
thought this is gonna be subjective any
way through it so I might as well do it
the way I like it
he's our lady in the 90s hospitals that
sort of JavaScript was at the books in
there was them totally not intentional
yeah that was completely external
also maybe they're you know they're kind
of like maybe like it you know there's
some connection there I mean you're the
peer scripts
well the points of what you mean by that
and it seems like we have a comeback
yeah closure makes scheme and at least
become doing comeback and the note
breaks back JavaScript from there from
the dead or yeah so so do you see
anymore
old old stuff coming back I don't think
things die I just think they go to sleep
for a bit and so yeah and it's great to
see ideas been rehashed because that
means that someone at some point
hopefully thought about some stuff and
you know some of the ideas were retained
and it were not reinventing the wheel
totally so yeah I hope so and I hope
there's more
