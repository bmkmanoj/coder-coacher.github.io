ambitious talk so I apologize in advance
for speaking fast we have quite a bit of
material to get through and first a few
disclaimers so since I technically still
work for the White House this could be
construed as an official White House
talk but this is not I have to put this
disclaimer in front of pretty much every
talk I give these days which is that
this is a personal talk this talk may
not reflect the views of the President
or the administration but what I can
tell you is that they certainly used to
and these days I'm told that there is a
service called Twitter which is the
source of all official policy so what
are the official day of just just look
it up there anyway see ya the war on air
so I'm gonna argue that air is bad that
air encode is bad and that you know code
for software when it goes wrong does bad
things you know things blow up because
things are incorrect or we get terrible
security mode abilities that cost
billions of dollars so that's that's bad
but bad things happen with when you get
errors in code for people to when you
get errors in code for people I'm going
to buy that I mean of course in your DNA
in your genome you get things like
terrible genetics orders chronic
conditions and things like cancer so air
for coated people as bad as well and I'm
going to argue that we can fix both of
them I'm not going to fix both of them
in 40 minutes but I argue we can fix
both of them and the unifying theme for
how we're going to fix these problems is
approximation we're going to find ways
of approximating solutions so that we
can find ways of fixing code for both
software and for people the main idea is
is on the software side you know if I
will I will make the claim that if we
could solve the halting problem it would
be a lot easier to solve many issues
with software so if we had some magic
function I took a program and mapped it
to whether or not it was going to
terminate or not in some given input
then this would solve a lot of problems
it would be very easy to make software
better of course we can't solve it but
we can approximate the solution to the
halting problem if we're allowed to say
I don't know
for what
program halts or not then suddenly it
actually gives a very easy problem-solve
we can always say I don't know and the
same thing goes for people so we can
take a person or a tumor or something
like that and we can find in their code
the source of the problems that drive
their disease if we can find the
mutations that are causing a particular
disease then maybe we can use that
information to find the perfect
treatment for them this is this is new
kind of medicine we call precision
medicine so in this case we're also in
substance building a function that map's
a person are really their data because
it goes well beyond the genome I will
say and match that into the right
treatment for that but of course we
can't do this either and you know
perfectly we're going to have to come up
with some kind of approximation that
gives us sets of possible treatments or
in many cases a set of scientific
experiments to run that will take us
closer to knowing what that right
treatment is so that's the idea so let's
let's do software first so software is
terrible I think we can all agree on
that and you know if we've reached an
era where we have security water planes
that I only have their own logos but
their own product line so this this is
not good and it cost billions of dollars
and that's bad and you know pretty much
everything is hackable today these days
including apparently even restrooms did
not know that until of course you
actually visit in Japan and realize that
were yeah toilets are in fact quite
hackable as well so it looks like we
really need security everywhere these
days ok so why is this why is thing why
does things gone so wrong for us and
software well there's a number of
reasons I would say you know language
choice has certainly been one of them
attitude is perhaps another but I think
what we can do is we could we can find
some solutions
you know based based on these
observations you know I think what we
need to do at the end of the day is
engineer software and what's interesting
is we have a field of software call we
have a field in acne called software
engineering but argue that we don't
really do much real engineering in the
classical sense within software
engineering so with with apologies to
all the software engineers I'm actually
it's really good I'm leaving computer
science and PL well I'll make these
statements I guess so maybe my periods
wouldn't be so kind next time
so yeah Engineers use prediction I think
that's that's sort of their their core
tools in the tool chest that's mother
yeah one thing I think the defining
attribute of engineering so if you order
do something with physical world you
know things like Newton's laws that will
tell you how physical systems evolve
over time and very precisely over time
so if you know the acceleration and mass
you can go to velocity from velocity you
can go to distance and from this you can
actually sort of plot the course of
something like a projectile sort of
you're a military engineer you can very
accurately predict what's going to
happen if you need to you know you know
fire something in an enemy ship so that
you can be guaranteed it'll actually get
its target you have that level of
resolution when you're an actual
engineer as opposed to a software
engineer where it's very difficult to
predict the behavior of these systems an
example of why I think you know software
engineering doesn't really resemble
engineering in a classical sense is that
we build bridges so I remember when I
was taking software engineering as
undergraduate and in when I was in the
software team in class this cartoon
flashed into my head I thought oh my god
this is what we're doing in it you know
Calvin's asking his dad how do they know
the low limit on bridges and says well
they just drive bigger and bigger trucks
across the bridges until it breaks then
they read they wait they will they way
the last truck and they rebuild the
bridge and I'm like yeah that's what
we're doing that's like all this
test-driven development that's that's
what we do and software we just drive
trucks across our software till it
breaks so yeah you know but if you're an
actual engineer and you want to build a
bridge well of course you actually have
access again to tools like status and
dynamics and tensile strength models and
you can use this to predict the behavior
of a bridge under a continuum of
circumstances you can do that if you're
a civil engineer but it's difficult to
the equivalent if you're building
software so can you predict software
well in a nutshell no can't
see no sound Alan Turing your right off
the side says nope just forget it
it's it's the 11th commandment so we're
kind of stuck there was that that's
that's kind of a bummer okay so the way
I look at it is you know you know you
know in computing physics you have black
holes
you know the boundary hasn't beyond
which you cannot see whereas computer
science what you have are the loops or
the loop holes you know these are the
the horizons beyond which you cannot
reason at least in an automated strictly
automated fashion of course we do reason
about them all the time so what can we
do well we could stop using 1970s
technology to build our programs so we
could switch away from that towards
something at least 90s era and far more
sophisticated or we could go to a
haunting universe altogether maybe it
even better one where we prove our
software correct from the beginning we
could do that too and that would that
would also be a fine way to go about
things and solving this problem
but this this doesn't do a whole lot for
us in terms of the legacy code that's
out there and there's an awful lot of
legacy code that we've got to fix so I
did have one point a large project
called crash dedicated sort of the older
techniques around this or these sorts of
approaches to solving in the software
crisis and that was a lot of fun but I
think there's another way we could go
about this is of course there's several
ways we can do this but the one that I
like to go after is through static
analysis so what I want you to do is
imagine the execution of your program as
the evolution of you know our trajectory
through some state space over time
moving through a sequence of states and
what you want to know is you know when
you're playing this game is can you
approximate it are bound the trajectory
of this of this line is similar that the
sequence of states so that you can you
can know for sure that you're avoiding
bad regions of the state space you know
regions where you're overflowing an
integer or regions where you're
overflowing a buffer where you're doing
something bad or you see some kind of
behavior you want to avoid you want to
know can you approximate it sufficiently
tightly to prove that this program
doesn't enter any of these regions yeah
in this case if this is your
approximation no you haven't done it
yeah it still thinks you might do evil
in some sense it still thinks you might
overflow a buffer so the game is really
to come up with ever tighter
approximations
so that you can provably avoid those
regions again as a fully automated
fashion as you can possibly do so that's
that's the game so how do you play the
static analysis game well there's a
general methodology out there called
abstract interpretation developed by the
kudos and and what I'm going to tell you
about in a very high-level is a specific
instance of that methodology called
abstracting abstract machines
so this first appeared for me and David
Van Horne back ICP 2010 and if you
really want to you know dive deeper into
this what I recommend is the jfp 2012
version of this which includes Haskell
and math side-by-side for every artifact
we build so that if you're trying to
figure out how to do this for the first
time it's it's alright there really is a
tutorial for you but what's the core
idea behind using abstracting abstract
machines to approximate program behavior
in such a way that we can make
predictions about what it will do well
the core idea is to take an interpreter
pass it through some process that's the
abstract abstract machines process get
an approximate are out the other side so
to do this we're going to do we're going
to deal with small step ab small step
interpreters so we need some sort of
injection function that will take a
program and push you into some state
space then we need some step function
that says okay if I'm in this state this
is my next state so we could just drive
execution forward one state at a time so
here's an example of what some of these
rules actually look like in practice so
this is for a sort of a minimal
approximation of the dalvik virtual
machine and you know here's what
execution looks like if you're doing it
completely yeah you inject out of your
state space and just step step step step
step
forever now if you could just observe
all the states you might visit then you
could ask a question like in any of
these these states is there security
vulnerability you know is that a problem
but of course you can't in practice
because this might go on forever there's
no guarantee that when you start running
this thing it's actually going to stop
so what we have to do instead is come up
with an approximation of this execution
we need an abstract interpretation and
what that's going to look like is since
the sort of projection into this finite
abstract state space so that once we
start running through it we're
guaranteed to stop at some point and
we're already somewhat we're just to run
it we're going to run out of states so
to go through and we'll have some sort
of relation that ties together concrete
in abstract state so if we take the
original concrete execution of the
program we're going to make sure that as
we evolve in the abstract we're
maintaining some kind of correspondence
with the concrete execution all the time
so that no matter what path we might
have taken through the concrete
execution it's going to be represented
in the abstract execution somewhere all
right so the I mean the first the first
step here and I've alluded to this
already when you're doing abstraction
you have check machines to diagnose the
problem why is it that you can't just
use the concrete interpreter to explain
it so for sort of fully explore the
state space and well the answer is I
think rarely parents that it might not
stop if you just start taking steps you
might never stop taking steps you have
an infinite state space through which
you might traverse and so there's
reasons why it's potentially unbounded
you know if you look inside one of these
states you're going to have things like
well depending on what kind of language
you're looking at it might be a frame
printer or environment you'll Hayter
have an address store or a heap or a
stack or continuation something like
that and three of these components are
actually unbounded in driving the
unboundedness of the overall state space
so we'll get into that in a second but
these are the three we're going to deal
with we want to come up with some sort
of approximating interpreter for flow
for the language so we've got this
unboundedness in the state space and we
want to get rid of that we want to
crunch it down to some finite space
that's that's the whole idea behind
abstraction abstract machine so the next
step is to abstract so in this case it'd
been for now I really mean finite eyes
we're going to try to take all these
components and give them a finite world
to live in so we'll do this for a
specific machine we're gonna do this for
the CES pain machine and CSK machine is
a very nice general model that I can fit
almost every language of dealt with so
far into first developed by Fleiss and
freedom back in 1987 and the four
components are controlled environments
store and continuation and so we have
four components inside every single
machine state and in the case of a
functional languages the C is going to
be an expression usually or sometimes an
expression context the e in this case
will be a variable that maps to be
environment that map's variables two
addresses so if you want to look up a
variable you first look it up first look
it's a dress and then you look in the
store the s to find its actual value so
it's a two-stage you look at process now
for every variable and then down the
bottom you have a sequence of stack
frames for the continuation there's a
number ways to represent continuations
but this one works just fine for our
purposes so what we need to do now is
sort of focus on the unboundedness in
the state space and somehow crunch it
down so that what's unbounded in this
state space really are sets of addresses
on the stack for the stack and values so
we'll do we'll do values first we'll
track this down so values are basic guys
which case we'll just assume that's
integers and potentially objects or
actually forged objects let's let's say
they're closures and let's look at how
we might crunch down a natural number at
the integers so the integers are pretty
easy to deal with if we want to just
approximate that all the integers we can
do that with the what we call the
abstraction of sines so we go from all
the integers down to power set of
negative zero and positive and now we
can represent not only the energy but
operation is an urges as well you can
take sets of signs and work out what
addition and subtraction and
multiplication all that means for them
all right so now we have an abstraction
that works for four basic values so we
need you next is abstract closures
well closures are lambda terms and for
any given program the set of lime terms
should be fine and then we have
environments so assuming we can abstract
environments then closures become
abstract as well so now we've got an
abstraction for closures a finite
abstraction that that is and next up
values becomes finite eyes or abstract
as well once we've got basic values and
closures handled we just handle values
at the same time alright so that was
values we've now got them living in a
finite space so what's next well we've
still got addresses so we're going to
just declare that addresses are now a
finite set all right so what we do this
is we have some abstraction function
alpha that takes a concrete address and
gives you back an abstract address so
it's just going to choose some
representative and it's abstract set of
addresses and for our purposes you know
the abstract set of just this could even
be the singleton set you could have one
abstract address for absolutely ever
thing it's a terrible way to do it but
it works you know if from the
perspective of sound is there's a whole
there's probably like 20 years of
literature and static analysis that
deals with how you carve up this how you
how you do this mapping because this is
what determines things like poly
variance and contact sensitivity and
other interesting properties the
analysis you get lots of resolution over
the speed and the time of the analysis
the speed is basically placing elseis as
well when you we start playing around
with this knob we're not going to talk
about that today but just let you know
there's a whole lot there's a very
principled way of going about doing this
mapping all right so now we've got
addresses abstract it's the last step
but actually before that if to realize
that as soon as we start sharing
addresses we once we have this finite
set of addresses we need to allow
multiple values to live at the same
address in the store so this the the
range of the store becomes a power set
of values so now when you look up at
individual address you might get
multiple abstract values back and that's
that's fine so last stop is the stack
which is right now a sequence of frames
so what we'll do to handle the stack is
we'll refactor it so that it's actually
more like a linked list and then what
we'll do is we're going to thread the
stack through the store so we're going
to heap-allocated continuations
effectively by saying instead of having
continuations inside continuations each
continuation will actually have a
pointer to the next continuation and
what that means in the context of the
larger state space is that we also have
to have continuations living at
addresses too so when you allocate a
continuation you might have to allocate
a continuation for the rest with the
continuation beneath it and when you
look up an address the store you might
get multiple continuations back yeah so
when it comes time to return somewhere
maybe return to multiple places in your
abstract interpreter that's ok as long
as we're building an approximation of
what the real interpreter would do all
right so we've got addresses that
abstract that takes care of
continuations and now everything in our
state space has been abstract 'add so we
actually have finite eyes this entire
state space so we have an abstracted
abstract machine at this point and we
can just run it we can see where it goes
and what it's going to do is build an
over approximating model
of what our original programs might have
done and of course there's there's
Mannix to show you that this actually
does work or you can actually do this so
here's the concrete cymatics for that
dalvik machine and after pushing it
through abstracting answering machines
you end up with something that looks
like this so I'm not going to go into
detail on this but you can you can see
even visually sometimes that there's a
very tight correspondence between the
original interpreter and the abstract
one so you don't know a lot more about
this than I have talked online
we're actually live code and abstract
interpreter for a relatively simple
language so if you go here there's a
corresponding blog post with all the
code available as well so if you want to
know this edit this in much more detail
go here watch this video and you'll be
stepped all the way through the process
of building a concrete interpreter and
then building its corresponding abstract
interpreter as well all through this
process of abstracting abstract machines
so this question Kent can we can we win
the game of the static analysis game
well you know in some sense
it'll never really be one it's it's oh
it's a game it's going to go on forever
which is good for people in static
analysis but it turns out I think when
we focus our efforts on meaningful
problems we can actually start to make a
real difference in practice for programs
that people care about so one of the
things I did is I had a project called a
pact or DARPA where what we were trying
to do was solve it really really
anticipate a really terrible idea that's
it's kind of inevitable so what the
military decided they wanted to do was I
wanted to give Android phones to
everybody and then have an app store
where anybody could submit well maybe
not anybody but lots contractors could
submit apps photos could download apps
and these would be used on the
battlefield with no problem whatsoever
so that that was the idea and they
realized at least that this was a bad
idea and that there need to be some kind
of measures in place for protecting this
apps torrance and in so doing protecting
the soldiers as well so you know well
what are they worried about well maybe
there's a malicious application on there
that's actually leaking your device back
to some attacker somewhere so that you
know they know exactly where you want
those also I mean I think we can all
imagine lots of really bad things that
could happen if you open up an app store
like this so the idea was was to
perforate pack was well let's have an
auditor
have somebody stand in the middle and do
really thorough static analysis to see
as programs come in if they're good and
don't have malicious behavior that
they're approved and that soldiers are
allowed to use them and if they're bad
and they try to get in then we find that
and we crush them and we go after the
person that tried to submit it that's
that's the whole idea behind the API
program was to build these static
analyzers that would be used to audit
programs coming into the military app
storm so the structure of the program
was every six months starting at month
six way to go begins red teams that were
basically simulating submission to the
App Store some of which were malicious
some of which weren't and we had to
figure out which was which so how did we
do well six months in the program turns
out not so well we got literally
everything wrong like it was just like
like catastrophic we bad that's when I
head around my program manager that
sometimes there are discrepancies
between the vision you include in your
research proposal and the deliverable
that you get at the end of the day and
it was fortunately very understanding
about this but only for like the first
six months was like you know you
actually have to solve this problem so
the amazing thing is over the course of
four years we actually needed to do
better and better and better in terms of
our accuracy in the engagements and in
the process actually did an awful lot of
really good research and static analysis
so there's a number of papers out there
that fell out of this project covering
everything from like how to go from
finding state to pushdown systems to
analyzing parallel programs and lesson
programs in parallel to informational
analysis that we ended needing to
include in order to reasonably start to
figure out what was malicious and what
was not now it wasn't a totally
automated process by the end there was a
human loop that was able to use the
results the analysis to make the
determination but in many cases we got
very very good at highlighting regions
where if there were malicious behavior
this is probably where it would be so
this was this isn't very a really really
fun project we've got a sequel to this
now we're actually what we're doing
instead is looking for complexity
attacks and things like space attack so
this can be like an algorithm at you
know if you've got some input to the
program it takes really wrong it's very
small but takes a long time to run
that's an interesting kind of
to look for or the small input that uses
a larger large amount of memory or side
channels all three of these are in scope
now for the sort of follow-on project to
AIPAC and we're actually are going to
see sort of a similar results were there
we started off terrible and we're about
a year and a half in and starting to do
better and better now even though I
think that yeah the sort of class of
enemies we're looking for is actually
quite challenging but we are able to
from again for programs that people
actually care about programs that people
write we're getting reasonably good at
doing automated reasoning for these
things all right
so that's that's the halting problem
what about people you know how do we use
approximation to help people well
there's there's a new kind of medicine
sort of putting it so actually not
really a new kind of medicine it's
really a new way of doing medicine it's
all about being data-driven and
oftentimes genome guided so the genome
has got people really excited about this
new kind of medicine it because because
it happen to be enlarged and piece of
data that is actually pretty informative
when it comes to your health
particularly for certain classes of
diseases can be extremely informative
for your health I would say doesn't have
to be genome guided I think if using
large if using a patient's data to
optimize their health I would say you're
doing precision medicine at that point
because it's really all about delivering
the right drug to the right patient at
the right time that is the essence of
precision medicine so I want to talk
about curing cancer but what I really
want to do is is clarify that cancer is
not one specific disease cancer is
actually many diseases put together in
fact cancer is many rare diseases if you
take cancer to the limit it's likely the
case the same cancers never occurred
twice if you look at the genetic
footprint of cancer even within the same
patients as well as I'll explain just a
moment you get very different cancers
from the same originating source and
I'll explain why that is and so that
that's why this sort of like you know
very information driven approach to
curing cancer I think is absolutely
critical so what I really want to talk
about is how to cure rare diseases in
fact rare genetic diseases because I
think it is a consequence being able to
cure rare diseases quickly in fact every
quickly is that we will have table to
cure cancer as well if we really want to
be able to cure cancer there's really no
way of getting there almost certainly
without being able to cure where
diseases - so we're curing rare diseases
sort of like the sort of base state the
base case for curing cancer but first I
recognize that this is not a room for
biologists so let me give you some a
brief background in biology so in bio
101 you learn that DNA is char star
you've got four letters a T C and G and
these are represented by by nucleotides
and are bound together and the double
helix we call DNA so sort of the
fundamental dogma of biology is that
you've got DNA which has a bunch of
genes in it and these genes are first
transcribed into RNA
very similar alternate alphabet and then
RNA is actually divided up into a
triplet called codons ultimately at the
end of the day and each triplet is
converted into an amino acid through
translation so you get for each gene for
the current understanding of gene that
is which is you know expanding I would
say right now you end up with a sequence
of amino acids this sequence of amino
acids then you undergoes a folding
process and that's because amino acids
have these side chains that are some are
electric positives I'm electronegative
some are hydrophobic so I'm hydrophilic
some are neither and it's these
interactions between the side chains
that ultimately give these the final 3d
conformation to the protein there's
actually a lot of us that happens after
that including a process called post
translational modification there's about
like 70 different things you can do to
protein after it's been produced that
modify it in some way but then you
actually have these agents that now
float around inside your cells and do
things they either serve structure
sometimes they have enzymatic functions
but they're doing something or they're
sort of like the principal agents within
your cells that's how you get proteins
so and that's what your DNA is encoding
by and large your dean is encoding RNA
and much of your RNA is encoding
proteins there's actually a lot of
there's a lot of RNAs now that never
translate to proteins and they do lots
of interesting things too but we're
we're not going to talk about that right
now by and large if you care about human
disease much of it is really focused
within the proteins and we're learning
more and more about what the other
regions are doing but yeah for our
purposes that you know going after the
proteins is where the the money really
is so many proteins are enzymes
enzymes are really their functions they
catalyze the transformation of one thing
into another thing so sometimes you get
two things coming together to form
another thing or sometimes you take one
thing you split it apart yeah so that's
what that's what many of the the
proteins are actually doing within your
body which means that the genome has
syntax and in fact it has a semantics
and beyond that it has an instruction
set to yeah so to give you an
understanding of how mutations drive
disease let's actually take a look at
this instruction set
so here's here a little micro gene and
if we split it up into codons we've got
ATG GCC and TGA so ATG is the codon that
means begin construction of this protein
and and sort of methionine
so you always insert a methionine the
beginning of the protein the next codon
GCC and we know what GCC does no no one
yeah it's compiled of C program it's
amazing that it fits inside the human
genome but ya know actually it's just
inserted Melanie so all these are just
saying insert some amino acid and the
last one TGA just means stop meaning
you've hit the end of this protein eject
and fold so if you put these three
things together this really means this
big in constrictions protein and sort of
methionine a certain alanine done that's
that's the code
yeah and it's this one heroes that
biologists are just terrible at
designing language syntax so what about
mutations
well mutations are driving a lot of
disease so if we mutate this sequence
like what do we put in a here well now
we've changed the meaning of this
program so instead of this program
instead of inserting an alanine what you
actually have is the insertion of an
aspartic acid which may or may not
actually change the function of protein
at all some mutations in fact many
mutations are benign they really don't
do anything at least the ones that we
find in the wild that's because there's
this you know selective process that
gets rid of bad mutations pretty fast
but some destroy function some will
actually increase function in some way
some will change function and it's it's
really you know depending on what
happens will tell me whether or not you
end up with some sort of consequence
your health but rare disease is by and
large or monogenic in nature they're
driven by a single mutation somewhere in
the genome that causes the disease to
happen and for example if we have and I
think it's easy to explain this with the
simplest model organism all which is the
stick figure and I like model organisms
as as our like stick figures as model
organism because they only have I think
six genes which is which is much less
complicated than humans which has around
20,000 so if you have if you have your
little stick figure and he somehow has a
deficit in gene C then this is going to
cause some change to his phenotype and
so there's something that occurs as a
result of the loss of C now what this
means that we're looking for in terms of
treatment is a way to - we're looking
for some sort of treatment I'll actually
compensate for the loss of C and if we
find that then hopefully what we've done
is reverse the course of that of that
change for this particular patient
cancer on the other hand is multigenic
it's not just one gene going haywire
it's several at the same time often
starts with just one mutation within
kescott cascades into many more usually
one of the first mutation that will
happen in cancer is a loss of a tumor
suppressor once you lose your tumor
suppressors now it's easier for many
more mutations to pile on top of that
and some of those will eventually be
growth genes that will increase growth
rates and so that's that's how cancer
the sort of this cascading process so
you to go for cancer have to find like
multiple treatments for different genes
all at the same time and then because
cancer is evolving you have to keep
finding new ones constantly cancer is
just hard because again tumors are
evolving they're undergoing a selective
process so when you're fighting cancer
you're fighting evolution itself inside
your own body it is it is tough yeah so
if you start off with you know without
with a single cancerous cell it's going
to multiply over time and at some point
you're going to apply a treatment and
the treatment will work for some of the
cells but some of the cells will
actually have just by luck in many cases
a mutation that gives them resistance to
whatever that treatment was so you can
weigh about large fractions of the cells
of a particular treatment but some
survive sometimes undetectably many but
sometimes you can see a residual and
then these things keep dividing but
they're carrying with them the genetic
memory of how to resist that drug so as
they divide if you apply the same
treatment doesn't work it's resistant
now so that's that's why cancer is so
tricky one of many reasons I should say
so curing cancer is kind of like hearing
many monogenic diseases on the fly
because every time you get a new
mutation you've got to find a new a new
treatment a new way of addressing the
gene now driving or the mutation now
driving that particular cancer so that's
that's hard so hopefully I've convinced
you that monogenic diseases sort of the
base case we're going after cancer so
can we cure monogenic disease I think we
can and I think we need an algorithm for
doing is a very systematic process that
takes his input a patient and their gene
defect and at the end of the day gives
us out some sort of medication we can
give them or maybe a set of experiments
we want to get us closer to that so I'm
not going to step you through the entire
algorithm but I've put a lot of thought
on this over the past several years and
I've developed one I've actually been
applying in practice to real patients
and this is this is what it looks like
in this flowchart form but again it's
patient data going in often genomic data
it is it's it's moving through a process
whereby we to figure out some drugs it's
going to counteract the effect of that
mutation that's the whole idea behind
this algorithm right here and it always
ends in something like federal trials
although we're finding ways to get
around that - and gets a treatment to a
patient the question is will it work and
the amazing thing is I've had a
ridiculous sequence of opportunities to
able to answer this question I'll tell
you it does but you know it what I want
to do now is tell you a very personal
story but why even do this you know man
I'm a PL researcher by training why am i
doing medicine at all out well this is
my son Bertrand so I'll tell you his
story very quickly and this is the story
of what happens when you're told that
your child's actually the very first
case ever discovered of an ultra rare
genetic disorder
so when Bertrand was born you know we
didn't know why he had development delay
why he got seizures why he had a
movement disorder and why for some
reason he just couldn't cry tears we
didn't know why any of that was
happening and that would've been the
case for pretty much forever it had not
been for after about 48 months a team of
scientists at Duke stepping up and
saying you know we will do the
sequencing that it will take to find the
source of your son's disease so I've
been trying to do this for a couple
years at that point because I really
believed it was a genomic disorder so we
actually did sequence
my son's genome but we also sequence
mine and my wife's looking for any
potential de novo mutations as well and
what they found what they told us this
is five years ago almost of the day was
that he'd inherited two mutations in a
gene called ng ly-one or angle i1 that
would knocked out the function of this
gene so for me he got a premature stop
that basically put a stop instruction
right in the middle of this gene that
said you know jekt after your halfway
done for my wife he got a deletion of a
single base pair that garble all the
instructions that came after after that
point and then they said you know he's
the first and the only patient we have
ever seen with this disease he's in many
ways an N of one there was no a there's
no there's no evidence allure of this
gene ever even causing human disease
before let alone in existence of another
patient so the questions well how do you
know that this is really the cause of
this disease and this isn't one often
the first step in precision or genomic
medicine how do you know that you found
the right mutation to treat it in the
first place because there's lots of them
well if you're computer scientists you
know you might want to lean on something
like molecular dynamics where you take
the protein you take the gene you look
at the consequence of the mutation by
first year you fold it figure out what
it looks like and then maybe you do some
sort of statistical simulation to figure
out how it's changed in some way to
maybe your immigrate you increase
function decrease function change
function but it turns out you you really
can't use something like molecular
dynamics for this problem cuz it just
doesn't scale it is an incredibly
computationally intensive problem so we
need to work around and we got lucky and
that we're building the work around
thanks to this guy so Obama about two
years before he left office announced to
launch the precision medicine initiative
what this is doing is it's collecting a
million of the genomes and health
records of a million Americans
completing them together in a single
database so that we can actually use it
sort of like a rosetta stone for the
human genome and by this I mean if you
want to know what a mutation is doing in
terms of human health you can look into
this database and say well what does it
do on average to other people what is it
really doing to people well when you
find something like this so we're
building a way of sort of jumping
straight to the end and I look at it to
a genetic telescope so that we are
starting to sift apart what mutations
mean into their consequences for human
health so some of the mutations will
give you a predisposition to cancer some
may protect you from cancer some will
make your predisposition for artsy's
some protect you from heart
and and you know over the course of the
excuse we're going to learn about all of
these and what they do
alright but what about my son's mutation
database doesn't exist now and it didn't
exist then how do we know that that was
really the cause of his disease well to
figure this out I wrote a blog post and
III did some calculations to show that
you based on the frequency of pathogenic
alleles there was probably somewhere on
the order 500 patients out there in the
world that had this they just didn't
know what they had and I wanted to find
them so this this blog post was designed
to do two things it had to go viral and
it had to rank highly in Google search
results so it's just basic SEO and this
is the blog post that I wrote and the
there's actually five dozen words
beneath this but the picture of Liam
Neeson that's to make it go viral
because the Internet's kind of sadly
predictable you know it's amazing how
well this actually worked
I'm appreciate I got to put a cat
picture there too and but it would work
just as well but the 5,000 words below
that was for search engine optimization
and crazy things that actually worked it
did go viral seen by millions of people
in a very short amount of time it did
rank highly in Google search results for
all the terms that a patient or parent
of the patient might actually type in if
they were trying to find somebody with
the same thing and so almost overnight
literally within weeks of discovering
this disease we went from being the only
patient in the world to having patients
popping up all over the world you know
in literally two weeks later we have
patients in Turkey and so what this did
for us is it sort of washed away this
dark night of uncertainty and replaced
it with a sunlight of science and
community and we've been a very good
community ever since I think having this
community to draw on to actually go
after disease has been a very powerful
thing for us I won't go into details
about what happened when terms of that
if you want there's an article in New
Yorker about what this process was like
and you can read that some other times
you're interested in fact turns out
there's patients in Barcelona so last
night I was having dinner with with one
of these patients which is just kind of
an amazing experience big gala you
almost anywhere in the world now and I
end up meeting one of these patients
because there's 57 of them that I've
discovered in the past five years
through that blog post about about
finding a treatment well it turns out is
since we understood the route molecular
cause of this disease I could reason
about what might be going you know
ultimately wrong and potentially ways to
fix it so the enzyme he's missing
it's called n glycan ace and end like
today's is responsible for dig like
oscillating this fall to glycoproteins
after they've been respiratory to form
the implication to the end of the sinus
all so you know there are sentences I
never expected to have to say as a
parent and I guarantee you that was one
of them and what this means at the end
of the day is that he is missing a
critical recycling enzyme so there's a
kind of waste depicted here that he
can't recycle and is that way started to
pile up in a very particular way it
actually starts to sequester but certain
metabolites there's certain things that
go deficient in him or I hypothesize
would go deficient in him as a
consequence of this missing enzyme so
this little blue square in particular is
the thing I thought he was deficient in
it's a rare monosaccharide called an
acid of glucosamine you wouldn't
ordinarily eat it unless you eat the
shells and shellfish but it's not
something that's totally necessarily
ridiculous to put inside a human body
even so once I realize this what I what
I did is I found out you could buy it on
Amazon so I did I took a bottle of it
myself and didn't die because in my
household I am the FDA and so I remind
folks that I'm not literally FDA and
then after a serious hospitalization
when I sort of weighed the ethics of
giving it or not giving it to him I
realized that I can never live with
myself if I hadn't tried this if I
didn't know if it worked for him so I
gave it to him and about three days
after he was on it for the first time in
his life or the life of any patient for
that matter he started crying tears so
that was unexpected and over the course
of a few months his nighttime seizures
also subsided and almost disappeared
entirely so that that was I would say
one small tear for Bertrand but it
really became an ocean of science for
the disorder as a whole and I did what
any parent would do when they saw their
child cry for the first time I took his
tear I packed it under ice and I shipped
to a lab in California for analysis and
I literally did that and you know when I
give this talk to biologists they say
well that's great madam it's wonderful
this works in humans but doesn't work in
flies and because biologists are very
weird and they just want to know these
things so we built a fly model the
disease and sure enough it actually
works there too so flies have about a
seventeen percent survival rate with
this disease but if you give them this
compound they go up to about 8090
percent survival so works of people
works and flies that's pretty good
actually
and in general you know I think we could
we could automate this process of
discovering deficits by realizing that
you can represent reactions as turn
rates as well other people made this
realization you can represent these
reactions these enzymatic reactions is
essentially writing systems and is even
programming language where you can
represent write these things down to so
you can use a language like Kappa to
simulate and find these deficiencies for
others is just like I did for angle i1
this point I went really from computer
science into biology medicine to do what
we call traditional or rational drug
development I got a grant to actually do
drug development this disease and built
a worm model disorder a planarian
remodeled particular implant or a great
because if you cut them in half you
actually get two planaria it's like two
for the price of one plus some scissors
and the great part about giving them
about the spring buy one is that if you
give them NY one and you cut them in
half what you get is a worm that's been
cut in half so it disrupts their
regenerative capacity so this gave us
the basis for it was doing called a
screen a genetic screen that looks for a
modifier that actually can determine
whether or not there's some other gene
that gives you an advantage in this
disease so we did we start knocking out
other genes in addition to angle i1 to
see if any of them could restore the
regenerative phenotype and one of them
did so we found essentially a second
gene so what this means it's been it
would be missing two genes than one so
there's a second gene you want to get
rid of if you also miss NY one which
means we're looking for an inhibitor for
that second gene and to find that
inhibitor I went back towards computer
science because what we did is we
started with a bacterial model of that
of that of that second gene we tweaked
to look like the human version through a
process called homology modeling and we
look for small molecules that were
inverse and shape and charge to the
catalytic domain on this target we
looked for for about two and a thousand
molecules all together 70 compounds
actually showed up in the screen 14 of
them were fda-approved
one actually worked in the lab but we
check to see if the prediction was
correct because again this is an
approximative process and that one is
prevacid so you can buy previs it at
Costco and obviously we did and he's
been on it now for about four months and
there's already substantial benefits for
him in terms of I think
regaining many of the developmental
aspects of his disease I mean I've seen
him doing things now but I haven't seen
him do in nine years well since he was a
one-year-old
in fact I got a publication on this just
a few weeks ago and when the crazy part
is is you know whatever else they
publish but I think for the rest of my
life I think this will always be my
favorite publication about finding a
treatment for my son's disease so I love
poeple I love PLD I love all that but
this for me is where it's at now the
question is will it work again and will
it scale up and I got again a sequence
of extraordinary opportunities to really
test this out in practice so a few years
ago the Harvard med school asked if I
would join the Faculty of course I said
yes then Obama said come to the White
House and help engage in the setting up
the precision medicine initiative and I
said yes to that too and then about a
year ago I now is jointly with with the
president and experiment essentially to
see if precision medicine would really
work in practice and the experiment was
can we go after five diseases in 12
months
repeating essentially that process that
I've done for my son but for these other
rare diseases and the crazy thing is it
worked over the past 12 months we
actually found treatments for five
diseases I won't go into the details of
that but what in order to do it I
essentially put together a processor for
that algorithm stitching together a
substrate from a number of different
entities that when able me to actually
execute pass through it in a fairly
efficient away so these are the five
entities that joint that initial
substrate and I was actually you know I
found was braid that actually go to him
right before he left off so this is
three days before he left office
actually got to go back to to meet with
him and say you know look we actually
succeeded on on those goals so precision
medicine I think is definitely going to
be real and really enabled as a
consequence of this initiative that
you've set up so it's it's it's been fun
working at the one at the was it was fun
working at the White House it's been
interesting lately I will say that much
but as it was I think the privilege of
my life to be able work for him to
actually execute this project on behalf
of patients everywhere and in terms of
my future I'm actually kind of leaving
PL this is my last lecture as a computer
scientists so I'm leaving my professor a
professorship in computer science on
July 1st and picking up a professorship
in medicine at UAB
where I'll actually be a professor in
internal medicine which is really
strange and director of the hue call
precision medicine Institute so I'm
building this thing from scratch hiring
a faculty and
executing this vision of bring this
algorithm to patients everywhere so I
think in conclusion yeah the war on air
is tough but through mechanisms like
approximation I honestly believe it is
ultimately winnable so thank you
so are we we have any time for questions
one question yeah we could do one
question anybody okay so my question is
how do you see the impact of projects
like the 1000 genome project in UK for
example a regarding this is your
medicine so that's a great question so
in the UK there is a like the UK biobank
I think that's what your furring to you
whether I think 250,000 individuals that
have volunteered biospecimens and their
health records it's been interesting is
that that's it's it's definitely cited
as a forerunner of the precision
medicine initiative where we're
collecting a million Americans it hasn't
yield as as much as we'd hoped yet in
part because apparently the the they
have the electronic health record format
for the UK is not entirely unified so
it's been very difficult to pull results
from across the entire system they're
there they're been son already so for
example a number of genes and responsive
for influencing height have been pulled
out of the UK biobank in terms of
finding genes that directly you know
identify human diseases not as much as
we'd hoped so far and some of the
drawbacks of the UK biobank are being
you know addressed in both the precision
medicine issue and another program in
the u.s. called the million veterans
program so that hopefully will have a
more attractive way of getting these
answers from that data so that's that's
a great question yep
dude last one okay so whenever I hear
talks about how our bodies work I'm
astonished through it all seems like
such a Heath Robinson arrangement of
things that inhibit this and it seems
astonishingly complicated and whenever
people talk about cancer who said that
many diseases just seems unreasonably
complicated the amazing thing about what
you're describing is that you've had
some success but whereas it what else
seems to make tiny incremental progress
do you think that will scale did you
think this was really going to work on
the big scale or do you think you've you
kind of something that will sort of run
into the sand of the complexity of the
way of our bodies amazingly work at all
that's a great question and and so I
think there are large reasons with the
genome for which this will scale where
if the thing we need to address is a
particular kind of gene so I'll give you
an example there's a large number of
genes called ion channels these are
basic little circuits in the membranes
of cells that let ions pass in one
direction or another if the defect
driving your disease is one of these I
guarantee we can do something for you
today we know I had these things left
and right with with with drugs we can
make them go up we can make them go down
so if you've got a genetic epilepsy or
heart condition or a pain disorder
driven by one of these channels for a
reasonably low cost we can find a drug
that will work for you if however you
would the the gene driving or diseases
and some sort of structural gene like
dystrophic and must get list your feed
now it gets a bit trickier because now
what we're having to do is sort of tweak
the structure back into its it's correct
form that's harder to do with drugs it's
not impossible and we know broader
approaches into something like that so
we are building an Arsenal for
medicating the genome as we speak
we're in rare diseases kind of paving
the way because your patients very
motivated to forget the technique that
works for their gene but those that
Arsenal's be purposeful as we move on to
cancer and so for every you know we
can't do it for every gene right now but
what we can do for any given gene say
even if there's no medication available
right now this is the set of experiments
I would run if I wanted to know the
answer or get closer to it so sometimes
you can't use it so what I say in the
context of precision medicine sometimes
science is the medicine the conduct of
doing science becomes the kind of
medication that you do and hopefully we
can do it fast enough to save your life
but that won't always be the case which
is why we need more science funding in
general
okay let's get Matt a big knot of course
