with another video and in this video I'm
going to be showing you how to correctly
use throttle stop to reduce lag and
jitters when gaming now please do know
that this tutorial is focused mainly for
laptops because this is where CPU
throttling usually takes place the most
so let's start with the basics what is
CPU throttling now CPU throttling is
simply the manufacturer the laptop
manufactures way of reducing the CPU
clock speed or the processing speed to
obviously to reduce the temperature of
the CPU and to to cool things down and
obviously to save energy which is why we
have this CPU throttling mainly in your
laptops not as a way to protect the
computer from damage now usually when
when cpu throttling occurs is when you
pass over a certain temperature mostly
60 degrees and the the BIOS will thaw
the processor to just slow down so it
can cool down now what's wrong stop does
is it simply overrides this BIOS
mechanic and allows you to obviously
continue using the processor over that
temperature now obviously this sets some
very important points here is that
obviously this will heat your process up
more than it's supposed to more than the
manufacturer wanted it to and if the
good side is then reduce all lag that
you have in games caused by the
processor and the reason you can tell is
the process is that in a game you will
be having higher high a high frame rate
and you will be getting jitters now
these jitters are not caused by the GPU
because the GPU may be running the game
perfectly but the processor may be
struggling as it slows down as it slowed
down by the buyers so what throttle stop
is is a simple program that overrides
this now CPU throttling is a very very
very broad topic and it's usually in
processes from i-5 and over
have the turbo feature the inter turbo
feature I'm not sure about AMD button it
will have the turbo feature which allows
the processor to boost when needed but
the only thing with this boosting is
that it it obviously takes the call and
processor to a higher temperature so
that obviously triggers throttle stop
which basically means you're back to
square one now when you're putting total
stop you will have these four tabs I
like keeping everything in one tab in my
performance tab so clock modulation is
how high you want your processor to
clock so this is like overclocking
underclocking so you can see mine is
grayed out that means my processor does
not allow this feature chips are crock
mod is to set that clock so it stays
there constantly now this usually is the
main cause of melting your laptop
because you give it 100 is gonna run at
100 whether or not you're browsing or
not or you're playing games so I don't
recommend turning these to all setting
multiplier as for that I also don't
recommend it but what I do recommend is
now this is where your power will be
going I mean your multiply is going to
the processor now my process the Intel
Core i5 and it boosts from 1.7 G gets to
2.7 it's a pretty pretty powerful
processor it has a quad core with 66
calls actually for logical processes so
as you can see it's everything is being
displayed here and their temperatures
are the air temperatures now and their
maximum temperatures that they've
reached when gaming you don't want to
cross over 70 degrees that's always the
rule and your GPU should be not over 60
degrees so back to how to to actually
reduce the lag so I don't recommend
clicking this all I recommend is just
going down and till the disable turbo is
ungraded and you can check it make sure
you check disable turbo now for for this
leave this check is very important and
and yeah that's pretty much all you have
to do to minimize the cpu throttling and
allow your from you to run as a at a
constant obviously frequency so please
do note that this does not make a
difference is these I just tabs that you
can customize for yourself you can
actually ensure you can just change the
names here so these are not actual
profiles that you can click games going
to run better no one tab you customize
with however you want it to please do
know this program is a very powerful
program and it can damage your system if
you don't know what you're doing
so all I told you never click on clock
modulation never click on chipset clock
mod never click on set multiply unless
you want it to run at that constant
speed it's almost the same as clock
modulation the cycles at which you want
the processor to run at it's going to
tell you the power being consumed and so
yeah so you just have to set your
multiplayer lower your multiplier all
the way to the point where it accepts
disable turbo click that and leave these
all as there and turn it on here as you
can see mine is on and so it's saying
turn it off and just save that profile
and you're good to go whenever you're
gaming just open this up and you're good
to go
now if this did help please leave like
if you it didn't help please let me know
why in if you have any problems please
comment them below or hit them up on any
of my social networks or on my blog
which would be linked down the
description I will link this that's all
stock down in the description so you can
download it and yeah so have fun gaming
and please follow what I've told you or
you will end up damaging existence
anyway peace guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
