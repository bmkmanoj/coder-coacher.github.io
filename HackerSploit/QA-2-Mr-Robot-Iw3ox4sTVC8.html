with another video and welcome to this
Q&amp;amp;A where you guys ask me your questions
and I answer them now before he get
started I know what you guys are
thinking I haven't uploaded a video in a
week and the truth is I I did that for a
very good reason and that's because I
took a step backwards and I just wanted
to look at how I can improve the channel
because over the last few months the
channel has grown a lot we're at 22,000
subscribers that was you know we have
smashed the goal for the year so I'm
really really excited and excited to
make better content and to give you guys
a much higher quality of content so
that's what I was planning and I've got
a lot of exciting stuff lined up for the
month so videos will be coming regularly
now especially and that's the point I
was trying to make videos are coming in
every day there's gonna be a video every
day without fail and the videos are
going to be much much higher quality and
again focused more on the delivery and
the the quality of the of the
presentation and the content in the
videos now apart from that as I said of
what I'm working on a lot of things to
make this channel a lot better and one
of them is the website of updated the
website so the website is now fully
fledged news website you can get the
latest hacking news as as it happens in
terms of resources are packed it up with
resources you can check for e-books any
downloads password lists guides all the
all Matt of stuff and they'll it'll keep
on being updated alright in addition to
that you can ask me questions on the
websites site so you can just post your
question and I'll be answering them in
the Q&amp;amp;A video which is awesome so that
way we can have some good interaction
apart from that I'm going to be
releasing the hack exploit mobile app
that will give you the latest hockey
news on the go you can access my video
tutorials in addition to that you can
contact me directly and I'll be working
to add a live chat system where you can
chat with other users also using the
application so I'm really really excited
for that and I've just been working all
of these things together
so that we can all so that we can all
make this a better channel in all
possible ways and the last announcement
before we get started with the Q&amp;amp;A is
that I have launched the crypto sploit
website or crypto spite YouTube channel
where I'll be uploading videos of all
videos you know regarding crypto
currencies and the blockchain and how it
works we'll also be making videos about
how to develop applications that run on
the blockchain something really really
promising so yeah that's what we're
going to be working and I just wanted to
give you guys an update on what I'm
doing and hopefully these Q&amp;amp;A videos can
be a good place for us to interact on a
more hands-on Excel alright so let's get
started with the Q&amp;amp;A not a lot of you
guys posted questions but we have a few
so thank you to those who did post
questions and they're very very good
questions so let's get started with the
first question that was asked all right
and the first question that was asked is
port forwarding all right so Quantum
asks let me just open it up right here
Quantum asks can I explain
can you explain port forwarding alright
so I'm obviously thinking that you want
me to explain it really really simply
and I'm gonna do that right now
when it's so port forwarding is is when
you for the network port all right so
let's say you for the port on your
network - from your network you you
basically for the network port from your
network to another alright so this
basically allows you to it allows you to
it gives you the ability to connect from
from an external user or from an
external IP they give the functionality
of another user with an external IP to
reach the port that you have given which
is why they call it port forwarding to
connect to a private IP address all
right so that means inside a local area
network so put simply you're simply
forwarding a port that is on your local
network and then once you've performed
the port forwarding it allows an
external IP to connect to your private
IP through
that port that you afforded right so
it's really very simple and I can make a
video about this so that you understand
it in depth because that is a very very
simple explanation but hopefully you got
are you got an answer in what I've just
given you all right so that's a very
very good question and you know what
I'll make a video on that because I
think it is something very very
important that is related to networking
and is also important to understand how
that works alright so the next question
is asked by Mike and the question is let
me just open it up it's regarding
Metasploit of all three all right so can
you make a video on Metasploit of all
three on Linux and the difference
between two and three yes I am working
on that Mike actually created my own
version of the Metasploit about three
using Windows Server 2012 because the
previous version the Windows Server 2008
had a lot of bugs especially when
building it and that's probably why you
guys are asking me to make a video on
how to install it and the truth is it's
a really really tricky thing installing
it Metasploit about three because you
have to install a lot of dependencies
and these software versions have to be
the exact ones used in the build but
overall I'll be making a video a
complete video series where I'll be
showing you how to install it and how to
get it running on your computer so I'll
give you my version which i think is
much better and has a lot of fixes and
is running the latest version of Windows
Server 2012 with the latest updates and
the vulnerability is already there
we have WordPress all of that great
stuff so yes I will be making a video on
three and to answer your question yes I
will be explaining the difference
between two and three well one of the
differences I can explain right now is
one is running Linux Metasploit able to
was running Linux and metric Metasploit
all three is running Windows Server so
hopefully I answered your question
there but don't worry about video on
that all right now let's look at our
last question only got three questions
this week so the last question is to do
with mr. robot fantastic all right let's
see what mesh says all right so messes
hi just wondering if you watch the live
TV show if you watch the TV show mr.
robot and if so what are you
sonot well mesh yes I do I have watched
the first and second season I haven't
caught up with the third season yet I've
just had a lot to do really but I will
catch up with it hopefully in the next
few days and hopefully there's not a lot
of the season released I can catch up
with the first few episodes and get a
clearer picture of what's happening
happening to Elliott alright so your
question is what are my thoughts on it
well I'm guessing you're asking this in
terms of its or its authenticity and
real realism when it comes to hacking
and I'm just gonna be honest mr. robot
is fantastic the first time I watched it
I obviously was a bit judgmental because
Hollywood tends to make hacking look
somewhat like a superpower and something
that really really is very very simple
but in truth mr. robot has made it
it is completely accurate all the tools
that they use the methodology the terms
the definitions that they give are just
up to up to scratch the only thing that
they do exaggerate and it's obviously
for dramatic and because it is a you
know it is a TV show and they have to
maintain some a bit of drama dramatic
effect is that the the hacking process
is sped up and it is just exaggerated in
that way in the sense that they just
make everything look a bit accelerated
whereas you know performing a network
scan might not happen in five seconds
and you get the idea and for those of
you experienced you basically enjoy it
because you you can see that the
techniques are real and the steps that
Elliott takes when performing a hack are
all accurate and they do represent real
life techniques alright so yes my
thoughts on it are it is fantastic and
it's probably one of the best directed
produced and acted on TV shows related
to cybersecurity and hacking that I've
watched and I think those of you have
watched it can agree so yeah those are
all the questions that have been asked
this week and that wraps up Q&amp;amp;A to this
is the second series the second video in
the Q&amp;amp;A series so yeah thank you so much
