with another video so a lot of you guys
have been asking me how you can
basically root your Android device and
the fact that you have different Android
devices and basically it's getting a bit
complicated for you guys well I actually
thought about it and I actually have
rooted a lot of devices and I thought
let me try and help you guys out so
basically it first of all it depends on
the device that you're current you
currently have for example if you have a
snap for example if you have a Samsung
device it's relatively easier if you
have other types of devices it also the
possibility it could be easier but let's
get started so if you have a Samsung
device CF autoroute if you don't don't
know it let me basically explain see a
photo root is basically a method of
routing that involves using the Odin
flasher the odeon flash a tool that
allows you to root your android device
as simply as just clicking a button now
this again will only root your device it
will not give you the ability to install
a custom recovery but we'll get to that
later
so basically this is the site right here
the link will be in the description
section don't worry about that this is
made by chain fire the guys that chain
fire awesome stuff so you can just read
through all of this and it will give you
a list of devices that you can currently
route with the auto route utility so
basically you have your device's model
names your both the platforms you tell
the Android version that is currently
then it currently works on and has the
download link so you can basically
scroll down layer and find your device
again it's not going to be all devices
but most of the devices that are
currently in the market will be
supported so you have all the devices
like the Samsung Galaxy s4 s5 even the
newer forms like the Samsung Galaxy s7
edge or the as8 I'm not sure actually
quite sure about the s8 but that's
basically it you can just select your
device right here and once you've got
your device through the model number you
basically just go and hit download now
the files do come with the odeon flasher
already installed already zipped
together with it so just to save you
enough time and you basically take you
to the download page object I'm just
downloading a random device file so CF
autoroute J 53g I'm not really sure what
that device is so it's going to ask you
to save the zip file just save it right
here I hope that doesn't take too much
time that is going to take a bit of time
anyway basically once it's downloaded
all you have to do is basically extract
the file run Odin and plug in your
device and you can you're basically good
to go now for those of you who don't
have Samsung devices and maybe have
devices like the shell me or hallway
those type of devices usually what I
found with my research is that this
program called kingroot basically does
the trick now again the the I'm not
going to say that it's going to give
your route 100% but I'm going to say
about 90% you're going to get your phone
rooted so basically it offers you two
options you have the option of
downloading an apk file installing it on
your phone and rooting your device
within your device or from your Android
device you then have the Windows client
that allows you to basically connect
your Android device and route it from
your PC which also works I think better
than the application itself so that's
another option that you have right there
now if you're still stuck you basically
want to check xda-developers calm this
is where I got started out with routing
and basically Android I've been using
Android since 2011 so this was actually
the first place to check for roms and
the custom recoveries kernels basically
building your own type of roms and stuff
like that I'm sure most of you on this
channel are already familiar with that
and you remember the good old days of
flashing custom roms etc etc so what you
basically do on xda-developers is just
go ahead and search for your device so
I've seen a lot of people commenting
that they have the Samsung Galaxy J
forms
so basically as you can see you have
your Samsung Galaxy j7 J 3 J 1 so you
can select one like I've selected the
Samsung Galaxy j7 excuse my internet
connection if it's a bit poor there we
are so basically it's going to take you
to the page and you can see this a
plethora of information about the device
how to basically guide the news you
don't have your roms Colonels etc etc
you have your themes apps and mods so
basically you have your audience you can
see Pro Stock gear next a zip aligned D
Knox tweaked roms so that's pretty
awesome you can check that out you'll
probably find all the route files right
here and you can find some good runs as
well so that's basically it in terms of
routing your Android why these are the
best options in my in my opinion really
on basically getting your Android device
rooted so basically for Samsung try the
CF autoroute option for other devices
that you may not have found a route
option available you can go ahead and
try King route and that basically will
hopefully sort your problem out in terms
of whether or not you want to install
other roms or modify your device you can
end up xda-developers a call and you can
take it from there so that's basically
it for this video guys thank you so much
