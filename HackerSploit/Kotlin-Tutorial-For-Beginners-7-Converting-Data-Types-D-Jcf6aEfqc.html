this video what I'm going to be
explaining is how to convert data types
from one data type to another
so it basically looked at this very
briefly in the past videos where we were
basically converting the data that was
input through the red line from string
to integer and that's very important
that you understand how to convert data
types because sometimes you may want
data types converted from when they are
read into the system and when you want
to use them for example in calculation
or when you're basically using it for
output so let's get started so we're
going to create a new new Kotlin class
and we're going to call this data type
let me just try that again data type
convert all right you can name it
whatever you want as long as you
basically remember the name is let's get
rid of that and let's create the
function the main function so function
main arcs array into string all right
and which is going to open that this is
the main function so now in the previous
video we already discussed so if I would
supposed to say let's create a variable
of a all right now variable a is of
integer and this is equal to let's say
20 right we would know that basically
where we have created a variable and the
variable is a now variable a is strictly
to of data type integer so we have
entered the value which is plenty so we
know that now if you are to create a
variable B all right of type let's say
string all right and we were to give
that a value of since it's a string we
will give it a value of 10 in string
format all right now if we basically
created a variable a variable C alright
C which is an integer all right and we
basically left it for we basically
created that and we were saying that C
is equals to B all right what we get
would that be possible no because
basically we're saying we're trying to
say C
is equal to the value of B but B is in a
string format and this is an integer
format so what would you go about doing
so you basically use the dot operator
dot - int alright that was basically how
you are to convert that value so now to
see whether this has worked to see
whether it's converted this string value
of 10 into an integer value we would
just basically print out the value of C
all right and hopefully this will give
us the answer so let's save that and
let's run this hopefully that returns
the correct result that we wanted and
that hopefully is 10 so there we are as
you can see it returned and the value is
indeed then as an integer so that's
basically how to basically convert a
very very basic datatypes from into
string and at you you get the idea and
you can basically do it in any other
format so if we are basically saying 10
if we're creating a string of let's say
10 point 6 and we want to give this to
convert it into a float we will
basically go into this variable C and
change this into a float alright and
then we would go here and say - to float
oops sorry I use my caps lock there
again sorry to float right so very very
simple and that would basically convert
it into a float and it will basically be
treated as a float instead of a string
so let's save that and see whether it
returns the same the same thing and as
you can see it now returns it as a float
value which is very very good and very
very it's very useful to understand how
to convert so that's basically it in
terms of conversion you can basically
convert it into anything that you would
feel necessary so for example we could
say to float we can say to double of
course it has to make sense when
converting we can convert it into a to
double and that will basically you'll
get an error because this that does not
convert contort to what a double is so
let's just leave it at two integer and
you get the idea it's very very simple
to convert
to convert these this data type so we
will change this to an integer and
basically it will be consider it as an
integer and we can change that back to
ten so you guys get the idea of changing
one one data type into another we use
the dot operator then to int which for
most of you who are familiar with the
Java programming language will already
have understood that you use this so you
can say to int or you can say to to
string or you could change it to to
double to to short and etc etc for
different data types so let's just leave
this as int and that's basically it for
this video if you have any questions
just let me know in the key when a
section of the course thank you so much
