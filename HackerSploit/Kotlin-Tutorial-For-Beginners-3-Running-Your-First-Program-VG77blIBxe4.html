this video we're going to get started
running our first Kotlin program and i'm
going to be showing you how to set up
IntelliJ IDEA and creating a new project
where we can get started working with
Kotlin so open up your IntelliJ and it's
very very simple as I'd want it and
finished installing just double click on
the shortcut on your desktop or run it
from whatever internet from whatever
your location you've started that now
once it opens this page what you want to
do is just hit create a new project if
you haven't created a project already
this is the screen you should get so
create a new project
alright it's going to open up a window
and here we are so it's going to open
the first menu it's going to open up is
Java and you just want to stick to that
now it's going to show you some
additional libraries and framework all
right so in here you just want to select
Kotlin Java just make sure that stick
and that's all we need to do right now
so just make sure you hit Kotlin Java
now when looking up here we have
something called the project SDK now
remember we install the Java JDK and we
give it a location it's under your
Program Files and the Java folder so if
you don't see any Java version right
here you basically want to go into new
and you want to browse to that directly
so I said it's in your C Drive where
your windows is installed in your
Program Files and all the way down to
where your Java folder exists and you
just want to select your JDK folder it's
as simple as that so mine is already
selected so I don't really need to do
that so again make sure Java Kotlin is
ticked right here not not Java
JavaScript Java Kotlin and just leave
everything else as it is and hit next
and you want to obviously give it a name
so we're going to start with first first
let's call it first project right and
I'm going to store it on my desktop I'm
going to give it a new folder I'm going
to call it a new forum where I collect
Kotlin Kotlin and let's call it floated
the Cortlandt class and I'm just going
to create a new folder inside the Kotlin
class I
just you guys do this as well I'm going
to first first project alright and I'm
going to save it in there again you can
save it in any folder but I recommend
that you guys actually do it in a much
organized way that will suit you so I'm
going to save mine in my desktop in a
folder called the Catalan class in the
first project folder so just hit OK
I'm going to save it basically as you
can see over there you can save it
wherever you want and I'm going to hit
finish and it should start up the
IntelliJ IDEA editor again this will
start up depending on the speed and the
performance of your computer so if you
have a fast computer this will load
faster if you have a slow computer don't
worry this will still end up loading for
you so it's going to open up this editor
and you're going to see some pretty
weird stuff
if this is your first time using
IntelliJ and I don't I want you guys to
just calm down and just relax don't be
overwhelmed by these editors they're
really just there to make your
programming experience a lot easier so
let's just instruct ompletely indexing
the files as it's same down here and the
once it's done we can actually get
started making explain the structure of
how a Kotlin program works so once
that's done it's basically going to be a
it's going to leave you to it and you
can basically get started so up here we
have the project you have your project
browser we can basically browse the
folders that are currently in your
project folder and here you have the
editor section where you edit your code
and I'll get to that so you just want to
open this and it's going to show you
some very very weirdly named files and
again don't be bothered by this it's
going to show you an idea don't touch
that and it's going to show us our C
folder now your SRC folder is where all
your Kotlin classes will go into so for
those of you who don't know what classes
are class is a collection of functions
and you may be asking yourself what is a
function well a function basically
performs a specific task and we'll get
into that when once I'm explaining the
basics of programming now again your SRC
will store your job
classes or your Kotlin classes in this
case so you just want to right-click on
this to create a Cortland class and you
just want to go to new alright and
you'll see something here called the
Cortland class you want to open that up
and it's going to ask you for a name so
let's give it a name let's call it hello
hello world let's begin with something
as simple as that
you guys can name it whatever you want
again and just hit OK right and once you
hit OK is going to create the Cortland
class and it's going to give you some
commentation so it's going to say
created by your username on the debt
created alright if you get a
notification like this telling you to
update Cortland
please do so I'm not going to do mine
right now I'm going to do it a bit later
so basically you just want to get rid of
this comment file unless you need it
which I doubt no this is basically your
Cortland class and you can basically
start writing code here now as I said
this is a class and that means that
means the class contains functions now
in Cortland we basically create a
function by writing fu n pretty fun
that's a function so fu n is a function
and we're going to create we're going to
use the abbreviation main this is the
main function in the class which we
created here which is hello world so
function main alright and once we have
the function main we're going to open
brackets all right and we're going to
say args which our arguments I'll
explain what this basically means and
we're going to say array all right and
it's going to give you cold suggestions
these are basically suggestions here
that are trying to help you
so make basically saving your time we're
going to open some equality brackets
right there and we're going to type in
string all right and we're just going to
go over to the end after the brackets
and open two curly braces now in de Cali
braces you just want to expand one of
them just click enter and there you have
it this is basically your Cortland
function now everything that you want to
do basically comes right in here the let
me explain what this function basically
stands for so you have your function
which is a few n main which for some of
you who have done or I don't know how
many of you have actually done
programming main is basically the
function that is first executed when you
run a program so this will run first and
it's going to say args which arguments
you don't really need to know what this
section means right here this is quite
advanced stuff that we'll get we will
get to soon and just know that this is a
function and in the function you can
create you can basically do whatever you
want to do so in this case we want to
print out hello world so it's very
simple in Kotlin all you have to do is
just hit print all right and open
brackets and basically open the speech
marks and just hit hello hello world and
basically what this will do is will
print hello world now I will get to
basically printing a single line in a
few seconds so once this is done all you
want to do is hit ctrl save alright if
you're running Windows or you could just
go here and hit or you can just go here
and hit save all you can go to file and
hit save all and what you do is just
right click in your editor and just hit
run and it's going to run this program
and hopefully if we've done everything
right so far it should tell us that the
we have actually printed the words hello
world so let this run it's going to
start building of course this will be
the first time we are basically running
this compiler so it will take a few
seconds but hopefully this gets faster
as we continue increasing the code so
there we are it's going to open it's
going to open this console and it's
going to print hello world so there we
are big eyes that's basically how to run
your first Kotlin program and how to
basically make it say something now
again if I was to basically just print
another sentence right here hello world
say welcome to
chuckling all right and I was to
basically save this so control s and how
to run this it would basically as you
will see basically right now it will
take a short amount of time to compile
this code what you would see is it would
basically print it on the same line now
if you don't want that
all you have to do is just basically
print and after you just want to hit
print
Ln alright and that basically means
print line and that will print hello
world on its own single individual line
and you'll not conjoin to this second
statement right here so basically what
print line means it's printing a
sentence on its own and it wants
anything that is going to be printed
after that to be printed below this so
if we control save this and we run this
it should hopefully say hello world on
one line and print welcome to Kotlin on
the other and there you have it
it's as simple as that very very simple
programming language to grasp and that's
basically it for this video I hope this
has been very very interesting and
engaging for you guys if you have any
questions let me know in the key section
of the course anyway I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
