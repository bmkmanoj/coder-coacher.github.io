with another video and in this video
we're going to be looking at linux
explorer and you might be asking so for
what is linux explorer well linux
Explorer is a forensics toolbox for
linux operating systems so in reality
what they give you or what this script
is is essentially is giving you an
advanced process manager and a forensic
toolbox that will allow you to analyze
anything on the linux click on a Linux
client alright so some of the
functionality that it does offer is it
will give you a full process list it
will allow you to inspect the memory map
and you can you know also fetch memory
strings so it it's fantastic for
forensics for those of you interested in
forensics this is a fantastic tool that
can allow you to perform some forensic
analysis on a client or on a target
computer it allows you to dump the you
know process memory again very very
useful for forensics it allows you to
view the user list on that system it
allows you to search for files you can
look at the system log the firewall log
bash history so really really useful
stuff it allows you to have an ante
rootkit software or framework so one of
the dimply supported one here is ch
rootkit and yeah so let's look at how to
get it installed and some of the
requirements that you need to install
before you move on so it does require
python more specifically Python 2.7
right and it need to requires yarra or
why a ra it requires CH rootkit if you
are planning on using it I'm not gonna
use it right now but I'll show you how
to install it alright so let me just
open up the link here have it open up on
my browser's you can see it's on github
and I will be leaving the link in the
description so you can check it out
so I'm just gonna clone the repository
like so so I'm just going to copy the
link there and what I'm gonna do is open
up my terminal which is right here I
already have it opened up let me just
zoom in so you guys have
better idea of what's going on all right
so I'm on my desktop and that's probably
where I want to store it if you're on
your computer I recommend that you keep
it in your optional folder so that is
you know your opt folder where you keep
all programs that are not installed with
the system because these tools may have
some bugs and you know mixing it up with
your system isn't the best of things to
do
so yeah let's clone it so git clone get
flown by the way this does work on any
Linux distribution so you know you can
use it on a bun - Fedora whatever you
feel is comfortable for you so I'm just
gonna paste the link there we are and
I'm just gonna hit enter and depending
on your internet speed it will get the
file downloaded so yeah for please
forgive my slow internet right now it
isn't the best of connection speeds but
it should get it downloaded immediately
so just give it a few seconds to start
up and get all the files download it and
we should be good to go all right so let
it just finish up there we are it's
getting all the files that we need there
are quite a lot of files actually all
right so we've got it on my desktop for
some reason I can't seem to get it in my
desktop why it's probably on my root
directory so what I'm gonna do is go to
my desktop sorry
there we are because I am in my user
sorry or I am on my desktop sorry so let
me just list that out there we are
so it is the Linux Explorer file source
let me just enter there all right so let
me clear the terminal now and to list
the files there are a few things that
you have to do and one of them is to
look at the requirements alright so all
the ins they required packages for that
matter so what I'm gonna do is I'm just
going to display the requirements that
you know given to us in the requirements
about txt file alright so I'm gonna hit
enter and it's going to tell you you
need these packages to be installed so
you need flask PSU tools just some
libraries and utilities that you will
need so what you can do is you can
install it using the TI t install PAP
install R and use the requirements the
requirements for TX
so you automatically get the packages
for you so you can just do that I
probably have them already installed so
it shouldn't take too much time as well
and once you have the requirements
installed there you say I already have
them installed as you can see a
requirement already satisfied so I know
I have them but for in your case you can
go ahead and get it done right so
another thing you have to make sure that
you need to do is we need to configure
the we need to configure the Python file
so let me just clear this up and if I
list the files we have the Python the
configured Python so Python convict or
Python and oops let me use the Nano
editor my bad config configured Python
there we are so in here if you wanted to
use the VT o TX api's that's a special
tool sorry about that notification that
that's essentially an API that allows
you to or that gives you route kick
rootkit detection all right so you if
you want to use the API you can go ahead
and just google it and you can get their
API and that will allow you to use the
rootkit detector alright so but I'm not
going to use that because it's really
not necessary at the moment so I'm just
going to exit the that I'm just going to
exit that and we can move on to you know
installing our other required packages
or the requirements basically so you
make sure you have Python I'm sure the
destroy you're on already has Python
installed so no need for that you can
then just install yarra or Y ara so
apt-get install we are there we are
and I probably already have it installed
there we are ok and then you can choose
to install your CH root kit which is
also optional yet install a CH root kit
like so and it should install it CH root
kit for some reason I'm not getting it
CH yeah chk root kit sorry about that my
spelling was wrong
so cata rootkit there we are already
have it installed and once you're done
that should be good to go now and what
you have to do now is start the the file
explorer server the Linux Explorer
server for that matter so the way to do
that is to use the Python so python
linux explorer using the linux explorer
dot py or python and it's going to start
it and it's going to say running on that
link so let's open that link alright and
it's going to open up on firefox there
we are so the link is 127 0.01 the port
is 80 80 alright
so it's going to open up and it's going
to give you this fantastic web interface
and it's going to start loading these
services and there you have it it gives
you these services pretty pretty awesome
and you can see all what's running and
the process IDs there process the user
names under which they are running if
you have multiple accounts alright so
you then have your user step right up
here that gives you your users and what
they're using so as you can see I have
my user the up to the package manager
that's running we have Beth
we have iodine mailer so these are all
user services that are being run and you
can look at the user ID their username
of course you have their home directory
what what their directory they are from
so it's really really a fantastic tool
for forensic analysis and finding out
you know what processes are running and
I really really see this a you know to
be useful for servers of course more
servers will run the command line
interface but you know if you install a
GUI and a desktop environment this can
be fantastic as well then of you find
which allows you to search for you know
files or if you're searching for a
specific you're searching for specific
you know hidden files or malware and
stuff like that you know for suspicious
files stuff like that you then have your
net stat that allows you to check your
your incoming and outgoing connections
as you can see so you know we have the
the the process manager that is
currently working in as you can see it
is it does have connections in incoming
not going to the different ports we then
have some other traffic coming and going
so yeah pretty pretty awesome let me
just zoom back in there we are
alright so you can view not stack you
can also view your logs right so I'm
gonna just try and keep my logs to
myself but let's look at my ufw firewall
so I don't have you you have W firewall
installed again that's really really
another cool tool if you want a video on
that please let me know
looking at the authorities log as you
can see yeah the power button yeah I
guess you can see how awesome this can
really be so yeah you didn't have your
anti-rootkit section which is again for
checking for rootkits and you can start
the service when you're in so what's
going to happen now is let me just open
up the browser is when you get the
survey started it will obviously give
you the functionality of checking
whether we have any root kits installed
so really really helpful as well
alright then Aviara which again is for
setting rule sets and for file
directories and you know process ID is
just scanning your files on your file
structure for anything for anything that
you specify well with the path all right
you don't have your ticket doctors here
I mean your rule set which is set to
default the tick adaptor and you can see
you have your up to ghost dragon ghost
rat and you can upload your different
year rules files so pretty pretty
awesome functionality it does give you
and if we go back to the processes you
can see that again it gives you a lot of
information about these services that
are running does take a while to start
up but overall pretty pretty awesome
then have the ability to perform a
search for the processes that are
running so that's also pretty pretty
cool as well like they can run processes
that are running under my username and
as you can see it's going to tell you
what's running so for example I have the
system library running we have the we
have some you know the dynamic config
service running just really religious
normal stuff regarding the system that's
running anyway guys that was it for this
video Lin Explorer is quite an awesome
tool for
check analysis and for system management
Linux system management that is I hope
you guys found value in this video if
you did please leave a like down below
it would really I would really
appreciate it if you have any questions
or suggestions please let me know in the
comment section or you can hit me up on
the on my social networks or on kik for
the latest hacking news and resources
please check out my website a chestplate
calm the link will be in the description
and yeah thank you so much for watching
guys have a fantastic day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
