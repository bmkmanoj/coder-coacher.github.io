with another video and in this video I'm
gonna be showing you how to perform a
DOS attack or in some cases a DDoS
attack or a distributed
denial-of-service attack using zexis one
of the most powerful tools in this
category for performing denial of
service it
Derk sees it really is very very simple
and because of this I just want to throw
out a bit of caution I just want to say
that you know this tool is very very
powerful if used in the right way now
again this is going to you know it
brings me to the question of of whether
you're going to use this for ethical or
malicious purposes and again I'm not
going to be held responsible for any you
know malpractice that you do with this
tool my job is to show you how to
install it how to get it working and how
to use it how you use it is up to you
and again I'm going to say this that I'm
not going to be held responsible just do
it in a you know in your own environment
just use it for testing again you can
perform these attacks if you have
permission from the owner of the website
you have written permission or you're
performing a penetration test things
like that so you know having me having
given you that disclaimer let's get
started
so I have the github repository open up
already the link will be in the
description section don't worry about
that so what you want to do is just go
and you can just clone the repository so
I'm just gonna copy that or you can
download the zipped folder the process
is essentially the same just that with
github it allows you to clone it
wherever you want and extract it for you
so I'm gonna zoom in right here and so
we can actually get a good picture what
I'm gonna do is I'm just going to go to
my desktop because that is where the
recommended location is for this script
so CD desktop all right I'm just gonna
move for my desktop and in my desktop I
just want to clone the repository so git
clone I am gonna paste the link in there
and I'm just gonna hit enter so it's
gonna start cloning it and there we are
it's done shouldn't take too much time
the file is relatively small in size so
I'm going to change my directory into
these X's full
and this is where a lot of people get
issues why do they get issues is because
they try and execute the xerxes dot C
file and that is completely wrong
because as I said there's a readme file
please take time to read the
documentation it really really does make
a difference so let's try and read it
together all right so I'm just gonna
print it out
whoops readme not be Xerxes file I
almost made that same mistake so read me
all right so it says zexis is the most
powerful das tool download the file
Xerxes dot C to your desktop obviously
it's programming the programming
language of C open the terminal and type
these commands CD desktop again we are
using the gnu compiler so essentially
this command right here is going to
compile the C file into an executable
all right so then we can as you can see
it tells you here the usage is Xerxes
with the website or the target IP and
the port all right our report 8e
obviously is referring to the port the
TCP port where all communication is
going through so again that is pretty
self-explanatory so again if we open up
these xerxes folder and we check out
these X's dot C with something like the
Plumer editor or you can use genie as
you can see it's using the C programming
language and we have to compile it so
let's do that right now all right so
it's telling us to use the command GCC
all right so let's do that right now so
G new compiler whoops no comply
compilers X's dot C with the output into
xerxes all right so we're just making an
executable so if we enter it's going to
create our executable for us there we I
if I list it it's just gonna be called
xerxes all right so let me clear this up
now you might be asking yourself what
target are we going to try and attack
well again as I've said I really
encourage you when you're trying to
learn these things is to run it in a in
your own environment where you control
everything and one of the best ways is
to use
you know you can't write on your own
virtual machines on your Windows device
or on an IP that you want to test now in
my case I'm going to be using a virtual
machine for Metasploit able to write so
what I'm gonna do I have it running in a
virtual machine and oops let me just get
my ifconfig back up as you can see I
have the IP address here for the
Metasploit able to virtual machine we
have the 192 one point one sixty eight
point two point one three zero all right
so that's the IP address for the
Metasploit able machine now we do know
that Metasploit able has a web server
it's running some files on it so let's
try and access that right now let me
just bring up power to us back again
here and if I move to my web browser
let's try and access it alright so
192.168.1 three zero that where it is so
if I open it as you can see we have the
web server running a few vulnerable
frameworks like we have the PHP my admin
which is not really vulnerable it's
there for testing we have the motility
dam vulnerable web application which we
will be looking at by the way most of
you guys have been requesting literally
begging for MySQL MySQL tutorials so
we'll actually or SQL injection attacks
a tutorial so we'll be looking into that
in other videos but the bottom line is
we do have the web server running so
let's try and actually attack this and
see what happens all right so let's
execute it so Zack sees
Xerxes and then it said that we specify
the IP or the target so 192 point one
six eight point two point one three zero
with the port a TP use for TCP
connections and also hit enter it's
gonna start sending the volleys which
are simply attack vectors let's see if
we can get access to the web server and
what do we have here well it looks like
we can get access and as you can see as
simple as that you are able to perform
in this case a denial of service attack
it could be to any target on your local
network or if you are trying to attack a
target you know anywhere around the
world whether whether it be a web
or an IP address you can see that it
does work with great you know with great
efficiency and it's just amazing to see
that such an simple tool you know very
very easy to install and and to
configure can perform this attack
you know this effectively so as you can
see it's just gonna keep on sending
requests in terms of volleys and yeah
until you stop it which is when you can
get access to your web server so let's
try and stop it and I'm gonna try and
reload it and immediately we get access
now I know if I run this again it's
probably not gonna work because the
requests have already been said let's
try and see if it yeah it's not gonna
work now that's usually an issue so what
you have to do is run the script again
but again you can try and target even a
website again I would recommend that you
don't do it to a website into you that
you don't have permission to and that's
pretty much it that's how to use Dirk's
ease you can use any target that you
want again I'm not gonna be held
responsible if you try and attack a
website you know that you're not allowed
to and you know the funny thing is many
many websites nowadays still don't have
D dose or than denial of service
protection which is just amazing to see
because you know with with a tool like
this and a botnet you can really do some
serious damage I mean most of the big
websites nowadays can handle a lot of
traffic and performing one you know an
attack from one computer or one one
client is not gonna be enough but for
many of these smaller websites you know
individual blogs or or you know you know
Hospital websites or stuff like that
that really not very important you can
actually bring it down which is
incredible but again this is all about
learning we're learning a lot of these
new things and how they work and yeah
that's gonna be it for this video guys
