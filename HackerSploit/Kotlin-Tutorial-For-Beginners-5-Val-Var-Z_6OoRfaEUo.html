this video we're going to basically look
at the different types of variable
declaration now this is going to be a
very short video but it's gonna have a
lot of value in terms of understanding
how you declare variables so as I've
explained in the previous video you
basically declare a variable with the
with the abbreviations are all right now
you basically give it a name so var a is
equal to 10 that's an example alright
and we can basically say if we wanted to
update this variable we can basically
say a is equals to 20 and what this
means is in essence these variable as I
mentioned in the definition allows you
to basically manipulate or access the
value of a variable so we have another
type of variable declaration quite
similar but also quite different which
is the V al which basically is in short
for value and a value could be for
example very value B is equals to five
all right now what the difference is
between these two is a variable will
allow the value to be updated all right
so basically what this is is this is a
read or write value right here so that
means it can be updated but if we try to
do it the value with the value right
here what this means is that the value
of B is equals two files cannot be
changed and cannot be updated so in a
way in a simple way of understanding the
value of B is equals to five and cannot
be changed further or updated so if we
try to do that we say B is equals to
play it'll basically not allow us to do
that all right and if we hover over this
as you can see Val cannot be reassigned
which means that Val cannot be updated
or or the value of of B which is a Val
or a value cannot be updated and it's
very very important that you understand
this variable can be updated the value
of a variable can be updated and
value of a value cannot be updated or
reassigned so I just wanted to explain
that so to get that out of the way so
thank you for watching this video again
if you have any questions let me know in
the case section of the course thank you
so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
