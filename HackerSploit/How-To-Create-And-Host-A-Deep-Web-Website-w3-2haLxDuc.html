the course in this section we're going
to get started with creating and hosting
your own deep web or onion website so
basically in a nutshell I'm going to be
showing you how to create and host your
own Deep Web website so now what I'm
going to be doing in this video is just
showing you the process we're going to
be using Linux more specifically Ubuntu
you can use any other Linux distro you
want and that's what I would recommend
because they're and manageable is over
using Windows you could do it with
Windows but I'm not going to go into
that because it's a really really
tedious process and again you're
basically going to be turning your
computer into a server and you don't
want it to be running Windows trust me
so I'm going to be using a bull - I'm
running this one my going to machine
right now so let me just open up a
terminal this is how we get starts
opening up a terminal and you have to
enter root alright so I'm going to enter
root right now so that sudo bash going
to enter my password alright if you guys
have a password enter it and it should
grant you the root access now first
thing we need to do is we need to
install the Tor unit alright the unit
package for Linux so Act not the browser
the toy unit package act get install for
all right and it's going to ask you to
install it and if you want it installed
it's going to just complete I already
have it installed so I don't need to go
through that so once that's done we're
going to have to browse through to a few
directories here so what you want to do
is you know if you guys are not familiar
with the Linux command line just follow
me along it's the same process but for
those of you who are accustomed to how
the Linux terminal works you will get
the idea so we're going to change the
directory to CD and to the Etsy or et
Cie folder and it's going to open that
and let me just list the directories all
right so we're going to then move into
the CD CD tour I believe if you have
installed toward this folder should
exist alright so there it is you then
want to use a text
yes to edit the detour cease beat or
Seif file right here so I'm going to use
G edit if you're running Linux this
should come pre-installed on Ubuntu if
you're using Kali Linux use the leaf pad
or if you want to do it through the
terminal you can use nano the Nano or
DVM editor so what we're going to get
started with is G edit G edit tour see
this is the file we want to edit right
here and add something that so I'm just
going to open that up and it's going to
open up and that file in this nice
document folder now as you can see on a
scroll all the way to the bottom all the
way to the bottom and you want to enter
these two lines here so I'm going to get
rid of them and I'll show you
whoops excuse me I'm going to get rid of
these two lines get rid of them
alright so basically what we have to get
started with now to what we have to
enter in now is the following
alright so we have to just follow for
follow along as I type right so you're
not typing let me just see if I can let
me just stay hidden alright so make sure
you that you don't leave a hash before
because you want to actually activate
these commands so just just copy what
I'm doing hidden service directory just
the way of punctuated it VAR we
understood this in the bar VAR library
tour and the routes store hidden store
hidden underscore service right so once
that lines done we can now go to the
next line and we want to type in hidden
serve this port or it's hidden service
pot 80 because that's the default 80 for
those of you custom to networking you
will understand this you know want to
get your IP address all right now I'll
explain Tony about this so just open
your terminal another terminal
you can and just type in ifconfig you're
using Linux side and config please we
work on any Lux distro and you want to
go to the your current network adapter
and as you want to go to the I net of
section right here and you want to just
copy this this is will be a public I
mean your private on your local IP
address on in order for you to host this
to the whole entire planet meaning
globally share this website and who's
the through your machine you'll
basically give it your real IP address
or set up a server but to demonstrate
I'm just going to be using my local IP
address so that's that's the one there
so I'm just gonna copy it so after the
80 give a space and paste that there
alright you then want to enter : and 80
sorry 80 again alright so once that's
done those are the two lines that we
needed to enter so let's just save that
right so once that save close this file
and we can open up the terminals again
and we were working all right so let's
clear that now we want to start the tow
service right so this is why I said we
need to install the Tor unit so the two
installs at all service we just want to
hit service again for those of you who
are custom to the Linux command line
you'll know how to start these stuff so
service to start right and it's going to
start the tow service if you installed
it next what we want to do is we need to
install Apache to Apache to is a live
server for those again of you who are
custom to web development will
understand what apache is for just
creates a localhost where you can access
your website and edit it etc etcetera so
to do that you just wanna tap install
apache2
alright and as you can see i already
have it installed but if it's not
installed it's going to install it for
you and you you're basically ready to go
so next thing on a visit service apache
- and we want to stop it right there we
are sorry that started and now now what
we can do
is we need to go we need to browse into
our in 2d folders that we have set so to
do that I'm going to just hit not unless
Nautilus is a root file browser or file
explorer so I'm just going to open gnome
Nautilus alright and it's going to open
my file explorer so I'm going to go into
the hard drive where Ubuntu is installed
and you want to go to this directory so
you want to go into VAR alright bar
library tour you're not going to tour so
this should be down here torque and you
want to go into hidden service and the
hostname all right your hostname is
basically your deep web link your onion
website link so just leave that open and
now we can go back go all the way back
to your hard drive and you want to go
into VAR all right and www and your HTML
so this is your Apache folder and this
index dot HTML is your actual website
source code so let's say we wanted to
create a test web site I'm going to open
a text editor I'm going to be using atom
because I am also a web developer so if
you guys are obviously accustomed to web
development this should be no surprise
for you so let's create a new file and
let me just save this as I'm going to
save it on my desktop as index it's
going to be a very simple looks like
index dot HTML I'm going to save that
right and let's just get let me just
enter the syntax alright so there we are
I'm just going to call it test Deep Web
oops site this is that's the title of
the web site in the body I'm just going
to create a container div container and
let's call this welcome to the website
we're not using bootstrap so I really
can style it much more than that but
this is just a simple website we can
give it some simple styling some in an
internal styling style is equals to
color let's say reg you guys don't have
to do this if because when you'll be
creating your own works
is all up to you just basically creating
a text website HTML file so again
actually I can just show you that it
works
so we're basically gonna say welcome to
the website this this site was created
for the Deep Web alright so I'm gonna
I'm going to save this and we can exit
now now we're going to get rid of this
index dot HTML I'm going to move it to
the trash and we're going to move in the
one we've just created which is in the
VAR WW and HTML folder I'm going to copy
it in there so once that's done we have
almost getting to where we want it to
get next thing we need to you need to
download the tor browser the actual tor
browser as I showed you guys so
basically what you want to do I just
open up your browser and search for tor
tor simple as that and then it's going
to take you to the website right here
just click on that website and just hit
download and again you can just select
your value architecture right here we're
using Linux for this so download the
Linux version and now I'm going to open
my file explorer right here I'm going to
go to my downloads I already have the
tor browser extracted so we'll have to
readjust it tor browser and hopefully it
should start the DOE browser and we can
we can basically paste the link to our
website which hopefully should be
running because of the Apache so let the
tor browser start up there yeah now I'm
going to just copy the link that belongs
to our website let's copy this and let's
paste this angle and hopefully if it
worked through the ports and the Apache
we should get there so they welcome to
this website this website was created by
the Deep Web and if you see we can
basically this is what we wrote and
that's the the basic web page so as you
can see this is an onion web site and
this is the basic web site really really
very simple and a meaningless web site
but you guys get the idea this is just
showing you how to go about setting the
environment up and
basically creating a test website and
how to basically set up Apache so that's
basically it for this video guys it's
not really that complicated but as you
can see it's totally worth it and it
does work so if you guys have any
questions at all about anything that we
have done in this in this section just
let me know in the connect section of
the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
