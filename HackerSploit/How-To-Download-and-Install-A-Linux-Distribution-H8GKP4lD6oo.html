with another video and today I'm going
to make be making a video on basically
how to get started with Linux how to
choose the correct distro for you and
how to install it now the reason I'm
doing this video is because there are a
lot of new users on the channel and they
they really are interested in getting
started with Linux and ethical hacking
but have had no they have no experience
actually installing any operating system
and that's fine you know that really is
fine all you have to just understand is
that it really is very simple and it
really is very simple and the steps are
mostly Universal when installing any
Linux distro so and that get started
so if you're a beginner this is probably
what's really going to help you so the
first thing you have to do is you just
have to understand that Linux is
open-source alright and what that means
is most of the distributions out there
and some of the best distributions out
there are free of charge alright which
means that you can download them for
free and once you become or if you
choose to become a developer a Linux
developer you can contribute to the to
the distribution then basically make it
better and that's fantastic now again
there's some things I want to basically
clarify that maybe I haven't clarified
before and that is that Linux is
actually a kernel alright that is
coupled together with the G the glue or
the GNU alright which basically means
that bind together as a linux destroy
you're basically combining the Linux
kernel and the new the glue system
basically which then gives you a
complete operating system that is that
are uniquely different from each other
so first things first is you have to
decide what a Linux distro you want to
go for now there are a lot and this may
be very overwhelming for you so in order
to get started I would recommend that
you visit this website this website
helped me a lot when I was getting
started and it's called distro watch
distrowatch calm right that's the site
you want to visit this is the one this
tor.com sorry I entered a spelling
mistake right there
now this to watch is basically a website
that contains a lot of information about
Linux and the different distributions
around Linux so basically it's going to
give you the latest news and updates
regarding the related distributions
being released so you can see we have
raspbian you resent in scold linux you
have debian which was recently updated
your FreeNAS IP fire just everything
related to this resent is you can see
you have your ranking here so we have
linux mint you have debian manaro ubuntu
open-source etc etc so these are really
all the best distributions of them and
this can basically give you an idea of
what you would go for now for a beginner
I would if you're looking at Linux from
a beginner's perspective and this is
your first time I'm going to judge my
suggestion based on on these three
things first thing it has to be easy to
install to download and install second
it has to be very user friendly in terms
of basically you might be switching from
Windows or Mac OS and it has to be
familiar enough for you to get moving
and do to do daily tasks and the third
one is that it's a basically it's not
very very complicated for users to set
themselves up in the city in the sense
that a you won't experience any errors
or major bugs that might discourage you
from using Linux so what I would
recommend for a beginner is Ubuntu and
Linux Mint alright these are the two
that I would recommend the reason I
recommend these two are there they are
very very popular and have a good
reputation all right for example Ubuntu
is being used all around the world
I mean it's it's use is just absolutely
phenomenal for example one of the
biggest users of the Ubuntu distribution
is Google
Google developers actually have made
their own version of Ubuntu and they use
that for actually developing so that's
pretty pretty awesome and and again it's
open source so you can choose between
Ubuntu and mint again if you're feeling
adventurous you can go and try these
others for I would say open-source is
good as well but I would not recommend
it for beginners it's more of an
enterprise type of solution where you
want to install it on a lot of computers
on your maybe in your office or school
that's where you usually find open
source but if you if you want a very
good stable a very good stable working
distribution I would recommend mint and
Ubuntu Debian requires a lot of
customization and basically it's it's a
raw operating system in the sense that
you control everything about it you can
customize how it looks how it feels how
it works which is great once you know
how to basically move around Linux which
you will hopefully get to learn through
going to an mint so you can just go to
their websites hopefully this takes me
there I'm not sure it will or it's a
stigma it takes me to this page and well
I you can basically just give it a
Google search or we have the website
right here I'm just going to open that
this is one of my my favorite operating
systems because I've been using this
since probably I think I was 11 years
old that's the first time I saw it I
actually used Linux this is a true story
I actually use Linux before I used
Windows and I was thinking well what
what's this you know because at that
time everyone was so fixated with
Windows 7 and how awesome it was and
everyone was just like whoa whoa you
know just just windows and gaming and
stuff like that but actually got to use
Ubuntu when it was I think in its
version for very very early on when it
was being distributed around meaning the
only way you could get a copy of a bunt
was through a free disc that were
usually packaged with with magazines or
if you are lucky to get one a person
already had the the disc and duplicated
it so basically enough of that
Ubuntu is free and you can download it
and they now support a lot of basic
systems and they have tailored it for
different purposes
again I'm not favoring Ubuntu if you
feel like going with any other it's the
the process is going to be simple there
two ways you want to go about installing
this now it's firstly you have to
download the ISO file now all of the
Linux distros are going to be downloaded
in the format of an ISO file now an ISO
file is a virtual disk image alright
that means it's a disk image file that
you can mount now most of you probably
already know what that is so you can go
about installing it on a disk you can
install it on a flash drive and there
that's pretty much it or you can run it
on a virtual machine alright but that is
really really for people who don't want
to install Linux as their primary
operating system so as you can see one
tree is completely free to download and
you can just hit open to desktop that's
the primary one and it's going to say
one to sixteen point zero point four or
you can download thirteen point zero
point four zero point zero four is a
fairly new version I've used it and I
use it but there couple of bugs so I
would recommend that you go with sixteen
if you're a beginner so just hit
download and you can download it
directly or through a torrent it's going
to ask if you donate any money too
because if you don't that's fine if you
do they're going to really appreciate it
and once you're done you can just hit
continue download and basically it is
going to start downloading the ISO file
alright so currently I don't have the
ISO file downloaded but I already have
an ISO file here for pirate OS alright
so most of you guys if you watch my
videos no more pirate oasis paradise is
basically a penetration testing
distribution you really don't have to
worry about this so if you're planning
to install Linux on
you're on your main computer and
basically if you want to dual boot it
the process is very very simple all you
have to do now is basically decide what
installation medium you're gonna be
using for example you might want to be
using a flash drive which I would
recommend it's very very easy and using
a disk drive or a disk
sorry ID we did this good in fact I've
even forgotten how you even say it sorry
about that I haven't used a disk in a
long time this are just getting Auto
fashion and yeah just get a flash drive
because you're going to be doing this
once you get started to relax it's like
an addiction you can just stop
installing different distros and trying
them out it's really fun so you can
install it with different USB installers
but I'm just going to make it very very
simple for you what you want to use is a
tool that I've been using and I just
absolutely love it and it's called
Universal USB installer alright
so Universal USB installer and as you
can see easy 1 2 3 basically what the
reason I say download this is for the
following reasons so just go to the
website and hit download works on
Windows it's a very small file just hit
save it's probably already downloaded as
you can see try taking one right there
so once you just open it up just
download it and open it up you'll see
what I'm talking about
alright so it's going to say agree it's
probably there is no setup it's just a
one-time run so basically now it's going
to ask you select a distribution from
the drop-down this is the reason I'm
saying this it's basically going to help
you in the installation process so it's
going to ask you all right buddy what
Linux distribution do you want to
install so I have on my desktop parrot
OS if you have one to downloaded the ISO
just it Ubuntu if you have Linux Mint
just hit Linux Mint simple as that you
have Debian just a Debian if you have
fedora if you have open source if you
have any of the puppy linux distros you
have the lean existence for kids and
then it sorts
all the other distros alphabetically and
you can see I can find pirate OS down
here here we are under security and
penetration testing just hit that next
select your ISO file if mine is on my
desktop and if I just go here just
select that open and you can then select
your flash drive right here so let me
actually just grab a flash drive and
plug it in sorry about that I should
have done that before recording this so
I hope slimiest plug again
there we are hopefully it reads it all
right there we are actually actually has
a file called recording don't judge that
don't judge me actually sorry so
basically it's going to show up right
here Cline is going to give me
information it's a seven gigabyte flash
drive that should be enough next thing
you want to do is it fat32 format and
fat32 and that basically just make sure
that it formats in the right right sorry
about that the right format and makes
the flash drive bootable so just it
create and it's going to start the
installation process is going to take
about a few minutes and once it's done
you're going to have a bootable flash
drive alright I've just skipped through
that because that's just really going to
waste time
now once you've installed it you need to
decide what you're basically doing so
are you planning to dual boot it with
Windows or are you planning to do a
fresh install getting rid of Windows and
stuff like that so if you're going to go
through with basically installing it on
dual boot what you do is plug in your
flash drive power of your machine plug
in your flash drive boot into the BIOS
alright once you've booted into the BIOS
you then want to make sure that you you
basically boot from your flash drive
that you've just created should be
plugged in once you're booted from your
flash drive it's going to start taking
you through the installation process all
right now in the installation process
you probably have probably understood
that if you
we need to have two partitions in your
hard drive all right
the reason I'm not showing you this is
because it's really really very simple
once you understand about basically
installing them in different partitions
all right and by basically you should
have partitioned it before you went into
the installation process but it can also
allow you to do that in that inde
partition when you're installing any in
the next distro most of the good distros
come with an inbuilt partition alright
so once you're done basically selecting
the partition you want to install the
destroying just select it and hit
continue and then it's going to ask you
if you want to basically install all the
all the partitions into one drive and
it's these different partitions of the
swap partition and we the basic the
installation partition with where the
actual operating system is going to be
installed all right and you make sure
you want to make sure that that that's
all in one partition that you've created
next it's going to ask you on which
drive to install the grub bootloader
all right the grub bootloader is
basically going to give you um allow
your computer is going to prompt your
computer to ask you when you start it up
whether you want to boot into Linux or
Windows so you want to make sure that
you install the grub bootloader on to be
the partition that way of installed
Linux already once you've done that it
will basically complete the installation
and reboot and it's going to take you to
the bootloader which will ask you do you
want to start up the Linux distro that
you've just installed for example Ubuntu
or do you want to continue to Windows
and you select you make a selection and
it's going to boot up into that
operating system that's basically that
for M for your boot for a clean install
you want to make sure you backup your
files if you need them and all you have
to do is say goodbye to Windows if
you're that brave enough so what you
want to do is just power off your
computer it's going to take you to boot
up into your flash drive and then you
can basically start the installation
when it
to selecting the disk select the disk
that you have windows installed on
probably you're just going to do it on
one partition format the drive and just
hit install again make sure it installs
all the swap partitions into the single
partition and the grub bootloader so it
actually is able to boot up the Linux
distro and it's going to install and
reboot and you should be good with Linux
so that's basically it for this video
guys a lot of people or are beginners in
this and they wanted me to basically
advise them on where to get started you
know it's really really overwhelming
especially now with there's so many
Linux distros and there's a lot of
information about Linux but for beginner
it really is overwhelming just don't
worry don't really worry about not
knowing everything we're going to go
through this I'm going to make a lot of
other videos regarding Linux and how to
move or navigate around the operate the
operating system the user interface how
to use the command line and there's a
lot to learn but if you just go into the
operating system and tinker around like
you would with Windows it's a very good
operating system so that you basically
get you sorted for installation if you
have any questions or if you're stuck
anywhere just let me know in the comment
section or you can hit me up on my
social media by the way make sure to
follow me on Instagram it's going to be
linked down in the description if you
want quick tips or you can also contact
me there on Instagram through the direct
messaging service you can also contact
me on kik there's so many contact
methods that you can use when it comes
to contacting me I'll answer your
question no problem as fast as I can
hopefully within a few hours or even
minutes depending whether always or not
on online at that current tank but just
send your your question and I'll answer
it that's basically it for this video
quite a long video but I just wanted to
have a number or more or less a
discussion with you guys and just
explain to you guys how to you know just
get really just getting started with
Linux
yeah that's basically it for this video
