another video and in this video I'm
gonna work I'm going to show you how to
ddos using your Android device now
before we continue I just want to let
you know that whatever I'm showing you
in this video is just for educational
purposes and I'm not responsible for any
damage that you caused using the
information I will give you in this
video so without further ado let's get
to this so there's going to be a file or
an application that you have to download
in the description just download it copy
to your phone or downloaded directly
from your Android device and install it
it will be called and DOS ID and when
you open it it's really very simple give
you a warning that it's used solely for
professional security stuff so just hit
continue and we see it's very simple you
have your target URL your payload in
bytes remember that it's in bytes and
the milliseconds between posts so you
can immediately just enter it whichever
URL you want long of course when you're
ddossing the you have to make sure that
you're anonymous but just for the sake
of this video I'm going to be using my
routers IP local IP address so um it has
to be in URL form so hypertext Transfer
Protocol slash in point one sixty eight
point zero point one and once you hit go
don't worry the app will say it has
stopped working but it's as you can see
it still working here that's at it
saying the attack has started once you
open it will tell you that it's already
running and you can stop it so yeah just
let it run for long you want it yeah
once you want to anyone you want to stop
it just hit stop and that will say it's
stopped again so yeah that's one small
problem but it does work I have tested
it it was really sending like a lot of
packets to my router and yeah
I hope this video helped you if you did
leave a huge like and if you want more
videos like this subscribe if you have
any suggestions leave them in the
comments I hope you enjoyed this video
