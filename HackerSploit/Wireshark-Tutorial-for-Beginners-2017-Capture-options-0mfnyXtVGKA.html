with another video and welcome to your
third Wireshark tutorial for beginners
so in a last video we talked about the
environment and how to basically change
the layout of the environmental
Wireshark to meet your specifications or
whatever you feel more suitable for you
we also looked at some toolbar actions
and what what the icons on the toolbar
do now in this video I'm going to be
talking to your body capture options and
the interfaces in depth so again this is
what I'm going to be talking about we
will capture options and interfaces just
for the sake of this for the starting of
this video which is going to select
Wi-Fi alright we go or whatever make or
a network interface card you're using so
I'm just going to stop scanning for
packet and I want to just show you
something here we want to hit this
little capture options icon here and
once you get that it's going to open
this menu now as you see there are about
four network interface card that I have
here now two of them the VMware network
adapter and this one right here one and
eight are not real in the sense that
they are not actually Hardware they just
software virtual network interface cards
these are for my virtual machines I have
two my Wi-Fi and my Ethernet I'm
currently using my Wi-Fi card so that's
you want to select the one that you're
currently using now it's going to give
you information more information about
it now when it comes to this tab here
the promiscuous mode what this means is
that whether or not you want to allow
your Wi-Fi card to read packets or read
data from other devices now let me
explain why this is a actually a setting
now in Wireshark you have two options
when promiscuous mode is enabled or
disabled when it's disabled while shock
is only going to scan data or packets
that are meant for your computer and
it's not going to scan for packets from
other devices from their devices to the
raw router so that basically what from
this case mode is promiscuous mode
basically pays more attention to data
that's going to and from other devices
so it's actually allowed
read packets and data from other devices
now again this is highly legal without
permission I don't recommend you going
and using this this method like any
public place it's highly legal and if
you're actually caught you will be
apprehended and it's a crime so again
you have done permission from your
network administrator or you basically
have not permission to scan the packets
on the data so yeah that's pretty much
about or promiscuous mode is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
