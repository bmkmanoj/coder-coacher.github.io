in this video we are going to be looking
at how to generate word lists with
crunch
all right so crunch is a fantastic
wordless generator that generates word
lists based on the criteria that you
pass through it so it's a fantastic
password utility that is pre-installed
on kan Linux and it's excellent for
generating word lists okay so in the in
the previous section we looked at how to
use word list for brute force
essentially for brute force attacks but
we did not look at how to create one and
how they are used in this case I'm gonna
be showing you creating you how to
create your own word list with crunch
alright so as I said crunch comes
pre-installed and pre-configured on Kali
Linux which is awesome alright now
before we get started I just want to
show you guys something that you know
that is really important for for you to
understand and that is that if you go
into your file directory and the point
here is that Kali Linux already comes
with with some pre-configured or already
comes with some word list that you can
use by default now these word lists can
be found in other locations good go to
your computer and you go to user and you
go into your share and you just want to
scroll all the way down or you can use
your search menu here and just type in
word lists all right so one once you get
that just open it up and as you can see
you have your word lists right in here
that are that come pre-installed or that
come with Kali Linux and the great thing
about these ones is they're very very
powerful and they are based are on
different types of attacks so for
example you have a SQL map or at least
you have your n map word list you have
one of the most popular word lists in
the world which is the rocky word list
and you know so on and so forth so these
will come really in handy when
specifying a word list and especially
especially if you do not want to
generate your own this is a great
starting point alright so you just
select the working directory which is
user share and word lists alright so
let's get back to crunch and let's look
at how we can create our own word list
all right so the first thing you need to
do is you need to make sure that you're
working in the directory in which you
want to store your word lists in alright
so what I'm going
to do is I'm just gonna change my
directly to my desktop all right so I'm
gonna change my directory to my desktop
and now in here I'm gonna create a
folder and I'm just gonna call I'm just
gonna call it word lists right so make
directory word lists and I'm gonna
change my directory into that folder
because that's where I want to store my
word lists so I'm gonna enter and we can
clear and now we can get started with
crunch all right so crunch is very very
simple to understand and it's very very
easy to start generating your own word
lists depending on the parameters that
you want to pass okay so let's look at
how to use it so the syntax is very
simple you obviously start off with the
V crunch all right the crunch command
and you can also look at the help menu
if you ever feel lost alright so as you
can see the usage is pretty much given
here so you have crunch the minimum and
maximum value and then you select your
options alright so I'll explain to you
what this means so if we just clear this
and we get started so let's say for
example we want to generate a word list
that contains words with three or more
letters but the letters should not be
less than three and not be more than
something like five all right so what
would we do we would say minimum the
minimum amount of letters to to generate
or work with in terms of the words to
create is three we then select the
maximum amount so the maximum should be
let's say five okay so the minimum and
maximum is specified now now we need to
select the character set that you want
to specify so a character set is pretty
much self-explanatory it is the
characters that you want to specify to
be used in this word list okay so for
example we can say ABCDEF g and only
specify ABC till the a - g essentially
and then we can also specify numbers so
you can say one two three four five six
seven eight alright so it will only use
this character set to generate a word
list now by default this is not really
it's it's really not something that you
would be looking at but it comes really
in specialized situations when you want
to generate word lists for more specific
types of cracking or approaches alright
so we're just gonna we're gonna create
this one and I'll show you the correct
way of creating one or the way that I
use to generate word lists okay so this
is what
this the syntax is so far so I've
specified crunch will specify the
minimum amount of letters and will
specify the maximum amount of letters so
we know that all the words in the word
list will be will be more than three
letters but less than five letters
excellent we've then selected our
character set which is all the
characters that the word list will be
based off so it's currently going to use
ABCD efg and one two three four five six
seven eight all right now you might be
asking well how do we output this into a
word list well what we do is we use the
O command which specifies an output and
then we just type in the name of the
word list that we want to give so I'm
just gonna call this word list one dot
txt all right the extension is very
important you can use a dot LST
extension all right which is also good
or you can use a dot txt extension which
is also going to work perfectly all
right so I'm just gonna hit enter and as
you can see the crunch will not generate
the following amount of data and we'll
give you the size or the amount of data
in terms of the word list that is going
to generate and as you can see I took
only about four megabytes that's because
we've related this word list is
relatively small because of the
character set that we've provided
remember if you do not specify a
character set which is what we'll be
looking at it's going to generate a word
list that contains all characters okay
so you can expect the size to be quite
large as you can see the units specify
dear you have gigabyte terabyte and
petabytes so you know things can get
really really big and it's very very
important to understand that okay so let
us look at the word list file now if I
just go into my word list folder and I
look at the word list one dot txt if I
just open that up you can see it's gonna
take a while to open up and there you
are so you have characters you with the
character set that we we have letters
with the character set and the words
that have been generated so you can see
some three-letter words if we scroll all
the way down you you have your four
letter words five and so on and so forth
and it continues all the way down using
all the character sets and the
combinations that are possible now you
can see that this word list is extremely
large and you know likely so it is a
very very powerful word list in its own
way okay so that is how to generate a
word list in you know in proper proper
theory
so now let's look at how to create a
word list that is actually quite
powerful so what i'm gonna do is i'm
going to say crunch again let me just
clear the terminal so i'm gonna eat
crunch okay
crunch now i'll specify a minimum and i
would specify the same amount of the
same range so let's specify the minimum
of three and a maximum of six this is
usually about a good range to work with
especially when you're trying to crack
you know services like ssh you know your
turn network etc etc now i will not
specify any characters at that because
that's because i wanted to use the
entire character set and you know
therefore it is it becomes even more
powerful because the amount of
combinations have increased and
therefore there is a higher chance of
you actually getting the password that
you're looking for so now all i have to
do is i just have to output the word
list alright so i'm just gonna call it
word list two two dot txt and once i
enter it's going to output this word
list so i'm gonna hit enter and as you
can see this one is slightly larger
significantly larger it's two gigabytes
alright so now it's gonna generate the
following number of lines as you can see
it's gonna tell you and of course
because of the the size of it it's gonna
take quite a while so as you can see
crunch eight percent completed
generating output so this is a really
really really huge word list now
something else i want to explain is you
can generate word lists using crunch
alright so it's it's a fantastic a
password utility to generate word lists
now most of the the powerful word lists
that you'll find online and more
specifically word lists like the ones
that kali linux already comes with which
you can find in the user and you can
find it in share and if I just search
for it here I want to explain a few
things while currently is generating
that large word list file all right so
all right so let me just open that up
now the thing with these words
more specifically they rock you where
list is it contains leaked or stolen
credentials actual you know passwords I
it actually contains passwords that were
leaked or stolen from a website and then
what were released to the public so this
is why these word lists are considered
much more powerful because they actually
come
real password combinations that are
likely to get you into a system now by
default using something like crunch is
it's like shooting in the dark that's
because you might you might be able to
crack you know a login or or you know
for some reason if the word list was not
good enough or did not contain the
correct or the correct character set you
might end up with a failed failed
exploit or a brute-force attack okay so
we looked at performing a brute-force
attack in the previous section when we
were using when we were using Metasploit
and obviously in the wordpress section
where we are trying to brute force the
the login of the WordPress site you you
saw that when using a a word list it
does work if you have a fantastic
character set now by default this word
list that we're generating with crunch
as you can see is quite large more
specifically two gigabytes but it is
quite powerful in the sense that you are
likely to crack services like the SSH or
telnet you know really basic types of
services all right so the word list is
generated and now we can just open up
our folder and word list to dot txt now
this obviously depending on its size
will take quite a while to open up with
my text editor and there you are so now
as you can see it is still calculating
the amount of lines that it contains
which just proves to you how large this
word list is okay so even if we scroll
all the way down you can see the number
of combinations that you can find there
and we've not even hit the ones that
have the ones that have numbers or a
contained characters so that was how to
generate a word list with grunt it is a
fantastic password utility and it's
always good to know how to generate your
own word lists with your specific
character sets or user preferences all
right so that's going to be it for this
