with another video and in this video I'm
video I'm gonna be showing you how to
install and configure Metasploit a
community or the probe version depending
on which one you want to get install and
you might be asking yourself for what
exactly is Metasploit I thought we
already knew what Metasploit is well
that's true but what you're looking at
or what you used on Kali Linux or entire
to s is the Metasploit console alright
so that is essentially Metasploit for
the command-line now what I'm talking
about is the Metasploit framework that
is a GUI framework that will discover
that will allow you to discover open
ports on a network and then it will find
out the installed services on the target
or the server or website that you're
trying to scan on alright so again you
might be asking yourself well what's the
what's different what's the advantage
why do I need to use this well the main
or the best part is that it Maps the
services that will be installed on those
ports to the Metasploit modules or
exploits and will allow you to execute
the exploits on the the port that you
choose so to put it really really simply
it will allow you to scan your network
okay so once you have scanned your
network what will happen is it'll show
you your the ports and the services
running on these ports so let's say you
had a port running an FTP so you have
your ftp port and it was running a
specific service what it will do is it
will get all the exploits that are
compatible with the service that is
installed on that pot and then we'll
show you the exploits that you can use
to you know perform your attacks and
it's very very similar to what you would
find on the Metasploit console but in
this case it will show you the best
options all right so it's really really
awesome and it's more of a professional
based tool right so what you want to do
is it's completely free the community
version is completely free there is the
pro version but that's if you are really
into
into this in on a more professional
level I have used the professional
version and if you're moving into
network penetration testing it is a
really really good option all right so
let's get started it's really really
very simple all right so I'm just gonna
be putting the the links in the
description to make it easier for you
you want to go to rapid7 comm again they
developed Metis flight so this is their
product products Metasploit download and
community alright so as you can see
Metasploit community download and it'll
give you a free one-year trial so it'll
actually give you a serial key for you
to use and to test
so essentially Metasploit communities of
our limited feature penetration testing
tool that gives you power of the
Metasploit framework with that added
graphics use the graphical user
interface for easier navigation and
exploitation right so it's designed for
students and small businesses who would
like to safely simulate network attacks
with basic exploitation and network
discovery all right so what you need to
do is you just need to enter your
details here your name your email it's
very important that you enter your valid
email a working email where they'll
they'll send you your serial key so once
that's done it's gonna take you to this
page and as you can see it's good time
and it's gonna show you the downloads so
it does work on Windows because it's a
web-based graphical user interface so
you have your windows and you have your
Linux in my case I'm running late 64-bit
so just click on it and it'll download
the file for you alright so once you've
downloaded the file what you want to do
is you want to go into the installer
this is how it will look it's going to
be a very very simple installer and what
you want to do is obviously if you look
at the permissions you will not be able
to run it immediately so just change the
permissions with chmod plus x whoops
plus X and you want to just select the
Metasploit framework there we have the
installer so make sure you change the
permissions to allow execution and once
that's done just run it and it's a very
very simple installation it'll probably
take a few minutes to get installed the
installation process is really simple so
I'd really don't need to take you
through it and it'll take quite a bit of
time so just give it enough time to
install
in addition to that I've already
installed it so we don't need to go
through the installation process so once
it's installed you know probably prompt
you to open the the user interface and
as I said it does open in the browser if
it doesn't open for whatever reason it's
really really very simple to start and
the first thing I want to tell you is
you need to start the service if you
installed it as a service all right so
service Metasploit oops
Metasploit start all right and once you
hit that it should be good to go and
it's gonna ask you for your
administrator password all right so let
me just enter that right now there we
are and it's gonna start the service and
what you want to do now is just open up
your browser I opened it on Mozilla
Firefox and you want to go to the
following link all right so I'll do it
again for you going to go to localhost
localhost like so and localhost with the
port 3790 or that's the port you want to
visit there we are and again it's going
to prompt you to create an account and
by this time they should have sent to
your serial key once you've created your
account this is going to be your user
account you can just sign in alright and
once you have signed in this is the
Metasploit community framework and as
you can see it's really really well
designed and let me just breeze you
through the user interface so you have a
good idea of what's going on here
alright so starting at the top you have
your project section where you can
create different projects based on
different IP addresses or targets that
you want to scan or perform attacks on
so very very good it allows you to sort
all your stuff out you then have your
account settings where you can you know
change your setting to a logout you can
then check out your administration tab
here that allows you to check for
software updates to check your software
license and the global settings alright
so that's just to do with
personalization and customization you
then have your news panel as you can see
here that is based on the rapid7 website
so this is the latest news that they
have here let me just zoom back in and
you can choose to hide the news panel
nothing really important there now let's
get to the main which is the projects
alright so you have your project listing
and you'll give you
default one so what I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna delete that right and after I
delete it what we're gonna do is we're
going to create a new project right so
it's really really very simple
we're going to go into here a new
project like so and it's going to ask
you for project name so I can just call
it test like so test and they just call
it test home network right so this is
going to be performed on our home
network so yeah it's already given us a
network range and yes I do want to
follow that range so 192 this is my
local IP on my private IP address so I'm
just gonna create the project and there
we are so it's really really very simple
to understand what's going on here now
so you have your discovery this is where
it's going to be all about what ports
are discovered what services and
vulnerabilities what is covered and
penetration then the penetration section
this is where you're going to be doing
your brute force and your exploiting all
right we'll be looking at this in the
future videos regarding this topic but
to start off we can just try and perform
a scan all right and when I hit scan you
won't enter your target addresses or a
target range so I'm just gonna launch
the scan all right and I'll take a few
seconds that's something that I needed
to tell you and what it's going to do is
obviously it's going to perform an nmap
scan on the network range that you've
provided obviously and it's going to
start scanning the hosts I probably
should have reduced the range of
networks obviously it's gonna take a bit
of time it usually does take quite a bit
of time a bit slower than nmap but it
does work alright so once you're scanned
it will then give you the
vulnerabilities that you can access all
right so I'm just gonna stop this
because again it's not very important
for us right now let me just stop that
for some really that there we are
already stopped let's look at tasks
again alright and tests let's move to
our test project again and moving on to
the exploit section if I hit exploit it
will show us there we are so get a free
upgrade to try smart exploitation again
that's if you want to move to your
Metasploit Pro but I'll be showing you
how to perform the exploits there
without using Metasploit probe all right
you then can collect evidence and this
is more to do with the web and cookies
stuff like that then of your analysis
section this is where you can look at
the you know different information that
was captured
you have your sessions campaigns web
apps modules so Web Apps is to deal with
if you perform the scan on a web server
and it had web absent that you would
like to scan and exploit that's what it
will deal with but that's a basic
overview of how to use Metasploit and
more specifically Metasploit community
so it's a very very powerful tool as I
said it's oriented more on the
professional or enterprise level
depending on what state you are in your
penetration testing career granted that
this is a very very important thing to
learn so I hope you guys found value in
this video if you did please leave a

questions or suggestions leave them in
the comments section or you can hit me
