with another video and in this video I'm
gonna be showing you how to install Kali
Linux on the windows subsystem for Linux
alright so we've talked about the
windows subsystem for Linux before it
allows you to run Linux distributions as
a subsystem on on windows which is
awesome alright and as I've said many
many times this is a fantastic feature
that I don't think you know gets enough
credit on Windows that being said let's
get started so before we get started I
just want to just tell you that we have
some prerequisites for this tutorial and
the the first one is obviously that you
have to be running the latest version of
Windows 10 alright and that's because
this feature only exists in Windows 10
it's actually a fairly new feature it's
about a year old and I've been using it
ever since the only thing is that okay
not a lot of people seem to be using it
which is quite weird because it allows
you to essentially emulate Linux in a
subsystem environment right so you need
to have the latest version of Windows 10
or with updates installed preferably ok
the next thing is you need to have
Python 3 version 3 installed right now
when I mean installed I real mean I mean
really really installed in the sense
that you can access it from the command
line which means you have set the path
and the home the invite and the
environment of the variables what I mean
is after you've installed it you should
be able to check the version in the
command prompt as I've just done so as
you can see I'm running Python 3 point 6
point 4 the last prerequisite is is to
have git installed on Windows alright
now you can you can do this the other
way by actually downloading the files
from the repository manually and then
extracting them which is what I have
here but we'll be looking at that in a
second
now as I said I already have git
installed so I'll also be using that
method as well so let's get started now
remember by default the windows of
system for linux is going to be disabled
so to enable it it's really very simple
all you have to do is just go into your
control panel and you want to go into
programs and you want going to turn
windows features on and off click on
that and now it's going to give you this
little dialog box that will allow you to
turn Windows Features on and off
depending on what they are so for
example we have Internet Explorer we
have net framework till four point seven
and three point five very very important
so I tend to leave those ones always on
and you want to scroll all the way to
the bottom to the bottom and you will
find the windows subsystem for Linux
right here alright so by default it will
be unchecked if this is your first time
doing it but for me it's already checked
because I already have it and I use it
quite a lot so just check it and just it
ok now if that is your first time
checking it it's gonna start downloading
some files the required files and once
it's done we can move to the next step
alright now once you've you've checked
that and you've enabled it the next
thing you need to do is you need to
install a base distribution and you need
to configure your username and password
so the way to do that is to go into your
command prompt and run it as
administrator all right so you want to
run it as administrator and now you need
to run the command LX run which is Linux
run and you want to hit install fourth
slash install or and once you hit enter
it's going to give you this little
option saying LX run is only used to
configure the legacy Windows subsystem
for Linux distribution distributions can
be installed by visiting the Windows
Store so what this means is the version
I'm showing you installing it through
the command prompt is considered the
legacy version of how to install the
windows subsystem for Linux all right
now the distributions can be found on
the Windows Store which is quite awesome
I actually saw them on the Windows Store
there was a bunch of fedora and open
SUSE which are awesome you know that is
really great flexibility but sadly there
wasn't any Kali next version but this is
a way of actually getting the Kali Linux
you're getting to install can index as a
subsystem all right so it's gonna prompt
you here this will install Ubuntu on
Windows distributed by canonical and
licensed under its terms available here
type Y to continue now I already have it
installed so it's probably just gonna
tell me that it's installed so hit yes
and as you can see yes the legacy
Windows subsystem for
distribution is already installed now
for you it's gonna start downloading a
bun too it should take less than 20
minutes and then it's gonna ask you to
enter your UNIX username and password
that's very very important that you
configure that all right so once that's
done you have successfully configured
and you have enabled the Linux the
windows subsystem for linux alright now
the next step is to download the the
windows subsystem for linux switcher
alright which is can be found in the
github repository here which i will
leave in the description section so you
can check it out for yourself alright so
as you can see it's the windows
subsystem for linux distribution checker
here and its main purpose is to is to
let you easily download and install new
Linux distributions under the windows
subsystem for linux and seamlessly
that's a key word there seamlessly
switch between them so i've used this
tool for a long time now and I was
shocked not many people know about this
and not many people knew that you can
install any distribution under the
windows subsystem for linux alright so
the windows subsystem for linux
distributions which is a fantastic tool
that allows you to do this and it makes
it really really easy to do alright so
as i said you can do this with two ways
because windows is not native to get you
can just go to clone and/or download and
just download the zip or you can go and
copy the link right here and just copy
it alright so now what i'm gonna do is
i'm just gonna create a new folder on my
desktop right and i'm just gonna call it
test i'm just gonna call it test there
we are and I'm just I'm gonna open up my
command from now this time you don't
need to be an administrator or actually
before we do that I want to open up git
because we need to clone the repository
so I'm just going to open up get bash
what I would recommend you do if you
have downloaded the file directly just
copy to your desktop and extract it
there so I'm going to open up git bash
now right and this is fantastic tool it
allows me to do all the Linux commands
that I would get to do so it emulates it
really really well alright so I'm going
to change my directory into my desktop
and I'm gonna change it furthermore into
my test folder which is where we're
gonna be doing all of this right so test
and now I'm going to hit get
clone and I'm gonna paste the link there
and once it's based it oops for some
reason I did not for some reason that
did not paste there so let me just copy
this again right and I'm just gonna hit
git clone again and paste there we are
it's yeah fantastic so I'm gonna 10/10
is gonna start cloning the repository
give it a few seconds the file is not
large at all alright so we're done so I
can close it now and I can just open up
my command prompt and head over to my
desktop and into the test folder alright
so we're in the test folder if I look at
the directories I have in the test
folder we should have the WSL
distribution switcher alright so I'm
going to change my directory into that
into that directory so wsl distribution
switch and then now let me just clear
that and let's see what files we have in
here so as I mentioned we need to have
Python 3 are pre-installed it's a
prerequisite for this because you will
need it so the first comment we're going
to need to use is the get pre-built or
Python file right here that's the most
important file which will allow us to
fetch the kali linux docker files you
then want to use the Installer python
file here which we will use to install
the docker file or the docker or archive
alright so as I said I've already done
this before which are you know to save
time and to show you how it all works
really really well I have it in this
Kali folder here so as you can see I in
the Caliph all to have the wsl
distributions which are you know you
know the same directly the same
directory as I have in the test folder
so if I open this up the file that we
want to download the docker file is the
tally Linux docker latest tar all right
so that is the file you want to download
and install and that can be done really
simply so to get it installed what you
want to do is use the Python command so
python because you want to run a Python
file and then we say get pre-built get
pre-built we want to use this Python
file right here get pre-built and now we
specify the name of the of the docker
file which in this case is the kali
linux
alright kali linux so it's actually
going to download this file so kali
linux
all right so it's going to get this file
and download it now as I said I've done
this before so it's already downloaded
and the file I'm talking about is this
one right here so it's about two hundred
and thirty four megabytes so again you
know if you don't have the file it will
take a while to download that's all I'm
gonna say there so just hit enter and
it's going to start downloading the file
so in my case I already have the file so
I'm just gonna show you what to do next
so once you've downloaded the file let
me actually just copy it into the test
directory so I can show you exactly what
to do so I'm just gonna copy it and I'm
just gonna move it into my test
directory here which is the one we are
currently working in so I'm just gonna
paste it in there alright fantastic so
now if I list the files inside once it's
done downloading you should see it in
here so the route FS Canada next
scallion X daca latest or target.com
todo ji said all right now we need to
actually install it so we use the Python
command Python and we select the install
dot Python file here so install dot
python file like so alright and after
you hit install dog Python now we need
to select the name of the file that we
installing which is the kali linux
docker file so we just select it right
there or you can just type it in so root
FS and i can just use the tab button to
autocomplete and just hit enter now once
you hit enter it's going to start the
installation process it's gonna start
extracting and installing the kali linux
docker once that is once the
installation is done what you want to do
is just close up this command prompt
here because again i'm not gonna do it
because i've already done it so just
close this command here and now you want
to go into your command prompt again and
you want to run it as administrator ok
now once you've run it at as me as
administrator you need to set the
default username so we can do this using
the LX run command so let's do that
right now
alright so to set the default username
we use the LX run fourth slash set
default user set default user and then
we select the default username which is
root
all right so essentially we are creating
we're setting the default user as the
root which is fantastic because we do
not need to create a non root account
here alright so once that is done just
hit enter and it's going to say found
UNIX user root the default use UNIX user
Center root fantastic now once that's
done we can just hit bash and voila we
should have Kali Linux active excellent
there we are
that is fantastic so now we are in the
sub system now we are actually using
ours I forgot I'm actually on Linux now
so you might be asking well how do I
know I'm actually in in Kali Linux well
the easiest way to know that is if we
check the issue file so that can be done
with the issue so cat we can just
display cat et Cie and issue alright and
as you can see here Kali in the next GNU
rolling can its Linux rolling rolling
release so again you're running can do
next now and the first thing I recommend
that you do is you just update it so
apt-get update you can also update the
distribution and furthermore you can
then install because this is this is the
docker file or the docker installation
you can then install all the packages
that you require for example nmap the
Metasploit console all the essentials
that you require alright so that is how
to get Kali Linux install as a subsystem
on the windows subsystem for Linux on
Windows 10 so I hope you guys found
