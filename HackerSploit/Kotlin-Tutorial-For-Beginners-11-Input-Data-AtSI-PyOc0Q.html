this video I'm basically going to be
explaining to you how to input data in
the Kotlin programming language so we've
already looked at variables and how to
basically output data or war text on the
screen or the console and now it's time
to basically learn a very important
thing is to learn how to input data into
the quadlin programming language so you
can either store it as a variable or
money butan manipulate it in whatever
way you want so let's create a new class
so you guys remember you go to your SRC
folder and let's create a new Kotlin
file class philo class and let's call it
let's call it input input data all right
let me actually just calculate
capitalize this so it looks neat so I'm
going to say input data that's the name
of the class and it's going to create it
and let's get rid of this comment right
here so let's create the main function
so function main args array string and
let's open that as a function now
basically how I'm going to explain this
is using the this is using the help of a
simple program that will make
understanding how to input data very
very simple so let's let me first show
you the command that is used to input
data and the command that you did the
read read line command as you can see
Continent already recognizes it so this
is the command that we're going to be
using now the simple program that I'm
going to be using is a program that will
basically ask the user to input their
name and their age and it's going to
display their name and age pretty simple
but it's going to basically summarize
all that we've learned so far in terms
of variables inputting data and
outputting data so let's get started to
get started all you have to do is we
basically ask the user to input their
name so we're going to use a print line
statement and we're going to say please
enter your name alright and we're going
to use a colon and we're going to give
it a space to make it look neat alright
so we have printed on one line please
enter a name now we need to basically
allow
into input basically your name and to
store it in a variable so let's create a
variable called name alright which is
obviously going to be a string but we
don't need to enforce that so variable
name equals to read read line and open
and close the bracket so it's going to
basically read whatever name you enter
in string format and then it's going to
save it it's going to save it or assign
it in the variable name so now the
variable name equals to your name once
you have entered this now let's
basically create another state comma
basically another text let's all put
some other text thing please sorry about
that let me just open this quotation
marks please enter your H all right now
basically was the user to enter the edge
so very very simple now we're going to
say variable age but now we want the age
to be an integer format because it will
not be very very useful if we enter the
age in string format and it just
complicates it a lot so we want to make
sure in we enforce the datatype as int
and we're going to say is equals to read
with line alright now once you enter
that you will get an error and there are
will be on this read line section and
that's because read line is going to
basically it's going to assign the
default data type it's going to read
whatever you enter and register it as a
string but we have already declared it
as an intro it's going to confuse the
compiler or the editor and say wait wait
a minute he has basically said that the
age variable is an integer can only be
an integer but in terms of read line we
can only read in terms of string so we
need to convert the string into an
integer how do we do this we do this by
using two exclamation marks and using
the dot operator dot two int all right
so we're basically converting red line
which basically reads
a default it will read by default in a
string format so we are converting it
into an integer format so that it can
basically store your age as an integer
so what's happening here is you've
created a variable called age and you
want to make sure that it's only stores
integer integer values as for the
variable but when you say read line it's
going to automatically assign the
datatype as a string that's why we've
got the error so we have to convert the
string into B into the integer and once
it's converted it's going to basically
save it it's going to it's going to give
the value of whatever 8 you entered and
it's going to declare it to that
variable so basically we've already once
this line is entered now it saved both
of the variables and they both have a
value the name and the age of whatever
you have entered now we basically want
to output what prevented so this is
where we're going to summarize the
concatenation section so print line and
we're going to say your name is and
you're going to use the space and be
concatenated operator and we're going to
say plus your name is and we're going to
say name because the variable already
has the value and we're going to use
another concatenation operator and say
your name is and you are and I'm going
to give it a space and another
concatenation operator you are age okay
that's your age that's how old you are
h plus you can open the quotation marks'
space years also that's the thing you
want to take your name and your agent is
going to include it into this sentence
and hopefully the sentence will make
sense once I've entered everything so
once that's done we are basically done
with the program all you have to do is
hit ctrl s to save and let's run this
program by the way you can also run the
program from up here and you can also
get into debugging which I'll get to in
the future so just run the program again
if this is your first time running the
program it will take quite a while so
just let it finish configuring the
compilation and just let it compile
everything together and
let's see what we get so it's going to
ask me here please enter your name well
okay I'll enter my name my name is
Alexis all right so I'm going to say
okay please enter your age again say 19
all right so once enter 19 is going to
say your name is Alexis and you are 19
years old pretty awesome so it basically
allowed me to input data in whatever
datatype that I wanted we wanted string
for the name it did that we wanted to
convert the basically the age and make
sure that it stores the value of the
variable as an integer and it with that
we also wanted to display what we stored
in variables I needed that so that's
basically inputting data in a nutshell
and that's basically how to input data
into Kotlin very very important in
Catalan and I hope you guys found this
helpful so that's it for this video and
thank you so much for watching if you
have any questions let me know the Q&amp;amp;A
