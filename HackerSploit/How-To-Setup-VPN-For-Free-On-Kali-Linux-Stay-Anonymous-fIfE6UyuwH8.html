with another video and in this video
video and in this video I'm gonna be
showing you how to set up VPN for free
in Kali Linux more specifically you can
use this on any other Linux distro that
you want it will work perfectly and the
reason I'm making this video is a lot of
you guys have requested it and that's
because the proxy chains configuration
videos that I made are a little bit
complicated and are bringing a lot of
problems I will be making a follow-up
video to those brocolli chains videos to
sort everything out and to clarify a few
things and that that video will help you
troubleshoot your own the problems that
you have with your proxy chains but
again the reason I'm making this video
is a lot of you guys have been
requesting it to have been requesting me
to make a VPN on Linux video on how to
set it up and how to get it running and
basically explaining how to do it now
before we get started I just want to
point out something VPN is not my
preferred option when it comes down to
anonymity it doesn't matter whether
you're browsing a VPN just won't cut it
in terms of giving you I would say 90%
of anonymity and the reason is this okay
firstly you have to you have your free
VPN services or service and your page
VPN services which obviously it's
obviously it's obvious to tell that the
paid versions are going to provide you
with a much better speed are not going
to log your information or some of them
may be doing it I'm not sure but they
you know some of them log your traffic
in case they get questioned by
authorities if you did anything illegal
they will be proof they will you know
provide them with your browsing
information and your DNS information
which is what I'm getting to very very
closely what I'm trying to say is there
going to be plenty of free ones out
there and that's what I'm gonna throw
out a bit of a caution that please be
sure of the VPN server or service you're
choosing because if that VPN server is
set up for legitimate purposes meaning
the owner of that VPN server
is in all essence logging your traffic
or your decides you're visiting
well that just defeats the purpose of
even having a VPN in the first place so
you know in this video I'm gonna be
showing you one of the best free options
available and I would recommend that you
stick to it unless you find another one
that's better and is proven to be
legitimate okay so that's just a little
disclaimer that I wanted to point out
now again when it comes down to DNS
information being leaked I can tell you
for a fact that a VPN is not it is
probably gonna leak your information I
would say a VPN provides you at least
with 60% of anonymity I'm not going to
say that a lot of people are going to
look at your DNS information but if
you're changing your IP address with a
VP and you're really forgetting that
your DNS information can provide
authorities or anyone who pokes into it
with information about your DNS and from
there can deduce your location so it
really doesn't matter if you've changed
your IP address if your DNS information
or in-store geographical location that's
it they've got your location and from
there they can just pinpoint your
activities but let's get started so I'm
gonna open you just want to open you up
your browser and this is the service
that we're going to be using we're going
to be using VPN book calm all right VPN
book comm provides free VPN services and
as you can see here it cost zero dollars
a month which is awesome if you want to
donate to them I would recommend it
because the service they're providing is
fast it's reliable and it's secure so
we're gonna be using free Open VPN okay
which is recommended obviously and they
provide you with different certificate
bundles depending on your location so
you can select you have your euro 1 euro
2 us-1 us-2 CA 1 I'm guessing that's
California probably I'm not sure don't
hit me on the head with that and as you
can see it's going to tell you optimized
for fast web surfing so no p2p
downloading so it's going to allow you
to browse the web you know with great
speeds but
you're not gonna be able to download
with p2p so if you for those of you who
like torrents and stuff like that if
that's the reason using a VPN this is
not for you so this is where you might
want to go into a a paid VPN okay so
let's get started now with setting this
up so as I said you can choose your
certificate bundle which are all which
include UDP 53 UDP 25,000 TCP 80 TCP 443
so that means if you have a network or
your network is has blocked UDP
connections you can use the TCP
certificates they also provide you with
a username and password which are going
to be very useful in a short while so
just download any certificate bundle
that you like I'm just gonna try euro
two for example it's going to be a very
small file so that shouldn't be an issue
it's about nine kilobytes so I'm gonna
save it and it's gonna download
instantly and I'm gonna open the folder
as you can see I have it in my downloads
folder and now I'm going to extract it
because it's a zip file so make sure you
extract it then in that folder in this
case I'm in my downloads folder I'm
going to enter that folder and as you
can see we have the certificate files
the dot OpenVPN certificate files so you
have your TCP 80 tcp 403 UD p 53 etc etc
the one I'm gonna be using and I'm
guessing you're going to be using is UDP
25,000 again if your network has
restrictions you can choose any of the
other three certificates but I'm
guessing this is the one you can be
using so I'm just going to copy the
entire file name with the OpenVPN
extension just because I want to save
time and I don't wanna have to go
through the process of typing it I'm
then I'm gonna open a terminal in this
folder like so let me just get rid of
that like so and what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to zoom in so we can see
everything that we're working on right
now and we can get started now with
setting it up now it's very important
that we use if we enter into root mode
so sudo OpenVPN alright so especially
thing that we're using open v
now you want to give this certificate
file which I've pasted the name there
and it already knows that I'm in my
downloads and in the VPN book comm the
VPN folder that contains the VPN
certificates so I'm gonna hit enter and
it's gonna ask me for my password
remember this is my root password and
I've given it there and then it's going
to ask for the authoritative username
which in this case they have provided
here which is VPN book okay so you can
just copy that or in fact let me just
type it VPN book and we're gonna hit
enter it's going to ask for the password
which is Sun to IMF I'm just gonna copy
that I don't want to make any mistakes
like so and I'm gonna hit enter so it's
gonna start the whole VPN service and
just give it a few seconds and once it
tells you initialization sequence
completed from then onwards you're
connected to the VPN now again the speed
may not be the best speed but it's good
speed I can I can vote for that so I'm
just gonna closed it I'm just gonna
close this up and we're gonna try and
open up a site here so let me just try
and open up duck go.com like so and
let's see if it allows us to access that
means we essentially have connected to
the VPN servers or surface for that
matter don't worry if it's a little bit
slow at the beginning that is usually
what happens but as I said don't worry
if that's that's the case so I'm gonna
check for DNS leaks as well because I
just want to show you that it indeed
changes the IP but will leak some of my
DNS information unless I change it but
for this VPN certificates I'm really
working on a way to stop the DNS
information from leaking but I'll get to
that probably in another video now as
you can see it's quite slow nothing
really is opening let me just enlarge
this slightly here so we can have a
split menu
and we can see what's going on so yeah
it's loading up but quite slowly
dr. Koo is opened up and for some reason
it's taking quite a while
let me just open up another check for
DNS tab I can already tell that it's
changed my IP because it's giving me
Google dot ro I'm not sure what what
country that is probably Romania
probably I'm not sure but if it opens up
that would be fantastic or let me just
close these three tabs this is usually
the problem with VPNs they're really
really slow if use the free versions but
it shouldn't be that slow so I'm really
curious to see why that's this is the
case so for DNS leaks okay and if I just
try and open up a search engine like
Google should open up quickly I'm not
sure why it's giving us it's really
really slow right now hmm that is pretty
weird but it should load very quickly
now if I was to examine the files which
I'm gonna show you right now we are
using the UDP 35000 dot openvpn file if
we open that up right now you can see
there's some parameters here that we can
change and this is what I'm gues
guessing you can set some security
information that will change the DNS
leak information as you can see you have
your private keys your certificates and
stuff like that so as you can see if I
can just explain a few things it's this
is the remote server that is connecting
- as you can see euro 214 or VPN book
comm with the port number no binding
persists the key of the user password
combination which you have entered is
then we're going to use the encryption
AES 128 bit I'm guessing faster IO
isn't gonna pull and redirect to the
Gateway so I would recommend if you know
this is pretty interesting stuff just to
see how it all goes through and we
still loading here this is really really
slow guys I'm actually quite shocked at
the moment but it's always good to test
things on the fly and it's also good for
me to do that it would be a shame if I
if I cut the video and I pretended that
it was working when it wasn't right so
let me just try and open up Google here
again and hopefully it works or if he
doesn't work what we'll have to do is as
we'll have to use another we'll have to
use another VPN certificate bundle from
probably another location probably the
u.s. location because this is looking
really really slow as I said it could be
due to the fact that there are many
users on it right now but again I can be
sure so what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna close this one up right now and
hopefully that will allow us to access
something here when I go back to my
normal internet connection what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna use the UDP UDP 53
so rename I'm guessing quite few people
oops excuse me rename my god man my
fingers are letting me down today
alright so let me just use that service
again this time we're ready enroute Open
VPN like so I'm gonna paste that in for
some reason oh yes sudo Open VPN excuse
me for making some really amateur
mistakes here VPN book I'm guessing
that's the username if I remember VPN
book also the password oops we need to
look that up how could I have forgotten
to do that so let's look for that like
so hopefully my internet connection
works without the VPN service so as you
can see my internet works perfectly when
I turn to the VPN I really get a slow
connection so let me try and use this
now the UDP 53 certificate file now it
looks like it's working yeah
all right so initializing sequence is
complete let's see if that works at all
so I'm gonna close that up it's always
good to restart the browser just saw
everything loads up correctly with the
correct
VPN settings that you have set so again
I'm just gonna try google.com and let's
see what we get if we get anything at
all dr. Goodkin let's try and open that
up as well
and there we go okay DuckDuckGo seems to
have opened I don't know if this site
will open up that's the error that we
keep on getting all right there we are
so as you can see the VPN now works if
we use the UDP 53 certificate file again
it's very very slow but I can tell you
that we're in Romania and the fact is I
don't live in Romania so that just tells
you that indeed the IP has changed and I
can use the VPN I really I'm really
shocked as to how slow it is but I said
it's probably under heavy load right now
the servers are currently being used a
lot since they are free but I'll be
finding different other different free
options available that you can try out
especially for Linux but this is again
what I was trying to point out proxy
gains are just so much better at
everything they are faster even though
they are slightly slower than your
normal internet connection they're just
much faster you know you know so it just
really is a slow slow process but anyway
you guys can try this out and let me
know what you think you can try all the
difference
these certificate packages from
different locations and let me know
which ones are the fastest and yeah I
hope you guys found value in this video
if you did please leave a like down
below it means a lot if you found this
