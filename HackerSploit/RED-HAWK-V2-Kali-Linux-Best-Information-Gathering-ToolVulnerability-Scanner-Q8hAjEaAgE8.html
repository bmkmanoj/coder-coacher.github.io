with another video and in this video
again at Red Hawk which is an
information gathering tool or a
vulnerability scanner for Kali Linux I'm
not sure if it works on any other
penetration testing distres but it's a
very very powerful tool that is used for
information scanning and vulnerability
scanning as well as crawling so this
comes into the field of reconnaissance
so let's look at how to install it and
how to use it so I have the github
repository opened up right here and I'll
really I'll leave the link at the
description for you guys to check it out
all credits go to the creator of this
script or tool so the tool has said is
called Redhawk and as you can see a very
very great tool the version 2 has been
released so it's been out there for a
while I've used the earlier versions and
it's been fantastic but now it's even
better so we're just gonna clone we're
just going to get this get repository
and let's copy that and now we can just
open up our terminal here and let me
just increase the font size here and in
fact let me just enlarge the terminal so
sudo Bashan to enter my route oh I think
entered my wrong password sorry about
that
alright so now we can get started so we
have to I'm gonna clone this on my
desktop alright so I already have red
hawk folder on my desktop so what I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna go back and
what we're gonna do now is you're gonna
say git clone let me just clear that
first get clone and we're gonna paste in
the repository and it's gonna start
downloading Red Hawk obviously and there
we are so we have it downloaded as you
can see here and there's red hawk so CD
CD Red Hawk let's enter a door and if we
look inside we have we have all the
files necessary for it to run so it is
based on PHP that's how it is created
and in order to launch this you
obviously have to use PHP
and Red Hawk dot php' whoops
why did that happen right dr. PHP there
we are so as you can see you don't need
to install anything you just need to
clone the repository and there you are
so as you can see coded by I'm not sure
to pronounce that name I don't want to
butcher that name so as you can see
that's the creator of the script as I
said I'll be linking the repository in
the description section so let's get
started so all-in-one tool for
information gathering and vulnerability
scanning so this is very very important
especially when it comes to
reconnaissance and as that is the first
stage of of performing a hack and that
involves finding information about your
target or finding any vulnerabilities
finding any information that you can
above the target so you have a better
idea of how to attack the target so
again this is these tools are very very
handy or come in handy when when doing
that so let's get started so it's gonna
ask you to enter the website you want to
scan I'm gonna be scanning my own
website which is finer fool.com all
right so make sure that you have
permission because some of these some
what we're going to be doing might not
be entirely legal if you perform it on a
site that you do not own so final
quarter comm and it's going to ask me
enter 1 for HTTP or enter 2 for HTTPS my
site uses HTTPS which is again a much
more secure protocol so I'm going to
select - all right so now we have our
list of scans or actions so it's very
very well designed as you can see it's
going to tell you scanning site that is
the psyche of scanning and you have your
options here numbered so 0 is for basic
reconnaissance which will give you the
site title IP address CMS cloud fare
detection and the robust wrote xt
scanner i talked to us who who is look
up it has geoip look up it has grab
banners a whole plethora of information
as you can see you have the n mo and map
spot scanning availability is there you
have your SQL eye scanner which will
find whether your site is vulnerable to
SQL injection or sequel injection
it has other stuff like WordPress cans
so if your site runs WordPress which
mine does you can get information about
the version of WordPress its running
what theme is installed etc etc and from
then onwards you can you basically make
you make up your mind on how to attack
the site that is just an example in
terms of what I'm trying to tell you so
from a blackhat perspective this is a
tool that can gather the information for
you about the site that you want to
attack and from then you can then plan
out what vulnerabilities you're going to
target if any from a white hat
perspective this tool can be used to
test your site for any vulnerabilities
oh and obviously to fix them or to
defend them from attacks so we're going
to start with zero which is basic
reconnaissance so it's going to start
the scan and it's going to tell me this
site title which is accurate it is fine
a Cota Academy the IP address is as you
can see down below there's no point
trying to ddos this because I have DDoS
protection enabled and as you can see
the webserver is Apache it's using
WordPress and no clouds are detected all
right so now what we have to do is let
me just run the script again and find a
cool calm and so we have looked at basic
reconnaissance obviously who is his
pretty self explanitory it's going to
give information about your hosting and
stuff like that you have your DNS lookup
which is also very important this we can
give quite a good idea of where the
location of the DNS or the ISP is in
terms of geo IP lookup this will give
you a pretty accurate location I have
tried it but I do not want to give up my
location so yeah you guys can try that
out for yourself I hope you get what I
mean so yeah that's basically that's
basically redhawk of course there are a
lot of options here that I can show you
but most of them will just give too much
information about my site that I do not
want you guys to have but I know you
guys are probably gonna do this yourself
if you do it go ahead I don't encourage
you to do it because again that's you
know that's my site I just hope that you
expected just try this on sites that you
can or open you know most of these cans
will bring up open-source information
that is not illegal to look at so yeah
otherwise some of the more interesting
ones are the s sequel or SQL eye scanner
which can find you know vulnerabilities
with SQL injection if your site does
have any and you have your crawlers
which will crawl all the pages on the
website and look for stuff and you have
your alphabetical options which from
a2qa being scanning everything which
will scan everything here and that the
rest all involve the tool itself so a
very very powerful tool I would highly
recommend that you check it out and you
know use it to your advantage it just
simplifies everything and it gives you a
very systematic way of looking at things
so that's basically it for this video
guys I hope you found this video helpful

mainly for discussion with all of the
subscribers so we can interact there
even more and that's basically it for
this video guys thank you so much for
