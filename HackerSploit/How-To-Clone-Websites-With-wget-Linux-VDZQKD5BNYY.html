with another video and I know I haven't
uploaded in a long time more
specifically two weeks so for that I
really really apologize but it hasn't
gone in vain I have been working on the
channel a lot I know most of you have
asked me questions I know that you know
that I once had all your questions so I
was active it's just that I haven't
uploaded any videos and I know I was
supposed to upload the Deep Web videos
and continue with the ethical hacking
series which I am but I just was sorting
things in the back end of the channel
since we are going I wanted to basically
get started with just making sure that
the quality of the videos is very very
high now so that you guys can also enjoy
it and there's a lot of value being
pushed out in one video but that's
beside the point now for this video
let's get started
so in this video I'm basically going to
show you how to clone a website now
again this is part of the ethical
hacking course this where you might be
asked as my y'all you might be asking
yourself well why do I need to know how
to clone a website well it may come in
handy when basically for him for
instance you're in a certain scenario
where you wanted to basically a clone
website and you want to run it on your
local area network so that you can
basically your target to that website
and they can enter their credentials and
basically you can get those credentials
and you get the point really
so basically cloning website now I'm
going to be using Ubuntu Linux you can
use any other Linux distro for those of
you who are using pirate OS and Linux
and Kali Linux you can go ahead and do
that by the way I have no no I take no
sides with either Khaled Nexo pirate OS
a lot of you guys have been really
really commenting down below that I
either support Kali or pirate and the
truth is I don't support either one I
like them well you can say equally I
just have one preference at this time
and that is para two is because of its
user interface it doesn't really lag and
Kali Linux as they really go to fix that
but again that's besides the point
sorry about that let's get started so
we're cloning a website I lost track of
what you are doing here so what we're
going to do is
to get started all we are going to do is
basically open up the terminal all right
so everything begins from the terminal
so just enter your route and I want you
to create a folder on your desktop or
wherever your working environment is
again this will work on any Linux distro
so what you want to do is create a
folder on your desktop and I've already
created one as you can see here it's
called cloned pretty cool so I'm just
going to browse to my desktop and the
and the folder before they created so as
you can see I've done that now to
basically get started cloning we're
going to be using a command called the W
get or the the we get command now most
or some of you may have already heard of
this command and maybe you don't know
but for those of you who don't know the
DW gate command is basically a very very
powerful and popular command and that is
used in the Linux terminal and it's used
to basically obtain or pull data from a
website or web server which is what
we're doing right now we're trying to
clone a website so how do we get started
well we could get started with VW gate
command just enter the W Gate command
and we can use the H which is help this
is always a good thing to do if you are
new to a command using the help command
will basically give you a good idea of
what the command the full power and
potential of the command and how it can
really help you so I really really
encourage you to look at VW get command
or if for example in any help command
for whatever you're trying to do or your
learning it'll really really give you a
lot of information and you can get a
better understanding of what each
parameter does so there's a lot of
parameters as you can see an options
here that you can choose but we're not
we've been we're basically trying to
clone a website so just follow what I do
and I will explain as we go so let's
just clear all of this and again to get
started with the W gate command and just
for what I do we are going to be is the
LK command
and now we're going to we basically have
to enter the URL of the website that we
want to clone so if we were to try and
find a simple website I don't want a
complex website because that will take
too long and that's just basically going
to waste my time we can try and
basically just open like this simple
webpage let's see is this a simple web
page looks like but I don't want a page
with downloads but let's try this all
right let's try help go to voltar com
let's try and clone this so after the MK
just paste in the URL with the HTTPS all
right or the HTTP depending on what
website you're trying to clone so just
hit enter make sure that you're in the
folder I'm in my clone folder where I'll
be storing all my cloned websites so
let's hit enter and it's going to get
started cloning it now again as I said
depending on the size of the website it
may take time and I hope this doesn't
take time I'm I'm really really hoping
this site isn't that big so it can
actually just complete and I can show
you that it does indeed respond or give
us all the resources linked to that
website so it's still trying to get
something right here but we can we can
check and see what it it's actually got
so you can say this is the folder here
help doctor Bunter calm and if we look
in here it's basically got the the index
dot HTML for those of you again who are
familiar with HTML and web development
it's called the LDS folder basically the
files being stored again in index dot
HTML and you basically get the idea so
you can basically now this is where the
magic comes in in terms of cloning and
ethical hacking or basically if we
cloned this site and we wanted to use it
for ethical hacking purposes how would
we go about it well let's say I wanted
to for instance I wanted to create a a
local server on my Wi-Fi network let's
say clone 3 Facebook page and I know
maybe I have a friend coming over with
his laptop and or his mobile device and
he wanted to log into Facebook right I
would basically spam
his IP with with that Weber with that
web address or did that web file and you
would basically enter his login and his
login details and it will redirect him
to the original Facebook page whilst I
get his credentials and you get the idea
can change whatever I want and you get
the idea basically hacked his Facebook
account so that's pretty pretty
interesting pretty powerful tool I
really really encourage you guys to to
go on and basically experiment of course
make sure that you keep your
experimentation within legal bounds
right please don't you know assure
yourselves into into illegal or
malicious intent but again this is all
for educational purposes I hope you guys
found value in this video again you have
any questions or you want to basically
have a discussion you can hit me up in
the comments section these are my social
networks you can basically send me a
message on facebook twitter if you want
if you want to basically keep up with
any of my latest updates within it you
can basically look at my Instagram if
you want they personalize its type of
 you you have a personalized type of
question you can hit me up on on my kik
and we can basically take it from there
otherwise guys thank you so much for

a fantastic day
