with another video and in this video I'm
gonna be showing you how to exploit WPA
or wpa2 alright now again this is
something that I realized was not on the
channel I did really have not focused on
cracking wireless networks and I was
thinking of starting off with WEP but I
then realize that WP e has become almost
obsolete after you know the arrival of
WPA and you'll rarely ever see a network
that uses WP e as their means of
security
she's an in this video I'm gonna be
showing you how to use aircrack-ng to
capture packets obviously to capture
packets and then to capture the WPA
handshake which then get which can then
be used with a word list to perform a
brute-force attack or a word list or a
dictionary attack and obviously to get
the the password now again I'm also
going to be using air gedan which again
is a fantastic tool or as I like to call
it a framework that makes penetration
testing or wireless penetration testing
a whole lot easier so we're going to be
looking at actually performing the pixie
dust attack with air get in using bully
alright but first I'm going to show you
how to use air crack how to capture
packets how to store them in a capture
file or a dot cap file not really a tour
pcap file but then i'm gonna also going
to be moving on to show you how to you
know select monitor mode how to select
your adapter and change it to monitor
mode and finally I'm going to show you
how to how to use aircrack-ng to crack
the password that being said let's get
started so for those of you don't know
let me just explain really quickly WPA
is essentially it stands for Wi-Fi
protected access and it is a security
protocol that was introduced in response
to the weaknesses that WEP had alright
so it's really improving upon a WPS
authentication and encryption features
and that's what I was talking about WP
II was was able to be cracked within
minutes it was unbelievable you know and
that's why they had to introduce a you
know another protocol that made networks
more secure and the WPA is is quite
secure but it's not
at the most secure and it is is quite
secure but it's not the most secure and
that's with the introduction of WPA 3
which is also something I'm gonna be
really really focusing on in the future
once the new routers are released which
are set to be later this year so I can't
I can't believe that it's finally out
and I'm really excited to get started
with it
that being said hopefully this video
acts as a final resolve to cracking our
WPA so it's essentially gonna cover
everything alright let's get started now
with aircrack-ng alright but before that
I just want to talk about I just want to
talk about your wireless adapter alright
so my wireless adapter is currently
connected right now if I go to VM and I
go into removable devices you can see
that I have my theorist USB device
connected and I just want to take a few
minutes to talk about wireless adapters
because this is something that people
get really really mistaken with you need
a good wireless adapter for Wi-Fi
penetration testing it's no secret and
it's the truth I don't know whether
you've tried performing a packet
injection with your white your laptop
Wi-Fi card but it just doesn't work and
the success rate is minimal you can
expect to crack a wireless network with
you know a small little you know a small
little tp-link or well I'm not saying
I'm actually using the tp-link but using
the the onboard Wi-Fi adapters that come
in laptops you know it's just not
possible now coming back to the correct
adapters to be using I looked at the
tp-link and the Alpha cards and in my
opinion the tp-link is the best one out
right now the tp-link a TL WN 722 n
version 1 because version 1 is the only
one that contains the atheros chipset
which again is awesome for packet
injection you can also try the alpha
ones but the alpha ones were also I
would say in my mind mediocre no not
that they are bad but they'll get the
job done the tp-link one is extremely
fast I was I've been using it for a
while now and it really does work
wonders that being said let's get
started alright so the first thing I'm
going to show you how to do is how to is
how to to actually enable monitor mode
or on your wireless adapter alright so
make sure it's connect
and I'm gonna type in iw config to show
us our wireless interfaces and my my
Wi-Fi that is already in monitor mode so
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna I'm
gonna disable monitor mode and you can
also do this by typing M on ng stop
LAN zero month that is the name of the
interface in monitor mode and I'm gonna
hit enter all right and it's going to
disable monitor mode so now let me show
you how to enable it so if I type in IW
config again you can now see that it's
not in monitor mode and you can see that
right over here
it's saying that the mode is managed now
for those of you who are wondering what
exactly does monitor mode mean you know
why do we need to even change it to
monitor mode
well monitor mode essentially means that
your wireless adapter will go into
promiscuous mode what does that mean
well it means that your wireless adapter
is now able to read packets that do not
belong to that computer alright so what
I mean what this means in essence or
simply means is it can read packets that
are being sent to any device that's
around this wireless adapter it doesn't
matter whether there's different
wireless networks doesn't matter how
many clients they are it's going to
capture all of that as long as it's
within the range all right so it's very
important that you enable monitor mode
because most of the attacks will require
monitor mode in fact monitor mode is
essential so to do this we use the
airmon-ng it is part of the aircrack
suite so M on ng and we hit start
alright remember you can also stop it if
you want and now I select the interface
name which is currently line zero wlan0
and I'm gonna hit enter alright and it's
going to change it for us so now if I
clear and type in iw config we can see
that the monitor mode is currently on
and you can look at that in mood which
is currently showing us monitor and the
frequency is 2.4 gigahertz now again
penetration testing on 5 gigahertz is
slightly slightly different and that
will require special hardware but also
get into that on the channel I really
won't focus on cracking wireless
networks as well because it is quite fun
so let me just clear this up now before
we move on I just want to point
something out
most of the other videos on YouTube
really just they have no meaning
whatsoever because they essentially
promising you that you can crack Wi-Fi
with any Wi-Fi adapter and that's not
the truth I can guarantee that to you
that being said I just want to I just
wanted to say that now we have enabled
monitor mode now we need to start
capturing data well we need to start
capturing data and packets from the
access points around us so we need to
start seeing what access points around
us and then we'll select the access
point that we want to crack or we want
to get the WPA handshake from ok and we
can do this using the arrow dump arrow
down ng so airodump-ng and now we select
the interface name which is in monitor
mode which is wlan0 month alright and
I'm gonna hit enter now this is going to
display the Wi-Fi networks that are
around the wireless adapter or around
you and I'm going to be blurring the
ones that aren't mine or if I capture
mind immediately then I'm gonna stick to
that so I'm gonna enter and I'm just
gonna hit control C like so and you can
let it run and it's gonna start
capturing the Wi-Fi networks that around
you by default this is the network that
I'm going to be performing the test on
as you can see it is my router it's it's
called Alexis broad link and let's start
off with what each of these sections
mean alright I'm gonna go just cover the
most important bits so let's start off
with the bssid this is the MAC address
of the router very very important this
in fact should be I you should actually
be copying this immediately the next
thing is the power which is essentially
the strength of the signal strength that
you currently have which is not that we
have 41 then of the beacons this is the
the beacons being sent quite
self-explanatory you then have the
channel of the Wi-Fi network again
something very important this is the
channel on which the wireless network is
running on you then have the encryption
type which is wpa2 you then have the
authentication which is PSK which stands
for pre shared key which means you know
the the security of the network is
determined by a pre shared key also
known as a Wi-Fi password and you have
the ESS ID which is the
of the network all right awesome so
Alexis you've told us how to find the
wireless networks around you remember I
can I stopped the scan as soon as I got
the one that I wanted because I do not
want to to start scanning devices are
you no other Wi-Fi networks and I really
don't want to go through the trouble of
blurring all of that out all right so
once you've you've captured or you've
actually spotted the network that you
want to perform the test on just hit
ctrl + C and it's going to stop now make
sure you have this data in place in
plain sight because you're going to need
it so what we're going to do now now we
need to start capturing packets that are
being sent to and from on this network
alright so now we need to focus on this
network so we need to select it so
essentially what we are doing now is we
are saying only focus on this MAC
address or this access point do not
focus on the other ones so it's going to
start scanning the network and it's
going to display all the it's gonna
start displaying all the clients
connected to that Network and I'll show
you that in a few seconds so we can do
that by typing aro dump airodump-ng
alright so airodump-ng and now it's
going to say we need to essentially
specify the bssid so you can say bssid
which is done by BSS IT and you want to
copy the bssid of the access point and
we're going to paste that in there and
now we need to select the channel which
you can do like so or you can just
abbreviate with AC but I like having it
as channel by the way you can use
channel and bssid where it doesn't
matter what comes first it'll still work
just the same alright so the channel is
Channel 2 so I'm going to specify the
channel is 2 now what else do you need
to specify well now you need to specify
the wireless access the wireless the
interface name which is LAN 0 Mon
alright and I'm gonna hit enter and now
as you can see it's gonna start
capturing data that is on that network
that is being sent on that network and
if I just open up my phone right now my
Nexus device you start seeing the MAC
address there we are this is my MAC
address of my Nexus so let me just open
up a website - here really quickly so
let me just open up a website here and
you start seeing that data is already
being
you can see the frames as I started
increasing there we are and the frames
will show you the amount of data being
sent or the amount of whether or not
that device is active this is very
important because to capture the WPA
handshake we need a device that is
active on the network otherwise it'll
take too long all right awesome so now
we are capturing the data but something
is missing you know this data is
important but it's of no use if we are
not saving it so how do we go about
saving you know this is where many
people make the mistake you cannot crack
or get the WPA handshake if you're not
saving the data you need to save the
data you need to save it well wherever
you choose to save it I'm going to save
it on my desktop and I'm going to show
you how to do that right now
so we only control-c to stop that and we
need to clear this out but before that
make sure you copy your PS s ID and the
channel because we're gonna need it
again except this time we're just gonna
save it or output the results to a file
all right let's clear this up and I'm
gonna change my working directory into
my desktop and there we are so now let
me just clear that up and we can get
started now all right we are going to be
saving the the the data that is being
that we're logging in to a file a
capture file or a dot cap file which
they can then be used which can then be
analyzed by tools like Wireshark but we
are really focused on using aircrack to
capture the WPA handshake and then crack
it okay so I know the video is getting a
bit long but I just want to cover
everything here excellent so now we're
gonna use airodump-ng same commands all
right whoops airodump-ng every dump ng
and we're gonna specify the bssid BSS ID
so i'm gonna paste the bssid that's the
router access point the access point MAC
address and we're going to select the
channel which was channel the channel
numbers too all right
and now we need to select the show ACK
all right you might be wondering what
the hell does that mean but this is just
going to show us the acknowledgement
packets if you have learnt about
networking you know that we have your
your acknowledgement packets so this is
going to show us the acknowledgement
packets and then we want to write we
want to write the output or the whatever
data is being captured to a file name so
we select a file name let's just call it
WP
a WPA results or actually let's just
call it log because we're logging the
data and then we need to select our
interface name
alright so EE lands zero Mon in in
monitor mode alright so let me explain
so a same airodump-ng I want you to
focus on this access point which we have
provided the bssid and the channel which
is which is the which is on channel 2 we
now want to show the acknowledgement
packets and we want to log all the data
into into this file called WPA lock and
it's going to automatically save it in
two different file formats the four file
format that we're interested in is the
lead capture form at alright and we'll
select it the interface that we want to
use so I'm gonna enter and it's gonna
start capturing it's gonna start
capturing all the data and is going to
be saving it into a capture file on my
our desktop as you can see right here so
if we look at the file you can see it
saved it in four formats we have a net
XML CSV format and a cap not capture
extension which essentially means it's a
captured Network or traffic so now as
you can see it's currently running and
it's still capturing data so you might
be asking should we actually stop it no
I want you to keep this running and what
we're going to do is I'm gonna open up
another terminal I'm gonna leave this
running here actually we're gonna leave
that running make sure you leave it
running because we need it to be
constantly capturing data and saving it
to this file okay so now we need to open
up a new terminal and now we need to
perform ad authentication attack you
might be a little bit confused and you
might be wondering what is AD of the
indication attack well this essentially
is an attack where we send the
authentication packets pretending to be
a client on the network to the access
point in in the hopes that we can get a
handshake from the access point remember
we're not actually connected to the
network so getting a handshake is very
important and the way we can do this is
by performing ad authentication attack
to one of the clients connected to the
network so again make sure you select a
client that is active on the network so
right now the most active client is this
one on the top but I want to use my
Nexus device because that's the most
accessible to me alright so this is the
MAC address of my of my Nexus device so
what you want to do
is you want to make sure you copy that
MAC address all right so just copy it
and now you want to go into the other
terminal instance make sure you don't
stop this one and you need to start and
drink these the following commands
alright so we're gonna use airplay ng
airplay alright so airplay and G total
it also belongs to the aircrack suite
airplay energy and now we need to select
zero which means we're using a do
authentication attack now we need to
specify the amount of the the
authentication packets we want to send
now if your wireless network or the
wireless network that you're trying to
get the WP engine and check is quite far
away from you then you want to increase
the amount of the authentication packets
you want to send so that there's minimal
packet loss and if there is packet loss
you're you're constantly sending so that
there's a higher chance of you getting
the WPA handshake so usually I would
specify if it's quite near you about 20
and your send occasion packets and then
now you need to select the access point
the access point MAC address which you
just specify which is right here so we
just hit ctrl C and we can paste that in
there and now you say you need to
specify the client MAC address so the
you just can just select a random client
on the network one that is sending more
data preferably so let's copy that and
we paste that in there and now we need
to essentially specify our interface
that we want to use which is LAN zero
Mon in interface in monitor mode and hit
enter alright now when I hit enter it's
gonna start sending the authentication
the authentication package to the router
which is essentially going to disconnect
the client that you've just selected
vMac and it's gonna disconnect it from
the network temporarily until all the D
authentication packets have been sent so
I'm gonna hit enter and as you can see
it's gonna start sending details
indication packets and once it's done
what what should happen here is as you
can see it started sending them and for
some reason well actually it should have
actually sent them by now and for some
reason we're getting an error here there
we are it's still running and still
sending and as you can see we have
captured the WPA handshake right here
and once we have this you can start
using aircrack-ng to crack it so I'll
show you how to do
that right now what you can do is once
the P authentication packets have been
sent as right here for some reason we
were experiencing packet loss so it said
quite a few more because there was
packet loss and there we are you can see
that it has sent the earth packet and
once that is done it will give you the
ability to capture the WPA handshake
while this is still running so it
captured the WPA handshake
in the dot capture file here ok now this
may seem a bit confusing but once we
have the WPA handshake we can now use
air crack to crack it alright but I'm
going to show you a better way of doing
it you can use aircrack-ng and you can
you'll be limited to using a brute-force
attack or a dictionary attack now I'll
show you how to do this with an awesome
framework in my mind and I'll show you
work with what it's called that
framework is called the air gaiden
framework alright so I will have the
link in the description you can find it
on github and the reason I like this is
because it keeps everything centralized
and I'll be showing you the great amount
of attacks that you can perform all
right so open the link in the
description it is the github repository
so just clone the repository I'm just
going to copy the URL right over here if
it doesn't copy just copied manually and
again I'm going to save this for my
desktop so you'll see the desktop
git clone I am gonna paste it in there
the URL and let it clone it's quite a
large file I would say so give it a few
seconds to copy again please pardon my
internet connection I know it isn't the
most favorable connection right now but
it shouldn't take too much time to get
all the files so let that complete
downloading and I know the video is
getting a bit long but as I said I want
to cover everything in this video ok so
let that complete downloading and
hopefully weird it isn't affecting
anything here I'm waiting waiting in the
meanwhile I can show you that you can
use aircrack-ng
to to actually crack e the file here so
what I'll do is I'll show you
aircrack-ng if you want to start
cracking the the WPA han-shan check
aircrack-ng you no need to specify the
the capture file which we used over here
so in order to do that we'll out have to
actually say CD desktop
and there we also say aircrack-ng crack
ng and I select the file which is WPA
log one capture and then I select whoops
got capture I select the word list file
which I'll use the rock you word list
which is in user share word lists and
the rock you dot txt dot GZ and probably
it will not work as I said as you can
see here it only went through it
essentially performed a dictionary
attack now this is what I was talking
about the chances of you cracking it
after have captured the ante because
again not enough data has been captured
you'll probably have to leave this
running for about a week that's what
people don't want to understand there is
no 5-minute hack well there is and I'll
be showing you that in a few seconds
that's why I'm actually downloading here
gedan will I'll explain why this you
have only captured one handshake and if
we kept the data running which means if
I would have kept here the terminal that
was capturing the data and we kept on
sending the authentication attacks and
we captured maybe maybe ten handshakes
then we could have actually performed
the brute force of the dictionary attack
but this is a very old way of doing it
and the chances of you cracking the
password are to be honest quite low I
would say you have about a 10% chance of
getting be at the expose point key okay
so we're just gonna close this up and
hopefully I get in has been downloaded
awesome so I list the files yeah we want
to go into air get it I get it
let me list the files in there there we
have the air garden executable which is
currently set to be not executable so we
have to change permissions so chmod plus
x and get in thought shell I'm gonna
list the files there and we're gonna
launch it so I get in and we're gonna
launch it there and it's going to open
up air get in now this is a fantastic
tool and I'm going to show you right now
how you can actually go about doing
stuff so I'm gonna enter to continue and
it's going to start checking for the
essential tools now don't worry if
you're missing a few tools like hash cat
or better cap well hash cat is very
important in the the event you want to
use GPU
backing which most of you have actually
recommended and I'll be actually going
through that you know using rainbow
tables I'm actually finding a Quadro GPU
which is the best one as they're more in
tune with with performing more
enterprise type GPU calculations so I
will be getting to that in another video
but for now just make sure that you have
the most important things like River and
bully all that good stuff installed you
have crunch at the gap but the gap is
not that important it's it's important
if you're performing an evil to an
attack that being said let's not waste
any time let me just hit enter and it's
going to check for a new version and if
it doesn't find one just hit enter to
continue and now it's gonna ask you to
select an interface to work with I'm
using Ethernet and mile and 0 Mon which
is already in monitor mode so I'm just
gonna select the second one and now the
awesome thing is here you can see it's
gonna give you a menu and it's gonna say
the interface is LAN zero one selected
Modi's monitor supported bands is 2.4
gigahertz and the great thing is you can
select another interface you can also
put the interface in monitor mode and
you can put it back into manage mode
this is the thing I love about it it
just makes everything a whole lot easier
now you can see the attack types that we
have here are very very enticing you
have your dos attacks menu which
essentially perform a denial of service
to a specific access point this is great
for you know trolling you can also
perform general service attacks to
devices on the network even if you're
not connected to them so you can see how
much damage this can cause and one of
the great things as I don't know whether
actually shared that video with you guys
but there was used using one Def Con
video or when I was watching one of the
DEF CON videos the guy was actually able
to just perform a denial of service to a
drone that he was not even connected to
so his neighbor actually used to really
bug him with the drone you know flying
around spying on people using you know
through their windows and that drone
actually had its own WPA network
connection between the drone and the
controller and obviously because he's
not connected to it he was able to
quickly scan it and then specify that
network and then the client being the
the remote controller was able to
perform the denial of service to the
controller which means that the drone
was no longer in his control and you can
they guess the amount of damage than
that can cause that being said let's
stop wasting time if you want to perform
your own handshake if you want to
capture your own handshake
this can also be done with air gaiden so
let's actually do that right now so
let's sit five and now it's gonna say
well the most important thing you're
doing to the right now is you need to
explore targets which means you need to
specify the network that you want to
capture the handshake on in this case
we're just gonna it for to start
exploring for targets and it's gonna say
WPI filter enabled in scan yeah just hit
ctrl C to stop so I'm gonna enter and
it's gonna start capturing the the
network and I'm gonna it ctrl C and it's
captured the network that we want to
target and this displays the information
much better if the OBS is the ID the
channel power encryption and these ESS
ID which is the most important
information all right so it's gonna say
only one target detected remember if you
have any other it's going to give you
the number so you can select it from
there and I'm going to continue so it's
selected Alexis broad link and it's
going to give you more information about
it up there now we need to capture the
handshake which is here so we can say
five to capture the handshake so let's
say five and I'm going to enter to
continue alright and now it's going to
ask us what type of the authentication
attack you want to perform I usually
like the deal with indication of the
attack that is done with airplay or you
can use this
there's the disassociation attack that
is performed by MDK three which is not
that effective to be honest especially
against newer routers so do syndication
airplay attack so I'm going to select
the second option and I'm gonna hit
enter and I'm going to continue and it's
gonna start performing the idea of
attack as you can see here there we are
the earth and you have to wait now until
the day of the indication package has
been sent and you were able to capture a
WPA handshake
alright so apparently we were not able
to capture a handshake and yeah we did
there we are we were able to capture
handshake so now it's going to ask you
did you get the handshake it's gonna say
look at the top right corner of the
capture window yes we were able to
capture handshake so I'm gonna it yes
congratulations take the path to store
the file or press ENTER to accept the
default proposal so it's gonna save it
in route handshake and it's gonna give
it its own name so goodnight
enter alright so the path is valid and
you have write permissions script can
can continue so you want to hit enter to
continue and now you can go on and clean
or optimize the handshake file which we
don't need to do right now because again
we have not captured a lot of data so
now we can finally go back to the main
menu and we can see we can look at the
offline wpa wpa2 decrypt menu which is
where we can perform the cracking so I'm
gonna x6 and now you can see if you have
hash cat installed you can use hash cat
too
well it's going to use your central
processing unit or your processor and if
you have a bad processor then it's going
to take a while but I'll be showing you
how to do it with hash cat if you want
that tutorial just comment down below
and I'll be sure to do it you then have
your non GPU attacks again aircrack-ng
is the best option here now what I would
recommend is that you go for the air
crack plus crunch this will perform a
brute force attack dictionary attacks
will only test the the current
combinations that exist within the
within the the word list or the password
list alright so I would recommend that
you go for option two which is air crack
+ crunch and this has about a 60% of
cracking the the key in my opinion now
again you might need to leave it on for
a few days and you some of you might
just think what the hell man that's way
too long and the truth is if you want to
crack a network that's how you do it
using the WPA handshake right so I'm
gonna it - and do you want to use this
already selected capture file so it's
gonna ask if you want to use the capture
file that was captured during this
session I'm gonna 80s and you already
have selected the bssid do you want to
and it is present in the capture file do
you want to use this base ID of course
we do what is the minimum length of the
key to decrypt all right so now it's
going to ask you to specify just in your
own opinion what you would expect the
minimum the minimum length of the key is
in my opinion I would say the minimum is
8 because not many Wi-Fi keys are Wi-Fi
routers are going to let you set a key
that is or a password that is below
eight characters all right so I'm gonna
hit eight and the maximum I would say no
one has a a Wi-Fi path so that is over
20 or actually 15 so I would I would go
about 15 and I'm gonna hit enter now the
most important thing because it's using
crunch to generate your own type of word
list dependent on what you would specify
now most people would usually go for
lowercase and numeric characters or a
combination of lowercase + uppercase and
numeric character characters in my
opinion I've set the password to be
quite easy which in you know involves
lowercase + numerical characters so I'm
gonna select option 6 you can go and
select whatever you want it's going to
just generate it automatically with
crunch someone at 6 and it's going to
start the decryption the decryption
process and as you can see the character
set that is going to be using this ABCD
the alphabet and your numerical
characters when it enter it's gonna
start generating the word list with
crunch and crunch will now generate and
the cracking process has begun so again
there you are it'll use aircrack-ng to
do it for you automatically with your
own word list this is the awesome the
best part about it is the word list can
be specified to account for the type of
characters you would expect in a in a
modern Wi-Fi password so again you can
see that this is gonna take yeah it's
gonna take a while so I would recommend
that you leave this on for about two
days in my opinion it takes about three
to four days for a Wi-Fi password that
has eight - about 15 characters again
not that complex if they're symbols then
it gets even more complex so you can let
this run and once you're done it will
give you the key if you're lucky I said
the chance of this working is 60% if you
have specified the right character set
if you specified a wrong character set
then it'll all go down the drain so I'm
just going to ctrl C and let it just end
don't worry if it gives you this weird
thing and it's gonna ask you
interruption detected you really want to
exit I'm going to yes and do you want to
preserve monitor mode yes I want to
preserve it I don't want to turn it off
all right so now let's look at the WPS
all right the WPS attack
this is one of the most effective
attacks and I'll explain why most people
who buy routers have the WPS feature
enabled and they do not disable it
what does WPS mean what does it mean WPS
essentially stands for Wi-Fi Protected
setup all right now you might be asking
how does this work you might have heard
of it what WPS has a WPS pin
all right the WPS pin well essentially
WPS only works for four wireless
networks that user password and what
this means is WPS essentially allows you
to connect using the WPS button on your
router and essentially deals with a key
or a pin all right so cracking the WPS
pin is essentially it's an eight digit
pin that even if your router does not
have a the access point does not have
the WPS a button you can still crack it
and that will crack the password for you
using an authentication attack alright
so usually people leave it on now the
great thing about a WPS pin is once you
crack it once you get that pin the
network is yours for life it's yours for
life that's because you can never ever
change the the DWS pin in older routers
in modern ones they've actually allowed
you to do it but most people would even
know that it was cracked using the WS
pin the D WPS pin all right so I'm going
to show you how to do that with air get
in so let's let's launch air get and
again alright and I'm going to hit enter
and let it start again and again and
know the video is getting quite long but
I just wanted to cover everything here
when it enter all right let me just scan
for the tools right continue we're gonna
check for a new version I know this is
the latest version for Nate continue
again and I'm gonna select my interface
which is already in monitor mode and
I'll go straight for the WPS attacks
menu remember you can also go for WEP if
you're using that type of encryption if
you're lucky to find a network that has
WEP crack it immediately that's a
once-in-a-lifetime experience if you
actually even find one
I remember once finding one at a
restaurant but I didn't have my laptop
with me so I had to pass on that all
right that being said you can go for
your WPS
tax menu which is eight and we're going
to be using bully the reason I'm using
bully is because River is not that it's
not that powerful as even if you're
performing the same type of attack which
is a pixie dust attack you can also use
bully for to perform what I would call a
brute force pin attack that if you have
a good word list that has some of the
most common some of the most common pins
the ws pins then that can also work as
well but in my mind this works the best
alright so we're gonna go for 27 which
is bully we're going to be performing a
pixie dust attack now before that we
have to actually select our our network
again remember we have to always select
our networks I'm gonna it option 4 and
it's gonna start capturing and
immediately once I capture it we should
be good so they really started capturing
and once it captures my Wi-Fi network
for some reason it's not capturing any
network here WPS networks let me just
see if my Wi-Fi if my access point is
currently open here is currently online
let me get back to you once I've checked
whether it's online alright so just give
me a few seconds here alright sorry
about that guys for some reason it was
just taking a while to load up and I was
just waiting for it here anyway sorry
let me let me just open up the emulator
here you can see that it has captured
that network and let me just explain the
results here I'll probably have to zoom
this in because the text is really
really small ok so it's using wash to to
scan for networks and this is the
network that we're going to be
performing he exploited on or it can be
cracking the ws the WPS pin you can see
that it is using WPS version 2 and if a
WPS is locked it's can also show you
here and if it's locked then you can't
use this attack alright so make sure
that it's not locked and you'll be
surprised I can actually guarantee you I
want you to try this out let's say when
you're at home I just want you to scan
the networks around you let's say there
are 10 networks probably your neighbors
I can guarantee you 5 of them can be
exploited with with the pixie dust
attack ok that being said let me just
open up let me just hit ctrl C because
once we are done capturing we just hit
ctrl C and we go back into air get in as
you can see only one target was detected
it is going to be auto select
I'm gonna continue and now we can
perform the bully pixie-dust attack some
I'm gonna hit a seven form the bully
picks it up slack I'm gonna enter you
have bully version 1.1 installed press
ENTER to continue
the bssid set be generally set now you
need to select the the value in seconds
for the pixie dust time mode if the
connection cannot be made by default
it'll tell you to use 30 seconds I also
recommend 30 seconds however if you're
further away from the access point I
would because of packet loss I would
recommend changing it to something about
100 or 200 that's if you're really
really far and you have you know really
poor signal strength I'm going to enter
and all the parameters are set and it's
gonna say - it's gonna say starting
attack when started press ctrl + E to
stop so I'm gonna hit enter to start it
and there we are gonna start the pixie
dust attack and there we are for some
reason it is it looks like it has got
thee it's got its captured a handshake
here and it's performing the pixie dust
attack with bully so let it just perform
and there you are the pin has been
cracked and the password has been
correct how about that I I think this is
the first video on YouTube that actually
has has actually shown that that it is
possible using different vectors for
example like the WPS with bully alright
so you can see it capture the WS pin it
captured the key the Wi-Fi key which as
you can see is Alexis 1 2 3 4 5 now
that's what most people do now again
most of you are sitting there saying
well that's a simple password but
remember it did not crack the posit it
was able to authenticate with the
network with the pin and then get the
the Wi-Fi key it got the bssid and the
SSID and there we are pin cracked
password cracked and there you go you
know that's how to actually perform or
exploit WPA using the handshake capture
method and how to use WPS pixie-dust
attack using bully you can also perform
River but River will most likely most
likely give you errors alright so once
I'm done let me just actually close this
up ctrl + C we can close the window and
we should be back in - in
again and once that's done you're
essentially done so that's gonna be it
for this video guys I know I took this
video bit too long but I just wanted to
show you every aspect of it and I'll
also be moving into using hash jet and
GPU cracking which is very very
effective especially when trying to cap
when trying to crack the handshake which
you can save and then crack it even if
you're not near the Wi-Fi network that
being said I hope you found value in
this video if you did please leave a

questions or suggestions let me know in
the comments section or you can hit me
up on my social networks you can also

latest hacking news resources tools all
that good stuff a chestplate calm and
I'll be seeing you in the next video
