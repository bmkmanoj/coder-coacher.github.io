with another video and in this video
we're gonna be looking at an awesome
tool that I'm sure will make your life a
whole lot easier alright so the web
penetration testing testing series is
continuing and ongoing don't worry about
that I just thought I'd throw in a video
here you know showcasing a really useful
tool that'll hopefully make your life
easier alright so in this video we're
gonna be looking at clone master alright
so let's get started with what clone
master is so if you open up the github
repository the link will be in the
description if you just read what it's
about as you can see clone master is a
Python script that was coded to make
your life easier
now you can easily choose your favorite
tools from github and install them on
your system with one click so again you
can see how awesome this is even better
you can ensure that you have the latest
version of your favorite tools another
way another great thing here is that
obviously gives you the ability to check
for updates for your tools so you don't
have to manually update them from github
and all of this and you can do more the
clone master
alright so you can see clear master was
mainly made for penetration testers and
bug hunters so again what whatever tools
you're going to be installing whether
they are a web application vulnerability
scanners are any tool from github it can
really easily be done from clone master
alright so let's get started I'm just
gonna clone the repository and we can
look at how to get this installed all
right so I'm gonna install it on my
desktop and we can just change in my
directory to my desktop here and I'm
gonna clone it and let's get started
with cloning it now that should take a
few seconds
sorry about my internet connection there
we are it's done let's change it into
the clone master oops there we are let
me list the files in there as you can
see we have some requirements that we
need to install so we're going to use
the pike the Python package manager or
the PIP so pip oops
oops install I install our requirements
dot txt and I'm gonna enter to install
all the requirements give that a few
seconds to load it there to load them
all up that shouldn't take for some
reason yeah there we are so the
requirements already satisfied so we
don't need to do anything else so let me
just clear that up and we can just
enlarge this and let me clear it again
sorry for that
let me list the files in there so now we
have the clone mastered Python file what
we need to do is we need to change
permissions so chmod A plus X and clone
monster clone monster-dog py lists that
and now we can start it up with Python
and clone master and once we started
there we are as you can see clone master
it started and credits go to the the
author the creator of this tool you can
check him out on github and now you
might be asking or how do we get started
well as you can see it it's sorted
really really well in terms of firstly
adding a tool using URL you can find a
tool on github you can reinstall your
tools you can update your tools you can
display your tools you can delete your
tools list export tools to HTML again
you know a great way of documentation
you can import your tools and you can
exit so let's say you want to find the
tool on github because adding a tool
using a URL is fine but we you know that
that can easily be done as we just did
but let's look at finding a tool on
github this will be really interesting
I'm going to find and let's see let's
find better cap right and I'm gonna hit
enter and let's see what I can find
better cap for us I found four pages how
many pages do you want me to display so
I'm gonna hit fourth and let's see what
we were able to get all right so by
default of what a lot of you know tools
here and I should have actually
specified it more but they go you have
your tool which is better cap right here
that's probably the one that we want to
to use so we've listed all the tools
currently here and the rest of the tools
have nothing that we need so let's look
at the tool number that we require which
is better cap
I will be making a video on medigap so
stay tuned for that so as you can see
here you have betta cap obviously the
first one is the correct one and we also
have here battery cap and author is
Wi-Fi analyzer so you know what let's
try the first one which is the tool
number one and I'm just gonna scroll all
the way to the bottom and when it one
and the new tool has been added and we
can enter em to return to the main page
so I'm gonna enter em to return to the
main page and now looking at updating
your tools this is also something
important that I wanted to look at so
I'm gonna eat you to update so let's see
let's update all the old tools of great
update and there we are better cap is
being updated that's the first one let's
see if it's able to it for us again we
are testing everything life so again I
haven't gone through this before
there we are all tools have been updated
I am to return to the main page alright
so that was updating now looking at
displaying our tools that's also very
important comment that comes in handy
and as you can see it's all showing us
the currently installed tools with clone
master that being only better cap and
again you can word install others as
well
so let's return back to the main page
and you can finally also delete your
tools list if you want to start over
again but that being said you can also
add a tool using URL as you can see you
can you can we can paste the URL that we
did which is clone master and if we
enter let's see if it is able to do that
there we are the new tool has been added
you want to add it no I don't and I'm
gonna am to return to the main page now
overall as you can see this is really
giving you a great way of organization
in terms of your tools now if you're
going to be installing a lot of these
scripts and tools you know I really
don't care about the specifics whether
they be you know really advanced tools
or they'd be script kiddie tools you
know irregardless of that the purpose of
this video is to really help you and to
show you that you know they are you know
good tools like this that can really
save you a lot of time
in terms of managing the tools that
you're going to be installing so if you
install a lot of tools this is a
fantastic
you know tool for you the link will be

and the credits go to the author I'm not
taking any credit for creating this
script kudos to the authors fantastic
