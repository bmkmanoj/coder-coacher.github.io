this video I'm basically going to be
explaining the different data types that
you'll find in Kirkland or in any other
programming language so that what I mean
by data types these are basically
attributes that you would give to a
variable describing the type of the
value that they're going to be storing
so in many of my previous videos in this
course you basically have seen data
types like int sorry about that in your
field string and you may have seen float
right you may have seen float well the
others that maybe may apply to whatever
things when we're going to go through
them and how they're basically used you
really don't need to know all of them
but you just need to know some of the
most important ones
so as I've said one of the most common
ones is the integer alright so basically
what the integer datatype is is
basically allows you to store an integer
this simple is that negative or positive
it allows you to store an integer I
think a 32-bit floating point integer so
you can basically perform the
calculation and find out how many how
high the value can go but as we did in
previous videos the variable integer
let's say we assign variable a is of
data type int a and the value is equal
to 20 all right so that's basically an
example of a variable you can also say
variable B of integer of data type
integer is equals to negative 10 allow
again it will allow both a negative or
positive integer value of a floating
point of 32 a 32-bit floating point all
right
you then have something like strength
right now string is basically a string
or a sequence of characters so it's for
example we can say variable name very
good example is because the variable
name string is equals to Alexis right
and this is basically are going to allow
you to store any collection of
characters in mode to basically make a
word or a sentence really so you can say
Alexis and you get the idea really so
string is pretty self-explanatory you
then have your float sorry now your
float will allow you again very similar
to the integer but will allow you a
32-bit point a floating-point sorry
32-bit floating point decimal allow you
to store decimal so basically how you do
go about declaring a flute datatype is
you'd say variable for example we can
say variable sum of flute sorry of
floating datatype is equals to 20 point
6 but you'll see we will get an error
and that's because when when using a
float you have to use an F at the end of
B value of the variable when using a
float just that's just to make sure that
it understands that this is a float
value so basically a decimal allows you
to store decimal values of up to 32 bit
point in terms of the floating points so
very very large value as you can
probably calculate you then have your
your character alright you have your
character let me just comment that and
your character is basically allows you
to store one character so for example I
can say variable character again a
variable character option let's say
we're creating a multiple-choice test
and we can the option we can say we're
using the datatype character and the
first and their choice that we are
giving this option is going to be when
when declaring the value of a character
it has to be in single quotes and you
can say a you can say B you can say see
all the way to Z whatever you want but
it can only be one character so I'm
gonna say a for an example and you get
the idea of where this can be used you
then you then basically have a boolean
for most of you who are familiar with
programming will already know this but
for those of you who don't know these
are basically the different data types
so boolean is simply a data type that
allow you to aid the store one two
values true or false so we can say
variable we get the option is going to
be option of a boolean boolean and we're
going to say option boolean oops
we actually use the name options we're
going to say variable variable let's see
test variable test boolean is equals to
we can say true for example all right
and if it's going to give you this error
that means you have to actually write it
in in this format right here all right
because this is not it's not a string or
a character it's basically a conditional
statement that saying it can either be
true or false all right you get the idea
so these are some of the most important
data types that will come across in
Cortland the rest of Dawn's that will
come across I will explain them as we go
along but I just wanted to clear this
out of the way so you guys may have a
basic understanding of how they are how
they work and what they actually store
so thank you so much for watching this
video against you have any questions
just let me know in the key section of
the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
