video now this is gonna be kind of an
update video and it's it's gonna be a
video explaining a lot of things I know
you guys are eager to know what's what's
going on with me and why I haven't been
uploading any videos so yeah this is
just gonna be a little bit of an update
video and thank you video because as you
all know I hit a thousand subscribers
this was my target that it took me
almost a year to reach it's been really
really difficult
um because of my limitations in terms of
hardware but I got everything sorted out
and I just want to say an amazing just
thank you all of my subscribers and
anyone who has ever watched my video
thank you for subscribing to this
channel thank you for watching my videos
thank you for commenting on my videos
it's really overwhelming feeling knowing
that almost a thousand people watch my
videos and actually want to watch my
videos that I make so honest a great
huge thank you and I also want to
apologize to you guys for not uploading
videos consistently and just being a
really really bad youtuber I know you
guys enjoy my content and I fail to
deliver but I have a very reasonable
explanation you see I've been basically
setting up my computer and getting
equipment for recording my videos so I
can make better quality videos and
during that process I've had to
obviously save money and I'm currently
I'm going to school and I'm working on a
lot of projects so there's really been
kind of a brick wall staring me in my
face but I've managed to break through
and I've actually got all the equipment
I need and I'm just grateful to say that
I can now make videos consistently and
in the best quality that I can so again
a huge thank you guys for watching my
videos I just it's it's unbelievable and
my next target is 10,000 subscribers now
I am gonna do a giveaway in April I'm
gonna be giving away Grand Theft Auto 5
so I'll let you know when that giveaway
is open and
I'll let you know the rules as well in a
future video so stay tuned for that um
that's a huge giveaway I wanna give you
guys and that's my way of saying thank
you for everything that you've done for
me again I apologize for my inconsistent
upload schedule and stuff like that
which is what I also want to explain
right now
so after reading you guys comments and
getting a lot of feedback from you guys
you want basically hacking videos now
that's perfectly normal
I love hacking and that's what I'm gonna
do I'm still gonna continue the hacking
cause I'm gonna be releasing videos
almost I'm gonna be listening for three
videos a week or even five videos a week
depending on how much time I have and
the basically the new content on this
channel is going to be focused around
Linux hacking and the Deep Web because a
lot of you have requested for Deep Web
videos so I'm gonna try and add that to
my to my schedule so the new schedule is
three to five videos a week I'm gonna be
uploading on Monday Wednesday Friday and
Saturday as I said if the Deep Web video
will most probably fall during the
weekend it'll be quite a lengthy video
it'll actually be a proper series where
I'll be exploring the Deep Web if you
guys have any video suggestions or any
other content you want me to to
basically make just let me know in the
comment section the other thing I want
you guys to do for me is just please
follow me on my social media on my
Instagram my Twitter and my facebook so
you can stay in touch with me and you
can actually send me questions if you
wanna send me questions hit me up on my
kick I'm always on my kick I will answer
your questions anything you wanna ask me
just hit me up on my kick or in my
social networks so that was basically
this video guys I'm sorry about the
background gameplay I pretty much suck
at Counter Strike go but yeah I hope it
hasn't been real bother for you
otherwise guys thank you for watching
this video new videos will be coming
straight after this one and have a
fantastic day and thank you so much for
the support you've given me
