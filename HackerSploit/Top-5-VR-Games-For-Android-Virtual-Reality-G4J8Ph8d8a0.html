we'll be talking about the top 5 virtual
reality games for Android so virtual
reality has been there for quite a while
now making its way into people's lands
with the oculus rift which is still in
development but it's set to release in
2016 and also the the emergence of the
PlayStation VR which is also a VR
headset for the PlayStation 4 so
PlayStation users will be able to get
their hands on to that in 2016 but there
has also been the emergence of Google
cardboard a cardboard made simple
virtual reality headset for Android
devices it does work with the iPhone
devices however the experience is not so
great but as I'm saying well it works
amazing with Android devices and after
that we have seen the emergence of other
virtual reality headsets made for the
Android platform and I managed to get my
hands on the Samsung Galaxy gear VR
innovator Edition which is for sale
right now for about two hundred dollars
and this is basically an advanced
headset made for Android and it's it's
functionality is the same it works with
all Android devices and allows you to
put your device into the headset and
experience virtual reality so I've been
using the headset for a week now and
I've got some pretty pretty good results
alright and and I've also tried a lot of
games and of course a crowd I'm come
across a few good ones but these are the
games were going to be talking to your
bar right now and they're a definite
must-have for anyone who has a virtual
reality headset so without further ado
let's get to this
so at number five comes VR rollercoaster
so this is one of the best rollercoaster
games I've found for Android and
rightfully so it has the perfect mix of
graphics and adrenaline to suit your
needs please do note that the app comes
in two versions the paid and the free
version all work perfectly except for
the fact that the free version has ads
so do keep that in mind and yeah enjoy
this app it's a fantastic virtual
rollercoaster app and I know you'll
enjoy
at number 4 we have insidious chapter 3
which is the popular horror movie
franchise and with the latest
installment coming in next year 2016
obviously if you're watching this in the
next year it will be released by then
but yep so this is the the preview or
the trailer in virtual reality and this
would be perfect for any oral oral of
ourselves or people like that who really
enjoy scary stuff I don't personally but
if you are into it go ahead it has
amazing sound and it's almost like it's
real so give it a try
cambia enjoy
and number three we have in mind VR
which is a futuristic set game in which
you have to travel into the mind of a
patient and see what's wrong with him
and it's a very interactive game where
you have to actually cure the dead or
the wounded neurons in the mind and yeah
that's pretty much it it's very simple
that has good graphics and the gameplay
is very soon
at number two we have one of my favorite
VR games and this is lost kismet this
game has the perfect balance between
graphics a gameplay and user interface
and it has the amazing story I won't
give any spoilers but yeah be sure to
download this app or game
and at number one we have one of the
best virtual vacations you can ever take
and that is perfect beach fear this is
the best game or app I've tried on
Android and it is absolutely amazing

beach and the best part is that you can
change from sunrise to sunset alright
