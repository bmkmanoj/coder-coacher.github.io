again with another video and welcome
back to Python for ethical hacking and
in this video we're going to be looking
at functions in Python so you might be
asking yourself what is a function and
really fundamentally when you break it
down in any programming languages
functions you are usually created to
help you sort out your code and to
organize your code by separating it into
into a specific block into a task
specific block so that each function or
each section of code is bundled into a
function that will then perform a unique
task or process etc etc so that's what a
function is
now you might be asking yourself well
how do we create and implement a
function in Python and it's really
really very simple now as I said it's
used mostly as an organizational means
of of organizing your code and structure
in your code so you definitely try and
use it for air for performing individual
tasks so the way to create a function is
simply to use the de f4 right that is
the syntax for it after the DF you want
to give your function a name so you can
call it anything and I'm just gonna call
it function as simple as that just to
keep it simple and use your brackets
right or your parentheses and then use a
colon and you hit enter so we are also
using indentation in functions as well
now you might be asking yourself why do
we intent and that's because anything
inside this indentation will essentially
be part of the function all right so
this anything below this is under the
function it will not be considered
anything else or part of any other
function so it will be very very similar
to other programming language anything
that falls inside the parentheses or the
curly brackets is part of that function
so we can then print out something like
we can say this function was just the
purpose of this function was to print
out this is a function as some something
as simple as that right and now if we
save this and run this you realize
something interesting happening if we
run it you're not gonna get any output
and you might be asking yourself why on
earth aren't we getting any output and
that is a very very good question and if
you have also learned programming you'll
know that you have to call the function
but the good thing is you don't have to
call it in a class there's no specific
syntax for calling a function in Python
all yeah all you need to do to call a
function is just to type it outside the
main function is to call it so we'll get
out of the indentation and as I said the
way to call it is to simply give it some
name and if you want to pass any values
you can pass them as well but in this
case we don't want to pass any values
because the function is already
performing a task in this case it's
printing out this is a function so to
call the function
just give the function name and use the
brackets remember do not use the colon
because we're just calling the function
alright so if we run this now you're
gonna see it's gonna show you this is a
function and that is pretty pretty cool
so we know that the function is working
and we know how to call functions all
right now let's look at more of a
practical example here alright and what
I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna use an
example of something like a currency
converter alright so what I'm gonna do
I'm just gonna close that up and we're
gonna create a currency converter so
we're gonna be converting US dollars
into these British sterling pounds so
let's do that right so let's do that
right now so I'm just gonna use a
function and I'm gonna call the function
converter all right function converter
now inside these parentheses is where
you declare your variables and I know
for those of you are experienced in
programming you already know that you
declare your variables in here that
you'll be using to call or you can be
using to pass values
so for now we need to declare a variable
and in this case we're going to be
declaring our variable that will be
storing the value of the of the US
dollar that we'll be converting into
British sterling pounds so I'm just
gonna call it USD all right and we're
going to use the colon and after that we
can then perform our own calculation so
I'm going to create a value a variable
called amount and I'm going to say
that's going to be equal to USD
multiplied by the rate the current rate
which is 0.76 I believe I'm not sure it
could have changed by the time you watch
this video so that's going to be the
current rate and then we can say print
all right amount whoops
like so and we can and that's basically
what this function is going to do it's
really really very simple we have
essentially created a function called
converter that we are going to pass a
value that's going to be stored in the
USD variable that is going to be used in
the function we then created an amount
variable that's going to be equal to the
value that will pass multiplied by the
current exchange rate of the British
Sterling pound and now we can actually
just exit out of the function and we
need to call the the function and pass
values to it so it's really very simple
all we have to do is hit converter and
in here is where we pass the value in
this case we'll be passing the value of
the US dollars that we want to convert
so let's say we wanted to convert $200
we just type in $200 there and if we
save this and run it's it's hopefully
going to calculate $200 in British
sterling pounds and as you can see one
hundred and fifty two dollars that is
pretty pretty cool and I believe my
calculator can do that for me let me
just open it up here just to make sure
that it is accurate so just let it load
up the current exchange rate we want to
look at
oops we're looking at the just give me
one second I should have had this ready
but anyway I don't know where I can find
this was going alright so the British
sterling pawned so 200 would be a
hundred and fifty 1.09 in this case it's
given us a hundred and fifty two which
means it's rounded off but again you can
see that it's working and you can change
the value to whatever you want so we
have created our first currency
converter it's really not impressive but
again it's really really fun creating
stuff like this and that's basically it
