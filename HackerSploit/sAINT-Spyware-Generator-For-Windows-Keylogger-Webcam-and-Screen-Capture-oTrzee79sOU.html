with another video and in this video so
looking at st. so you might be asking
yourself what is st. well st. is simply
put is a spyware generator for Windows
and it is coded or developed in Java
alright
so essentially what did the
functionality that it give is it gives
you the key log of functionality so
you'll be able to get keystrokes sent
back to your host email again I'll show
you how to do that right now
you can take screenshots of the the
target computer you can capture you know
images with the webcam you can also you
also have persistence all right so let's
get started with me showing you how to
get it installed or to configure it and
then we can create the malware or the
spyware for that matter and how to move
it to your operating system of choice
your test operating system again I do
want to throw out a bit of caution
because this can cause damage and I do
not want you to perform anything or to
use this in any way that may infringe
any any laws so please make sure to stay
on the right side alright so I already
have the link open up here it is a
github repository so the link will be in
the description as always and yeah you
can just clone it and we need to install
a few things before we can move on
alright so I already have it cloned here
but you can do that for yourself I
usually keep all my scripts that I'm not
really keen on or you know scripts that
I don't really trust in my optional
folder again it's a good way of
separating your experimental folders
from your you know the folders that you
can really hold as part of your system
so as you can see if I list it down here
I already have it here right here st. so
I'm gonna move into the directory you
have the same with you'll have the same
directory
alright so st. and if I list both inside
there's a few files you have inside now
the first thing you need to do is you
need to look at the dependencies that
you need to install and one of them is
the whoops
get that open right now one of them is
the Mazon libraries for the java jdk so
it's very important that you install
these Marvin dependencies as you can see
right here you need the Marvin and JDK
package installed so Marvin is
essentially a library for Java so make
sure you get that installed I already
have it installed the next thing you
need are the libraries that will allow
you to generate an executable file or a
jar file which is a lunchable Java file
alright and once you're done again will
tell you to clone the repository and
then you can move into the folder and
then you change the permissions for the
configured SH alright so we can do that
right now
so chmod oops chmod there we are plus X
and the configured as H right there we
are and once that's done you can then
hit configure that sh so we can do that
right now so configure oops not SH and I
can run you through what what's gonna
happen now all right so just give it a
few seconds to start up if you have
installed all the dependencies you
should be good and it should start up
right now okay so give it a few seconds
and what I have already so there we are
it's going to start configuring and
building all that is required right now
I already have my virtual machine here
my Windows virtual machine and I already
generated the spyware and I've you know
I've put it on my virtual machine but I
haven't run it yet alright so if I let
me just open the folder that contains
this so one more important thing is to
make sure that you your target operating
system has a Java version of Java JDK or
the Java Runtime environment version
eight installed that is very very
important and again it should be the
appropriate version according to the
process and operating system
architecture 32-bit or 64-bit so once
that's installed let's just go back to
the lead generation here alright so as
you can see it's still building the
files that we require here and just give
it a few seconds again it shouldn't take
too much time before we can actually get
it running and we can generate our
spyware all right so what it's doing
right now is it's building all the files
required and again it shouldn't take too
much time it's really really fast
so yeah give it a few seconds and as all
saying make sure you have Java JDK on
your target operating system and it's
going to generate two types of files all
right so this spyware will generate two
types of files it will generate a
executable version and the Java the jar
application which is again it's up to
you on what you feel is more appropriate
to install because again when it comes
down to client side attacks it's more
about social engineering all right so
let me just close up my virtual machine
right here and let's let's look at the
process that we have here and whether or
not we can speed it up again it
shouldn't take too much time just these
few just has to compile a few stuff here
and build the required libraries and the
plugins alright so again just let it
complete and it should bring up the
interface which is a command-line
interface there we are
alright so let's list the files again
and directly here you can look inside
the folder and once you've configured it
we can get started right so you might be
asking yourself how do you get started
well we are as I said you need to have
Java installed and that is on the
operating system in which you're
creating these spyware so Java we
essentially launching this right here
right so again if you want any help you
can check the repository and I'll give
you instructions so Java jar right so
let's Java jar st. oops
oh my bad right so st. doe jar and we
launch that and as you can see it's
gonna say the software is provided as is
without warranty of any kind you may use
this software at your own risk
the users complete their use of this is
completely you hold completely
responsibility so again I'm just passing
off the disclaimer all right so once
you're ready to go just hit enter and
it's going to ask you for your Gmail all
right now this is a very important thing
you need to create an a gmail account
where it will send the results now I do
not recommend that you use your personal
email Gigi mail address if you do that
well I think you should just leave the
video right now if you really are
thinking of doing that so I already
created my email I have already
generated the spyware so obvious
run you through how you would do it all
right so you would enter your email so
let's say test at gmail.com again this
is not my my real email that I used so
test at gmail.com enter your password it
could be you know soaps oops all right
my bad I think I actually just caused a
bit of an overflow there so let me run
that again so test at gmail.com all
right and again say you know something
really simple in integer password and
then here the options come do you want
to enable the screen shot functionality
which means it'll take a screen shot
every few seconds and it'll send it to
the email yes that is very very handy
the auto enable webcam now again this is
not work on virtual machines which is I
just wanted to get out of the way but on
a real host machine if the the target
does have a webcam yes it could be
helpful yes do you want to enable
persistence yes we do do you want to
keep the data on the computer again
something very very important here the
thing with this spyware generator is
it's going to keep the the files that
it's generating oils or the key logged
your data it's going to all store it on
the computer if you want it to so
usually it will store it in the app data
folder where you can find all the files
again it depends on your target if your
target is a tech stack savvy user and
knows what's going on in his or her
system it might be a good idea to say no
or you can just hit yes and once that
you 80s it's gonna ask you enter the
number of characters to send the email
to all right now what this means is the
amount of characters you want your key
logger to to grab before it sends an
email so you could enter something like
if you wanted to grab a lot you can say
something like 20 that's an appropriate
amount because you can grab 20 key logs
or keystrokes and then it will send all
the files to the email alright so once
you're done just hit enter and I don't
want to create one because I already
have so I'm not gonna hit enter so yeah
once you once you're done you just have
to check if the information is correct
if it is just hit yes and you don't
generate it for you and it will store it
what will do it will store it for you
let me list the files again it will
store it in your target all right so in
your target folder right so if we list
the files right here as you can see I
already copied the file from there the
exe it's gonna generate a saint a 1.0
jar with dependencies dot jar or dot
executable all right so I already copy
that to the virtual machine and again
make sure your virtual machine or your
target operating system is running Java
or has a any version of Java 8 available
whether it's the development kit or the
runtime environment all right so once
you're done just hit this right here
just open up the executable will not
give you any graphical user interface
it'll just start up and as I was saying
you actually have the ability to check
the files as you can see here so it's it
is in the app data folder that that is
where the files are going to be stored
if you chose that option so let's open
that right now and you want to go to
local or actually roaming that is where
it stores it most of the time there we
are so as you can see the generated or
folders st. and what we can do now is
let's just open up let's type some stuff
in here so I apologize if my virtual
machine is a bit slow so what we can do
is we can just try and open up a notepad
here if that lets us open it I don't
want this to freeze anytime soon I'm
because I'm actually running this in
quite a low resource virtualized
environment so what we can do is yeah or
we can just type in some random searches
here so we ran up data let's see we're
and a few commands there so I'll open
this in a second but first I just want
to saw log interested in that let's just
type some weird stuff like email you
know what a normal person would be
typing in or would be typing in some
documents and yeah you can just enter as
many keys as you want and now let's
check the email the email that I used
and as you can see yes it has sent us
stuff here so let's look what it's sent
now these ones are from yesterday when I
was testing this and these two are the
latest ones all right and I'll show you
that it does send all the files so let's
look at the latest one all right so the
latest one it does send it with the D
logged keystrokes as
can see we entered email we hit control
email backspace notepad and it didn't
launch the notepad how sad about that so
let's look at the screenshots there we
are as you can see it took a perfect
screenshot amazing you know really
really powerful let's look at the next
the next one is the webcam but again it
could not take a picture of the webcam
because of disable webcam functionality
on my virtual machine and on my main
operating system right now and then it
gives you the text document which is
your key logged or your keystroke
characters so if you open that as you
can see backspace backspace backspace
pardon me
notepad control email so all that I
typed is gonna be sent
alright then as you can see it's gonna
keep on sending it as the as time goes
by so it's just gonna keep on flooding
in so awesome you know it's almost like
real time you know it's like a real-time
remote access tool or a rat all right so
if we look on the updater folder you can
see that yeah it does store it in the
cam but again nothing is gonna open here
because I've disabled my webcam then of
your logs which is your key logger or
your key lock strokes you can have your
screenshots which are going to be saved
in intervals as you can see right here
right so you have that which is the
latest one and if you just open that up
right now
hopefully windows you know doesn't let
me down opening an image can't be that
difficult right so yeah there we are as
you can see you can see all the
screenshots taken and now this is this
is very important because as I was
saying if you want to keep your files on
the only host computer again it's really
up to you and you can experiment with
what you like but the real trick is
using social engineering so yeah that's
how to use st. and how to use it
correctly so again if we take a look as
you can see it's sending all the key log
keystrokes that have entered and
everything is just generating and
sending to me real-time as you can see
there's an image of what we just opened
fantastic fact so in the do know that
it's working now if you're running this
on your virtual machine like I am and
you're wondering how the hell do we stop
this well it's really very simple and
this is again maybe one of the
disadvantages of this piece of spyware
is it you
you can actually disable it really easy
easily or you can actually find it
really easily if you just open up your
task manager if you're on Windows the
default task manager that it comes with
that Windows does come with all right so
what I'm gonna do is I've just opened it
up and you will see that the Java
platform se library will be open and
that's essentially what the the applet
is running on and if you disable this it
will immediately stop it right so it's
taking a fair bit of memory as you can
see it's taking about 46 megabytes
again it's not the best optimized piece
of pie we have seen but it's it's really
good for beginners you know to
understand how this really works so yeah
guys that's it for this video I hope you
found value in this video if you did
please leave a like down below if you
have any questions or suggestions let me
know in the comments section or you can
