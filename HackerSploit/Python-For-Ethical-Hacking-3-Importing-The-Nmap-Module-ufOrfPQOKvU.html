with another video and in this video
we're going to continue with our Python
for ethical hacking series and in this
video we're actually going to be
importing porting a module into our
Python program and we're gonna see how
they work in conjunction with each other
so we're gonna be importing the nmap
module because i think everyone is
familiar with the nmap module and will
just give us a bit of information on how
to use a module you know in in relation
to your program so let's get started now
as i said we are going to be using the
nmap module again to install any module
it's really very simple
all you have to do is go to the p i py
website where the all the packages and
modules are to download or to check
which one you want and then obviously
you can download it directly and extract
it and install it or you can use the PIP
function alright so we're going to be
using the PIP function and obviously the
browser option or doing it through the
download method so let's start off with
the terminal version where we install it
using the PIP command so I'm just going
to open up a new terminal here let me
just zoom in like so alright so let me
enter my route and see the desktop okay
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
install pip install install and we're
going to install the Python the Python I
believe it's the Python nmap module okay
so this is basically nmap the the nmap
python module so once we hit enter it's
gonna start downloading hopefully if
that's the correct name of the module
I'm not sure I haven't actually seen it
for a while so just give it a few
seconds it should take too much time
alright there we are so that is the
correct one so it's going to download
the Python Enma and it's going to say
successfully installed Python and map
zero point six point one okay so if you
through the web through the website all
you have to do is just open up your
browser and be i py I'm going to go to
the Python package index and just give
it a few seconds
I just want to search here I don't know
whether it will and map I don't know
what they'll actually give me the reply
or the results that I'm looking for what
I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna search
the page you know I'm just gonna hit
nmap let me just mmm Python and map and
map there we are so that's the one right
here so just hit Python and map and
you'll find it I actually should have
seen that sorry about that so python and
map just click on it and you can just
download the tar file okay so we can
just save it and a lot of you guys had
commented that I should have just
extracted it through the file explorer
so I'm gonna do that now I'm gonna hit
extract here and we're going to open
another terminal here and let me just
open and this up and zoom in okay so now
we can list all the files in there so we
want to get into the folder we just
extracted to install little life means
to install the nmap module this way so
change directory we are going to do it
through Python and map like so and let's
see what's in here we have another
folder alright so change directory
python let's see what we have in here
alright there we are
so we have the we have all the files you
have the setup so we want to actually
install it if this is the method or the
way you want to install it so all you
have to do is we use the Python
obviously cuz it's a Python file setup
dot py and we want to say install all
right that's another good command that
you should know you use install when you
actually want to install it
am I getting an error writing user local
distributed yeah okay
that's because I'm not rude sorry about
that like so and what I'm gonna do now
is I have to do it again
Python let me just clear the terminal
it's getting a bit crowded so Python
setup dot P Y dot py just bear with me
I'm trying to remember the exact name of
the file so it's installed since we're
installing it and there we are so it's
gonna install and it's done now we have
the nmap module for Python installed and
let's see how we can incorporate it into
our package or into our project so let
me just minimize all of that and open up
PI jar and we're gonna create a new
python file so new python file and we're
gonna name it and map underscore test
all right something like so and there we
are so now we can actually I can
actually show you how to how to
incorporate the nmap module with your
Python program or your python script now
I'm not gonna be explaining anything
about Python or the syntax in this video
but I'm just going to show you that that
indeed they do work and you could
incorporate this with other scripts that
you find alright so we have to first
import and nmap alright so there we are
it's gonna tell you it's going to give
you some intelligence and it's going to
show you the exact directory way it was
installed so user local libraries Python
2.7 like so just hit on that and nmap is
imported so now we can actually just
what we can do is we can just create a
variable so nmap 1 oops and my point is
equals to and map dot port scanner if i
remember the correct syntax port scanner
the area and my port scanner like so so
we have no two variables
okay so now we have initialized the
variable there and that's equal to in my
block port scanners who were actually
getting the port scanner
okay so we've initialized that now we're
going to create another variable let's
just call it let's just call it a is
equal to n map 1 the variable n map 1
dot n map and let's say we wanted to
print out the N map version that's
something that we can get a mock version
and yeah that's basically good enough to
test that it does work so what I'm going
to say now is I'm going to say print and
I'm going to say print whoops print a ok
like so and now if we just save this I
think it saved on my desktop from
mistaken there we are so now we can just
run this through the terminal so and we
can save Python and map test dot P Y
oops dot P Y and as you can see it's
going to display the N map version now
if you think that this is somewhat
displayed incorrectly you can actually
just run the n map /v comments to
verbose and it's gonna show you n map
version seven point six zero so it shows
you in a very neat way probably and yeah
that's basically how to implement a
module or to import a module into your
Python program now I know this seems
quite simple and you might not some of
you who are just getting started might
not understand what I've done here but I
just wanted to show you how these things
relate with each other and in the next
video we're actually gonna get started
with the basics of n map from variables
and we're going to be working hand in
hand with what we are doing right now so
it all makes sense in a few videos
anyway that's it for this video guys I
hope you found value in this video if
you did please leave a like down below
if you have any questions you can eat me
up in the comment section on my social
media if you have any questions hit me
up on kik
if you want to have a discussion there
is a discord server the link will be in
the description if you want to get the
latest hacking news and resources check
out my website the link will also be in
the description and I'll be seeing you
in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
