with another video and I apologize for
the lack of uploads I was just
completing the web penetration testing
series and I had some work that I needed
to get done so I'll be uploading those
promptly but now I really wanted to show
you guys probably one of the most
important tools that you should be
familiar with and you should be able to
use and that is Hydra alright so for
those of you have never heard of hydra
hydra is essentially a very very good
password brute-forcing or a password
cracker for that matter so it allows you
to crack you know online logins etc etc
now in this case what we're going to be
focusing on is how to attack SSH or how
to actually brute force using a
dictionary attack we are going to brute
force the SSH port all right now you
might be asking yourself well why is
this such a viable thing well the truth
is if you're looking at this from a
blackhat perspective let's say you have
access you know you have access to a
network an organization's network and
now you want to gain access to a
computer well SSH might be a very very
good attack vector that could obviously
give you you know a large amount of
access or could give you access to a a
senior or you know systems administrator
or something or like that for example a
router etc etcetera and obviously from
then your no escalating your privileges
even further so again you can target
really really important things you know
in an organization for example you can
target the router you can target the
systems administrator you can target you
know probably one of the one of the most
important posts computers you know for
example the the CTOs a computer etcetera
etcetera all right now in this case
again I'm going to be stepping out of
using net exploitable now in this case
I'm just going to be using a in standard
Ubuntu I'm just going to be using an
open to operating system here that is
again connected to my local network and
this will offer us a fantastic
understanding of how to use Hydra
to perform an attack now when I said
we're gonna be using Hydra we obviously
gonna get started with using X Hydra now
if you have not heard about exciter
don't worry it's essentially the
graphical user interface for for Hydra
and you might be asking yourself well
why exactly are we using X Hydra and not
Hydra well I'll show you exactly why all
right so the first thing we need to do
you know following the the standard
steps is we need to identify the the
targets we need to identify what ports
are open on the target so for that will
just perform our basic nmap scan you
know we'll just scan for the for these
simple ports the IP address for my
target is 192.168.1.1 wait now if you
don't know your targets IP address you
can just perform a an nmap scan as well
on the entire subnet and you'll get the
IP address that way or you can use net
Discoverer depending on what you what
you like all right so I'm just gonna hit
enter and as you can see the only open
is the SSH port and by default I created
a new user with with its own password
the admin user with its own person or by
default of course you'll not be knowing
the username and the password so we are
going to be using word lists are to
perform a dictionary attack if you
perform a brute-force attack it becomes
too long because you know some word
lists have about you know like for
example if you use the rocky word list
it could have in in them in the minimum
of 12 million different combinations and
that that's gonna take like a week now
you can see why this is getting really
really tedious is because if it's gonna
take a week and you're on the network
meaning you're actually inside the
organization probably have not connected
through it externally but you know you
you're on the network you need to you
need to get something really really fast
now again we're going to be targeting
default usernames and passwords but
again it can be different depending on
these security protocols set up by the
company or the organization so you can
use the default a word list that's come
with Kali Linux which are extremely
powerful that can be found in CD sorry
not CD command share change directory
user
and I believe they're in word-lists
there we are so if you list the the word
list in here you can see you have the
rock you you have the phone Wi-Fi which
is again set up by the phone Wi-Fi
cracker the first crack the fast-track
sorry dot txt and these are some that
you can just experiment with and they
are fantastic as well all right but in
our case what I've done is I've just
created my own word lists here they
sorted out in usernames and passwords
because if you if you know the username
then you're halfway there all you need
to do is brute force the password but in
this case I'm just gonna create a
usernames and passwords again it's a
simple one with in open with you know
possible ones and the passwords as you
can see the actual password for the SSH
is Alexis one two three four I've just
kept it as basic as that you know so
that I can save time and I don't have to
you know go through the cracking process
which can take up to a week and then or
you know a few hours depending on the
complexity and where it lies on the word
list or in the word list okay so again
I'm just going to be explaining how
everything works here and how it's done
excellent let's get started now so we
know that the the port 22 which is the
SSH port is currently open you remember
it's very important that it is open all
if it's not open then you know many
people have tried to tell me that they
are trying to attack a target but when
you look closely you can see that the
that specific port is closed so that
means it won't really work so again make
sure that the port is open so once
you're ready what you want to do is we
just want to just type in X Hydra X
Hydra like so and once you type in X
Hydra it's going to open up the
graphical user interface and let me
expand that alright so now we want to
select our target right so it sorted out
in target passwords tuning specific and
start will get to all of that so our
target is essentially a our tau if
you're targeting a single target you can
enter the IP address here whether it's a
global or I mean a public or local IP
address or you can select your target
from a target list alright so we're just
going to select a single target and
we're going to select the the IP address
point one point one over eight and again
if you're using ipv6 you can also
specify that
as for the port we know that the default
port for SSH is port 22
it could be incorrectly in it could be
incorrectly configured so you can also
watch out for that you then have your
protocol in this case we want to scroll
all the way down to the SSH so again you
can look at how to use Hydra for that
type of other types of cracking but for
now just a lower less focus on the SSH
because one of the most popular ways of
being crack now for the output options
this is very very simple you have your
be verbose so it's going to give us
additional information and show the
attempts very very important now why am
I using exciter and not Hydra the reason
is if you want to learn if you want to
learn how to use Hydra or any other tool
I would recommend of especially Hydra in
this case you can see that it gives you
these syntax that is being used right
under here and from then on you can then
try it on your own with the command-line
alright so again it's gonna just list
down to you here how you would go about
typing this how do you you would go
about using Hydra in the command line
alright so those are the options were
selecting there now let's go to password
so again you can select a default
username if you know the username or you
can select the username list which is
what I'm gonna do which is stored on my
desktop and usernames dot txt and we
open that now again I've said this word
list already contains the username so
it's not gonna be a long cracking
process I'm just explaining the theory
here behind what's going on again I
don't want to go through the entire
cracking process because that would be
pointless and you're wasting computation
power alright so as for your password
again you can select the password if you
know it well if you know the password
then it really doesn't make sense unless
you want to know the username which is
again very a very viable option so let's
select your password list or your
password and you want to go to I'm gonna
go to my desktop and I'm going to select
password or txt and you can also
generate your own password that's an
advanced feature will not be looking at
that right now as for the option of
options you can try login as password
this essentially means you can try the
default so if it was incorrectly
configured and the systems administrator
or the network administrator was really
well he wasn't really keen on security
you can try an empty password with
most times believe me I've tried this
and it's actually just shocking
especially for smaller companies that
don't really have the budget to do you
know to do to hire serious security guys
and stuff like that but irregardless of
that what we want to move on now do is
the beginning now tuning why is this so
important well we talk about number of
tasks what this means is these are going
to be the number of login attempts being
made now as again and said if these
security protocols in place are very
very high and you're trained you know
you're trying to attack a company that
has their security at the top at the top
notch level you want to reduce this to
about five because again what will
happen is if you you know most companies
usually have the protocols of if you
enter five passwords incorrectly it logs
you out and it locks SSH for about five
minutes so again I would recommend that
you keep it at about five and for your
time out we can just change that to
something really nominal which is 10
seconds to timeout so again you want to
make sure you select exit after first
after first found pair global so again
you don't want to make sure that your
key you keep on looping around all right
moving back to the passwords sorry what
am I saying
not the passwords going back here exit
after the first form pair so this will
essentially mean that it once it gets
the password and the username and a
password pair it stops the brute-force
method now again you can also use you
can use the your HTTP and HTTPS are
proxies here which is again something
advanced but right now we're not using
any proxies but again it might be useful
if you're using a proxy going on to
these specific settings we don't have to
change anything here this usually come
in handy when you're targeting you know
telnet or FTP etc etc and now once
you're ready just hit start and you want
to go into this bottom button here and
you just want to it start all right and
it's going to start and immediately as
you can see it got the the login as
admin and the password as Alexis
one-two-three-four now again this took a
really really short time probably
because the word list is so small now if
you talk about a huge word list like the
rocky word list that contains 14 million
different
patience so you can imagine how long
that will take so again a good good
sense of information gathering really
works here if you can get the usernames
of the computer or off your target that
will be excellent as well and you can
also try the default usernames because
as I said most of these smaller
companies do not I do not actually care
about security if I can say that all
right so now we've got the username and
the password now let's try and log in
via SSH so I'm just going to open up a
terminal here and I'm going to say SSH
I'm gonna select the username which is
admin at 192 point 168 point 1 point 1
or 8 and once I hit enter it's gonna ask
me for the password which in this case
is Alexis 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 sorry oops
and once a tenth it should lock me in oh
whoops something's happening here I'm
not there we are alright so you are
successfully logged in and that is how
to target SSH and how to use Hydra for
password cracking as you can see it's
really an efficient tool when it comes
down to what it does best which is
password cracking you know more
specifically really extremely difficult
protocols you know things like FTP which
can be extremely useful if you see the
use case but directly from here you can
see that we have got access and you know
you can imagine the damage you can do if
you get access to a targets computer or
you get access to the systems
administrator computer you can wreak you
you can really really damage stuff on
the network but again I'm not
encouraging that this was just a video
of me showing you how to use Hydra you
know to understand the cracking process
and finally using Hydra is is always
something that comes in handy especially
when you'll be performing penetration
tests if you're looking at at being a
penetration tester alright so that's
going to be it for this video don't
worry in the next video we'll be moving
on back to web application penetration
testing I've made all of the videos now
so I'll just be uploading them daily and
yeah thank you so much for the support
guys we are almost at 50,000 subscribers
as of uploading this video I really
appreciate the support and have awesome
things planned for you and I'm also
planning a giveaway so stay tuned for
that I love you all thank you for the
support it's been
unbelievable and you know I I couldn't
ask for more thank you this is all this
