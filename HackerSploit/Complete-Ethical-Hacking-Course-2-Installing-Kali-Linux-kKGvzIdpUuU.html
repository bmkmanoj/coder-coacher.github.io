with the second video in the ethical
hacking course which will take you from
beginner to advanced users or ethical
hackers so in this video as I mentioned
in the earlier video I'm going to be
talking about setting up your hacking
environment so this is actually a to do
with just setting up your environment so
it good to start hacking so we're going
to be using Kali Linux has been
primarily OS because they had a lot of
tools and features that are just
mandatory for hacking so apart from that
we are going to use VirtualBox for
operating system virtualization which
means that we're going to be running
Kali Linux virtually on our Windows or
Mac operating system or primary PC if
that's what you guys are running so this
should work on even Linux so yeah the
reason I'm saying we're going to learn
this on VirtualBox is just because it's
much better for my for me personally so
I can actually record the videos and
show you I would recommend you install
it on any of your computers using that
for acting but either way you can learn
hacking perfectly via this method of
running it virtually so the first thing
we're going to do is we have to install
a software called
VirtualBox so just open your browser and
Google VirtualBox
and there you are just click on the
first first or second link and then
click on VirtualBox virtual boxes this
is a virtualizer for Windows or Mac
Linux that allows you to run a operating
system within an operating system so
there are going to download you know the
reason I'm using VirtualBox is it's very
very easy to set up and now recommend
this for beginners so area our
VirtualBox by name so we are go to about
5.1.1 for black go back please let's
basically be set up and you have Windows
or Mac OS X and Linux distribution than
Solaris so this can learn on any of the
operating systems that you currently run
I'm not in Windows and body
so this tutorial I'm going to use this
as my example when I open up in a new
tab Angela start downloading it's about
118 megabytes so we have just let that
download I already have it installed but
it set up it's pretty simple want to
change it downloading just run through
the setup and the state Next Next and
you know the pretty standard stuff
alright so once you have that installed
we'll give you this icon here or
alternatively you could search for it
here they also they are but on my own
videos my icon here and just start it up
and do note that when you start there
for the first time you're not going to
have any of these here these are my
virtual machines that are just created
my virtual operating systems but I'm
going to show you how to set it up with
Kali Linux so just make sure it's up and
running and now we want to go into
Google let's just go into Google again
and you want to hit Kali Linux Charlie
Lux and you know open the first link and
there you are going to download and here
you are you have your time the next
download now depending on the operating
system or the M in your processor
architecture you are learning 54 bit or
32 bit with your processor is a 32 bit
to make sure download the 32-bit ISO
which you can download directly or using
a torrent client if that's your thing
you can have your 64 bit which is
currently for 64-bit processes so
whatever you have is point so what I'm
going to do now once you've downloaded
it just make sure you hit director for
and whatever when you face your
downloading you want to go back into
virtual box and you wanna hitting you
alright so I'm telling you giving your
option of creating a new virtual machine
so we're going to give it a name let's
call it sorry
acting this is called our jelly
which the hacking box or the type is
Linux and the version is yeah the latest
version 2.6 three four two point six
three and four this is the Linux kernel
again make sure you select your the
appropriate one according to your
processor architecture I have a 64-bit
so that's what I'm gonna use next now
this is your memory file how much RAM
you want to dedicate to Kali Linux now
if you're running a 4 gigabyte machine
or computer I would recommend just
leaving this where it is or you would
give it about two key program that's
what I would recommend so an acrylic
design is about 212 in the 48 megabytes
that's 2 gigs of RAM which is perfectly
fine to Kali Linux and whatever we're
going to be doing alternatively if you
have more than you could increase that
but I really don't see the need to hit
next and create a virtual hard disk now
make sure that is the option as we're
gonna install Kali Linux so here we are
this is basically where you want to be
Kali looks to be installed we're going
to create a virtual hard drive we're
going to create it and make sure it's
the virtual VirtualBox disk image not a
virtual hard drive I'll explain that
later hit next and you want to give it a
dynamically allocated just basically as
it increases as we need it so hit next
and here in a way to get specify where
you want to save me or virtual virtual
hard drive I'm going to save mine
I'm going to save mine on the desktop
for this for this tutorial
it's going to save it there you can save
it anywhere and then what I recommend as
you storage space with about 20 20
gigabytes little about 20 km kilobytes
and just create click create and there
you are now I'll give graded the virtual
machine you want to go select it and you
want go into settings so just let me go
to settings and don't be overwhelmed
here
which defies death so basically the as
it is you've already done that we don't
need to touch anything else eh just make
sure you specify here whatever you want
it to be called you can change with that
next you are going to system now again
we can change how much RAM you want at
any time or in boot order just leave
everything the way it is we don't have a
floppy drives for the micro soldiers
leave that the bar drag an optical just
leave it as opposed to what you can
leave um check them if you want to
chipset ps3 is fine
um please everything the way this is on
the processor the most important thing
is you have to enable BAE or NX all
right now basically this is going to be
put a little physical address and it's
just going to be communicating with the
processor directly to increase the speed
of a particular machine so make sure
this is checked and you can select how
many calls that you want to allocate to
the virtual machine I usually leave it
at one because I want my one of my calls
on my computer is about 3.2 takers and
that's perfectly normal to support Kali
Linux right acceleration if you want to
touch anything in display here you can
basically video memory dedicate how much
video memory you want to give it I
usually find other than twenty eight
megabytes fine but if your computer has
less you can also reduce that to how
much you hard make sure you enable 3d
acceleration and if you want to run on
multiple monitor mode you could but I
only want it further on my current
monitor so that's fine now the next tab
is video capture they only record your
screen you can actually enable that I
don't really need that now because I
have an external video recorder so the
most important step is the storage now
the controller we have already created a
virtual hard drive so that's already it
already linked it to the virtual machine
now we need to specify where the ISO is
now wherever you have downloaded it make
sure you just go there and select it I'm
going to go go to
- and India's usually has a multiple but
for this tutorial I'm going to use my
Canon Linux just electric and that's it
so it loaded the ISO and you've loaded
be hard work
next in audio you can literally just
choose whatever or all your goggles you
have and network make sure you have make
sure it in that network adapter you
don't need anything else for this and
for this tutorial so that's all good
part of this you must you know you're
live good after this after you just
follow those settings you should be good
just hit OK and there we are going to
the test terminate stop all right so
let's hit stop and it's going to start
the virtual machine so just give it a
few seconds to boot up and we should be
good area alright so since a starting
virtual machine and there you are and
area is the first base our value max is
actually booted up and there you can
also see options here so what you could
do is like you can run it lives that
means with you a lot install Kali Linux
but in this video I'm gonna show you
clips on it step by step so yeah so that
if you met Lenny life you can then learn
it like for anything mode where you're
analyzing the repository then have life
and USB persistence which if you're
running it on a risk we wish you and not
and finally we have installation for
beginners or treatment a graphical
installation so that's what we're going
to just hit enter and you'll start the
graphical installation so just give it a
few seconds it gives you this error
don't worry about this it just going to
is going to save switched from that so
again here we are
I'm graphical select the absolutely
language that you are using or that you
were comfortable it and it continued I'm
okay English and you can select
whichever country from on the screen
select United Kingdom
it's okay British English configure the
keyboard no I use I use United States in
English like if this does not work does
not working my mouth with my law school
what is going to go back up here
American English I did not see that it
continued and it's going to say detect
and mount a cd-rom in Jerusalem start
reading from the ISO so give that a few
seconds and it's just going to read it
on the five you need
you
all right so what done all that it needs
to do and successfully connected to the
Internet it will ask for the host name
for this system so the host name is a
single word that they identified this
system on the network so what I'm gonna
say basically new username I'm just
going to create my net Cali Cali excuse
me HBO right so let's just keep it my
name Alexis there we are
and users gonna continue can name it
whatever you want as long as you're able
to identify it or air just for
simplicity if you're really a beginner I
would recommended leading tech colleague
alright continue and then your VIP
domain name you can just click continue
and just a skip back you don't really
need to do that right now
now every project you can debate in your
password for accessing root on Linux
so if you can leave anything you want to
use there for me I'm just going to use
little bit Cali on display because I
don't really need this to be secure
Cali one two three you can see there
there we are
and yes Kelly want to click continue and
it's gonna start setting of the prop and
other stuff so let me just go through
that and let's see what a very good next
right
alright so in the next step it's going
to ask you to stop partitioning disk and
where you want and leave enough to be
installed so here we have we have I get
a little off three options you can
actually usually enjoy this you need the
entire disk and setup LVM but what we're
going to do for the sake of this
tutorial we use the entire disk which
we've already created so don't worry
about it is just going to give you the
disk at a current a variable and as you
can see we have depended in the right
VirtualBox Hardware it's not going to
scan any object of your computers is
100% safe it's only going to use the one
that you've created virtually so as you
can SE AAP box hardly communicate
continue and I'm gonna take all files in
one partition that's written for new
users make sure you select that and
continue finish partitioning and writing
this to the risk and you can keep
creating partitions one is a swap
partition and one exec C for partition
click continue and we say write changes
to this make sure you select yes and it
continuum and it's going to start
partitioning the disk and it's going to
start installing the system so I'll
categories once it's done all right -
once it's finished installing the
operating system it's going to ask you
to install we grew up the bootloader
hard disk so this is very very important
the visibility's the energy Academy next
the ability to boot up correctly so I
shall not give install the grub boot
loader to the Master Boot Record just
kts that's very important and it this is
the hard drive here make sure it's
selected if we go through object select
install and it's going to start
installing it into into the virtual hard
drive so let's just finish this
collation just have a few more things
left yeah
alright so once it's done installing
everything is going to give a response a
finish with elation solution is complete
so basically done there is click
continue and it's going to
start removing the light packages and
finishing the installation give it a few
seconds and we should be able to run
Kali Linux for the first time in this
series of letters so hope you guys are
excited let's see where it goes alright
so just again let me just finish the
installation might take a few minutes or
a few seconds I don't know let's see
alrighty guys so once it's installed
it's gonna reboot and it's going to
reboot into Kali Linux so everyone
welcome to Kali Linux now one thing I
wanted to point out here if you go ahead
and write your username and your
password that we set earlier in doing
the exhalation we're going to get
something really weird so I remember my
user name of Kali and my password was
Kali 1 2 3 now if I hit enter when it's
going to say sorry that didn't work now
what I wanted to say to you is the user
name will change back to root after the
installation so you have to change it
again in values next once we log in so
the user named after an installation of
Kali Linux is always root and the
password remains the same which remains
the same password you kept during the
installation so Callie
1 2 3 there we are and it's going to
start up Kali Linux is logged in and
yeah there we are little bit a few
seconds to start and there we are
welcome to Kali Linux how exciting
they're all ready and we're getting
really really excited to start hacking
so that's basically it for this lesson
guys hope you guys found the video
helpful if you did please leave a huge
like and comment down below if you
didn't understand anything
I'll gladly help you otherwise have a
fantastic day guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
