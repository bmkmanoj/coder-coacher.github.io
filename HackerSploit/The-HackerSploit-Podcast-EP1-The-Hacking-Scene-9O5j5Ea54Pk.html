with another video but this time
something totally different so a lot of
you guys have suggested that you want
live streams and you want Q&amp;amp;A s and you
want more interaction between me and you
guys and that's perfectly understandable
that's very very important for us to
basically have a good connection with
each other
so I basically decided in addition to
the two live streams and Q&amp;amp;A s I'm also
going to be making a podcast type video
or a vlog video depending on whether or
not I can actually record a video I'm
working on getting a camera so I can
actually record these vlogs and if not
I'll basically continue with the
podcasts so basically the reason I'm
doing this is a lot of you guys have
questions there are very good questions
I read the comments but they cannot be
explained in the comments or it will be
quite pointless of me to make a video
recording my screen and then explaining
something that really needs to be
explained the way I'm doing it right now
now the topics for these podcasts or
vlogs so to speak will be coming from
you guys so if you have a question that
you want to ask about anything related
to technology about your career about
anything really I'll be happy to make a
podcast about it because you know a lot
of people need advice and you guys want
you ask a lot of questions which I love
and I try to answer other people need
the answer too and it's better if I make
it into a video that can help you guys
so I hope you guys find this valuable
now I'm going to try and keep these
podcasts as short as possible because I
don't want them to may not be these
long-ass podcasts so basically the
inspiration for this or this today's
topic which is about the hacking scene
or the ethical hacking scene where you
know the inspiration from this came from
a kik message I received I really don't
know the age of the individual and I'm
not going to release the name of the
individual but basically they send me a
message and I receive a lot of messages
on kik
thank you so much for that this is a
different type of message I got a
message saying do you know hacking so
again this this weirded me out because
I'm not used to be asking I'm not be I'm
not used to being asked those type of
questions where someone just comes
randomly and asks you you know I think I
said yes I do consider myself a hacker
because that's the name of my profession
and I have certifications and work
experience to prove it so the next thing
is the what what this person replied was
the thing that really just got me angry
and he said do you not hack like
watchdogs now that may seem funny to a
certain extent but when you come to
think of it you can see that kids I
would assume that that's a kid because I
don't think any grown adult would ask me
that type of question where you're
you're basically gaining inspiration to
learn hacking from a video game right
now the watchdog series is a game that
has played but I can you know instantly
tell you that nothing in that video game
is almost lifelike in terms of hacking
yes some terms are used here and there
but not even to be accurate meaning now
you guys might be also asking yourself
well what's it to me just a funny
message no you see this is what I'm
talking about the hacking scene around
the last two years I started hacking
back in 2011
alright that's when I started my hole
hacking and scenario and I tell you I
basically the reason why I went into
hacking is because I actually started by
actually exploiting the network of the
school that was in I didn't gain it from
a video game where I said you know what
I'm just going to go out there and start
turning on basically changing traffic
lights and stuff like that no and I
immediately said you know what this is
something I really really enjoy I like
finding loopholes in networks I like you
know exploiting machines not for
malicious intent of course then I really
didn't have a sense of
of what direction I wanted to be in so I
started off like that the next thing I
started doing I went you know I went I
started learning about the different
types of operating systems I got well as
accustomed to Windows I got well
accustomed to Linux I also learned a bit
of Mac I know some of you guys really
really hate Mac's out there but I
started understanding that the next
thing I did was I started learning
programming alright the reason again I
started learning programming is not
because I saw a video on YouTube telling
me that programming was going to give me
money or something like that or it's a
very valuable skill no it's because when
I actually started writing scripts I
that's how I started programming I wrote
a visual basic script that was very
popular then that would basically open a
thousand command prompt windows and that
really excited me the ability for me to
make a computer do something always
excited me so I learned web development
I learned Java Island C++ Island see I
learned c-sharp and then I started
looking at the hacking scene which had
grown quite a bit that was around
2012-2013 and there was something
something really cool that started
coming up when every time I would Google
my interest and that was black arc or
sorry so not like a backtrack I can't
believe I mix that up there are very
very similar names now backtrack was
actually created by the current team
that created Kali Linux so backtrack vim
then was the only penetration testing
distro around and believe me it was
really really bare in terms of how many
people even knew about it in 2013 I can
I can honestly tell you that not a lot
of people were installing Linux on their
computers and that I cannot I can really
really cannot explain the fact that
Linux is back then or something that if
you install on your computer there was
something mentally wrong with you
because firstly people thought that you
couldn't get anything done on it
secondly it's basically a crappy or a
buggy operating system I remember I
install the first Linux distro ever
installed
was a bull to Lennox and you know I I
swear I fell in love with it I fell in
in love with the were they basically the
idea that it was so open source and I
could control almost anything about the
operating system you know I could change
the desktop environment I could I could
feel MIT I could add my own icons of
course then the unity twig launcher was
or the unity tweak tool was was very
very limited but still offered a lot of
customization so I enjoyed it but again
I hit a wall where basically I I got a
bit of the dissonance in terms of how my
thinking was because I'll still I think
I was in high school I was in my second
year of high school then and basically I
needed my computer they know Microsoft
Word so I basically looked at the I
looked at the alternatives for Linux and
there was libera libera office which was
pretty good but again when you're a
teenager you basically want to use
things that are popular with your
friends and I went back to Windows right
so again after I went back to Windows I
again I continued learning how to
program nothing official yet I then
discovered and said backtrack Linux and
you know I said this is something I'm
really interested in again back then the
scene was was extremely limited you know
it was just the start of smartphones
things were just coming up in technology
it was one of the brightest times I've
ever seen you know in terms of how many
people wanted to learn how to code it
was really really a beautiful scene so I
installed backtrack and actually dual
booted it with Windows but it ended
messing up my my one of my favorite
windows or versions which is Windows 7 I
absolutely loved that version of Windows
but install backtrack and I started
learning about network network basics
right network basics like tcp/ip
basically things like network
administration I also learnt about Linux
bash scripting
and how to basically how to become a
Linux system administrator SSH all that
cool stuff I started learning about that
and then I discovered that that's
basically when backtrack started adding
all of these little scripts at that time
they were scripts like one of the oldest
ones was sequel map or SQL map which
allowed SQL injection and most of at
that time I remember there's a time when
the Facebook page because Facebook was
programmed in PHP was actually
vulnerable to an SQL injection attack
and I remember it was just it was just
fun we were having good old fun you know
just learning and you know when I look
at it now everyone just when when you
think of hacking they think all the
thing and the only thing you need is
basically to go install Kali Linux on
your laptop and you're basically a
hacker and you know they forget that
first thing do you even know how to you
know move get around in Linux do you
know how to basically maintain a Linux
distribution you know how to how to
customize your Linux kernel you know
those are some of the I think very
essential things that someone should
know before they even decide they want
to become hackers or you know whatever
they they want to become really and it
was the same scene with the programming
scene where people just got in
programming because they heard you know
what this is going to be the future
coders get paid a lot and you know
Zuckerberg had created Facebook and he
had made his billions and the the movie
social network came out and people saw
all mine this guy coded Facebook became
a billionaire I'm gonna do that and that
what ended that happened it up happening
is all the little babies and the kids
who tried to get into programming for
the sake of learning programming and
looking cool basically they got a taste
of their own medicine when they saw
programming isn't a piece of cake and
you can't master in a programming
language in one night all right you can
learn a programming language but you
cannot master it in one night
secondly you can't learn a programming
language as you can have that as a goal
you can't say like this year I'm going
to learn Java it doesn't work that way
I've told you many of you guys have
asked me what's your favorite
programming language
what language do you recommend I don't
recommend any language how I learned
programming is by actually creating
stuff how did I learn C shop I started
using unity3d to create games from then
owners I learned how to make scripts I
learned how to create character skits I
learned how to make scripts where the
character to make him jump higher and
that was when unity3d was so old I mean
it's incredible how did I learn C++ C
plus loss when we were doing machine
programming you know all that ASCII and
all of that stuff how did L and C when I
was doing when I when I started learning
the Linux kernel programming and stuff
like that how did I learn Python Python
came when I went deep into web again now
pythons not being used that much for web
or I'm not sure I am really not touched
up on my web development although I am a
pretty good back-end developer but
that's besides the case the try the
point I'm trying to make here is that
people are getting into these fields as
a joke they really don't know what
they're getting into and the as soon as
they're into it as soon as they have
Kali installed on a computer they assume
that they're hackers already there is a
lot more to Kali Linux or hacking then
there is you know Kali Linux I hope I'm
making sense there you know as I said
nowadays information is is widespread
you can learn how to do anything and the
thing people don't know other basics all
right I have nothing against any of you
guys on the channel most of you are on
the right track you guys are set to
become ethical hackers just that some
people just in the outlook on this whole
thing is so it's so wrong you know that
I I'm telling you that I've met many of
my friends after they saw what I was
doing they thought you know well ah this
is something cool you know I can get
into this and they they got
very they really got got hit hard when
they follow that is not all fun and
games you know it's not just sitting in
your in your room with your laptop doing
fun it's writing funny scripts when it
comes to serious programming or system
administration you know it's it's a
no-nonsense situation you can't be
fooling around you know that's not the
point of hacking the point of hacking
isn't you know cracking Facebook
accounts or Gmail accounts that's that's
you know it's it's sad to see that
that's the main reason people are trying
to hack account to learn hacking because
they want to hack accounts they want to
basically exploit people they want to
exploit their boyfriends or girlfriends
you know that's that's if you want that
done hire someone for it and I doubt
someone is going to do that for you
because again it's a stupid thing to do
you know many of the people you know
that I've met all want to become black
attackers because again here image of a
black hat hacker has come from movies
games where you know you dress up with
all these cool unique looking dressing
and you're basically just walking around
with your laptop in your backpack trying
to hack people that's not what a black
hat hacker is all right and the white
hat hacker isn't an idiot who doesn't
know anything about hacking all right so
I just want you guys to understand that
please understand what you're getting
into I said a lot of you guys know here
right now on this channel actually know
what you're doing and you have vast
knowledge of Linux which is awesome I
love to see that and I think my channel
is the only channel on YouTube that
actually has the best the best
individuals right now who ever chance at
becoming ethical hackers you can look at
all other channels that are probably
larger than mine that make all of these
funny Kali Linux videos where they use
these scripts that other people has
created to gain traffic I don't do that
all right I'm going to teach you and I
am kicking you the right way of going
about it you have to learn it step by
step
you don't learn hacking by learning by
cracking Wi-Fi password using
crack that's not how it's done all right
you start learning hacking by
understanding of few fundamentals about
Linux learning about the different
editors learning about the terminal
learning about the shortcut-keys that's
how you get started so you're
comfortable with the environment
next thing Len about networks after that
you can start learning about network
packet capturing etc etc you then learn
about password cracking you learn about
phishing you know you learn about social
engineering there's a lot to learn but I
think I'm the only person who is going
at it from a point where you guys will
understand and whatever I'm teaching you
becomes instinctively part of you you
know I went first I went in a very
coordinated manner when I started with
the course which I'm still continuing
I'm actually structuring it to you guys
extend more when I started with
information gathering you know nmap
scans that's the real way of going about
it because in once you're in you're out
there in the real world no one's going
to ask you no one's going to give you a
job to hack facebook accounts for a
living all right that job may very well
exist somewhere in the world but it's
not going to be worth it all right so I
hit you know I really am NOT happy that
I'm making this but I want you guys to
understand that it's not as simple you
know it's not a it's not a joke and it's
not a game you know the reason I got
into hacking was because I enjoyed it
many people are getting in clacking
because they buy watchdogs on their ps4
Xbox one and they play that and they
assume that you know it's going around
the city with your mobile phone hacking
people's bank accounts that's trust me
that's that's far from the truth and you
know once you get in into the real world
and you start and you find out that
whatever you're trying to do is really
not worth it you can make a living aking
Instagram accounts whether they belong
to your boyfriend or girlfriend that's
morally wrong so you pick your side of
the fence you either want to be a white
hack a white hat hacker or a black hat
don't to stay in the middle way you say
I'm going to be a gray hat because
you're never going to end up doing
anything really I can guarantee you that
I have trust me I have a lot of
experience in this if you want to go
black hat you're probably gonna you're
going to end up in jail one one of three
things is going to happen you're going
to end up in jail you're going to quit
or you're going to go you're basically
you're you're not going to make enough
money to even sustain a good standard of
living and if you think I'm blind you
can basically have a look look around
you look around you look around you
millions of hacks are carried out every
day probably you you don't actually get
to hear about them because of well not
the fact that they might have been you'd
really don't get to hear about them
because they're not reported but maybe
you try and hack a website today hack a
website I guarantee you hack a bank I
guarantee you you're going to get caught
anyone will be put in prison that's a
guarantee cyber cyber security remember
you may think you're learning something
but there are professionals out there
who are protecting white attackers are
protecting the the websites you are
trying to hack don't believe me try it
out just try it if you think I'm lying
or I'm trying to stop you guys from
becoming black hat hackers I just want
the best for you guys that's why I
created this channel is because I want
to push people in the right direction in
this industry you can't go around you
know just trying to hack different
people have a purpose have a purpose you
know you become a white hat hacker you
get hired by a company to basically fix
the problems in their network you know
so you know that's really the problem
that we are facing right now as an
industry you're getting a lot of people
entering this industry but not a lot of
people get to actually being
professionals in this field which also
brings me to another point are you
dedicated you know it's fine to say
you're going to sit around with your
email Kali Linux installed on a Dave
virtual machine or on your laptop and
just start you know your funny little
experiments you know this like
the other profession takes a lot of time
for you to become really really good at
it I'm not I'm not even own say I'm even
good at it I'm still working on myself
right now you know I still don't know a
lot of stuff and some of you out there
actually look like you know you know you
guys are in the comments section are you
we have very very smart people around
here you know and I the other day for
example I got a I got a comment or II
think it was last week I got a comment
about the web bug bounty hunting where
basically you hack Facebook and you
basically a exploit you show and exploit
and website and you get paid now that
makes sense
do something for the greater good again
it's not only going to help you imagine
today you few hack someone's account and
tomorrow you know you're you're maybe
maybe your girlfriend's account gets
hacked you know it's it's really it
really it's really a very irreversible
type of situation you're in so again I'm
really not trying to throw hate out
there I'm just trying to say understand
what you're getting into
know the consequences of your actions is
this really what you want do you enjoy
what you're doing because if you if
you're not enjoying it there's no point
if you're not enjoying programming
there's no point in doing it alright do
something that you love that's my motto
do something that makes you happy and
something that you'd be proud of after
you know 20 or 30 years of working so
that's that's that's what I wanted to
say really
again a dedication which is something
that lacks nowadays people try something
for a year and they are not successful
at it and they just give up you know
again it all comes down to passion and
dedication again passion comes from
whether or not you love what you do so
even if hacking is not what you want you
know you find your passion in life I
think that's very very important I know
this the topic of these videos on the
ethical hacking scene
you know it's very very important that
you guys understand the situation that
this industry is in you know you can
imagine if for example someone wanted to
start working in a car manufacturing
company and he basically he just reads a
web page in our our car is manufactured
and then goes into the factory and says
I I know how to manufacture a car you
know do you you really be looked at like
what the hell is this guy talking about
you know and in the cybersecurity well
you're competing with people who are
vast experience almost twenty years of
experience in the field because this has
been their this this sector or industry
has been there for nearly thirty years
since the invention of computers even
slightly before that indeed it really
took off with the with the start of the
internet but that's basically what I
wanted to say today I hope I hope this
has brought a lot of value to you guys I
know it's advice that I also at one time
I wish I had but I've learnt it the hard
way and I want you guys to make the
right decisions you know because you
might say right now you're you're young
it's about trial and error but it's
important that you know where you're
going in your life you know so that's
basically what I wanted to say to you
guys I hope you none of you have
actually got offended by this I just
mean that the I mean the best for you
guys and I want you guys to understand
what you're getting into um you know
just I just want to give you guys advice
that will help you hopefully so thank
