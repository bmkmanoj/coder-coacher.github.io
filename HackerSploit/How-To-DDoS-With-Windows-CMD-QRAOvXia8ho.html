with another video and in this video I'm
going to be showing out to Dido so DDoS
someone's IP using command prompt in
Windows so yeah let's get to this so all
you have to do is just down run command
prompt as administrator you can do like
that or just go to the windows button
and net and just type for CMD and you'll
get command prompt and you can run it as
administrator so once you have it open
now I'm just going to change it to green
color and all right so now once you have
a clean clean prompt here all you want
right is King and you want to enter the
IP of your victim or your target so you
know I'm just going to get some random
IP addresses like for example this one
is going to copy it and I'm going to
paste it then after you paste the IP
there you wanna add a space and you want
to enter hyphen T space - L oops - L and
then you want to enter the amount of
times you want to ddos your victim so
I'm going to enter 100 times I'm just
going to enter and it's going to say
pinging this IP 100 bytes of data so
that's not working because this IP is
not correct I'm going to show you with a
working IP that does work so again I
don't think you have to be administrator
but it's a good measure to take but I'm
just going to show you like this make
clear that so um I'm just gonna ping
then I'm going to say for 168 for jump
one I'm going to say T - L 10 packets
and it's gonna there we go it's a
ddossing my routers IP and stop there
okay it's keep it's going so yeah that's
pretty much it guys I hope this video
helped you and I and I do want to say
that this video is for educational
purposes only and I'm not responsible
for any damage but that's going to take
place if you use this for the wrong
reasons anyway guys if you liked the
video give it a huge thumbs up if you
want more videos like this please
subscribe if you have any questions
leave them in the comments and yeah I'll
see you later peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
