with another video and in this video I
have for you guys a Linux distro review
and for this very review I have blackout
Linux which is a very very new district
that is basically focused on as you can
read here Blackhawk we on the website
right now black out Linux is an ocular
decks based penetration testing
distribution for penetration testers and
security researchers so this just
screams out Kali Linux competitor now
again it's based on our clinics which I
love I just love how simplistic the our
clinics architectures is compared to
Kali Linux which is really really not
friendly with the low spec systems and
the reason why I selected to do this
destroys because of how lightweight it
is and it's basically just focused on
penetration testing and security
research and as you can see here that
the district contains 1569 tools now
that is twice or even thrice as more as
Khalil nuts does and this is straight
out of the box so you can install the
tools individually or in groups so it's
already there and Blackland black our
clinics is compatible with existing
Arkansas's that's great if you have if
you already have an ocular that's the
ISO or you have already installed it on
one of your computers this can just come
on top as an add-on so that's basically
it it's a very new district and it is in
it's a new project and it's in it's in
testing so if you have any bugs you can
send them an email and they'll fix it
hopefully you can see it very very
simplistic I have it running on a
virtual machine right here it's free to
download by the way obviously all the
next should be free there we are very
simple you guys might be thinking
where's the toolbar or the taskbar
where's where where my windows where my
folders well as I said in earlier it's a
very very simplistic distro
all you have to your disposal is the
right-click and there you are
that's the menu you will get and I just
love
this this is all you need you don't in
any any services running the background
terms of display and it's basically very
lightweight and this will work perfectly
on any low-end laptop or PC as you can
see you have terminals just in different
colors red terminal green I find this
funny that they included this and may
just makes it easier when you want to
use the different types of colors terms
of the font of your terminal but they
are pretty really interesting and you
can run write a command here it's
running full Linux as you can see and
you can close that here we are
close that I don't know it's all in
black but they are you have browsers you
have Firefox and Midori you can run
Firefox we have network these are the
net different network tools or above
that you have WI CD curses and you can
see actually have not connected the
internet yet but once I do that you guys
will be able to see that but that's
basically it close tabs for the browsers
so this is basically focused on
penetration testing this is perfect for
you guys again here on the toolbar and
sorry I skipped that we have the time
and date that's it and you have virtual
desktops up to four you can have up to
four desktops very simple very nice
that's all you need again so let's look
at the tools that it comes in it may
look like not a lot as from the start
but wait until you look at the different
tools that each has are you guys seeing
what I'm saying
so obviously automation we have very
popular ones like Armitage but what I
like about this is it gives you variety
for your attacks or when you're testing
and this is very important when you're
trying to be dynamic with your approach
when it comes to penetration testing
really you have automobile just
different tools that most most of you
are familiar with if you have used Kali
Linux as you can see here this is the
binary attacks that you can perform
whoops
clicked on that by mistake let's just
open now Blackhawk again
toes cracka as you can see you have
cracker they should be John there we are
there's John very very popular cracking
fern you have the fern Wi-Fi cracker
again very very good stuff here
as you can see it really is working it
has all the stuff you need by the way I
do recommend using phone Wi-Fi cracker
if you want to try and crack Wi-Fi
although I don't recommend you doing
that as I'm not condoning any of these
illegal stuff here so they are fun
everything is really working and as you
guys can see it has it has it has an
abundance of tools that you can use when
it comes to penetration testing but
apart from that when it doesn't do
anything else apart from browsing and
hacking to be a bit cynical there and
that's what I love about this you see
Kali Linux is focused mainly on it
basically gives you both or the both of
the two worlds in terms of desktop
environments and the tools but Kali
Linux has said is not very friendly with
old hardware and it's very important
that Linux Linux any Linux distro should
be lightweight enough to run on any
hardware and this is one of examples
that really really makes me happy when
it when I look at the Linux community so
said you have all your tools I'm not
going to explain that in these videos
maybe I can do a few other videos giving
a special history tutorials on how to
use these tools very very many tools
maybe you can make that a series yeah I
actually have to think about that but if
you guys do want to see that let me know
in the comments section and I would be
happy to do videos on that so in your
fluxbox many of this basically of
settings menu you have your
configuration we can edit a few things
in the in terms of your tabs and very
very basic again you can't really edit
anything anything fresh special terms of
customization you have system styles
these are basically the themes you have
here you have Bora black very nice I
really like that meta sorry I clicked
out by mistake twice is very good I like
twice you have arc classic och Bora
blackboard blue or green but I think
here what you want to just stick to is
black hawk which is pure just read in
nice
I really like that you have user styles
nothing in there as of yet workspace
icons as you can see desktops tools
window name flux box commands can enter
commands if you want to
oops let's try to close that oops okay
let me just let's just carry on here or
figure how to shut that down because I
said there are toolbars are very very
limited but at least it does what it's
supposed to and that's hack hack the
hell out of I mean that's just
basically what it is
tools window named flux for commands
reload configuration restart in about
and exit that's all you need guys and as
you can when I click exit you have your
language and you keep order format and
your desktop as I said just use the
default desktop it's just going to be
the best thing sorry about that my phone
just ring in the background really sorry
about that that's very unprofessional
sorry about that again started over
there so as you can see just login and
you can quit pretty simple that was the
video I wanted to show you guys very
very exciting stuff from this distro
please go and check it out if you did
like the video please leave a thumbs up

improve the content on my channel as I
said this content is for you guys this

this is what I want to for you guys so

thumbs up if you want more videos from
me subscribe let me know if you have any
questions or comments regarding this
