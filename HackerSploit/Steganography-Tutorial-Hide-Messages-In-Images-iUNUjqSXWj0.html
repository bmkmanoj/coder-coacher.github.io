with another video and in this video
basically gonna be talking about
steganography and basically how to
perform steganography but before we get
but before we get into that I just
wanted to say thank you guys so much for
the support you've given me on the
channel and also on my social networks
you guys have been just commenting on
the videos asking your questions even on
social media just hitting me up and just
just chatting with me really about
whatever you guys are doing and how has
helped you and how you can basically you
guys also giving me tips and feedback
regarding the channel coming back to the
channel we have actually hit 5,000
subscribers that's a huge milestone and
very very important milestone it means a
lot to me and I know it means a lot to
you guys for those of you who have been
with me since the start 1 &amp;amp; 0
subscribers I remember so just a huge
thank you basically I've been going
through a lot I've been doing a lot and
this year since the start of this year
I've changed it basically what I wanted
to the direction I wanted to go not with
the channel the channel still remains
the same in terms of content but I
wanted to make better quality content so
I've been setting myself up for this and
I've decided to do YouTube and basically
online video production full-time right
so that's basically what I've decided to
do so what this means is that I'll be
uploading a video or two every single
day because I'm basically going to be
focusing on my YouTube channel and again
you guys can contact me on my social
networks you have any questions follow
me on them but the big change of brought
is I've actually created a platform
called final coder alright so this is
the platform of created and this is
basically where I'll be teaching coding
programming ethical hacking pen testing
all of the stuff that I do on my own on
the main channel I'll be using this
platform to teach now what does this
mean well I've created the website
before that before we actually just go
into that and the website is called
final coder
all right so basically this is a social
network for ethical hackers and
programmers all right so order to create
a social network where we can all
interact and and everyone can
communicate regarding what they are
doing whether they want to share stuff
with us you know it's can just become a
nice community of people who just love
you know love what they do which is
ethical hacking so you can basically
create an account you can just go up
here basically tell you to register or
login and once you've created an account
you can update your account by adding a
profile image you can you can edit your
profile and basically that's it so we
have a home section which is where
you'll find people updating their status
maybe whatever they're doing as you can
see I've already created my user for
myself Alexis and my administrator
account which is hackers Floyd and you
then have your activity section which is
basically what everyone else is doing
you have the blog section where I'll be
making posts and giving you guys news
and resources are just on a daily basis
so this would be updated on a daily
basis in the members section this again
is pretty self-explanatory
these are the members that are currently
online and are created as you can see
last active you can newly newest
registered you can search for members so
maybe if you if you sign up with your
friend that's there we then have groups
which you guys I want there is an ID
this is because there will be a lot of
questions or topics that you might want
to discuss and yeah this is a good place
to start so that's basically that's
basically it with the website you can
check it out the link will be in the
description go sign up and start posting
stuff and hopefully this will make our
interaction even better now let's get
all of that aside and let's get to the
topic of this video I know we're already
a long way in the video were four
minutes in already so let's begin we are
talking about steganography now what is
steganography this you might be asking
so well how is it related to ethical
hacking well steganography is basically
the practice of concealing a file
concealing a file message image or or a
video within another image or video so
basically the hidden message the hidden
message will be part of something else
like an image so in essence
steganography is the art of concealing a
message or a file within an image now
how are we gonna do this you might be
asking well there is something really
really cool I discovered I've been
really really looking into cryptography
and steganography and it goes in the
past few months and I'm actually a mint
a lot and I wanna share it with you so
basically what you want to go and search
for is you want to search for Steg
tagger sweet savory sweet I believe is
the correct area so basically step this
week is a free steganography tool all
right so you wanna go to the first link
it's take a sweet org and just click on
it hopefully the website opens up sorry
if my internet is slightly slow
basically the free and open source
steganography tool written in Java you
can hide information in image files so
it works on Linux and windows for this
video I'm gonna be demonstrating it on
windows because it's pretty much the
same thing you just run it and a
graphical user interface just pops up so
it's not actually in command-line you do
it with a graphical image user interface
so just click on it and download it
small file about two megabytes and once
you're done it's going to basically be
on your desktop if you're running
Windows and you have Java installed by
the way if you're on Windows make sure
you have Java installed that's just
something that I forgot to tell you the
Java runtime environment and you should
see that it gives you this nice little
coffee cup logo which is the look of
Java so just double click it and it's
going to open up Stengel suite and it's
pretty simple as I said very very easy
so now you basically just have to open
an image now the reason you saw me on
the other website at the beginning is
basically I was on a website called
pixabay I'm not sponsored by pixabay
this is just a very very good website
where you can get royalty-free images
for your project and you don't have to
pay for the
there are copyright free and and are
under Creative Commons so you can find
an image here then like let's say you
want to you want to use for this process
you can select any I already have this
one right here downloaded so you can go
ahead and just hit download and select
the resolution and just hit download so
I already have it downloaded so what I'm
going to do is just say file open and
it's in my download section as you can
see that's the file currently it has it
has not been steganography I don't know
if that's a word so just open it and
it's going to say enter your secret
message now I can't believe how awesome
this is
you can literally communicate with
images so let's say you're on Facebook
you can literally be chatting with your
friend sending images but no one knows
that they actually contain messages how
awesome is that now let me just show you
this so let's say say let's say hello we
can say the sum sale is awesome all
right pretty random stuff you can then
enter a password which is unique so I'm
just going to test let's just call it
test and we can then embed alright it's
going to start saying embedding data and
it's going to say it's done so now once
it's done it's going to give you this
right here and you might be saying well
how come it's not opening whoops let me
try and open that with with an image
viewer photos hopefully it opens up and
as you can see it the image still works
but it's in a different format so it's
going to be in a different format and
image format so you have the image right
here you can rename it let's say just
call it I mean but now what this
basically will make sense doing alright
sorry so we have to actually just close
this and then we can rename it to or is
it there is no need of a minute enemy so
let's delete the original and this is
the image with the message right so now
if you are sending images with encrypted
basically steganography
images to your friend he would basically
have to download the Steger suite
alright so once you have stayed go
straight open now let's say we wanted to
extract the message so I say open then
we go to the desktop and we select this
one right here the image that we
basically we basically embedded a
message in now let's enter alcohol
password let's say test and if we
extract it there we are
hello the steam summer sale is awesome
so as you can see this is just
unbelievable to me because you're
basically hiding I mean to a normal
person you could literally people could
be posting images on Facebook that
contain messages and that's pretty
pretty awesome I've got to say so that's
basically it for this video guys all the
links will be in the description to all
the resources that I've used in this
video I'm awesome awesome stuff you guys
should definitely experiment and
hopefully maybe you guys could post some
of your images on on the on your website
definer code the website and maybe I'll
go through them and see what hidden
messages you have left for me so go
ahead and do that and just basically
