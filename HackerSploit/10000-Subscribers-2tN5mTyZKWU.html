with another video and guys we have
finally done it
we've hit 10,000 subscribers I am just
lost for words I cannot explain to you
guys how I'm feeling right now I'm just
so happy so satisfied and so proud as to
how far we have all come together
because as I said this is not something
I did alone you guys were there to
support me every inch of the journey
from the beginning from the beginning of
this year when I had less than a
thousand subscribers and now we have hit
10,000 subscribers the journey has been
amazing and I can all I can do is thank
you thank you so very much for the
support you know the support has been
immense you know and all the comments
your questions just making this channel
one of the most interactive channels
I've seen in a long time I mean we
communicate with each other more than in
my opinion any other channel out there
so it's amazing to see how far we've
come
you know I I've tried to improve the
content as much as I can and as you can
you guys have seen my content as evolved
as we moved along
hopefully it's gotten better I think
that improved my equipment that I use
and I'm gonna continue to do to do so as
you can see I've made a few changes to
the channel when I knew that we were
approaching this huge milestone I change
the graphics of the channel which I
think will suit what we're trying to
move into which is a more professional
feeling now where I'll be uploading very
very regularly and content that is good
quality and has a lot of good content so
it'll have a lot of content with a lot
of good quality so I'm trying to get
that mixed together in addition when it
comes down to video quality I'm going to
be uploading videos in 1080p now because
that is again the step that we need to
take to push this further and further so
thank you guys for all your feedback you
know all your criticism it has helped me
a lot to streamline or to make this
channel better and to understand what
type of content you guys want you know
the quality you want it in
and that has been amazing guy so love I
you know I thank you so very much for
the support you've given me and it's
it's just been an amazing journey so as
I said I've made a few changes to the
channel I've changed the graphics and
I've added one more awesome feature guys
I've created the official hacker sploit
website as you can see here no more
block no more finer coder comm just
hackers ployed comm so I'm just gonna
open up open it up right now as you can
see I've added it to the channel links
and if you just open it up as you can
see it is an awesome website I've been
working on it for a long time and here
we are so what this website is gonna be
is gonna act as a news portal so this is
where you can get all of the hacking
news that you want anything real act
related to Linux or hacking you can find
here so in addition to acting as a as a
news portal or a news site you can also
find your additional resources here I've
been making guides tutorials you know
just awesome stuff will be coming or
making its way on the website and would
really act as a second home to the
YouTube channel where you can find
things like the ebooks you can contact
me you can you know just read all the
news discuss and just just educate
yourself with other stuff for example
I'll be creating as you can see I've
made a few posts in the hacking section
where I've created the a Canadian X
cheat sheet that you guys can use or get
started with that has all the commands
that you can use to get better so we
have our end map commands we have
enumeration commands we have our web
server commands fingerprinting DNS zone
transfers so all the all the commands
are here you can look them up and again
this is what this site is gonna be it's
gonna provide you additional information
to go along with the YouTube channel and
this will be as I said the second home
of the YouTube channel where you can
find almost everything else that I will
not be putting on video on the YouTube
channel so I'm really really excited to
have released this you guys should go
and check it out let me
know what you think make use of the
resources I've also added some iBooks in
there so you can go and check them out
I've added them to my mega cloud hosting
so you can download them just click on
this link right here I'll be adding more
books as I get permission to use them in
this domain or that type of domain so
yeah that's basically it for the website
I've changed a lot of stuff you can
still contact me on my Facebook Twitter
I'm still going to be making the
podcasts that are on soundcloud and tune
in radio right now as I said I'm working
to get them published on iTunes that'll
be a great achievement if I get to do
that and I'll continue uploading at
least a podcast episode a week you can
still contact me on kik to ask me any
questions but I want to just say
something that my main social network of
choice is going to be Twitter so if you
guys want to follow what I'm doing or
any of the updates that I'll be making
or future you know just insights onto
future videos you can catch me up on
Twitter now I can't reach 10,000
subscribers and not say thank you in a
more appropriate way so what I'm gonna
be doing is I'm gonna have a giveaway
and what I'm going to be giving away is
a copy of Counter Strike global
Offensive or CS go as it's commonly
known as I'll be giving one copy of this
away to any of my subscribers it's going
to be a random giveaway so make sure
that you're subscribed and I will be
making the announcement one week from
now on Twitter so make sure you follow
me on Twitter to get that update so as I
said the winner will be chosen randomly
and I'll send you the your serial key or
your steam CD key as it's called and
it'll work all around the world so it
says global steam CD key and yeah so
good luck to all involved in this
giveaway all you need to do to enter the
giveaway is to make sure you subscribe
and of course follow me on Twitter for
the announcement which would be one week
from now and yeah that's basically it
for the giveaway it's I thought that
would be pretty cool because last time I
did a poll for the giveaway and a lot of
you suggested counter-strike go
so that's gonna be it this is not gonna
be the only giveaway I'm gonna be doing
I'm also gonna be doing other giveaways
regarding the hacking courses that are I
am almost releasing this month or
probably in October so stay tuned for
that as well
so overall thank you so much for
everything guys this is a huge milestone
and it means a lot to me and I know it
means a lot to you guys because we have
come through all of this together and
it's just amazing to see how far we've
gone and we still have a long way to go
the target for this year was 20,000
subscribers
it was really an ambitious you know shot
in the dark that I took at the beginning
of the year but you know we have reached
halfway halfway there even if we don't
make the target I won't be disappointed
because I really didn't expect myself to
be this this far along the journey so
thank you so much guys I really
appreciate all the support you've given
me and I hope we can continue to you
know grow together and I'll promise to
make better and much higher quality
content that is my promise to you guys
and yeah thank you so much for watching
this video and I'll be seeing you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
