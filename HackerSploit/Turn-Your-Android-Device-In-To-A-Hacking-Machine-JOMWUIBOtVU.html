with another video today I'm going to
show starting a new series on my channel
where I will be showing you how to turn
your Android device into a hacking
machine in this so in this video I'm
going to be showing you how to set up
and install all the required
prerequisites for this series so yeah
let's get AK so the first thing you want
to do guys is make sure that your phone
or your tablet is rooted now you may be
asking why do I need to have root access
on my Android device in order to to make
my device into a hacking machine well
it's very simple and it all has to do
with the Linux kernel and the fact that
you need root access or root privileges
in order for you to perform some of the
commands or the hacking and hacking
techniques so make sure your phone is
rooted and you have a a super user
application or a root application for
example a super user or super su that's
the one I prefer because it's very
simple and it's a very it works for me
so make sure you install a super user
application I would recommend super su
or super super user that's what it's
made may be cool but that's for the
first step kinda thing you want to do
and the the final thing that you want to
do so that you can begin this series is
what you want make sure you have busybox
installed now if you don't know what
busybox is busybox is basically a set of
instructions or basically libraries that
a that a root a root user which will be
you will take advantage of system so
yeah it's basically going to give you
it's going to give you more control when
you have root so make sure you install
busybox it's free on the Google Play
Store and once you have it installed you
just have to open it and it will say
super user request you can grant it and
it's going to say well accept and you
just hit install and you know just just
as simple as that and you're done so
this is all you tickley need to do
so these are the two basic steps you
need to complete for you two to make
sure you're ready for this series so I
hope you guys are you liked this series
