with another video and welcome to Python
for ethical hacking and in this video
we'll be getting started with printing
out data mathematical operators and
variables that's a lot to cover in one
video but python is really simple to
understand and it really is an intuitive
language along with saying that python
is very very powerful so yeah so I'm
currently running this on kali linux
you're gonna be using i'm gonna be using
this as my environment i'm gonna be
using PyCharm as my integrated
development environment you guys can use
whatever you want or on any operating
system you want now before you get
started I just want to say that I've
switched this to Python 3 to use Python
3 and the reason I'm doing that is
because I think it's a much better
syntax to use than Python 2 and that's
because python 2 is going to become
absolute obsolete very very soon the
differences between Python 2 and PI 3
are there they exist but they're really
not any big differences and since we
haven't written any code in Python 2 yet
I talked I thought it would be a great
idea just to switch on to Python 3 so
I'm gonna be using Python as my
integrated development environment and
you guys can use whatever you want as
long as you're comfortable with it so I
created a folder called Python for
ethical hacking and this is where I'll
be saving all my Python files in this
video series so I'm going to create a
new python file and i'm gonna call it
let's just call it introduction right
because this is where this is a in this
video I'm gonna be taking you through
printing out data a bit of strings we'll
be looking at variables and mathematical
operators so introduction and we'll hit
OK and voila it creates our Python file
for us so let's start off with printing
out data
as you've seen in the previous video we
were able to print out some data and we
use the print command right so the print
command is simply going to print out
whatever you want so we open the
brackets and in here we can print out
strings we can print out numbers so
let's start off with a simple string
saying python is oops is awesome
if we were to save this and you do that
by hitting ctrl s on pycharm alright and
if we were to run this what do you think
we would get it would say python is
awesome because we have said print
python is awesome
pretty cool right alright now let's move
on to the next line in the next line
let's say we wanted to print out
something like a number and we we the
process would be similar you open your
brackets and you print out a number in
this case I would like to print out 200
right and that is an integer so let's
run this and as you can see it's going
to print out the number but here's the
interesting thing with python is that
python really does not need you to
declare the data type of the value that
you're using but we'll be looking at
that in the variables section but now
you can see that the print command is
quite advanced if you come to look at it
so print we can try something else let's
try and use some mathematical operators
here so let's say we wanted to add some
numbers we would say 20 plus 40 right
and indeed it would actually perform
that mathematical operator operation
pardon me and it will display that out
so if you were to run this it would
display out 60 so we'll be looking at
mathematical operators in a few minutes
but first let's wind up with printing so
breathing is very simple as you can see
you can print out whatever you want
defaults to again to print out the
sentence and I was to say hello all
right and that would print out the word
hello although a very very common
misconception is should I use the double
quotes or the single quotes and the
answer to that is you can use any it
depends really on the context in which
you're using them so if I wanted to say
hello the same way it would display it
in the exact same way
as you can see what I'm talking about is
let's say for example you had you wanted
to print out something that had a quote
in it now if I had a quote I would use
this single quotation marks and I would
say hello let's say this is the sentence
hello my name
is and then I would use the double
quotation marks and I'll put my name in
there in regards to the sentence my name
is Alexis and I love Python alright
Python like so and a false to save this
and I run this now you can see that it
displays hello my name is Alexis but now
my name will be in quotation marks if
you wanted to use quotes and I love
Python well while the rest of the
sentence is not in quotes so I'm sure
you're understanding how to use the
Print command now now let's look at some
mathematical operators all right so
mathematical operators are really very
simple in Python like they are in any
other programming language you have the
addition alright you have the
subtraction you have your multiplication
which is determined by the asterisk key
you have your division and you have your
modulus all right whoops modulus is the
percentage sign so let me show you how
to use them so as I said mathematical
operations are really very simple let's
say we wanted to add two numbers like
two plus two right if we were to save
this and run we wouldn't get a result
but I can guarantee you that Python has
done this calculation but now we need
something to help us display the result
and what do we use we use the Print
command awesome so we can say print two
plus two and we can get rid of that top
line because we're essentially doing it
in here so let's save that and if we run
it now you can see the answer will be
four and we can use other mathematical
operators like the subtract and let's
change the value of this one and let's
make that six all right so we already
know that this is a very simple
mathematical operation but this is just
to test the power of Python so if we run
this now you can see that the answer
will be 4 6 minus 2 is 4 we can also use
multiplication so we can use the
asterisk and if we use that it's gonna
multiply 6 by 2 so let's run this and as
you can see the answer will be 12 which
makes a lot of sense now let's try
division right
so 6/2 we use the ford slash for
division and if we were to save this and
run we would get three which makes sense
mathematically we do have something else
however what if we were to divide
numbers that are not necessarily going
to give a flat answer meaning an answer
without any remainder so if you were to
use something like 17 divided by 2 which
would not be give us a complete answer
it would give us an answer with the
remainder if you were to save this and
run you can see that it gives us 8 which
you might be wondering hey what's going
on here and it's really what it's done
is given us the flat number without the
remained if we wanted to see the
remainder we would use the percentage
sign which represents modulus and that
means remainder so if we save this and
run you can see that it does give you
the remainder which is 1 so the answer
for this question would be 17 divided by
2 equals 8 remainder 1 all right so I
hope that makes sense so you can see
that those are mathematical operators
and you can just alternate with whatever
you want to use so 17 plus 2 if we were
to run that for example we would have 19
pretty awesome if you ask me and yeah
that's basically it for mathematical
operators really really very simple as I
said we'll be looking at all of this as
we move along now let's look at
variables very important and they also
play a very very big part in Python so
variables essentially just hold a value
that can change or of are a value that
can be changed so we have the variable
name to declare a variable we start off
with the variable name which essentially
is a name and you can give it it can
only be a name it cannot be a number so
you can give it anything you want let's
start off with a very very simple
example here and let's say age all right
that's the name of the variable and age
is equal to 20 all right because age is
a number and we're using 20 as the
variable so this value can change all
right so if I was to go down here and
save
and in the print I can also print out
variables now so I can print out the
variable name and that will know and
that will essentially print out the
value of the variable okay so if I was
to print and I would say print age it's
essentially gonna print out 20 so if I
run this you can see it's going to say
print it's going to print out 20 now
what if I wanted to change the value
here and I would go into print and on
say print age plus 45 right and now to
just save that and run it you can see
that it will print out 65 and that's
what I'm talking about the value can be
changed all right so that's a good way
of using the print command as well you
can use variables in concatenation with
a number or if you're making any
mathematical changes as you can see that
we have done here you can also subtract
write which will not make sense and if
we save this you can see it's going to
give us minus 25 which makes
mathematical sense but not logical sense
so I'm just gonna stick to plus 85 all
right now we could declare other type of
variables like name right but name would
be in form of a string right so we use
the quotation marks and we would say
like name is equals to Alexis right
pretty awesome and again you can also
change the value it was to go down here
and say print and I opened the bracket
and I say I'll to say name in equal to
let's see let's see some other name John
wick alright something as simple as that
and also to hit enter you can see that
it's gonna give us an error okay and you
might be asking yourself why am I
getting an error here
well declaring or changing the value
does not work in there so what we have
to do is we have to do it out here so
name we have to update the variable so
to speak so we can say John alright so
once we say John it's what this print
command is gonna do is it's gonna start
from the top all right what python is
going to do is it's gonna start from the
top and it's gonna say name is equal to
Alexis Oh
okay and then hold on name is being
changed to John so I'm gonna print out
the latest version of the variable name
all right so I'm gonna say print name as
you can see it's gonna run and it's
going to display John alright so it
falls to to change the order of this it
would print out Alexis right so let's
run that and as you can see it prints
out Alexis so that's a cool way of
declaring variables and you can have any
name really you can say X we can make a
simple calculator program we can say
print and we can say something like this
is a simple calculator alright as simple
as that and we could go down and say sum
is equal to a plus B all right and then
we could go down here and say a is equal
to 10 and I know there are a few errors
here and there I've done that I've done
that exclusively and then we can say B
is equal to 20 now you can see that it's
giving us some errors here and it's
saying hold on I I don't know where this
a and B are from and that's because I
said it's gonna what python does is
gonna start from the top and finish at
the bottom so we're gonna have to move
these before the some variable right and
as you can see the sum is actually gonna
what it wants is the value of a and B
added so now we can go down here and
save print and we can print out the sum
right and if we save this it's gonna be
pretty obvious that is going to give us
30 as you can see this is a simple
calculator 30 now I'll be showing out to
input data which will allow the user to
input their own data but we'll get to
that so that's basically it for this
video guys that was an introduction to
the basics of Python with the print
command mathematical operators variables
