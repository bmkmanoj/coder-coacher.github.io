be talking about what Linux is and a bit
of its background to answer the almighty
question what is Linux Linux is running
on smartphones to cause and we have all
heard of the Linux operating system but
do we really know what Linux is so let's
start off with a bit of information
about what Linux is Linux is a UNIX
based operating system that is developed
under the model of free and open-source
software development now what this means
is that it's an open source kernel which
I'll get to in a moment and that means
that you can basically edit the kernel
to your specifications and it's all open
source and free now Linux is based on
the Linux kernel which is where it gets
its name from obviously the Linux kernel
is an operating system kernel that was
first released on September 17th 1991 by
Linus Torvalds many of you may have
heard of him
and he is actually the creator of Linux
so Linux was originally developed for
personal computers based on the Intel at
times 86 or 32-bit architecture but has
since been ported to many other
platforms than any other operating
system in the world we all know I'm sure
that all of us know that one of the most
prominent parts of Linux is Android now
because of the dominance of Android
Linux has the largest installed base of
all general purpose operating systems so
that really speaks for itself when you
talk of the widespread use of the Linux
kernel as I said as I mentioned earlier
from vehicles to smartphones watches
it's just incredible how fast the the
user base of Linux is now Linux is also
the leading operating system on servers
and mainframe computers and on a
staggering 99.6% of the fastest
supercomputers in the world but is
shockingly used on around only 2.3
percent of desktop computers
to elaborate over this we all know that
the desktop market has been flooded by
Windows and Mac Apple products and we
have the Windows operating system and
the Mac OS operating system which
basically dominate this market obviously
so typically Linux is a this package in
a form known as a Linux distribution or
a distro as some of you may know for
both desktop and server use so basically
this is where the kernel open source
comes into place basically we have
companies or groups that edit the kernel
to meet specific or to tailor specific
needs of specific consumers for example
we have Khaled the next which is
supposed to offer penetration testing
toolkit and we have open SUSE which
basically provides a general-purpose
desktop operating surface now some of
them what most mainstream a Linux
distros or distributions are our clinics
sent OS debian fedora gentoo linux linux
mint open source and a bun to the most
popular Linux distributions in the world
obviously so they are pretty good I
would highly recommend you check them
out if you're into the whole the next
thing and we also have some Enterprise
distributions or commercial
distributions as they call - such as
reddit and price Linux and SUSE Linux
and price server which have basically
require a payment or a or a fee to be
used so you actually have to buy these
Enterprise distros however the rest of
them are absolutely free and you are
free to edit them to your needs that was
all the basic info of Linux I hope this
video helped you guys if it did I would
appreciate if you left a like on the
video and I would love to hear what you
have to say about Linux in the comment
section otherwise now you know about
Linux these guys it's been hackers Floyd
have a fantastic tank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
