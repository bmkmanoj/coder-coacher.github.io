course and in this video I'm going to be
showing you the best email providers on
the Deep Web or the dark net as its so
called
so they're about four email providers
that I think will perform exceptionally
well for f4 really any purpose you have
in mind and basically you might be
asking yourself why do I need an email
address on the darknet or the deeper
well the question is why not why
shouldn't you have one first of all it's
just it's amazing for communication
because it's going to be anonymous and
there's literally no tracking whatsoever
there's no Google analytic tracking
basically tracking how many emails you
send a day or not nor is there basically
file scanning on basically attached
files that you could be scanning but
those are just some of the advantages of
using an email on the Deep Web or the
dark net so let's actually get started
oh by the way the links will be in the
resources folder for each of these
videos that actually contain links so
basically the first one is called
protonmail
now protonmail is also on the clear web
but it actually does exceptionally well
on the Deep Web or the dark net as well
so here it is and you can basically just
log in or create an account now you
might be asking yourself why should I
select a protonmail
well basically as you can already see
it's it's going to be clear web signup
and if we basically just temporarily
allow scripts on this site it should
this is already on the clear web so
there's really no risk you can select
your contact some of it some packages do
need a payment now the free version
which is a basic account with limited
features the secure email with advanced
features basically has these advantages
right here up to a thousand messages a
day and you might be asking yourself
well why can't I just use normally well
for my communication well that's also
good that's a good argument but with
protonmail
as it says Protomen is a free service
for the public good you
support online privacy by selecting a
paid account Avanti vision helps us
basically developed protonmail is a free
and open source software so basically
the packages the payment packages are
just to support them in development now
you might be asking yourself what
security do they use and these
end-to-end encryption so that basically
on its own on its own is the best and
you can go through all of this really
you can basically have have a look at
how it works and why they basically why
you should sign up with them but that's
basically it for protonmail I won't get
into too deep into that again it's all
about personal preference you can
basically make your decision out of
protonmail and the others that are going
to be looking at the second one is tour
box the tour mailbox now this is more in
line with what I would use and basically
if we go to the Welcome menu it's going
to say welcome to toe box this is a
hidden mailbox service only accessible
from toe so there is no clear web
version there is no connection between
toe box and the public Internet all
messages are sent and received with toe
box right so just sign up for a new toe
box and start sending and receiving
email within toe all right pretty pretty
cool so you can you can basically just
sign up for an account right here and it
is free so you can basically enter your
nickname your email address and name
password and capture and basically add
your mailbox might be asking yourself
why is this so cool well for me I've
used a talk box before I just love its
simplicity it's really easy to create
it's an account and it's the the mail
box is very simple you can give people
your email address over the deeper when
you can communicate through them I might
be asking so what type of security do
they use well basically as this is the
standard email system communications
between you the server and the server to
MTA transport are encrypted as they
established within the Tor network so
basically your message is already
encrypted because they are traveling
through the Tor relay
basically what it offers you is a
mailbox and an email address and wave
mail access through squirrelmail so
pretty pretty good
you need free absolutely free so this is
one of my personal favorites I would
actually recommend this for beginners
the next one is bit message now bit
message has been there for quite a while
now and very very very very simple
website I think this is done in basic
HTML you can basically register you can
set up effect frequently asked questions
and basically basically what bit
messages is a gateway that will
basically to connect bit message with an
email without the need of any software
so it allows you the bit message network
the same way you use email today so it's
completely free no advertisements
anywhere no tracking so all of these
really really good features are terms of
registration you have your setup guide
right here which we will look at briefly
so basically this website use JavaScript
to protect email addresses if you read
this text you have javascript disabled
in this case replace all hashes with a
at a document blah blah blah so this is
really just an advanced bit message
email client really advanced I would
okay it's a very good service but I
would not recommend this for beginners
and really this is something you get
into when you when you're moving into
like when you're using many email
addresses for example you create a
website on the Deep Web and you want to
use many email addresses this is the
service you would use because it's more
of a mail gateway now the last one which
is also a very good one is mail to tour
all right now mail to tour has a very
good website it's an anonymous email
service provider it's a free anonymous
email service to protect your privacy
all right so it allows anyone to send
and receive mail anonymously while via
web mail or email clients you will need
to have the top browser installed on
your computer to access mail to tour so
it only works on the on the Deep Web of
the doclet now it's a very very simple
website and you basically just go about
it by registering for an account
it's a bit of a slow attack but it's
very good service nonetheless so again
very very simple registration username
password to confirm your password it has
a CAPTCHA and you can submit your query
and then log in and then access your
mailbox and send and receive email
addresses email emails really not email
addresses so that's basically it for
this video guys these are the basically
I think the best email providers on the
Deep Web right now and hopefully you can
find one that you like and one that you
will hopefully be using for a long time
to come anyway guys thank you so much
for watching this video just to remind
you the links are going to be in the
resources folder if you want to access
any of these links anyway if you have
any questions just let me know in the
Qin a section of the course thank you so
much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
