with another video and it's been too
long since I've made a video I know guys
I'm really really sorry but you know as
I've said on Twitter that's where I was
making all the updates and that's what
I'll be making any updates I got really
ill and you know I just couldn't record
any videos I was absolutely sick my head
was really really in a bad state and
then on top of all of that I had to
travel and I had some work to do whilst
I was traveling so it was really really
just a stressful week or not to take
anything away from you guys but that's
basically what's been going all on my
end but I managed to finish everything
into good health now I've recovered from
the illness that I had and I'm pretty
much good to go now so we were working
on a Python for ethical hacking and this
is the next project that we're going to
be working on and that is to create a
password cracker a brute force password
cracker but in this case we're going to
be creating a an FTP an FTP port a
brute-force attack type of thing we will
just be using Python as I've said to
create this so thank you guys so much
for the support you guys have been
supporting me through the period when I
was not uploading videos and you know
thank you so very much for the support
I'm back and we are good to go so make
sure you have IntelliJ open whatever
you're using to write your Python
scripts I'm gonna be using this on Kali
Linux now and as I said we're going to
be creating an FTP port brute force
script of course it's not going to be
very potent but we'll make it as we go
along so the first thing we need to do
is we need to create a new Python file
which i have already so make sure you do
that I've named mine FTP cracker and now
we can start importing our libraries so
we can say we get the first library we
need to import is the socket library
which will allow us to connect to a port
or a socket so import sockets right and
that's the
the next one as the re library vigil
which will allow us to use regular
expressions I'm sure most of you who are
familiar with Python know what this is
so import re like so and the last one is
the import sys import sys which again is
for reading and storing files and
passwords again that will be creating
but for now just us let's leave it to
that alright so we're done with
importing the modules that we need now
we need to move along to creating our
function
alright so let's create our function
that will actually connect to the IP
that obviously we are trying to connect
to the FTP port which is the port 21 but
in this case of course you have to
specify the IP that you want to connect
to so we need to create our our sorry
our function here and I'm just gonna
call it connection like so and in there
we or we have to declare a few things
and the one is the IP number to use the
user and the password alright because we
have got an error now this is a very
very important thing now if you get an
error here it's basically gonna tell you
that the name is expected and what this
is is it's telling you that this pass is
a reserved word which means that it is a
reserved word by the programming
language and it means that you cannot
use it in any form of your expression so
let's just change this to pass W which
will make it password so we understand
what that means all right so now again :
and let's go in and let's start
declaring all the stuff that we need so
the first thing is we're just going to
create a variable sock to declare the
socket so sock sock let me remember
socket is it socket yes so okay dot
socket I'm sure you guys are familiar
with this okay dot socket and
Sauk owes its socket here socket dot AF
whoops AF and we have to first this is
to allow us to use the IP so I net ipv4
address specifically and then we need
the sock dot I stream
hmm let me just remember what that was
so yeah we have to stream so comma
socket dot sock socket dot sock was it
socket dot sock stream I believe is that
the correct one I'm not sure here let me
just see that is the correct one so
socket dot sock stream yeah
sock stream that's the one all right it
was actually supposed to be in capital I
actually forgot that that's really
really weird of me I remember doing this
a lot of times but anyway so that's
gonna be for the ipv4 IP now we need to
print out a statement saying that it's
going to try to connect to the IP so
print and in here we'll say something
like trying coops let me just do that
again
trying like so and in there we'll just
use the IP so we'll display the IP right
so we're using concatenation here and we
can use some more concatenation so the
IP oops you can use a colon there and
again concatenation after the IP we're
going to use the user another
concatenation oops
plus concatenation there whoops let me
just turn that into single quotes and so
basically say trying the AP and the
username plus the password that we have
entered or in this case we are going to
specify again you can create a database
and connect it to that and we'll work
just fine
so password
password it's gonna just suggest that or
right and I believe that's all the
variables that we're going to be using
that is gonna try again it's just
essentially it's just telling the user
that it's trying it's not it started
anything so the next thing we need to do
is we need to connect to the port right
so we specify the IP and then we specify
the port which in this case is going to
be port 21 because we're trying to brute
force an FTP port alright so let's move
on swiftly so sock dot let me remember
connect as it connect yes and the self
and address not connect IP which is
going to be the we can just use any port
here so on sixty eight point zero point
one and we can just use a comma and we
can specify the port which is 21 all
right so we're getting a few errors here
and that's probably because I'm not
using the correct syntax for IPS and
ports so that's gonna be the port not
again as I said this is you can specify
any IP of course we're going to be
implementing features into this that
will allow us to allow the user to enter
his own IP and maybe the port that they
want to connect to all right so now
we've moved away from that now let's
create a variable data that will store
the data that is gonna receive so data
is equals to sock dot receive all right
so it's receiving data in the form of
twenty ten twenty four all right so like
so and then we need to that's the data
received so now we need to send a
username and password
combo or the combination to check all
right so sock dot send so it's connected
and it's received connected received so
sock dot send and now we have to specify
the user so user like so
and we're using the concatenation and
we're gonna say user oops I keep on
doing making a mistake that's very weird
alright so user and then we just need to
end the statement so instead of doing
that I'm just going to end this
statement I hope you guys remember to do
this so R and whoops that's actually
supposed to be /r /n from not mistaken
all right so that's that so I've sent
the username alright and now we have to
receive their username which will be
stored in data as well so data is equal
to sock oops
sock dot receive again inform of 1024
like so alright and that's done now we
can basically say sock dot receive the
password I'm pretty sure we have to send
the password but let me just remember
what the exact one yes I think we
probably have to send the password so
sock dot send the password so let me
just suck dot send the password or the
me so password also it like so because
we're actually searching for the name so
we will be specifying password and we
can just end this statement as we did
there so I don't know I made that
mistake there alright so again our and n
whoops I keep on making that same
mistake R and n let me just specify the
quotations here like so I can just close
that up like so alright so now we're
basically sending the password and then
we're gonna receive is equal to sock dot
receive and in that's in there gonna be
that in the form of 1024 me just correct
that right now
all right now we are getting into the
interesting stuff so now we need to
basically send the data all right so we
have sent the data we need to now send
it with so that we basically going to be
using the sock dot send so s dot send I
believe is the correct on OS it's
actually sock and keep on forgetting or
dice what I actually created myself
pardon me
so sock tots and quit so we're just
going to say something like quit that's
after its sent and again we can just
specify the we can just make it close
and end like so we can just specify that
just bring that up here and there all
right so we can just get rid of this no
like so and that's that so we've sent
the data and now we can say sock dot
close to close the connection dot close
and in there will not specify anything
else now since we've actually just added
using the function that will actually
connect will allow us to connect to the
IP and the port and obviously send the
username and password we now have
actually have to return the data because
we want the data to be returned so
return data and that's going to be that
for the function we have ended the
function and we're returning the data
because that's the information that we
require now essentially what we have to
do is you have to just specify so we're
going to say user is equal to we can
just create one user and say user one
all right something is simple is that
cuz we're done with a function we can
just specify our own stuff right so spaz
word is equal to we can create a list
right and again saying here password one
we're just creating this for testing
purposes so password to and something
like password three yeah something as
simple as that so we have three
bastards with one username of course the
FTP is not going to be running but again
this is just for testing purposes now
what we have to do is we have to use the
for loop so we're gonna say path for
password in passwords right so for
password in passwords we're gonna say
all the trenches we have to print out I
still remember this actually connection
yes IP username and as you can see it's
gonna already specify that all right so
IP user and the password so again in
here we can just specify the IP 168 oops
point zero point one right and then we
can just say user and the US word
alright like so simple as that and we're
probably getting the error because we
are supposed to specify it like so
alright pretty pretty cool cuz we're
actually using this data right here now
if we run this which we probably should
let me just save this and run will get a
few errors and that's because obviously
the FTP it's probably gonna turn nothing
because that's not what we have in terms
of credentials but let's actually just
run it and as you can see it's gonna
tell us that the connection is refused
because indeed there is no FTP running
on that IP address or there is no open
port on port 21 again you can specify we
can change you to port 80 right which
I'm sure you guys know and if we run
this now let's see what we get it's very
very interesting as you can see we're
gonna we're getting something object has
no attribute receive oh looks like I had
a typo there so receive like so and let
me just get rid of that see
and if we save this and run it now we
should get something interesting there
we are so trying username/password and
for some reason it's not ending so again
it's going to keep on running the loop
because using the for loop until it
finds but again there is no FTP there
running there and there therefore there
is no username and password and you get
the idea of course you can test this to
your liking and run it on a virtual
machine it's really very interesting it
does work again you can create a word
list
what will be looking to add more
features on it so this video was pretty
pretty interesting we've looked at
creating our own brute-force type thing
a brute-force script but again we are
using our own combination of usernames
and passwords which is really not very
useful but again could be making it more
advanced so that's basically it for this
