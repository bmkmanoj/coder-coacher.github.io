with another video and welcome back to
the web application penetration testing
series alright so in this video we are
going to be looking at web application
firewalls or WAAFs as they're called now
this may be a new term for you and do
not worry this is now when we move into
a more professional level and again this
is what I'm been talking about is most
people are almost documented
documentation out there won't cover the
most important industry standards you
know now when I'm talking about web
application firewalls what I mean is is
these are the protection or these are
the mitigation procedures put in place
to protect a web application from
attacks obviously now as a penetration
tester or if you're looking at it from a
white hat or a black hat perspective
from white hat perspective it's always
important to have a Web Application
Firewall and I'll probably make another
video showing you how to set it up it's
really easy and it's free and it'll
probably remove about 20% of attacks ok
so that's if you're a white hat now if
you're a black and you're targeting or
you're performing a penetration test
legally on a web site or web application
usually what the employer will tell you
is they'll give you a scope of the
project and again they might give you
the source code etc etc you get the idea
you have your white box testing black
box and gray box but coming back to the
firewall most of them will know that
there is a file and that's because the
person who set the website up for them
in terms of hosting or the web
application for them will in most cases
on a professional level have a Web
Application Firewall now you might be a
bit confused and you might be saying
well why is this important when
performing a penetration test well this
is important because firstly it's
something that most pen testers overlook
and if you know this you've got an ace
up your sleeve
all right so essentially what's
happening is if it's being used if a web
application firewall is being used you
obviously first need to detect it and
I'm going to show you how to detect it
in this video using a special tool that
I don't think you
ever heard of but it's also industry
standard so this is a really secret I
don't know for some reason it's not just
it's something that just hasn't caught
up yet but hopefully after this video
you know about it
alright so essentially the purpose of a
Web Application Firewall is it protects
the web application you know from a
firewall point of view in the sense that
it blocks attacks as a one would expect
them to come now what does this mean for
you well this means that you will need
to in you will need to manipulate any
type of data that is going to be encoded
all right so what this means is if
you're if you're performing a
penetration test that involves you
manipulating data and sending it back to
the web application similar to what we
did in the previous video then you need
to encode it in a specific way to bypass
the firewall otherwise it will be
blocked by the firewall and I'm sure
most of you have actually done this
before if you're just amateur
penetration testers and you've just
begun you'll find that for some reason
your requests aren't being processed and
that's because they've there is a
firewall set up to prevent these
malicious requests from being processed
okay so again web application firewall
is really really important now looking
at the tool we'll be using the tool has
actually a very very funny name if for
some of you might find it hilarious it
is called wofe wolf now for those of you
have heard of it you pretty much already
know how to detect a web application
firewall but it's really very very
simple all right so just open up your
terminal and what you want to do is you
want to type in wife wolf all right so
this is how it is going to be spelt so
it's worth wolf with a two with two
zeros and the syntax is pretty simple if
I just hit enter
as you can see wife Wolf's a web
application firewall detection tool
alright so credits go to the author it's
actually it's a tool that's been there
since the I think almost the last
version of backtrack and the first
version of Kali so again quite an old
tool when I say old I mean you know I
mean that with respect given the fact
that it's really really useful and I've
used it a lot because it saves you a lot
of time and what I'm talking about is so
let's say we want to scan
okay in this case I have my WordPress
server running here and as you can see
it's the site is being hosted on 192
point one sixty eight point one point
101 alright so I have that IP opened up
in my browser and as you can see it's a
wordpress site and this site is
vulnerable and this is what we're going
to be performing later on the
penetration test on but for now we want
to find out whether it has a firewall
now by default I know it doesn't have a
firewall but let's see what waffle foot
tell us alright so the syntax is very
simple as you can see you just type in
wife woof and you enter your URL or your
URL so you can enter as many as you like
okay so it'll give you an example they
are out to go about it make sure you
enter your HTTP or HTTPS protocol and we
just let's try that out so laughs woof
and we specify our protocol HTTP in this
case and the IP address 192.168.1.1 oh
one all right now in this case I'm
pretty sure that it won't detect any web
application firewall so let me just hit
enter and as you can see no web
application firewall detected by the
generic detection all right now this is
very very advanced and this tool is an
industry standard and if it does tell
you that there is no web application
firewall then by all means I can
guarantee that it does not have a
firewall now let's look at one of my
sites that I currently own it's a site
that I use it's actually my web
development company that obviously we
use for web development now I've
protected this site with a web
application firewall provided by cloud
fair now for those of you web developers
and when you're performing your hosting
you know that using cloud fair is
awesome because it allows you to
optimize your site for speed it allows
you to purge assets and make your site
faster protected and again protected
from DDoS attacks etc etc all the good
stuff so let's see if it will actually
detect this so I'm going to type in wife
wolf I know that name is really really
funny the protocol is HTTP HTTPS like so
and I'm going to specify the site which
is elkhorn studios.com all right el
cajon studios.com and if I enter as you
can see it's going to start checking the
site
give it a few seconds it shouldn't take
any much you know a lot of time and as
you can see the site Algren studios.com
is behind cloud fare all right now what
this means is that most of the most of
the attacks that involve manipulation of
data will be in some way blocked and you
know you won't get your response back
the way you wanted it and the render
wouldn't be the same all right now again
as you can see it's detected that it is
behind a Web Application Firewall now
the next step is how to encode these how
to encode and code iam your requests
that you're going to be sending to the
web application and that's what we'll be
looking at as we increase the security
level using the the damn affordable web
application all right so I thought this
is something that I really need to share
with you again it's going to really help
you and I promise you this is something
that you know if you go for a job
interview or you're performing a
penetration test for a company this is
something that most of the network of
systems administrators are very keen on
they want to know whether you really
know your stuff and whether you're
really up to date with how to detect
first of all because information
gathering is really important and as you
can see this tool is fantastic and once
you know there's a firewall you then
have a better idea of how to target and
you won't be wasting time again that's
something that most of the amateurs or
beginners do they waste a lot of time
trying different commands that they've
seen but if they find it under they see
that it doesn't work and they're like
how's this possible am i doing something
wrong the truth is the web application
is probably well protected so again you
know do not use this for any malicious
purposes again this is simply an
information gathering tool and yeah
that's going to be it for this video I
hope you found value in this video if
you did please leave a like or thumbs up
depending on on what you call it if you
have any questions leave them in the
comment section on my social networks or
you can write up your questions on the
website and I'll be happy to answer them
thank you so much for the support guys
and I'll be seeing you in the next video
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
