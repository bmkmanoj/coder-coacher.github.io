with another video and in this video I'm
gonna be showing you how you can destroy
spying elements and tracking elements in
Windows 7 8 8.1 and 10 so basically any
version of Windows you have after
Windows Vista obviously this does not
work for Windows XP and Windows Vista
now this program will also help you
remove some elements of telemetry and
will also allow you to to disable
Windows Defender and Cortana if you wish
this will also allow you to remove any
metro applications that you don't want
in your variant of Windows obviously
Windows 8.1 and 10 because there are no
Metro apps in Windows 7 and don't worry
it'll not harm your system because you
can create a restore point if you don't
feel safe so you're all good to go there
so you're gonna have to download this
package it have archived in the link in
description you can just download it
small file about less than one megabyte
and the program will be in the archives
um please do note that this program is
not mine I did not trade this program
you can have the author's contacts in
the program in the About tab so yeah
it's not my program of full credit goes
to the author please check him out so
when you open this application they're
going to see a the first one we call
main and you have a destroy Windows 10
spying button there don't worry if it
says Windows 10 it works for all
versions of Windows from windows 7
obviously and you can check that out
here as it says there so yeah then you
wanna head over setting so now this is
where you control whatever you want to
remove so you can create a system
restore point delete the keylogger
and telemetry and add spy domains all of
that good stuff
disable private settings if you disable
Windows 10 I mean Windows Defender sorry
set default Windows Photo Viewer
disables fight asks and you can also
enable professional mode to change any
of this if you want to and then you have
the option of deleting Windows 10 Metro
apps and you won't just select whatever
don't need you so that's amazing and you
also give you this warning that Metro
applications once deleted cannot be
recovered so please keep that in mind
you can only restore the key loggers and
all of these settings or from the
applications you're deleting so that's
pretty much it just select what you want
to remove and that's it at a lot of get
rid of all the bloatware that you have
in your system pretty cool and in acute
utilities you can edit the hosts file
yourself and restore it to the previous
settings that you have before you
deleted all of this stuff and you can
also delete all they were traps from
here delete onedrive which is not a good
thing because onedrive is pretty cool
and you have your UAC here and you can
enable it or disable it you have Windows
Update and able disabled so it has
everything here that you need to
anything you wanted to control in
Windows your version of Windows so this
is pretty amazing as so all you have to
do once you've selected what you want to
just hit destroy Windows 10 spying I'll
take about less than one minute to just
complete and yeah I have already done
mine so gonna do mine now but once you
hit that it's gonna ask you gonna
restart your system and bang you're
gonna be done so if this video does help
