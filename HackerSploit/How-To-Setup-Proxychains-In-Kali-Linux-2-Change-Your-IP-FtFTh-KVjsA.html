with another video and welcome back to
the ethical hacking course today we are
going to be talking about proxy chains
so this is actually going to be the
second proxy chain tutorial in the
previous video I talked about proxy
chains what they are how they work and I
introduced you guys to the proxy change
dot configuration file so in this video
I'm going to go into some really
advanced stuff when it comes to proxy
change I'm going to show how to set it
up I'm going to show you that it
actually works live so I hope you guys
are ready so let's get to it
so like any other ethical hacking videos
it all begins in the humble shell of the
terminal so open up your terminal and
let's get started so in the previous
video I was using the Nano editor and
I'm going to keep on using the Nano
editor now let me explain why you guys
might be asking yourself well there's
the same editor and there's so many
others why aren't I using any of those
well I'm trying to keep these tutorials
as beginner friendly as possible so that
almost everyone can understand them and
it's very easy for them to grasp the
concept of editing a configuration file
in the terminal so let's get started
Nano and we're going to access the proxy
change your configuration file we're
going to go to the EDC or HC and proxies
chains got configuration and let's open
that up now in the previous video I
explained why we need to uncomment the
dynamic chain that's basically
activating the dynamic chain now the
dynamic chain will basically allow the
IPA IP addresses to change in a very
dynamic in a very dynamic manner and I
explained that in the previous video
about how it works for strict chain is
going to it's basically going to go
through a series of IPs but they're
basically it's easier to detect because
those IPS will be just repeating
themselves and a random Jane this is
basically one of the worst ways of proxy
chain anonymization and for very obvious
reasons and omit connection will be done
by a random proxy and that if your proxy
it doesn't work you're basically stumped
and you have to restart the process all
over again so let's go all the way down
now I also told you to uncomment the
proxy DNS requests nolleke for DNS data
this will basically will will prevent
leaking of DNS data so you're even if
you're not using a custom DNS that's in
not in your country it'll actually it
will actually just follow the IPS DNS to
whichever country that's in so this is
very important make sure that's not
active and you can do that by
uncommenting as I did with the the
dynamic chain up there so let's go down
all the way to the example section now
in the example section I told you guys
to take a look at the format of the of
basically a proxy chain or a proxy fire
DNS works now this is the proxy fire DNS
this is socks5 that's what we're going
to be using because if the CSIs and it's
the fastest really and this is the
address of the proxy not nothing really
to say there that's basically just the
address you then have the port you guys
know what ports are and right here a lot
of people have been asking me what this
is well basically this is the username
and password examples so if you actually
buy a proxy or a proxy fire or a proxy
chain in most cases they'll usually give
you a username and password and this is
where you get to enter them so we're
going to use tor and the proxy chains in
in in interlacing together so they're
actually going to work together so let
me explain how we're going to do that so
in the proxy list section here this is
actually where we configure the proxies
as you can see the defaults have been
set to tour but it's being used in the
Sox for but we don't want that but
instead of removing that we're just
going to use this one so go to the line
just below Sox 4 and we're going to add
Sox 5 and you want to hit the tab button
on your keyboard and that's basically
you're going to follow the format of the
command above it so it's going to form a
follow the format just above which is a
very good format one twenty seven point
zero point zero two point one and 90/50
alright now why are we using one twenty
seven point 0.01 firstly that's the
basic tour a proxy configuration
that's where the IP is and this is
basically your IP n this is how you can
actually test by running this to test if
the proxy chains are working so Sox 5
we've actually configured and to be
honest we're actually done here now I'm
going to show you the proxy chains
working with an example or actually I'm
just going to run it live so we are
going to save this file and to save the
file you want to hit ctrl o and it's
going to ask you to write to write the
changes and I'm going to enter and it's
written and to exit the Nano editor hit
ctrl X alright we are going to clear the
console and finally we can begin
checking so the first thing we're going
to do is you're going to check if the
door service is running most likely it's
not running so let's check DOS this
actually it is running well hold on all
right so what I'm going to do is what
I'm going to do is is I'm going to close
this terminal and I'm going to open the
other one and I'm going to stop it stop
actually hold on its service or stop all
right and I'm stopped it if yours is not
open don't worry just skip this step and
we're going to start it again service go
start all right and I'm going to set the
reservist or start and it's going to
start the toaster this not we can
actually begin with the proxy change as
I explained we're going to using we're
going to be using the tour proxies with
the basically one using the top proxies
with the proxy change configuration file
at least for this video so the way to
test this is we're going to type proxy
change proxy chains we're going to use a
browser I'm going to use Firefox that's
basically oops my typing today is pretty
bad Firefox you can use iceweasel and
basically I usually just Firefox so
we're going to use Firefox anyway and
we're going to enter a test website to
test whether the proxies are working I'm
going to use
wwe.com and the reason I'm using this is
not anything particular
I just want also recommend this search
engine to you guys I know you guys are
very fond of Google but doctor goo is
one of the sites or search engines that
does not keep your IP addresses and
crackly so it in terms of anonymity and
when you are performing like who is
scans on targets I would recommend that
that go it just keeps you safer but
anyway we're using proxy chains so all
you have to do is hit enter and it's
going to start proxy chains and it's
going to open Firefox and it's going to
open www.google.com
just give it its time and it should
start it should open up doctor go and
there you have it it's opened up doctor
go but you might be asking how do I know
I'm anonymous or how do I know I'm safe
well firstly let's look at the terminal
so as you can see you're going to see
that it's basically accepted these IP
then you don't have to worry about what
it outputs here so to test it I'm going
to check for DNS leaks now how do we
check for DNS leaks were basically just
going to do a duck taco search check for
dns leaks alright and it's going to
hopefully return some results that was
very quick and we're going to test the
DNS leak test all right so let's open
that up alright so as you can see it
said my address is 170 650 898 from
London United Kingdom I can tell you for
a fact that I'm not in London in United
Kingdom I'm well I'm really really I'm
really far from here so as you can see
it's actually working and if we start
with standard tests to test whether any
DNS information was leaked regarding my
real location we'll see that it's
probably going to give us a UK DNS or is
actually given as a German DNS so that's
actually even better it just makes you
more anonymous now you guys might also
be asking how do we know this is working
and my P will be changing well to do
that I'm just going to close this
browser and I'm going to say
servus store stop or I could say service
store we start to save the time alright
and once that's done I'm going to clear
this and I'm going to say I'm going to
run the previous command the proxy again
Firefox dr. go.com just to test that and
let it start up again and their UI
should start up again depending on which
proxy it's using it will either be
faster or slower if it doesn't work
don't worry just give it a few seconds
and it should it should work because it
will go through this the series of proxy
changes you can see here and some will
be denied and some will work anyway it's
return duck taco so we can actually form
the DNS search again so to check for DNS
DNS leaks right again very fast let's
check for DNS leaks and we should
hopefully have a different IP and there
you are guys it's actually giving us an
IP from Prague the Czech Czech Republic
so if I booted that let's check what our
DNS is giving us let's see what DNS it's
giving us very nice is running the test
a bit slow but it's worth it where they
are performing scans or SQL injection
and there we are Germany so this is
actually pretty good and I've actually
shown you guys that it really does work
if you use this method you're going to
be anonymous and that's all I can really
say knock yourselves out go ahead and do
anything you want this is really useful
for for though for people who are
complaining about scanning the N lab dot
scan me dot n mob dot org now you can
actually just change your IP and keep on
using their domain for educational
purposes obviously anyway guys you can
see that it's working on mine anima like
now I hope you guys enjoyed this video
or hope this video helped you if you did
leave a like please share it because a
lot of other people need this
information and if they can get it
that'll be just great if you have any
questions the comments section you can
contact me on my kick or on any of my
social media on my social networks
anyway guys thank you guys so much for
watching the video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
