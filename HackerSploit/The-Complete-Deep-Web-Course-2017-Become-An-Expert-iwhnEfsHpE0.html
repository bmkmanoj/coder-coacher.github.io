just want to basically give you guys

three weeks and I've actually published
it to udemy for those of you who don't
know what udemy's udemy is a great site
for courses and basically online classes
where you can actually buy classes or
you can get them for free
so I actually created the complete Deep
Web course for 2017 and this is
basically going to be taking you from
the beginner to an expert all right now
the reason I'm showing you this is
because I know most of you are really
interested in the Deep Web and you want
you want to know almost everything
regarding the Deep Web so basically this
course right here will take you through
everything that you need in order for
you to get well acquainted with the Deep
Web and obviously use it too for
whatever you want to use it for I have
nothing against you whatever you may
want to use it for so as you can see
there are about 20 lectures right now
I've currently currently updating it
almost on a daily basis with new courses
so this course is about five days old
and I have already got about 2,000
students enrolled now I I I will be
giving away about 10 to 50 copies of
this course for free I'm going to be
doing that on Friday it's basically like
a giveaway to say thank you to everyone
for everything by the way the giveaway
will be a random so I'll be selecting
the people randomly and I'll send you
the link to which the way you can get
the course for free um for the rest of
you guys um if you're interested in the
course it's only priced at $20 that's
that's really not as much as what this
course is worth because it has a lot of
information and it's going to be
constantly updated it it currently has
three supplemental course resources you
a certificate of completion so is that
well you can basically do whatever you
want with that I mean but that's
something at least so I've worked really
hard on this course for the simple
reason that people want this information
