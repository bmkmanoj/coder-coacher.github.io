again with another video now in this
video I'm gonna be showing you how to
clean and maintain your android device
and keep it free from junk so we all
know that Android devices
get really cluttered after you use them
for about a few months and what tends to
happen is device gets slower so I'm
going to show you how to avoid all of
this and keep your device clean and
smooth as first day so yeah let's get to
this guys alrighty guys so what you want
to do is download these applications the
link will be in in the description so
just head over to the Google Play Store
if you're on your phone instead and I
want you to download CCleaner which is
an application that cleans all the junk
and stuff that you have that you don't
need in your on your phone sorry about
the Wi-Fi am loading very slow slowly so
we here we are see cleaner just install
it and open it as simple as that now
it's going to give you an overview of
your storage how much you have how much
you've used up and as well as your RAM
how much you have and how much you've
used up and it'll tell you when your
last clean ones
so mine was five days ago I like always
like doing this weekly just to make sure
my device is clean and fresh so all you
have to do is analyze just hit analyze
and I'll say detecting applications and
just let it do its thing as you can see
my cache already has about 500 megabytes
or 400 megabytes of data that is useless
so just let it finish scanning and yeah
so after it's done scanning if you're
running Android marshmallow don't worry
about this I'm going to show you how you
can clean your cache and RAM basically
what this means is that with Android
marshmallow you have to do this manual
you have to clear your your RAM and
running applications manually but I'll
show you how to do that in a second so
basically all you're cleaning here is
the useless storage or useless files
that you don't need on your own device
so it's going to tell you downloads you
have some files in your downloads that
you don't need I like to keep that empty
folders most important your thumbnail
cache call logs usually like to keep
that really clean and the processes just
hit that and hit clean and there we go
it's going to say cleaning and yeah just
give it a few seconds and it will be
done
and as you can see 613 megabytes has
been saved now this is really a lot if
you really really are a power user and
you need your storage forever you're
doing so yeah that's pretty much see
cleaner and must-have application to
keep your device Android device clean so
the next application going to download
is called SD made now this application
has two versions the pro version and the
new normal free version you can just use
the free version it works just as good
well but with a bit of little
restrictions so what you have here when
you open this application is basically
you have your corpse finder you have
your system cleaner and app cleaner and
databases now we've already cleaned the
application cache with ccleaner so what
we need to do right now is optimize you
databases find dead files and just clean
the system up a little bit so hit scan
and it's going to start scanning your
system and you have to have root access
for these guys sorry I didn't mention
that earlier but you have to have root
access
so just grant it root access and there
we are once you graduate root access
going to same it's going to start
scanning so just let it scan takes a
while actually
quite a while actually about 2 to 3
minutes so just give it its time
and you can just cancel the app cleaner
because we have already done that so you
don't really need that to be running but
if you want to buy the pro version go
ahead and you can have you don't need
600 then but I always recommend ccleaner
because it does its job really well
without any any problems so this is the
most important the last process that is
running the databases because this is
what tends to make your device really
slow and if you don't clean your
databases you will realize that your
phone is running really slow and you're
like what the hell so yeah these are
basically the two applications that you
need in my opinion I'm not saying that
these are the applications that will fix
every problem I'm just saying that it'll
help you keep your device clean so just
hit run now and I'll say it late and
just let it clean all the stuff that you
don't need on the advice and obviously
that's gonna take a while but yeah once
it's done you'll be you will be your
system will be fresh and clean now I
recommend you do this about weekly if
you can do it weekly just try doing it
every two weeks or or monthly but
whatever whatever you need them this
application is there for you to do
whatever you want it to do in terms of
cleaning so yeah guys that's been how to
keep your own device clean and as fast
as it can be as first day you bought it
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
