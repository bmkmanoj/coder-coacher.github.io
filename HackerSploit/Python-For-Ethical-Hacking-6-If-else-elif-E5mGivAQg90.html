with another video and welcome back to
Python for ethical hacking in this video
we are going to be looking at the if or
the elsif and the else
conditional statements so let's get
started so I'm gonna be explaining this
or showing you guys this using a very
very simple example and we're going to
be testing a value a number first
against another number and from that we
can see how to use conditional
statements to make logical decisions
decisions so to speak so let's get
started so I'm gonna create a variable
and I'm going to call it let's create a
test program and this is gonna be a
program that will test your marks or
your results in a test against
predefined grade your grade points or
your specific grading systems to
determine whether you've passed or not
but in this case we're going to be just
using the variable let's get a variable
a variable called marks and marks are
going to be equal to and these are our
custom arcs that we can edit so let's
start off with something like a hundred
I know that is quite is quite it's just
really just missing the point but just
go along with me
so the marks are 100 and now we can get
started with our if statement so it's
very very simple to use the if statement
is you just start off with if all right
and in this case we're saying if the
marks all right and now we use the we
use the the relational operators all
right which are the greater than less
than greater than or equal to alright
and less than equal to equal to and not
equal to which again I would be
explaining as we move along they're
really very simple to understand so in
this case we're saying if machs are
greater than let's say 80 we can move on
to the next line let me explain that
sorry I skipped over that really really
fast so if marks are greater than 80 and
then use a colon alright and now once
you hit enter you're going to notice
something interesting a little bit of
indentation has happened and this is
again very very common and very
Orton to understanding Python when you
indent it is like a second part to the
first line so you're it's almost like
you're saying what do you want me to do
for after this line all right so in this
case we're saying if marks are greater
than 80 so Python is asking what do you
want to do if the marks are greater than
80 in this case we want to print out you
have yeah
past so let's say 80 is the past Mach
all right so pretty simple to understand
and then once we are done we hit enter
and it's going to still be indented so
once you're done with that you want to
just backspace and I'll take you to the
first line now the other statement is
the else if for if else I'm pretty sure
you must be familiar with that if you're
into programming and this is just adding
another conditional statement to the
equation so let's say we had another
mark or another set of marks and let's
say and to do to use the else if which
in Python is denoted by E L I if all
right so else if marks let's add a a
mock in which if you do not perform over
that Maki or failed so in this case
let's say marks if marks are less than
40 we can then say print out you have
failed right as simple as that
all right so let's test this out let's
save and let me run this alright so once
I run this it's gonna tell me of past
because we've already given the value of
marks as a hundred but let's enter
something interesting let's enter 81 all
right if we save this for sure it's
gonna sell fast again there we are
if I entered let's say 34 or 35 and I
run this you can see it's gonna see your
failed so we know that the past mark and
the fail mark are both working but what
if we enter the value from 40 to 80 hmm
what's gonna happen there very very
interesting let's try something like 50
right if we run this you're gonna see
that it's good not gonna display any
result and that's because we have not
given it an option
to use so in this case it's going to
display nothing and now to simply denote
this we can essentially what we can say
is this let me just get rid of that
essentially what we can say is this is
that we can now use else alright
else is simply going to just it's going
to be used in case none of your mocks
are in or none of your mocks
are equal or in the range of 80 to 100
and zero to 40 so in this case let's say
else and then we use the :
because we are not comparing it to
anything and then we can print out you
performed average Lee correct whoops
that's wrong spelling all right so then
we can say try again harder okay pretty
cool if we run if we save this and run
it you can see now it's gonna say you've
performed averagely so if you have
performed from 40 to 80 that's an
average mock if if you performed
anything below 40 mark see that's a fail
if you performed anything above 80
you've passed all right so it's a pretty
simple program to understand and it
works really really well now let's use
something a little bit different let's
use strings or in the in this case let's
use numbers I mean names so what I'm
gonna be doing is I'm gonna just be
using a simple example and we're just
gonna be comparing names so I'm gonna
create a simple login type of script
here so I'm gonna same name that's a
variable a name is gonna be equal to
Alexis all right that's my name and then
here I can say if name and now instead
of using the relational operators we use
pythons very own syntax and that is if
name is alright if name is and then we
don't use the equal right if name is
Alexis right we hit enter
whoops we forgot our colon we
and then we can see print and then we
can say welcome back right now we can we
have also another situation we can say
elsif if name is let's say John and we
can print out you
oops let me just go and correct that you
are not an admin alright so let's say
John is not an administrator okay
so pretty cool we're moving along
smoothly and let's save this and run
this let's see what we'll get all right
it's gonna say welcome back what if we
change the value to something completely
different again it's not going to
display anything because it doesn't
match any of the results so there we go
so we can then say let's use the else
because we also obviously need a value
instead of giving it blank we need a
value for any of the options or results
that we might get in this case Lisa so
what if what work what should the
program do if we get a name like Lisa
who should basically print out you do
not have an account please create one
all right and we can just save that and
run it and as you can see it's gonna
tell you you do not have an account
please create one let's use another name
let's use a quite a funny name let's use
hey doc all right and I'm gonna run this
and you're gonna see that it does work
so you do not have an account let's try
it John all right John wants to log in
now and he thinks he's admin but I don't
think he's gonna get that access and as
you can see you are not an admin so
pretty pretty cool and this is where
you'll find most of your login forms
this is basically the structure where
instead what will happen is you will
check the database to find if the
username X or exists all the email
exists and then compare it to the
password and if they do exist it will
log you in if it doesn't
map should L tell you to enter the
correct details or to create a new
account and if you have a special type
of account it will give you the special
type of privileges but that's basically
it for if and else if and the basic
conditional statements we'll be looking
at the for loops and other loops as we
move along and we'll just be moving a
bit fast now and getting more advanced
with object-oriented programming so
that's basically it for this video guys
