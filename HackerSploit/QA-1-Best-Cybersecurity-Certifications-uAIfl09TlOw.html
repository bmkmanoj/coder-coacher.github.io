with another video and welcome to the
first episode of the hackers Floyd Q&amp;amp;A
where you guys post your questions and I
answer them every Saturday so let's get
started with our first episode so this
week another a lot of you guys posted
your questions but we have some of them
and let's get to answering them alright
so the first question is by Ronnie all
right and Ronnie asks do you have any
certifications all right and furthermore
he says if so what are they and which
would you recommend going for I assume
you have Linux plus all right well you
are correct
I do have certifications I have the
certified ethical hacker certification I
have the Linux plus I have network plus
and security plus and finally the last
one that I got very very recently was
the MCS e the microsoft certified
systems engineer' not the MCSA which is
different all right so what I would
recommend going for so I'm assuming
you're trying to get into into the field
of ethical hacking or pen testing
whatever what I would recommend you to
start with is to start with something
like the A+ certification but if you're
good with computers and you've been
using computers for a long time then you
really don't need the A+ certification I
would recommend that you go for the
Network+ Linux plus and then you go for
your certified ethical hacker
certification and then after that you
can do your security plus because the
security plus is going to be quite
advanced and you you don't need to be
doing that before you you do your
certified ethical hacker certification
because essentially once you do you do
your certified ethical hacker you will
move into your your other you know
you're focused certifications which I'll
also be telling you about but for now
just focus on doing the Linux plus
network plus and your certified ethical
hacker certification those are probably
the most important ones to have you can
then also move out to the
security plus alright so that's the
question that Ronnie is asked now let's
look at what other questions we have all
right so the next question is what key
logger does parrot OS have to replace
our old B now this is a question that I
get asked often is you know how what are
the best be log of both of the best key
logger software's and the truth is is
there isn't one and in my opinion if you
are ever going to try and use a key
logger the best way to do that is to the
multiplet air shell using Metasploit
able or Metasploit for that matter sorry
about that
and the reason for that is because when
you create a key logger there's always a
chance for detection even though some of
them will you know probably guarantee
that you won't get detected antivirus
softwares are or if you know obviously
your target I'm going to assume is going
to be running Windows but if you run it
on a linux host then yeah it does make
sense to use be logger and other stuff
like that there are plenty of key logger
software out there or key logger scripts
rather and I wouldn't tell you that
belaga is the best one that was just a
one that I was requested to make as a
review and as you as you saw it was
pretty pretty cool but I'm sure there
are other better ones out there that
yeah we know can can avoid the detection
in addition to that when it comes to key
loggers I'm going to be showing you how
to make your own key logger with C++ and
undetectable one this is literally
undetectable because I'm going to be
using the C++ programming language which
is as I've mentioned many times very
low-level language which will enable us
to run it you know as a system service
and it will be virtually undetectable so
to answer your question there isn't one
that I would recommend I would just
recommend that you get used to if you're
trying to do perform client-side attacks
or that is your focus this learn how to
use Metasploit that's a fantastic tool
if you want to perform attacks like this
all right now let's look at the next
question
all right the next question is posted by
Alexander and Alexander is asking
that I've come across many many times
and the question is what is the best
hacking OS other than Kali Linux all
right this is a question I get a lot and
I don't understand why you guys have a
problem with it you know you just have
to try all of them out and decide which
one works best for you now again in my
opinion I I think Kali Linux is the best
because it's it's at the top of the
chart and when when a distress at the
top and is considered to be the best it
had the people behind it offensive
security are are determined or they
actually they have the need to make sure
that it runs the best and you know they
give it the best features and just
generally it gives them the incentive to
keep on making it better all right when
it comes to power to us
you see power to us is a very very very
good distro the only problem is it it's
not very known even in in the pen
testing industry you know I've been
talking with some really really
experienced you guys in this industry
and they have admitted to me that they
really don't know what part ways is the
cynic wants or twice but it really
didn't convince them at all but I told
them to give it a try now and they have
agreed that as an all-round distribution
that you know provides you with
cryptography you know security and
anonymity
you know encryption and furthermore your
your pen testing toolkit power to us is
at the at the top you know it's better
than it's better than moving to
something like black Arch you know no
offense to black Arch I think that is
more of a of an itch destroy it's for
people who like RT Linux other than you
know you people who like Debian and
stuff like that so in my opinion and
this is again this is very very it's
based on my opinion only and it might
not I might not agree with you or my
opinion might not agree with yours but I
think that the best one other than Kali
Linux will have to be a the parrot OS or
black Arch it just again depends on what
you're comfortable with you know if
you're looking for a all around the
distribution that can give you a
of every a bit of everything then a para
tosse is perfect if you're looking for a
very specialized operating system kali
linux also gives you that you know in
fantastic in fantastic quality alright
so I hope I answered your question
Alexander let's move on to the next
question and now I had to pull one
question from YouTube because the person
asked me to pull it from YouTube alright
so the question is what are some good
budget what are some good budget
wireless adapters that are great for
performing Wireless attacks such as
man-in-the-middle you know
ARP spoofing or stuff like that or
Wireless password cracking there are
lots that fall into this category but
you know the thing that people don't
understand is that only some cards work
great with called-- necks and allow you
to perform these attacks to their
maximum potential now a lot of you guys
have been asking me to perform to show
you guys how to perform or how to crack
a Wi-Fi password No granted that you've
given me this question
I'm guessing and I'm only guessing that
you guys have tried to you know perform
a search on YouTube and found that there
are many videos telling you that it's
really very easy to crack alright the
truth is if you're trying to do this
from your laptop a Wi-Fi card that the
chances of it happening anything less
than two weeks is honestly I mean only
if the password is WEP or WEP encrypted
then it's very very easy it's extremely
easy to crack a WEP key or a WEP key but
when it comes down to WPA you using the
P know any wpa wpa2 it it's it's really
hard because the the handshake process
is different and the authentication
process in terms of the packets is also
different so you really need a powerful
Wi-Fi adapter or a a wireless card for
this and one of my favorites and one
that I've tested personally again this
is um this is all dependent on you there
are a lot but one of the best ones out
there is the tp-link WN
I'm not sure the exact model is but it
should be the tp-link WN 722 n alright
it has to be the first version not the
second version because the first version
was the original and essentially it
allowed you to control every aspect of
the that wireless card you can increase
the transmission power or you know you
can think of a whole lot of settings and
the compatibility with Kali Linux was
fantastic so that's one of the cards
that I would recommend to you if you're
looking for a fantastic you know cheap a
good wireless card if you're a pen
tester for wireless networks and those
are all the questions I received this
week please you know don't be shy in
posting any questions you might have you
know if they're good questions or even
if they are not good questions I am
obliged to answer them irregardless and
I feel this is a good way of us
communicating more directly where I can
answer your questions in more and more
of a better way anyway guys thank you so
