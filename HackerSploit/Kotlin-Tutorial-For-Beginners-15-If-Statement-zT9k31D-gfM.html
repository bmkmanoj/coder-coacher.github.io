in this video I'm basically going to be
explaining what conditional operators
are and how they work so in this section
of the course are going to be going
through all the conditional operators or
as they are also known as the decision
operators where they are basically used
to make decision and function under
certain conditions so let's create our
class and let's get started so I'm going
to create a new continent class and I'm
going to call it our conditional
operators let's call it college for
conditional operators all right and
let's open that let's get rid of this
let's create with the main function
arguments array oops what Ravi why
string photon that is a function now
when we are talking about conditional
operators we basically have a three or
four of them but the first one that I
think for those of you already familiar
with programming we already know this
the first one is if the gift statement
all right the if statement is as it says
is basically it's a conditional operator
so by default it means if what if that's
basically what it's trying to imply so
let me explain this with a simple very
very simple program let's say we say var
let's create a variable a is equal to 20
right and let's create an if statement
saying if we open the brackets all right
now in here you put the conditions
required for this statement so if a is
greater than all right so those are
these are relational operators right so
basically you have your relational
operator here greater than greater than
or equal to 10 which it is already
because it's 20 then that means that we
we then open two curly braces all right
we open two curly braces this is where
we enter the what do what to do once
this condition is met so if if a is
greater than equal to ten which it is
print out so I'm going to say print a we
can this if you say a a is
a is greater than or we can just say a a
is greater then then greater than or
equal to ten that's basically that you
know that's very very simple and if we
run this will basically get that
so let's actually run that so it's going
to tell us a is greater than or equal to
this is a bit basic or in terms of a
program let's actually create something
a bit a bit complete complex as when
compared to this and so we're going to
basically create a program that will ask
the user to input a number and then we
are going to test it if it's larger than
10 and to see whether it really works so
let's say print
let's prompt the user to say please
enter a number all right and we're just
going to prompt it and we're going to
say variable let's say variable number
is supposed to be in an integer format
we know that n is equal to read line
right and that's you basically get the
idea now when we're going to be
basically using we have to convert this
to an integer by the way so this is a
two int if I'm not mistaken actually I
don't know why so Ashley is not giving
me the completion so this is two to
enter that's supposed to be two n right
and we're using that actually that's
supposed to come before that so there we
are so we have converted this to an
integer so now it's going to be stored
as an integer in the variable n so now
you have to run the if statement so if n
is greater than or equals to let's say
ten all right and then we open the curly
braces and we say if n is greater than
equal to ten what we do we say print
we're going to use the concatenation
we're going to say n which is your
number plus concatenation your number is
greater
then ten all right greater than ten so
it's very very simple so that's
basically what we are going to be using
or or you could just say your number is
greater than ten is greater than ten all
right so let's save that and let's see
what we get it what we get and it's
going to say please enter number someone
enter 30 and it's going to say your
number is greater than ten but now you
might be asking how do we know if this
is working what if we enter a number
like five or something so let's enter 5
for an example and it's not going to run
anything all right
so in the next video actually going to
get started with the other conditional
statements like the if-else and so many
others so that's basically it for this
video if you have any questions let me
know in the key section of the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
