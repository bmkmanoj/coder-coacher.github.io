another video and in this video I'm
going to be showing you how to use tor
The Onion Router on your Android device
so yes this is finally working it just
released about three weeks ago then I'm
here to show you how to how to use it
and how to make it work correctly so
there is an app by the Tor project
itself on Google Play Store so all you
have to do is just open up the Play
Store and search for or bot Oh are be ot
and just search for that and open it and
as you can see it's the first one or
what proxy with tor and it's by the Tor
project so just open it and install it
it's very small and yeah so just open
the app once its installed and you will
get this screen now it's Conners is
going to tell you to long press the
onion to start and it will tell your
body starting and give it a second and
there we go I will tell you ten percent
15 percent and connected to the Tor
network now you want to make sure that
you click on VPN to make sure that
you're actually anonymous then you want
just I'm going to show you by hitting
browser hold on let it just check it and
I'll show you that this indeed is
working just give it a few seconds still
connect into the bootstrap yeah there we
go
and there we go guys as you can see it
is congratulations this browser is
configured to use tor so as you can see
change the IP address this is obviously
not my IP address it's very very dynamic
it has almost her three domain figures
so as you can see it is working and you
can now browse anonymously now please do
note that this might not be allowed in
your country or location depending on
your laws and because some countries
like the UK require you
well actually it's illegal to block your
IP address or to change it when browsing
in public networks but at home feel free
to use it if you don't want to be
tracked by your ISP and I just clicked
on Orbitz and you can disconnect it from
the status bar and Stelling or how much
is being sent and received and the
duration you've been on the network for
and your session which is the or book
VPN but otherwise you can just open the
app from our bot and I'll tell you
they'll just give you this
the additional thing I want to show you
is that you can change your location
well it's pretty basic for the Android
devices it's not there on Apple devices
as of now but ah well that's fantastic
and you have the log here it gives you a
log of what it's done so that's also
pretty cool I don't know whether you can
yeah you can copy the log which is
amazing you can actually when you copy
the log you can actually go to the Tor
network and then and you can be able to
analyze your stuff from your desktop on
what you're doing now so as you can see
here it's given me if I highlight it
it's given me a Luxembourg IP address
which is pretty cool so as you can see
it works properly so I hope you guys
