this video we're going to get started
installing the required software in
order for you to run and program in
Kotlin so the first piece of software
that is very essential is the Java JDK
now most of you may have heard of the
java jdk and basically it is the
development kit basically that is made
by oracle that allows you to use the
java subsystem for programming so it's
really not that hard to install all you
have to do is just fire up the browser
of your choice and just search for the
java jdk it's as simple as that really
so once you've searched for the java jdk
it should open up any first link down
below so java SE development kit 8 that
is the latest version as of this
recording and it's going to show you
this wonderful little little box right
here with the development kit downloads
and it basically asks you to accept the
license agreement or decline it so you
can go through the License Agreement but
it's going to be quite long so that's
really up to you so you then have your
your basically your different operating
systems from which you can download and
their different architectures so if you
want Linux you have 60 64-bit and 32-bit
versions of the JDK and 4 different
versions of Linux you have the Debian
and rpm format you can basically extract
it and run it in your home directory if
you're running this on Windows you have
your 64-bit and 32-bit versions so if
you're running a 32-bit version you can
download the x 86 version right here if
you're running the 64-bit version of
Windows you can download the x 64
version which is what I have now I
already have downloaded it so you I'm
going to basically skip that step and
we're going to get started with the
installation so just close up your
browser once you're done downloading the
file and it should be this little icon
here the installation should be the same
regardless of your system architecture
whether you're 32-bit or 64-bit so all
you have to do just double click it
and it should open up the the Installer
geotech it could take a while depending
on your system but mine has already
started be set up just give it a few
seconds shouldn't take that long and it
has started the installation process so
it's going to open the Installer that
took quite a while but it shouldn't take
more than a minute I think to say that
to say the least
all right so here we are it's going to
say welcome to the installation wizard
for Java the Java development kit it's
going to start computing the
installation requirements and you all
have to do is it next don't change
anything right here hit next and it's
going to start installing the Java JDK
so give it a few minutes or I think yeah
something I think about two minutes for
it install it again it all depends on
the your computer's performance so just
let this run and I'll get back to you
once it's done all right and once it
starts installing the Java just let it
continue again it shouldn't take too
much time but I'm going to skip this
process until it's done and I'll meet
you there
all right and once it's actually done is
still named Java it's going to tell you
the java SE development kit update 131
basically the latest version of this of
java as of this recording has been
installed successfully so you wanna just
hit close now to perform a basic test to
see whether java is fully integrated
this is basically what you have to do I
want you to basically search for CMD or
your command prompt so you just want to
search for CMD in your search menu of
this will work on any visions version of
Windows so you can be running this on
windows 10 windows 8.1 windows 7 just
search for your CMD which is your
command prompt I have mine right here so
just open it up and it's going to start
up and all you have to do is just hit
Java alright so you just wanna hit Java
and it's going to if it gives you this
result it means that Java is fully
integrated if it doesn't give you this
result what you have to do basically is
you have to go into your computer and
you have to go into this PC right here
and go
and go into your property section
alright now once it opens your property
section you want to go into advanced
system settings right now once you have
opened advanced system settings you want
to go into environment variables so you
want to open that and you want to go
into the path section right here so this
is basically under system variables we
are going to the path section and just
click edit all right now in the path
section you basically want to go now
into what you leave that open and you
want to go back into your computer and
open your local disk see where your
windows in store windows is installed
your basically your system hard drive
and go into your Program Files and go
into down scroll all the way down into
your Java folder and you want to go into
the Java JDK folder right here and open
this folder now once you enter Java JDK
folder you're going to go up here to the
to the basically the location tree or
the dead directory tree up here this is
basically showing you all the locations
and you just want to right click and
copy address once you've copied the
address you want to come here and hit
new alright so basically when edit the
environment variable just click new and
paste that location there as you can see
mine is already there if this doesn't
work just a date a backslash and add the
begin just at the bin section right
there as you can see I already have
added mine so I don't need to so I'm
just going to delete this one right here
so this is basically what you want to
have and once you're done just hit OK
and you should be good to go in terms of
Java
so this basically for this video in the
next video we're going to get started
installing IntelliJ which is basically
our editor that we are going to be using
for Kotlin to learn Cortland and we'll
get started with Android studio when it
comes to integrating and kata language
Android studio so if you have any
questions let me know in the connect
section of the course thank you so much
