Bitcoin section of the course in this
section of the course we're going to be
covering everything to do with bitcoins
from what bitcoins are to how they work
and all the way on to how you can
basically use it for transactions on the
Deep Web or the dark net so let's get
started so in this video this is a basic
introduction to what bitcoin is how it's
used and what the current value is so
let's get started so firstly you'll
realize that bitcoin has a very nice
logo I mean it just looks like a coin
but with a bit bit basically the B means
a bit so let's get started um coming on
to understanding what a bitcoin is you
have first have to understand that it
has an abbreviation and that is BTC so
let's basically let me basically explain
what bitcoin is so bitcoin firstly is a
decentralized currency which which
essentially means that it's not a
physical currency it's used on the
internet so this is not it's not a
currency that you can basically have
physically it's a currency that is
essentially what value on the internet
or digitally alright so if today the
internet were to collapse Bitcoin would
also collapse with it and money as like
money as today will not have any real
value however it does have value because
the internet is such a widely used to
secondly it's the most preferred for
payments on the dark web or the deep web
and I think most of you guys already
know this that it is the most preferred
method of payment when coming to
transactions on the deep web for the
simple fact that it has the best
anonymity in terms of how anonymous this
payment is now you have to also have to
understand that bitcoin is not
completely anonymous all right it's not
completely it's not really completely
hidden behind any shadows however it is
much more anonymous when compared to
your credit card and I'm going to get
you into basically Bitcoin mixing in the
future videos in this section so let's
go on until the final part here which is
basically Bitcoin is a very erratic
currency now let me explain what this
means Bitcoin is highly volatile and
unpredictable in the sense that it does
not store value in a very predictable
predictable fashion now you might be
asking yourself well has bitcoins value
always risen well yes that's true but
it's always it has or sometimes gone
down and that you know that really is
dangerous in terms of people want to try
and invest in it I will not recommend
anyone to invest heavily into Bitcoin
because it's really an it's really you
can't really tell what the value is
going to be a few years from now and
we're going to get into that in a few
minutes here now let's actually look at
the bit some basic Bitcoin terminology
you might have heard of the some of
these terms if you're keen on behold
Bitcoin scene so firstly you have your
Bitcoin wallet alright now this is where
your bitcoins will be stored for later
use it's just your virtual wallet where
you can store bitcoins all right this is
unique to you and it's protected by you
you have a password and that you you
basically understand that this is your
wallet where you can store your bitcoins
of course it's a virtual wallet now
secondly bitcoin address alright now
this is basically an alphanumeric key
that would be used to send and receive
Bitcoin now this is your unique address
that will be used for example if you
want to pay someone on the idea on the
Deep Web or the dark net you basically
give them your bitcoin address and so on
and so forth vice-versa now a blockchain
this is really this isn't really
important right now we will get into it
well when we are talking about Bitcoin
mining but basically a blockchain is a
list of blocks which I'll explain what a
block is and that has been mined since
the start of cryptocurrency
cryptocurrency now I'll get to that in a
few minutes I promise probably in the
next videos now let's look at what a
Bitcoin ATM is now a Bitcoin ATM is the
location where you can buy bitcoins with
real money so this is where you exchange
your money for example US Dollars that's
an example or you can talk about the
Great Britain per pound you can exchange
that for Bitcoin alright so basically
transferring as you guys know you're
basically converting your currency
into Bitcoin right and vice-versa now
let's look at Bitcoin mining which is a
very very hot topic right now and I'll
probably cover a few videos on Bitcoin
mining and how you can do it yourself
so Bitcoin mining is the generation or
production of bitcoins in the exchange
for solving cryptographic problems using
computer processing so basically if I
were to set up a hypothetical Bitcoin
miner this will include a computer
obviously and essentially what your
computer is going to be doing it's going
to be using a lot of its processing
power for solving these cryptographic
problems and in exchange for your
service you will be granted a certain
amount of Bitcoin depending on the
complexity of the cryptographic problem
you are using I hope that wasn't too
confusing but essentially Bitcoin mining
is as most of you or as I'm guessing
some of you may have heard is basically
a just a cluster of computers connected
together performing cryptographic
problems in exchange for Bitcoin which
in which later can be converted into
real money so it is a money-making
scheme now let's look at the Bitcoin
value because I think it's very
essential that we understand what I was
pointing out earlier if we look as of
recording this video the Bitcoin is a
two thousand two hundred and eighteen
point four seven US dollars that's one
Bitcoin now if you pay attention to this
little graph here it's going to tell you
that Bitcoin started out almost at a
zero value in 2013 all right now by the
end of 2013 going on to 2014 it took the
hugest spike I think in value and went
up to I think a thousand one thousand
one hundred and twenty dollars from not
wrong if I kept up with that right and
then all in basically in after two
months it dropped all right a few
hundred dollars and then climbed again
and then it dropped and then it climbed
again and then it went down by the end
of 2014 and then it climbed again just
at the beginning of 2015 and then
declined very steadily I think up to
hundred or two hundred dollars and then
kept steady on throughout the entire
2015 the mid-and of 2015 onwards and
then all the way to 2016 the beginning
of 2016 it started climbing at a very
steady rate almost like a tangent curve
as you can see right here with a few
hikes along the way and the highest
value the highest peak I think that it's
reached ever in history is basically
very very recently in 2017 as you can
see the value is not one two thousand
dollars but what I was pointing out with
how erratic it is is as you can see this
graph does not make very sense and if
you have to look at it in a mathematical
or statistical point of view what I mean
is if you guys are aware of statistics
you will understand that this graph does
not it's not a very good graph in terms
of if you are investing in this currency
for example because it goes up comes
down goes up comes down very erratically
it's not stable for a long period of
time it would be acceptable if the value
would be would keep on going but over
the period of two years increase
gradually with little or no spikes
because that is very very threatening
and you really can't tell what the
future holds so that's basically it for
this video guys if you have any
questions just let me know in the
community section of the course I'm
going to be continuing in the next video
about how to set up your Bitcoin address
and your wallet for Bitcoin transactions
so thank you so much for watching
goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
