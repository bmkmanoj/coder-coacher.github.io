with another video and in this video
we're basically going to be looking at
the results that I gathered from the
survey and the video that I posted about
basically me asking you guys what type
of content you want and basically I'm
just going to summarize the data that
I've gathered and the content that you
guys are going to be seeing as of the
basically after this video so looking at
the survey about 35 people took it and
that's pretty good just matter if you
guys didn't take it because also
received a lot of comments on the video
it's also leaving suggestions for videos
and basically topics that you guys want
me to do so looking at the analysis I
love this survey one for about two days
to get as many people as possible
without wasting too much time for Linux
distros if you look at the details we
basically got a medium type of result
here where we had the middle which is
three we had at the highest percentage
30% and then divided amongst three two
and five so if you average all of those
percentages divided by three you
basically get half so where basically we
have that statistic for Linux distro
reviews pretty good the highest of them
all is of course the ethical hacking
videos in the ethical hacking course so
these are videos that will involve maybe
Kali Linux parrot OS and be hacking
costs so this one obviously as you can
see got very very high results it got 70
percent being five so this is the
highest amount of videos that I'll be
uploading on the channel regarding
ethical hacking for cryptocurrency we
got some pretty interesting results some
people did not want it 9 percent didn't
want anything to do with cryptocurrency
but we got five saying a 30 percent
saying that they want cryptocurrency
videos again very good statistic and I
can make cryptocurrency videos according
to what I've just seen looking at
programming courses that that is pretty
much equal with the Deep Web videos
where you have programming you can see a
good percentage of people one
programming videos 33 and 21% are sure
of that
looking at the Deep Web videos we have a
overwhelming 42 percent that say they
want deeper videos so again that's very
good statistic for me I understand now
how to gauge the videos on the channel
looking at Windows tutorials we have
very very funny result we have the
highest percentage is zero so again I
will keep those to a minimum so looking
at the results what I can deduce is that
the the highest amount of videos that
I'll be making will be on ethical
hacking the second highest after that
will be the programming courses you then
want cryptocurrencies with another Deep
Web videos followed by the Linux distro
reviews and Windows tutorials of course
I will be I can make additional videos
if you guys actually want them that's
basically it for the results I've also
read you guys comments and they are very
very good recommendations for video
ideas really that just fit into these
sections that have divided it upon many
of you guys requests for in the ethical
hacking section of the video channel and
the programming section and also some of
you want some more information about the
Deep Web which I'll be happy to make now
a few other things as I've said I'm
doing this full-time now so you should
expect about five to seven videos a week
of course I'll be a May I'll be
uploading mass uploading the programming
tutorials because I found that it's
better for me to upload them in maybe
parts of 15 then each a day because many
of you want to actually just continue
watching them so the programming videos
will be an exception where I'll upload I
think about 15 maybe in a day as many as
I can but that's basically that for
programming now as I said I'll try and
keep the video quota from 5 to 7 videos
a week now a very good request that some
of you made is that you wanted a live
Q&amp;amp;A and this is something that I've
actually been pondering on and whether
whether or not I should have a Q&amp;amp;A how I
was going to plan it and I feel that a
live Q&amp;amp;A is much better than
one where you guys send me questions and
then I basically record the video of me
answering them
I can now answer your videos live and we
should really take advantage of the of
the live streaming technology that
YouTube has to offer
so I've decided that I'll be doing the
live stream on Saturday or Sunday I'm
not actually fixed a specific date but
it's going to be on the weekend owls are
based I'll send all the subscribers a
reminder make sure that when you
subscribe to my channel you actually get
a hit the Bell icon to make sure that
you get notified whenever I upload a
video
basically I'll send you guys a
notification before the live stream
begins so you guys can actually get
ready in addition to that you can send
your messages on Twitter or on Facebook
before I do the live stream and I'll be
going through those as well you will
also have the ability to send me your
questions on the live chat that YouTube
offers and we can basically have a good
discussion and we can communicate very
very well with each other apart from
that I've basically talked about the
video quota the type of videos I'm going
to be uploading we then have the fact
that I'm going to be doing live Q&amp;amp;A is
now in addition to that the questions
your questions basically you've been
submitting them on in the comments
section most of you hit me up on kik
which is awesome you then also hit me up
on my social networks so just make sure
you follow me on Facebook Twitter you
can hit me up on kik as well and those
are basically the three social networks
that we'll be mainly focused on now a
lot of you have been asking about my
website define a code Academy and hacker
sploit Academy these are the two
academies that I've created and whose
purpose is basically to educate you guys
or on a more professional level and it's
also a platform where you guys can
support me if you're interested in that
I'll get back to you guys when those are
really really a set up very well and
where you guys can actually help me make
it better and engage we can basically
engage with the
but I'll give you more information on
that in a later video so that's
basically it for this video guys this is
basically just me talking to you about
the results that I've gathered and how
we're going to move forward and now so
huge thank you again we've just hit
6,000 subscribers the target for this
year was 10 thousands of subscribers I'm
confident we can surpass that and you're
just amazing support thank you so much
guys and have a fantastic day
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
