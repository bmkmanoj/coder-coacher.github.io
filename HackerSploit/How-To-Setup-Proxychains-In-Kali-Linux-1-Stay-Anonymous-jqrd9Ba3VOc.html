with another video and welcome to back
to the ethical hacking course now in
today's video we're going to be talking
about proxy change so you might be
asking yourself what our proxy change
well proxy games are a series of proxies
that will basically give you an anima T
or or will anonymize anything that
you're doing whether it be it being your
performing an nmap scan or you're
performing a brute-force attack or
you're performing SQL injection or
you're just browsing the web this will
basically anonymize anything that you're
doing now you might be asking also the
difference between a proxy and a proxy
chain where proxies are usually found in
browsers and they basically anonymized
HTTP connections or web connections or
things that you're going on on the
Internet
whereas proxy chains will basically
anonymize all the activities that you're
doing now when when using the
penetration testing distres proxy chains
are already installed so I would
recommend if you're ever going to
configure them just use a penetration
testing distro as it will be much easier
so in this video you can already see
that am using Kali Linux that's because
I just want it to be a bit diverse I
don't wanna select one this too and go
with that I'm going to use the different
disclose because I know a lot of you
have different distros and you you might
feel that I'm ignoring those districts
but I'm not so anyway this is basically
proxy games are installed on parrot OS
on Kali Linux or even on Blackhawk so
since they're already installed all you
have to do is open the terminal like you
always should and we have to actually to
configure the proxy change we have to
use the proxy change dot configuration
file which can be found in the following
directory so the first thing we're going
to be nano editor and we're going to say
Etsy or ATC that's the directory we're
going to go into because Kali Linux is
already in the root directory we then
want to select the proxy in proxy change
dot configuration configuration dot conf
for the c dot configuration extension
alright so
and there we are very cool so it's using
the Nano editor and it's going to open
the file so using proxy change the
configuration version 3.1 that comes in
the latest distros now let's start with
the first thing that might appear new to
you guys is these hashes here all these
hash tags as they are called well
basically the hashes are just comments
in the configuration file now what I
mean is if you ever have done
programming you know that you when you
comment it's just for documentation well
these actual commands but they bill
commented to turn them off so I'll get
to turning them off in a second so don't
worry about the hashes now another
important thing is this line here now
HTTP socks4 socks5 tunneling proxy for
dns these are basically the format of
proxies HTTP proxies are you're very
familiar with them they're being used in
the tor browser socks4 are really not
popular anymore but they anonymize
pretty well and socks5 is what we're
going to what what i would recommend and
what we're going to use in this video
and they're basically basically they
learn on 'm eyes everything that you're
doing on your system alright so we've
explained what that is now let's go down
here into a dynamic chain now this is
the most important thing in dynamic
chains are the most stable and the
fastest proxies that you can use and
basically with the difference between a
dynamic and strict and even a random
chain by the way if you want to scroll
down the configuration file use your
mouse wheel or use the arrows I find the
arrows much better because I can specify
with a button or a key so as you can see
one of the lines is uncommented we have
the random chain now don't worry about
that let's actually just comment that
for this for this video what that means
is that it's just going to use your IT
address so the pro keys are really not
active if you want to activate a proxy
will will remove this hash and dynamic
chains have been activated so that means
you actually using a proxy right now
I'll get to configuring the proxy in
details just in them in a second now
dynamic boxes
each connection will be done by chain
proxies right so basically this will
will go through a series of IP addresses
or proxies in different countries as we
will specify down below in the
configuration section so the reason why
this is the fastest is because basically
it's going to what our gold say is a
very good system for proxies as you can
see it's going to say here all proxy is
changing the order as they appear in the
list at least one proxy must be online
we already know that dead proxies are
skipped so it will not go to a dead
proxy and then prompt you that the
connection is not working
just ignore strict change for now that's
a bit of an advanced thing but basically
strict chain will just stick to the IPS
that you've given it on the proxies that
you've given it and it will stay to most
emotion as is built it will only use one
of the proxies random join is just a
normal connection now in proxy DNS
requests in this section I just want to
explain something this is really where
the beginners make mistakes what this
means no leak for DNS data what this
means is usually when Khan when
basically anonymizing your system when
you are performing anything really you
can use a proxy but you have to also
change your DNS all right let me explain
why most of the beginners will use a
proxy and it will change their location
every 5 to 10 minutes or even faster
than that so it's bouncing all around
the world you're using different
locations but your DNS is in your in the
country you're in so when I website like
youtube accesses or when you access
YouTube for example it's going to log
your IP the IP will belong to let's say
France and and you have not changed your
DNS so your DNS will show your host
country let's say your country Germany
and you're accessing using a proxy
YouTube will already know that you're
using a proxy because they can see that
you're using different IPS and but your
DNS is in s1 is in one country and from
there they can track you and you get the
idea so always change your D
nests whilst using proxies it just
increases your anonymity and just it
makes you look a bit professional not
like a non-professional would go about
it so let's go down to the proxy list
format right now this is again they'll
give you like examples of how they would
appear so I want you guys to pay
attention to these formats here just go
over these formats and just look at this
to understand the format we'll get into
configuration and the proxy down below
here so as you can see this is the proxy
list down below and basically choosing a
Sox for one twenty seven point zero
point zero point one and nine fifty
which is the tour using the thoth proxy
which it's same sock for I know it's
made basically for HTTP so I'm going to
get in the two in the next video using
your own proxies so otherwise guys I
hope this video helped you if you did
leave a like if you enjoyed the video
leave a like if it didn't help you let
me know in the comment section if you
have any questions again hit me up on
kik my social media by the way don't
forget to follow me on my social video
on my social media excuse me
have a fantastic day the next video is
coming soon in fact is coming a few
minutes please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
