this video in this video today what I'm
going to be explaining to you is the
mathematical operators and how they work
in Catalan so let's just get started so
the first thing we're going to do we're
going to create a new class and I hope
you guys are doing this as well just to
keep your your files organized so we're
going to create a new class or new
Cortlandt class and we're going to call
it math math operators all right I'm
going to hit OK so let's get rid of this
commentation and let's create a function
so constant main ora grazing the
function main arguments array string and
open a function so this is the main
function so the way I'm going to do this
is we're basically going to learn the
mathematical operators by creating a
calculator very simple calculator so
let's basically say get basically say
this is a math this is a simple
calculator so let's actually give that a
comment and let's say this is a simple
calculator again it's very very
important that you use comments so first
thing we're going to do is let's first
remember that we have to prompt the user
to enter the first number so let's say
print line let's say print line excuse
me print line let's say print line
please
enter we first listen to the first
number colon and there we are so now
again we're going to use the red line to
input the first number so we're going to
create a variable number one
alright that's an n1 and we're going to
make sure it's an interest it has to be
the datatype of an integer just for the
for the purpose of this video so
variable n1 integer and that's equals to
read read read line alright so we
basically use the red line again is
giving us the error and that's because
as I mentioned in the previous videos
that the red line is the default data
type is a string so we have to convert
this into an integer so two integer
alright and that's basically going to
convert the variable n1 into an integer
and store it
the number you write for n1 in the end
one variable so let's use another print
line statement saying please enter the
second number alright or use a colon and
open that up
and we're going to say variable and two
very similar to the first one we're
using the int datatype and that equals
to read read line score excuse me
redline and that's basically going to be
going to convert back into integer and
that's basically that so we have to do
two of these values and that's it
now we have to create basically we now
have to create a variable that will
store the sum so let's create variable
sum
all right the variable sum is going to
be of type float all right you can use
float or the or integer depending on
what type of calculations you're going
to be doing so let me actually just
start with integer for the purpose of
this video so variable sum is an integer
alright and this is going to expect a
value all right so it's not going to
expect a null value so we don't need to
leave the question mark so it's going to
expect a value and what is the value of
somewhere but as his sum is equal to n1
plus n2 and that's basically it the sum
is equals to 1 plus 2 the value of the
first number plus the value of the
second number which were going to input
so the sum already has its value which
we'll get over there so that's basically
your first mathematical operator is the
addition operator
so let's actually create an output
statement here so called print print
line and I'm going to say because your
sum the sum is space we're going to use
a concatenation and we're going to move
the variable sum all right and let's
just use the ctrl s to save this and
let's run this let's see what we get so
hopefully it should actually display us
to enter two numbers which will then add
it and then display the sum so it says
over here please enter the first number
I'm going to enter 20 and the second
number I'm going to enter 50 all right
so if this
work is that the answer should be 70 so
we enter that and indeed we do get 70 so
that is basically the mathematical
operator for addition now looking at the
others again it's very very simple
there is the subtraction operator which
is again self-explanatory it will just
minus the first value from the second
value so let's say the B they did the
difference is all right and we can then
you can then change this variable into
let's use the gif or X just change the
variable name into di f and let's get
rid of this sum and say the difference
is equals to N 1 minus n 2 and then we
can basically add this concatenation
same difference
we can edit it so now it's when you're
basically it's all about subtracting so
let's save that and let's run this
alright so once this runs the Trudel
again asked us to enter so let's enter
the first number the bigger 150 the
second number as 20 and we know that the
difference between these two should be
30 so again the difference is 30 so
that's basically subtraction pretty
awesome stuff now looking at the others
we then have multiplication all right so
then we can say the product so prou the
product is equals to so we're going to
use they give variable product you can
use a shorter name if you want but I'm
going to use this so we're going to say
product just edit it where necessary and
we're going to say the the product for
the product is and it's going to be n1
times n2 so again simple mathematics
here it just applies as simply as you it
would in real life so there we are
please into the first number so we're
going to do a simple multiplication 5
and the second number will be 2 and that
the product is 10 pretty simple
mathematics and you get the idea you
then have the final one and I think one
of these I think one of the most popular
ones that's being used currently and I
do don't mean this by any means is the
most popular in the world but what I see
myself using a lot
and that's the division which is just a
forward slash so we're going to call
this when I'm going to call this the I
just call it if I know that means for
those of you who do web development that
means basically a section of the web
page but that's not what we're doing
right now so div which is also an
integer and what we're just going to say
here say div all right and we're going
to say the way I'm going to say we can
basically add even another further
concatenation saying n1 then use a
concatenation saying n1 divided by and
userspace and use another concatenation
and to use another concatenation is a
12-2 and use another concatenation here
and that's basically going to output the
divided whatever you get from the
divided section so we actually have an
error here not the error thing so
basically an one print line there's some
error this some kind of error here and
we just check out what it is it's going
to say plus by defined in rockland
giving us this if we just try and run
this let's try and on this and let's see
what it gives us not sure what the error
is I'm pretty sure it's going to do it
float all right so when dividing as I
said this is where we get to changing
data types sorry about that
I've actually forgot to actually tell
you guys this so we're going to use the
flow to data type which you guys should
already know what it is
so data type allows basically larger
figures so n1 divided by n2 and if you
were to use those to cook basically the
it's going to say give n1 n2 we already
give this so now we have to give them a
loads up here so there is float and
again we're going to convert this to 2
to float all right so let's convert
these two integers now n1 and n2 2 to
float in inputs
updated X because the as it's very very
true that when you when dividing you
will get remainders and the float data
type is the best suited for this so div
base we are dividing that's going to be
a float value and once you're adding all
of this we can say the concatenation
right here is done very well let's give
that a space and let's say n1 right and
we're just going to use that or we can
basically just display all of this if
this is keeps on giving you an error
just basically say the answer is and we
can use the concatenation and we say do
all right
and that basically gives us the D on so
if we divide two numbers with each other
so let's actually run this and let's see
if we can get an answer so enter the
first number we're going to try four
divided by two and the answer is two
because we use the float is going to
allow us to use decimal places which is
very important so let's run this again
and let's use different values so if you
enter the first number let's say as
three and use the second one as five I'm
going to say the unsaved zero point six
and that's why we use the float data
type right here which is the most suited
when using decimal places so that's
basically it for this video guys very
very important as well to learn the
different mathematical operators in
Kotlin and I hope you guys found this
video helpful if you have any questions
just let me know in the cage section of
the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
