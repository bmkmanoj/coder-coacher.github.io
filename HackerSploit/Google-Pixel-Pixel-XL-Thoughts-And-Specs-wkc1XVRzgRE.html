with another video so google just
announced their latest flagship devices
the pixel and the pixel x 0 and they are
looking to be shaping up to be one of
the best phones of 2016 at least from
what they've said so does this pen or
dispelled in the end for the Nexus
devices there is only one way to find
out these are my thoughts on the Google
pixel and the pics Alexa alright guys so
let's start off with the prices of both
the devices the pixel will be priced at
six hundred and fifty dollars and XL XL
will be priced at seven hundred seventy
dollars and now both of the devices will
be released on 20th October with a
pre-order on doba so you can already go
and pre-order this device and now both
devices feature an aluminium unibody and
a glass design with Gorilla Glass 4
incorporated now let's talk about the
features that are exclusive to this one
and all Google is trying to sell us so
basically it's built in with google
assistant which is said to be or google
is claiming to be the best AI on a
smartphone google is claiming as well
that it has the highest rated smartphone
camera ever at 12.3 megapixels with a 2
point 0 aperture that still remains to
be seen but you know with google they
don't really like the second thing I
mean the third thing that trying sell is
the fact that it comes with a limited
storage or cloud storage and basically
everything you snap with your camera and
all files will be held on the cloud and
you'll never run out of space now the
other thing google is selling which is
quite new as most of you guys already
know is google do so basically what
google do is is basically a video chat
application likes FaceTime on Apple
devices but Google is trying to make it
into a better better than
facetime and basically they are trying
to make it a little more mainstream
because it's something that's always
been missing in android phones now
Google are also doing something really
really cool with the colors of the
devices they have three colors for all
both of the devices we have quite black
very silver and really blue now this is
a fantastic marketing scheme by Google
and I really like the way they've named
that the colors even though the colors
are simply just black silver and blue
they're giving them very nice names and
basically it's just it's always good to
see that they having fun with their
product now let's look at the
differences between the two devices now
we do know that the group pixel has a
display of 5 inches and the pixel XL
being larger will obviously have a
display of 5.5 inches so as for the
screen on the phone we have only pixel a
full HD AMOLED at for Pete 444 for and
41 PP I which means it's a standard
1080p display with a 441 PPI the pixel
Excel has a qHD quad HD AMOLED at 534
ppl which is very impressive considering
this is Google's forced high-end
smartphone now we then have a difference
slightly in terms of being thickness
obviously not more much to say they're
just the fact that the pixel is slightly
thinner than the pixel XL now the other
difference we have is the battery and
pick the pixel will have a two thousand
five hundred seventy million power
battery while the pixel XL will have a
three thousand four hundred fifty
million power battery not too shabby
apart from that they are really a lot of
changes or difference between the two
phones now let's look at the
similarities in the phones so basically
both of Isis have the same metal unibody
and gorilla glass coating same design
in terms of memory we both have four
gigabytes of ddr4 ram in terms of
storage they both come in 32 or hundred
and twenty eight gigabytes storage they
are both running on a slab dragon 810
processor which is pretty cool that's
the latest processors that you can get
on on a phone at the moment they have
they both have a main camera of twelve
point three megapixels with a two-point
40 aperture as I mentioned earlier and
the front camera is where I I see
something really really impressive is
they have both an eight megapixel camera
with a 2.4 aperture now the cameras are
able to shoot 1080p video at 30 60 120
fps respectively they can also shoot
720p video at 30 60 and 120 fps
respectively as well they also can shoot
4k video at 30fps that's fantastic
everyone needs to have a good recording
and have good recording resolutions in
terms of the connection and I oh we have
both both of them are running on a USBC
connection for data and power they both
have a single sim they both have a 3.5
millimeter headset jack I hope you're
listening Google and in terms of
connectivity they have everything you
could ever need NFC Bluetooth GPS Wi-Fi
and all the good stuff so basically my
thoughts on this are the fact that
Google is trying to move from move away
from the Nexus / budget android device
and android device market where they are
trying to create a they're now trying to
create a flagship device that can
compete with the big boys out there now
obviously both the homes are going to be
running stock android android 71 nougat
which is fantastic
I think I don't think they can ever be a
perfect phone like this it has been
basically all the bells and whistles you
could ever want in a good phone it has
the highest specs and it's running pure
stock Android what else you need so my
thoughts are that it is pretty good but
for the price range i think it's still
too high for the specs that it's it's
coming with i would have liked to see a
high amount of ram considering the
android operating system as we know it
really really tends to hook up a lot of
resources in terms of physical ram and
the processor but not too bad at all for
a start this is fantastic i think the
the selling point of this phone for sure
will be the camera google has said that
it's the highest rated smartphone camera
and the only way we'll know this is when
the phone comes out so that will be
pretty pretty interesting guys i hope it
the camera is good because it's always
soul is good to move ahead but as i said
again guys and days there really is no
innovation in terms of the battery life
no one's creating a bigger or better
battery everyone's just focused on the
design of the phone and basically the
software phone so my thoughts are that
basically it's really really nice to see
that google has gone this step in making
a high-end flagship device that can now
actually compete with the big boys and
not a be a budget form so actually very
very nice to see you could have moved on
to this party the devices are very slick
have very good design and I I expect
them to do very well in the last quarter
of the year with I I'm guaranteeing that
they'll have a very very good success in
terms of the sales but let me know what
you guys think about the device will you
buy it will you not buy it or will you
agency as to how it performs before you
bite so let me know in the comment
