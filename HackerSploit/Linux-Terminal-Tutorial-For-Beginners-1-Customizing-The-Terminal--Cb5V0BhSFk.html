with another video and I am
hey guys hackers Floyd here back again
with another video and I humbly
apologized for the lack of videos over
the last one or two weeks
the reason being as I've said previously
in other videos I'm planning to do this
as a full-time job or my occupational
content creation on hacking Linux
programming etc etc and I've just been
sorting out a few other things and I've
managed to solve them out so this is
because of you who love sending
suggestions
I really really appreciate them just
send any video ideas you have and I'll
make them you know just send them in and
I'll make them in accordance to how you
have sent them in the order that you
have sent them anyway enough of the
chitchat in this video I'm gonna be in
this set of videos I'm gonna be taking
you through the Linux terminal and how
to use it and how to navigate around the
Linux system with the terminal the
reason I'm making this series of videos
is because a lot of you guys are
beginners to Linux and also to the Linux
distro world and you know the Linux
terminal is very very important when
you're using Linux because essentially
the GUI that comes with Linux is pretty
much it's it's not the best you know
it's not something you can rely on
especially when you're trying to connect
to remote servers you usually do it
through SSH or secure shell for those of
you who like using it by its real name
not its abbreviation and you're gonna be
faced with the terminal and if it
intimidates you you know it can really
be something not to muck around with
because you can be intimidated of the
terminal and then make mistakes for
example you know are you connecting to a
server and then you know not knowing
youing way around and then making a
mistake deleting files that probably
have very very high integrity you know
it's really really scary and you should
be getting used to the terminal it's not
intimidating at all once you get used to
it
so let's just begin in this video I'm
just gonna show you how to customize the
terminal to your liking because that's
one of the ways of making it less
dreadful so just open up the terminal
I'm using Callan
so let's just begin it's gonna be pretty
much similar for any Linux distro that
you're currently using you can basically
create a customized profile for yourself
if that's what you're looking for or you
can just edit the custom profile that
comes with the terminal or the default
profile which I'm gonna be showing you
how to do so
if you want to edit your profile and you
want to change for example the font the
font color the background of the
terminal the transparency you get the
idea so how would we do that will you go
into edit and profile preferences
alright so you wanna click on that and
it's gonna open this little menu let me
just bring them side to side so you can
see the changes being made live in
general you can give the you can give
the profile a name so let's call this
profile you can just give it your name
so let's call it a Alexis I'm going to
give it my name I'm gonna call it
default alright now that's gonna be the
profile name don't worry about the
initial terminal size or you could worry
about that if you you don't like the
starting size of the terminal and you
keep on adjusting its size you can
increase that maybe to whatever you want
I'm fine with 80 that's pretty much what
I like additionally you could reset it
if you make changes and you don't
remember the original values when it
comes to cursor shape this is your
little cursor right here some people
don't like the block cursor and usually
prefer the i-beam which is very simple
and minimalistic oops excuse me it's
actually typing over there so as you can
see that's some people like that but for
me personally I like the block for those
of you as well like the underline which
is also quite nice I like that a lot but
it just not Universal for me I like the
block type I've gotten used to that in
addition you can increase your text you
can increase your text size you can also
change your your font I like using the
monospaced font that comes with pretty
much all linux distros
you can also rewrap the content you can
also allow bold text if you want which
is very very important I highly
encourage that you keep that checked
when it comes to commands don't really
touch any of this this is just custom
stuff when it comes to colors you can
choose to use colors from your system
scheme which I'll show you in us in a
few in a second when you look at the
built-in schemes white on black is text
and then the background color of the
terminal which so the text is white and
the background color is going to be
black which you can edit over here you
can edit the text color for example some
people like going with green and as you
can see it gives you a nice little color
up there and if I just let me just try
and run command right there alright so
let's look at that as you can see the
text color is gonna be green if I switch
that to something like orange I've also
seen orange being quite popular right
now H top excuse me let me just move
back to the terminal as you can see it's
gonna highlight in orange the main text
I like keeping it white and I like
keeping the background black another
cool color scheme that I've seen is
quite popular and is also quite neat as
well is when you do the background white
when you use the white background and
the text you can probably have that as
green or red and let me do see what that
looks like if I just disable
transparency or let me just keep that on
and reduce it slightly a lot of people
really really like this type of terminal
where the background is white and it's
it looks quite cool actually I'm not
going to like let me use the H top
command as you can see it has a very
very nice contrast with the other colors
but for me personally it's just too much
it's too bright and you know I wear
glasses so it's really taxing on my eyes
especially at night when I'm working so
I'm just going to change that to
I'm gonna change the text to white and
the background color to black with a bit
of transparency you can also edit the
transparency if you want some which is
also pretty cool I like that and you can
go ahead and make changes to the color
scheme right here this is all about you
just customize it to what you feel
comfortable with and immediately you'll
see it will not be scary for you anymore
looking at scrolling make sure you have
scroll bar that's very important when
going through like for example documents
or a new cat files compatibility don't
touch anything right here
yeah and that's pretty much it when it
comes to customizing the terminal to
your liking I like keeping it the
default way primarily because I learnt
how to use it that way but I also have
learned how to customize it and you know
when I'm running this on my main systems
I customized it you know just to make it
look how I like it I usually go for the
white on black type of thing or white or
green not the that type of stuff anyway
that's basically it for this first video
in the next video we are going to be
going through some terminal commands
that will hopefully make make you a
pretty pretty good pro in navigating a
Linux with the terminal so I hope you
guys found value in this video if you
did please leave a like if you guys
didn't like this video let me know why
in the comments section in addition if
you have any questions or suggestions or
any video suggestions leave them in the

there what else do I need to tell you by
the way guys I would really really

but really can find them so that will do
me and you guys a lot of a lot of good
that's basically it for this guys I know
this was kind of a kind of a random type
of video but you guys wanted hacking
videos and I'm making them and I hope
that I'm making them well let me know
what you guys think I really really
appreciate your feedback

this channel has grown so much over over
the course of the year it's incredible
