in this video basically when explaining
to you what null safety is in Cortland
this is a new feature introduced in
Colleen and basically has to do with the
null components of variables so let me
explain this by actually showing you how
it works so let's create a new class I'm
going to use a code link class and let's
call it no snow safety all right so once
you create null safety let's get rid of
this commentation and then let's create
a function name we're going to create an
arguments with an input of array with
string all right and we're going to open
it every function so this is my main
function
now what I mean by not null is basically
means 0 or no value so if we were to
create a variable of a alright and we
were basically to say variable a let's
say is int all right and we go down so I
basically enforced the fact that
variable a is going to use the data type
of an integer so that we know we already
know that so let's say a is equal to 20
all right so we've given it a value and
now let's say we print a alright now
this already is a fully working program
and this will basically output 20 so
let's try and run that and let's see
what we get just to confirm that
everything so far makes sense that we've
learned all right
so there we are so we get 20 so we know
everything's working but when it comes
to programming you will come across a
few instances where you will have to use
the basically the value now and what
this means already this means is that
this variable might not have or need a
value ok now one when it needs this you
basically have to change a few things
when declaring the variables so we let's
go through this step-by-step we declare
the variable a and made sure that it was
enforced it was going to use the data
type int a
only all right now in a we basically
have given a the value of null which
means that this variable does not have a
value and we'll probably not need one
all right and we're basically printed a
which in theory should print null okay
but we are getting an error here saying
null cannot be a value of a non null
data type integer which means that we
did not declare the variable with the
option that this variable could be a
null
what I mean is that as we as we did in
the previous video when I was declaring
a data type you saw me putting a
question mark all right what this
question mark means is that this
variable is expecting a value like I
explained a value of type integer or no
value at all meaning it is going X it
can accept any other variable it can say
for example a we have declare it as null
as you can see the error is gone and
this basically means a can be null or
again say a is equals to 10 all right
and it's going to print it's going to
first go through the program saying okay
Aleksey as said a variable a is
basically is an integer datatype and
it's going to basically accept a it's
going to accept a value or it will
basically accept a null value okay so
that's what I basically meant so now if
we control save and we printed this and
we run this program will basically get
the result of null all right there we
are so to summarize what I meant was
when declaring a variable all right if
there is a possibility that the variable
the value of the variable may be null
always use the question mark just in
case you there's that possibility but
when you don't need it and if the vary
the value of the variable will never be
and now just remove the question mark
and you can basically go about it as you
would any other variable so as you can
see variable a is of integer datatype we
know that it's accepting values and it's
going to accept a value of data type
integer and it's good and indeed we do
give it a value of 10 and it's going to
print a as 10 but again if you want if
there is a possibility that this
variable may be of type not
use a question mark and that means that
it's going to accept either an integer
data type or a null data type so there
if I enter now it's basically going to
print now so that's basically it for
this video guys another very important
thing that you guys had to learn if you
have any questions let me know in the
case section of the course goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
