with another Linux distro review today I
have for you back box Linux now the
reason I'm doing this is it looked quite
interesting and some of you have
actually mentioned it in the comments
now before we get started I have had
previous experience with this district
but not in this forum actually I
actually use this back in 2014
so I'm guessing a lot has changed and
yeah let's let's just get started
so you can basically download this
destroy it's free of that there's no
need to ask about that back box.org so
basically they free at an open source
community project and what's the aim
well basically back box is a free open
source community project which is
basically it's a penetration testing
distro but not exactly it's not a fully
fledged penetration testing destroyed
basically can be used for anything apart
from penetration testing analytical
hacking well basically on the website as
you can see back box is more than an
operating system it's a free open source
community project will be aimed to
promote the culture of security in the
IT environment so they are basically
trying to push security and anonymity in
the IT environment which is always good
to see it's actually quite excited about
projects like these that who's actually
focused turned their focus to giving
users a most secure environment to work
with you know it's something that has
been always always been lingering around
when it comes to an operating system so
it's fantastic that we have something
like this and others as well so
basically you can basically navigate the
site and you have your back box Linux
which is the one I'm going to be showing
you which is the desktop version and
then of your cloud which is for cloud
platforms I'm guessing you guys already
know that is and that's pretty much it
you can basically click on the Linux
which is what you want to download and
it's going to say download for free or
you can make a donation to support them
so you can just hit download
it's an ISO
so basically it works on 32-bit and
64-bit so choose your flavor and it's
basically going to give you an ISO like
any other Linux distro so I actually
have it running live on my virtual
machine I haven't installed it I have it
running alive on my virtual machine well
it actually just allows me to show you
the really cool stuff about this and you
really don't need to install it if you
guys might want to try this out on a
virtual machine as well so starting off
let me just give you some basic
information it's basically based off
volatile all right so that means it's
going to be very very stable because
it's based off a bun too and yeah it
does have a lot of repositories and
things that it will be updated I think
as frequently as Kali as something like
Kali Linux would be or pirate OS so in
terms of the upgrade ability of the
components it's pretty pretty good so
it's based of cobalt oh and it's running
on the xfce desktop environment which I
love it's because of it just how simple
it is and the other thing you can see
it's pretty snappy it's again it's very
very resource friendly and doesn't
require any you know special hardware to
run and you know what I'm pointing out
to and I'm talking about Kali Linux Kali
Linux they should really sort out the
performance issues with Kali that's
because the whole interface is laggy and
you go ahead and you change the desktop
environment and then you have errors
with updating them and it's just just
really confusing so it's good to see
that then we are sticking with simple
stuff here so as you can see pretty
simple you right-click you have a
plethora of options you have your
desktop settings which you can edit
pretty cool stuff you continue your
background color where they want to
solid color your icons you can reduce
the icon size as you can see pretty cool
I like mine about the default that's
good enough for me and close that again
you can open the terminal here's route
they are pretty cool you can basically
you can basically do everything that the
Linux distro can or with the XS see
desktop environment but now let's look
at the more interesting stuff so and
when once you open B we launcher right
here you have your search always a good
thing to see that implemented there you
have your favorite section everything is
categorized into what what what they
basically do you have your favorite web
browser actually haven't checked out
which web browser it is probably will be
a variation of Mozilla but let that load
as we check out what else is there you
then have when you go to all that's
pretty much all so yeah it is using
Mozilla Firefox awesome pretty cool
stuff back to here so we basically are
all which gives you everything currently
installed of course whatever you install
later will also be here you have your
anonymous section on this is what I'm
saying is pretty cool I mean they should
really just this should be a this should
be something that every operating system
should incorporate be your ability to
actually have an to basically turn on
anonymous mode which you can see is
dunya fantastically and you also have
RAM wiping for those of you don't know
what I am wiping is that's basically
it's just going to wipe everything on
your em and basically nothing is stored
that can be recovered for forensics
pretty advanced stuff but I'm sure you
guys know what it is you can basically
check you can start the anonymous mode
you can check the status and you can
stop it so let's actually try and start
it and I'm guessing is using some kind
of variation of the Tor relay of
anonymity to dieto relay or using the
unknown and onself tool most probably
I'm not sure or something of that
variation because that was something
that's quite similar actually with
parrot OS so let's hit yes I'm going to
use a random
and do I want to transparently route my
traffic through tor they are so choosing
the Tour de tour relay and there you are
so it looks like I'm anonymous I will
maybe let's check that out with that's
working right now we can actually just
open research for oh it's actually named
on the browser sorry about that web
browser all right so back to the
anonymous section so we have run wiping
and anonymous mode let's actually check
that so first for DMS check for DNS
leaks while that's loading because it's
going to be quite slow let that load
back here now in auditing this is
basically where all the advanced tools
are for penetration testing ethical
hacking encryption all of that good
stuff you're pretty familiar with this
if you have been using any of the
penetration testing disclose or disclose
are focused on anonymity and security so
basically have you information gathering
that's basically nmap and scanning and
stuff like that
here's your Zen map also you have your
web application is what web a
comparative view and you look at this
district compared to Kali Linux you know
Blackhawk prior to us it doesn't have as
many tools as them because it's focused
on basically giving a balance between
these elements most of the other
operating systems of focus on generation
testing so as I say you'll not find all
the tools so for example in
vulnerability you only have like one the
open bus you have unique Quito and Quito
sorry I don't have here I'm not a very
good pronounce of these tools
exploitation you have your browser
exploits Biff yes for database you have
only SQL maps on you not find the other
option like Kali Linux does or prior to
s does network you have your Metasploit
very important and Armitage basically
the way I look at it giving you the
tools that you're most likely to use
when it comes to performing network
attacks database attacks
or browser attacks so I think the also
you guys can also get the idea basically
when you look at net
attacks Metasploit is pretty much the
standard I would always use Metasploit
looking at database attacks SQL map is
the tool for database SQL injection etc
etc browser exploitation best has been
there for quite a while I'm sure most of
you guys have used it um web
applications you have privilege
escalation your root password sniffing
you have you basically you have
Wireshark installed awesome stuff there
you have your spoofing a spoof is there
pretty cool stuff maintaining access so
basically it's it's really categorized
in a way that's quite intuitive actually
you have your tunneling the tunneling
and here we are there's uncle proxy
chains pretty cool it's actually nice
that they have that installed because on
Kali Linux that doesn't come installed
so awesome stuff we're back those we've
lead not sure many of you know that but
reverse engineering social engineering
honeypot attacks deport stress testing
of your dos siege so for those of you
who are currently rambling about videos
you might want to give this a try and we
have a comment right here let me just
get rid of that and I'll just close that
up so coming back to the tools you have
a plethora of tools probably it allows
less tools compared to Kali Linux but it
has the tools that I think are really
important
you have automotive analysis so this
basically for those of you actually
connect your computers to your cause
using the OBD cable this is actually
pretty cool or you connect your computer
to your or your laptop to your car using
the OBD bluetooth connection that can
actually help here with forensic
analysis data recovery basically
everything exists and it works pretty
well now let's actually check whether
the anonymous word mode actually works
the strength submit and you know that
that's not going to give me what I want
let me just use DuckDuckGo calm that's
probably not gonna ask me to verify Who
I am
see that's what I'm talking about if
you're looking for a search engine that
really doesn't track what you're doing
just use doctor blue I know it may not
give you the results as accurate as you
want them but I'm guessing for testing
or basic reconnaissance when you're
doing performing a hack this will work
quite well connection is actually quite
slow you can actually try and see if
proxy change works auditing this thing
that's going to be and this will be in
sorry for that tunneling meeting access
tunneling and proxy change let's
actually run that and yeah so it's
already installed and you can basically
give that all right let me just
configure something what this is
regarding my keyboard actually my
keyboard is backlit so that just turns
it on
as you know backlit keyboard you don't
really work in in Linux
generally speaking you have to actually
turn it on manually and proxy games we
already know the intro services started
so proxy Kings Firefox let's actually
see if that works and yeah it does so we
can actually check for duck duck go home
the probably launched it from there and
this is much faster let's actually get
rid of that anonymous mode and we can
basically check for stuff right here and
just for DMS leaks hopefully this works
I'm not let's actually check to see if
the EPOXI oh there we are
proxy changes it does work and if you
check for your DNS leaks probably it's
going to give me some pretty interesting
results anyway this is turning into a
different type of video now so basically
as you can see everything works
perfectly and when it comes down to the
interface it's pretty much going to be
smooth for those of you have experience
with excel see it's simple really it can
get any simpler you have your you
basically launch everything from there
you
development tools and it basically
functions how Abunda would function just
with the extra tools so in my opinion I
would recommend this for anyone who
maybe is interested in in a digital that
has a balance between basically desktop
and simple desktop operating system and
a penetration testing lab would I
recommend it before the other distros
known if you were to ask me the best at
basically the best Linux distro
political hacking I would point you
towards Kali Linux so pirate OS
Blackhawk Linux is good but that
basically runs on arc and it's suitable
for people were actually used to walk so
yeah you get the idea I'll do another
review on Blackhawk so you guys should
stay tuned for that but that's basically
it go go ahead and give this a try you
don't have to install it just run it on
your virtual machine
pretty cool stuff it runs actually quite
well it runs better than Kali Linux as
well on my virtual machine so that's
that that's just that I I'll do some
testing on it and you can also use this
for deep web browsing because basically
you can give a message called control
water verde that's basically it for this
video guys if you liked this video or
you enjoyed it please leave a like down
below if you're new to the channel
please subscribe if you have any
questions comments suggestions let me
