with another video and in this video I'm
gonna be showing you how to install and
use be logger on kandi Linux to create a
key logger that can be used on Windows
so again we're going to be using v
logger which is a very powerful tool but
it does have some issues which we'll
look into in the next step so let's get
started so what I'm gonna do now is I'm
going to be using the github repository
for installation additionally you could
use the lazy script to install B Locker
which is much easier but if you guys are
going with this method it works
perfectly as well so what you want to do
is go to the github repository I will
leave the link in the description
section so you can check it out for
yourself
so all credits go to the hakka which is
for w4k 3 a's on who created be logger
so all credits go to him so what we're
gonna do is we're just gonna clone this
github repository so I'm just gonna copy
the link and we can get started with the
terminal alright so first things first
let me just enlarge the terminal so we
can see what's going on already so the
first thing I'm gonna enter root sudo
bash and let me enter my password in
there we are so now I wanna browse to my
desktop because that's where I want to
install the logger download and install
the files for be logger
so we're gonna clone the repository git
clone and I'm gonna paste in the github
link that we copied and I'm gonna hit
enter and as you can see it's going to
create our B logger folder and hopefully
this shouldn't take too much time I am
using a VPN for my connection which is
why it'll probably take a few seconds to
download so again yours might be
different if you're using your active
ISP connection but I'm using a VPN
that's limited to 500 kilobits per
second so I'll meet you when it's done
already so once it's done downloading we
can actually continue so we're gonna
browse into the VB logger we're gonna
browse into the P log folder so we're
going to change the directory
oops let me just clear that out so CD b
b locker like so and now we can look
into the b logo folder and we have been
installed as h file which is a bash
script so as you can see we do have the
permissions to run it so it shouldn't be
a problem at all to start the
installation process so i'm going to
just use the installation so installed
dot sh ok and it's going to begin the
installation process for the bean logger
script so just give it a few seconds to
start up because it does need to set up
additional dependencies like wine and
Python or PyCharm for example so just
let it start reading the package lists
and we can get started with the
installation process so as I said just
give it a few seconds it shouldn't take
too much time and as you can see it's
going to ask us for our wine
configuration so I'm just gonna hit
default settings and maybe change it to
Windows 7 and hit apply and then I'm
gonna hit OK
alright and after that it's going to ask
us to setup Python 2.7 so as you can see
I already have it installed so I'm just
gonna finish and it's gonna just repair
Python but in your case it'll prompt you
to install python additionally all over
again or install it fresh so make sure
you do that and I've already installed
Python then the next thing is going to
ask me to install is PI win so the
two-bit version so there's gonna it next
and next and it's going to install that
for me pretty simple so just let that
complete and it shouldn't take too much
time now there we are alright so I'm
just gonna finish that installation and
now it's gonna ask me to install PI hook
right PI hook is very important in this
so as I said I already have mine
installed so it's I'm just going to
breeze over these these installation
processes and there we are so we've
installed be long enough and you might
be asking yourself well how do I access
be logger if we view the if we basically
look inside the folder we have the B dot
T why
so Python and the doc Bui and if we
start that up as you can see we have the
B Locker opened and running so in
addition what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna exit and I'm gonna start in a new
terminal altogether because that has
brought a few issues before after we
installed the PI hook so what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna enter it again excuse me
like so and see the desktop and
obviously CT B locker and Python V dot
PI like so and there we are so we're
currently in the B logger script right
now and it's gonna ask you as I said
it's going to ask you know to hit enter
and before we get started
as you can see use this for work or
educational purposes so I have to throw
the disclaimer that please use this at
your own discretion and you know I'm not
gonna be held responsible for anything
you do with this tool so just hit enter
to continue and now the options are
pretty simple it's gonna ask you it's
going to give you three options k being
the option to generate the keylogger you
being to update the be logger which is
quite awesome that he added that all
credits go to Allison moreto and Q to
quit so we're going to generate the be
logger which is done by using the key K
T so once you hit that it's going to ask
you to select what type of key logger
you want to mask exactly so you can
choose an Adobe Flash update which is
pride group quite good and will help
with social engineering to some extent
you then have your fake Word document
which is really not convincing
especially for users who are pretty
familiar with computing and we then have
the fake excel sheet which again is not
very convincing because it is going to
be an exe file we then have the fake
PowerPoint which is quite convincing
because it is a PowerPoint and less
people come in contact with powerpoints
with PowerPoint files as come when
compared to Excel and Word documents we
then have the fake Acrobat PDF which is
also quite
convincing within of the blanket is
executable and now before we get started
with creating the BitLocker the thing
about a pillow is that it's very easy to
create a be lager when I say create a
keylogger what I mean is not to actually
create a keylogger by yourself or to
script it but to create a be lager that
you are using to gain information or you
know you're trying to use for either
malicious intent or or for testing it
really comes down to how you're gonna
install it on your targets computer how
you're gonna run it on your targets
computer and that's where social
engineering comes into place and we look
we'll be looking at techniques or not on
how to be using this and what I'm coming
to really here is all of these will be
detected by you know if you try and send
any of these these key loggers in forms
off for example and it will be flash
update Gmail and all of the other top
email providers will detect this as a
virus and will probably throw the mail
in spam or will alert the user all the
target that this does indeed contain a
virus so you really have to be smart and
if it comes to you down to using a
rootkit to mask the keylogger
or to avoid anti virus detection you
know that that's where all the whole
social engineering process comes into
but as I said we'll be looking at that
in future videos and how to mask all of
these exploits or just basically how to
mask your program or key logger to avoid
detection by anti viruses and of course
by users because I said it's going to be
less likely that you can trick people
with things like this for example a fake
Word document that contains the the dot
docx extension file but also contains
the exe extension so it's really
important to understand that so let's
get started with actually creating this
key logger so it's going to tell you
warning enable access to less secure
apps on your gmail account now what this
means is you have to actually it's going
to ask you to use a gmail as you can see
it's going to tell you only works with
Gmail
now why you need to enter you or create
a gmail email for this is because you're
gonna need an email in which the
keylogger program will be sending back
the results to so I would recommend
creating a separate gmail account just
for getting your results back but as you
can see don't it's going to tell you
don't use your personal email make a
dedicated separate gmail account
specific specific for the for the
gathering of results so once you've
created it you just want to click on
this link you can just open the link in
a new tab and hopefully does that yeah
and it's gonna ask you if you're signed
in to that gmail account it's gonna ask
you to disable it's gonna ask you to
disable less secure apps an email
account what this is going to do is it's
going to allow your email to be under
the control of the keylogger so the
keylogger will be able to log in and
send request and send the results from
what it has gathered from e from your
targets computer or system and it will
save them on that email alright so as
you can see this key logger will send
logs 50 characters or each in 100 in
intervals of 120 seconds so again very
very powerful and you're getting
extensive information of course this
will becoming effective if the user is
not connected to the internet but again
you know this is how these things work
and there's always pros and cons to each
of the side so alright what I'm gonna do
I have not created an email for this
because I'll be explaining how to mask
this key logger in the next videos where
I'll be showing you how to use social
engineering to avoid detection anti
virus detection and obviously to mask it
so that users cannot detect or you know
it does not look obvious that this
indeed is a virus or malware so I'm just
going to enter a I'm just gonna enter a
simple which is gonna be using a just a
fake email address so what I would
recommend if you're going to be using
this is to use the Adobe Flash update
the reason I'm saying this is because
people when they see Adobe Flash they
already know that this is an executable
program
and from that if it's an exe file they
won't be as hesitant to run it as if you
would have found a document with the exe
extension so again I'm going to use the
first one and this is obviously for
social engineering purposes so Adobe
Flash update and it's going to ask you
to type your Gmail to receive the logs
so I'm just going to hit test at
gmail.com as I said in the next video
the follow-up videos I'll be making and
I'll be showing you how to essentially
hide or to ask these key loggers and
have the malware from detection so we're
just going to enter and our password so
test all said of course these this email
does not exist and this password again
is not real I'm just using it to show
you that indeed it does create D key
logger so once you've entered the foster
just hit enter and it's going to ask you
if this information is correct and I'm
going to be s and it's going to start
the creation process as you can see it's
creating the key logger and just give it
a few seconds hopefully it shouldn't
take too much time again the it'll take
different times depending on what type
of executable you choose whether you
choose the flash update or the word
documents or Excel documents etc etc so
that's actually done now and hopefully I
don't know where exactly it or there you
saved to dist
slash B flash dot exe so obviously again
as I mentioned previously it's gonna
save it in the be nagas folder that we
created in the dist folder now what I
was talking about here again when when
comes down to social engineering this is
the key logger file very very powerful
but again the trick is the trick has
always been making sure that this runs
on your targets computer without
detection and without he he or her him
or her basically finding out that it's
running now with be logger as far as I
know once you run this it will basically
install it and the only way to disable
it as a service is through the MS config
utility in Windows so again it does have
the ability to be disabled or to be
stopped so that was just a little tidbit
I wanted to throw in there for you so
again a bit of you could do a bit of you
know social engineering and renaming
this to look like an Adobe Flash update
and oh say six times out of ten you can
get your target to run this without them
knowing that this is indeed malware now
I'm not going to be running and testing
this because as I said if you try this
on a modern Windows installation with
Windows Defender enabled or running or
any other antivirus software it's gonna
detect that this is the virus and even
if you try and upload this to Gmail
it'll automatically detect that this is
a virus so again we'll have to do a bit
of social engineering in addition to
that I'm going to be creating a special
little small cost exclusive to the
YouTube channel where I'm gonna be
showing you how to create your very own
key logger with C++ now the reason for
that there are obviously some specific
advantages of using C++ is but that it
is a very low lying or it's a very low
it's a very low level language in the
sense that it if you also create a
keylogger
windows nine times out of ten would not
detect that this has anything to do with
malware or it's malicious content of any
type in addition to that an anti-virus
software would not have been able to
detect it so that's basically it for
this video guys I said I'm going to
making a follow up videos to this whole
B Locker section that I've created or in
in the larger context the keylogger
section on this channel so stay tuned
for that I hope you found value in this
video if you guys enjoyed this video
