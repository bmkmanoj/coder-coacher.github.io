with another video now in this video I'm
going to be reviewing a browser called
the max on browser now this is a new
browser and the company has been there
for quite a while now but this is their
new browser and they claim that it is
one of the best problems and it should
be competing with the top end browsers
out there so I'm gonna give a small
review and let's see whether it lives up
to its current name so without further
ado let's get to this all right guys I
will live the download link in the
description it is a free browser to
download so you don't have to buy
anything or pay for anything so just
download it install it normal setup and
once it's installed open it up now I'm
basically very very simple UI when you
start it up it will greet you with the
next one now which is basically the
homepage and gives you a very very nice
mix of news and/or shortcut to different
websites that you may want to visit so
as you can see Facebook YouTube Google
Gmail very very nice I really like this
you don't have to just start entering
the website basically like bookmarks but
bookmarks of a very popular websites
that you may want to visit you then have
top sites most recent and your last
session so as you can see very very nice
homepage but you can change it if you
want to so yeah that's basically the
home page that you get you also have a
obviously a shortcut bar just like all
other browsers and you can actually
create a limited amount of tabs so yeah
you do have that you do have the
possibility of creating an account with
Maxthon and signing in which will
basically give you the ability to save
information bookmarks passwords from
device to device so you can actually use
this browser on multiple devices with
your data being shared across all and
also on Android by the way so very
simple you have the user account as you
can see I created my account we do have
here what's called the info box
now info box is basically where you can
save pages for later viewing so as you
can see I haven't stored any pages right
now
but this is basically the pages that
they give you so introducing infobox
welcome to max l5 and there's different
things like that so but this is very
helpful if you save a lot of pages to
read later so it's actually better than
a bookmark and it's very very useful if
you read a lot of articles you then have
password keeper which I really like and
I find that very few browsers have
nowadays is a good password keeper so
you create a password for your password
keeper it works as a keychain and and
sort of on the lines of things like that
so once you add a password you can
manage your your passwords that you're
signed in with this browser pretty
self-explanatory
and yeah so as you can see possible
keeper will have you remember all posted
so you don't have to keep on you know
just struggling to remember passwords so
very useful feature there I really like
that feature you then have you you mail
I don't know what you you is supposed to
me but as you can see I set up a real
email enter commonly used email and will
provide privacy and management's palette
or email so it's very helpful they
actually help monitor and stop spam from
your email address by shielding it and
preventing these the people who send
spam to your email address very very
helpful feature which have never seen
millennial browser fantastic feature
hats off the maximum for that it's
actually a shielding service for free as
long as using their browser you can use
the you you mail alright so that's
basically for the features that come add
it on to the browser platform the
browsing experience as you can see you
can actually log in with your device if
you're using the browser on the advice
which is also a very good browser by the
way guys I will be reviewing with
sometime later so that's basically it
for the features again you have your
infobox password keeper and you your
mail as features that you don't get on
any other browser so very nice and yeah
so as you as I said again you can create
as many tablets as you like
and it gives you this very nice holiday
that I really like which gives you your
favorite websites that you like to visit
of course I haven't used this browser
I'm reviewing it as we speak so you do
have a few features on the search bar as
you can see you can select the search
engine you're going to be using Google
search being Yandex Yahoo Amazon Baidu
and McMaster won't search and you can
add your own for example doctor go and
whatever you want to use you then have
this ritual which is actually a proxy
button as I said again guys you can add
your own proxies so if you guys know
what you're doing you can actually turn
this into a deep web browser I'm just
kidding guys do that at your own risk if
you know but if you know what you guys
are doing in terms of proxies you can
see it's using it then to Explorer proxy
settings doesn't really make a
difference pretty pretty good but you
can manage and disable proxies very nice
now the thing I really loved about this
browser is that it comes pre-installed
with add-ons that I think everybody
should be using now one of those add-ons
is ad book adblock plus which is an ad
blocker and it don't turns it on Maxthon
blocker which actually blocks the popups
on this webs on any web site you're
browsing very nice you don't have to
install it and you know download install
it just saves you that asshole now again
very nice feature we have here is the
developer tools you basically give you
the developer console and the source
page and source element and you can
actually if you guys really find that
helpful it's right up there for you guys
to use very easy to reach no right
clicking and having a drop-down menu
anymore very nice then the other feature
that I really like and I don't find out
many of the browsers when they come for
stock of course extensions with chrome
can enable this feature but I would love
to see it integrated in browsers which
we have here and that is night mode so
you can actually switch to learn more
which gives the screen for better night
viewing so you're not straining your
eyes very nice feature that I really
like that
and now actually you can switch normal
mode and you can custom it can customize
your experience and it will activate
automatically between certain times so
as you can see you can also disable the
brightness and and the and the contrast
so very nice right there very nice
feature added by Mac stole a leg mode
which I find very little browsers have
support for the only browsers that have
that is Chrome and Mozilla which all are
enabled by extensions now in next
feature which I absolutely love to have
in every browser is the snap
now basically snap lets you just take a
very smaller like it's pretty
self-explanatory just snap an image or
whatever using from the web sites for
example slap the whole page and until
you save it as desktop give it a name
dot PNG and save and basically it's
going to save the the picture of the
page very self-explanatory of course you
can edit the quality as you consider
something wrong with the quality I get
there but maybe hopefully they'll fix
that I don't know whether it's for me
with my computer or the browser itself
but otherwise that's basically slap
allows you to take pictures of the
desktop no print screening anymore and
no using the snipping tool that comes
native to Windows alright the next thing
is translate all browsers have translate
so pretty self-explanatory very nice
when I fugitive right up there and
obviously you have your normal window
are private and your session you can get
a new session info boxes explained is
like a it's saves pages for later
viewing a bit better than that
bookmarking but yeah that's basically it
and your normal your normal settings
that come with every browser one
additional setting that does come in the
download manager so download manager
and Ride relates faster compared to
others but I won't I won't be surprised
if you don't find any difference in
terms of the download manager because
what really makes the difference is your
internet speed as you can see it's a
very very quick browser but it's not as
loyal as quick as Google Chrome I would
say my experience using it I've only
used it a couple of websites but it the
website's load really really quick the
only thing I found in terms of
differences between this browser and for
example Chrome which is the current best
browser is that it takes quite a while
to load images which chrome does very
well as you can see those BBC really
quick and then again it takes it takes
time on websites that have a lot of
images and you can see you miss a few
images here and there otherwise apart
from that the browser experience is
pretty pretty smooth as you can see
scrolling down while images are loading
is pretty smooth overall this browser is
a fantastic browser if you just want a
simple browser without installing
anything else any adults anything like
that and gives you an experience that is
really really very unique and at this
point in time and with the info backed
an info box possible keeper and yet you
you mail very unique browser in my
experience I would not switch to this as
my main browser for the time being
because of its lack of support and on on
different websites that require you by
installing plugins like the flash
plugins and stuff like that but I will
be keeping an eye on it I will be having
it's all my on my computer and updating
it regularly to see what they add on and
I'll be letting you guys know what's new
but if you guys I really want you guys
to go and try out this browser and let
me know in the comment section below or
on my social networks hit me up on
Twitter I'm always on Twitter and on my
updates it doesn't clear so you guys
want to keep up with me please make sure
you follow me on Twitter
I'll be updating everything I do on my
Twitter so again guys please please go
and try this out and let me know if
you'll be using this as your main
browser it's not let me know why let me
know what you think of the browser's
overall
otherwise guy
thanks for watching it's been hackers
