today's video we're actually going to
get started with the if-else statement
so in the previous video we looked at
the if statement and how it can be used
as you can see here in this when we're
looking at one add that B F statement
so let's actually look at the if-else
statement so let's get rid of this code
and to do this I'm basically we're gonna
we're going to create a very very cool
program that'll show you how this would
work so this program is going to ask you
for it's going to ask the user for for
bid for their age and then it's going to
basically compare it and see whether or
not you are the legal age to drink drink
alcohol so let's actually get started
and what the first thing we have to do
again is we have to prompt the user so
let's say please enter your age right
they're going to enter the age and then
we basically put a variable variable age
which is an integer and in terms of
default data type which is going to be
read line we're going to read that and
then to int all right so I'm going to
convert it to an integer and store it in
the variable age now we're going to use
the if statement again so you're going
to say if H is greater or equal to 21
years old that means you are your legal
you are in the legal age to drink
alcohol so what we would say is print
line you can drink you can drink off you
can drink alcohol you can drink alcohol
right now where the elf statement comes
in the if-else combination of these two
comes in so basically of you've told the
computer or the echo client programming
language all right so if age was what we
enter here if it is greater than or
equal to 21 print this but what if it's
not greater than or equal to 21 what if
your 12-volt if you're 10 years old
that's when you use the else statement
all right the other statement is very
very simple you just use the else
statement and you come down and use e to
curly braces all right and then
you can basically print whatever you
want to be printed if the edge is not
greater than equal to 21 so if it's not
it's not greater than or equal to 21 we
basically use the we say print we
basically say sorry we basically you are
not allowed to drink right and that will
basically display that so now if we if
we run this program so let's run this
program and let's see what it gives us
let's enter our edge so it's going to
say please enter your age and I can say
90 all right it's going to say you are
not allowed to drink pretty awesome
let's try that again now with and let's
let's write an edge an edge like 30 and
it's going to say you can drink alcohol
right so pretty cool now in addition to
this you can have some you can have some
you can have some more fun but we'll get
to that in the next video so this is
basically the if-else statement as I
said your testing we basically to
summarize what have done with ask the
user to enter their age all right we are
basically allowing the user to enter the
edge and we are storing the edge in the
age variable in an integer datatype all
right we then go into the if statement
and we say if the age entered or the
edge stored in the age variable is
greater than or equal to 21 if you
basically print you can drink alcohol if
it's not you say else print line you are
not allowed to drink simple program that
basically explains the if and the
if-else statement all in one so thank
you so much for watching this video you
have any questions just let me know in
the key of a section of the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
