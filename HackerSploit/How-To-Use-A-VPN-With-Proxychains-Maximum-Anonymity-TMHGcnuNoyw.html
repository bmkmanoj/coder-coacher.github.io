with another video and in this video I'm
gonna be showing you how to setup your
VPN with proxy chain so that it works
together with Kali Linux or parrot OS in
a virtualized environment okay so I'm
going to assume that you already have
selected your VPN at your VPN provider
if you haven't I would recommend not VPN
you can check them out with the link in
the description that being said I'm not
going to promote anything else a lot of
you guys have been asking for me for
this and whether or not it increases
your security and I'm going to answer
that in a second but before I actually
do that I just want to say that I am
making the videos dependent and in
regards to the chronological order in
which you guys posted them so for
example we have the two other guides
coming out we have the complete
anonymity guide and the complete system
hardening guide that was requested by
mr. GFY I'm just going to call you that
so if you are watching this mr. gfy that
videos also coming out the ss7 video was
rejected by YouTube so I love to upload
it to the site what else let me see
quickly before we move on the web
application penetration testing series
is still ongoing that being said let's
get started with a video ok so I already
have node VPN opened and I'm connected
to a server in the United Kingdom all
right now many people were asking can I
use my VPN in conjunction with Kali
Linux and then can I also use proxy
chains and will it increase security the
answer is yes it will increase security
but at what expense or at what cost you
might be asking well what you're
sacrificing is speed okay now again for
most of you this might not be an issue
but depending on the speed of your eyes
of your VPN service or your ISP you know
you have to take that oil in to come
into consideration so again what I'm
saying is your VPN might slow down your
speed to a certain extent and there's no
questions asked there and then as we
know proxy chains is also very slow
because it is going through a series of
proxies and under the Tor network that's
if you're using the Tor relay
okay so the first thing I would
recommend that you do is on your host
operating system which I'm guessing is
going to be Windows but it could be
Linux you must change your domain name
server all right now usually with most
of the good VPNs like not VPN they will
automatically use the domain name server
in the wall essentially in the location
of that server so for example if you
ignite United Kingdom it's going to use
a DNS from the United Kingdom and now I
again I do recommend that you use a
safer one probably like cloud flares
or whatever you choose to use that's all
up to you so make sure you have your
domain name server changed or you can
choose to use the one that your VPN is
providing you with whatever you choose
it's up to you know I have Kali Linux
open here and these settings that you
guys were asking is how to configure it
with my virtual machine now you also
asking me whether I should you should
install two instances of your VPN one on
your host operating system and one on
your virtual machine and the truth is
you don't need to do that what you
should do is you should use your host
operating systems IP address on your
virtual machine if that's what you're
looking for
now you might be asking well why should
they do this why can't I just run it on
your virtual machine the truth is you
can run it on your virtual machine but
again we're focused on minimizing the
resources that are required by the
virtual machine so it's it's our out
recommend that you run everything on
your host operating system in regards to
connections and VPNs and then you can
use your penetration testing operating
system for what it's used for which is
penetration testing okay so what I'm
going to do now is I'm just going to
show you how to configure that with your
VM so you want to go into your VM
settings I'm going to be using VMware
the settings should be the same for
VirtualBox although as I mentioned I'm
really getting out of out of touch or
well VirtualBox is not my favorite at
the moment so VM and you want to go into
your settings alright and you want to go
into your network adapter and instead of
bridged you can go for NAT all right now
what this means is it's going to use
it's going to use your host operating
your host operating systems IP address
so that means it's going to use Windows
IP address which in this case is the
VPNs IP address that is provided to us
so now Cali
we'll also be connected to the VPN all
right so once you do that just hit OK
and for safe precaution you can also
change your your DNS settings here and
you can also restart your network
manager just in case but it should do it
for years you can see there we are it is
connected and water we can do now is run
a DNS leak test just to show you all
right so let me just open the DNS leak
test here turns out I was using the DNS
leak test alright so there we are let's
open that up and as you can see it's
using United Kingdom and I'm gonna
perform a standard test to show you that
it does use the DAT domain name server
in the country that the server lies so
you can see it's United Kingdom now
you're asking me if I can use proxy
chains in conjunction with my VPN and
the truth is yes you can but you're
going to sacrifice a lot of speed all
right so the first thing again myth
since we're using the door relay or the
Tor proxy is make sure you have tour
started I'm gonna respond or restart my
service tour restart and then you can
use your proxy chains well again as I
said you can use proxy chains in an
instance with any program so proxy
chains this time we're going to use
Firefox because we are testing the IP
here Firefox and DNS leak test sorry
about that DNS leak test comm you know
my keyboard is quite far away from my
DNS and that's the wrong spelling there
leak leak test there we are and let me
hit enter and for some reason it's still
showing United Kingdom and I think I
know why is because we did not close
down Mozilla so make sure it's not a
completely new instance so let me start
that again
and as you can see random chain is
working so give that a few seconds to
load up and you'll see that it is going
to take a significantly longer than with
your VPN as you can see from United
Kingdom we're not bouncing off to Sweden
which as you can see is quite different
so I'm going to perform a standard test
and let's see what DNS that we are given
here this should not load up thus
because we're using the top proxy and
this is where essentially well looks
like we are using
reusing a German one which is being
provided to us by the proxy but again
make sure that you your first DNA
or the first DNS server that your
traffic is going to be flowing through
is a secure one because this one won't
matter even if you know your first one
was going through your ISP so again make
sure your host operating system has a
trustworthy DNS and then make sure that
your Kali Linux is also running a
trustworthy DNS and then after that you
pretty much should be absolutely
anonymous and as you can see proxy
change is working really well with your
VPN that being said that's going to be
it for this video if you found value in
this video if you enjoyed it please
leave a like down below if you have any
questions or suggestions let me know in
the comment section or my social
networks or you can also post your
questions on my website for the latest
hacking news and resources you can check
out my website a chestplate comm and
that's going to be it for this video and
I'll be seeing you in the next video
