with another video this time just a
quick update video on the latest version
of Kali Linux so Kali Linux 20 18.1 has
finally been released I was expecting it
around the the last week of January so
it was a bit late but irregardless it is
out and it is only featuring a few small
updates
alright so as you can see the reason why
this this update took quite a while was
because it there was a lot of challenges
to fix the issues that were caused by
the meltdown inspector vulnerabilities
alright so the patches as they've said
will be in the latest kernel which is
the fourteen point one five all right so
they fixed some bugs and updated it
because they were very very mandatory so
looking at the kernel they have updated
the kernel fourteen point one four or
fourteen point one four of fourteen
point fourteen really alright so the
kernel does not have a lot of new
features but it's fictional of bugs and
they're trying to get the whole meltdown
specter vulnerabilities or and you fixed
with patches all right but as they've
said the patches will be in the 4.15
kernel so I'm expecting the most stable
released version of eighteen to be
either to be the twenty eighteen point
to that's when we'll see some really
good stable version all right so some of
these changes in the kernel exist as the
MD secure memory encryption support so
this allows you to essentially the
memory is encrypted it gives you the
that ability with AMD processors all
right so that's really just something to
it with memory management in terms of
the in terms of memory limits they've
allowed the memory limits to be
increased on 64-bit processors alright
so that is really really to do with
hardware them in terms of the package
updates if you want to update if you
have Kali Linux currently installed and
you want to update it you just need to
update your packages and your
repositories and then perform a full
upgrade and that can be done with the
apt-get update and the apt full upgrade
or apt this upgrade all right now for
some of you have actually
messages regarding the repository key
being expired a lot of you had this
error and I did too but I already knew
this because it happened some time back
in 2013 where the key had expired and
you know at that time I was still a noob
so I knew exactly what had happened and
I went directly to the blog to see that
they have updated to add a new key all
right so you just need to run the W gate
command to get the latest key so you
have to run it as root alright so in
terms of the hyper-v updates so if you
are running hyper-v to run your virtual
machines you'll find that the hyper-v
virtual machine is now in generation 2
which means you if you if I is is based
or expanding shrinking hard drives also
is supported so what this means is if
you're running hyper-v you can expand
and shrink the hard drives or the
virtual hard drives that you're
currently using
without partitioning or increasing the
partition size which is awesome all
right so it's really very simple and if
you're new to call the NEX you can just
download it from the download page so
that was just a quick update on the
latest version of Kali Linux and what
this update features but again in my
opinion I would feel that the the best
version this year would be the 2018
point to release and obviously the 2018
point 3 lists that is usually the most
stable but a regardless of that I'm
gonna be using it obviously on a day to
day basis I'm going to be performing
some tests and we'll see what we make of
it so thank you so much for watching
guys if the found value in this video
please leave a like and if you have any
questions let me know in the comments
section on my social networks or you can
hit me up on kik and I'll be seeing you
in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
