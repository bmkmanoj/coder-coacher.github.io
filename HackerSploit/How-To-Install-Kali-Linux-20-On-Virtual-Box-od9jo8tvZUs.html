another video and in this video I'm
gonna be showing you how to install Kali
Linux 2.0 on a virtual machine now I'm
going to be using the Oracle VirtualBox
for this tutorial I'm gonna be
explaining explaining it all through the
process so there's what you have to do
open up VirtualBox and make sure you
have done with the latest kali linux 2.0
iso from the website down whatever
version you are on 64-bit or 32-bit so
what one bill is it new and give it a
name I'm gonna call mine Callie it's the
4 bit
I'm gonna select Linux and make sure you
select Debian sorry oh is Debian Debian
64-bit or 32-bit according to the ISO
you can be using so hit next this is the
amount of ram you wanna give your
virtual machine I recommend both 2
gigabytes 2048 and megabytes that's 2
gigabytes of RAM I create a virtual hard
drive now that's if you want to install
it um if you wanna install it just hit
create which I'm gonna be showing you
and select Virtual Box disk image or you
can select AV MDK a virtual machine disk
which then leaves by different virtual
machines globally so the next thing you
want to do and is select whatever
whatever you want I'm going to select a
VDI just for this VirtualBox virtual
machine because this is the only one I
use so next then I'm dynamically
allocated and that's fine in a fixed
size with whatever you want you can just
do that I'm not gonna be installing it
I'm just gonna be showing you that how
to set it up so next 80 eggs is fine
create and once it's created you want to
hit settings make sure selected your
Kali setting go to advanced make sure
all of that is done leave encryption
like that and global system now in
system you will make sure boot order it
also boots from the network pointing
device you can select whatever Mouse
and stuff like that processor you can
select how many processes you want to
use one is fine for me and the most
important setting here is to make sure
the enable PAE or NX is ticked to make
sure you take that acceleration leave
that the way it is display give it 128
megabit megabytes of dedicated video
memory and wanted to count how many
monitors you can be used I used to but
for this demonstration we will be using
one so that's one enable 3d acceleration
and it's storage now here's where you
select your Kali Linux ISO - in my
downloads as you can see Kali Linux
64-bit open that up audio select
wouldn't call your driver you have four
speakers connected and mom I will just
be using me normal computer speakers
Network and now this is the most
important thing here now it allows you
to use up to four adapters what I
recommend using is a bridged adapter and
selecting your Wi-Fi adapter here that
most of the time that's the only problem
that you usually get here if you select
a nap driver I mean usually something
goes wrong but if you're having those
problems connecting to the internet once
you're on Kali Linux make sure that you
select a bridged adapter and make sure
that this is your Wi-Fi adapter a to
2.11 serial ports if you wanna connect a
serial device USB whatever USB
controller you only use shared and using
two-thirds leave all of that - it's off
and just hit OK so I'm going to start it
up and show you alright so the machine
is started may have been I'm going to
just use life just to show you that
everything works the way it's supposed
to
all right so once Kali Linux boot it up
what you want to do is just check your
Wi-Fi adapter it's okay if it says white
or white connected it doesn't matter
doesn't it it's gonna be using the Wi-Fi
but if it says Y it is no problem with
that
it's love using Wi-Fi so watch what
you're gonna do is hopefully browser
we're gonna use the stock browser
iceweasel
it's not that bad actually I'm sorry in
taking a bit of time because I'm running
on a virtual machine all right let me
just enlarge that and open a website
like Kali Docs for example and as you
can see Internet is working I can
actually scroll through the website and
install all the new repositories for
example here so that's so that's what so
that's what I'm trying to explain
everything works perfectly if you just
follow those settings most of the time
as many people get stuck with the
network adapter part but that's
basically how to do it um if you have
any any problems you want you want me to
help you with just let me know in the
comments or comment on my blog and I
will help you I will reply if you like
