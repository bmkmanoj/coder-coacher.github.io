with another video and in this video i'm
gonna be showing you how you can install
pokemon go on any Android device in any
region or any country that doesn't
support it yet or hasn't reached to that
country yet so it's very simple guys the
link will be in the description to
download the apk and where you can
install it directly from there so you
can either do this on your phone on your
pc and then cop if you're doing it from
your pc you can copy the APK file from
my pc to your phone but if you're doing
this from your phone very simple just
click the link in description and look
and it'll take you to this page ap
camera so click pokemon go 0.2 a 9.0
that's the APK version scroll all the
way down till you see download apk and
once you once you click on that will
take you to this page your download is
starting let's give it a few seconds
until it starts and yeah you can choose
whatever downloader you have and yet you
just have to sit start downloading and
once it's done as you can see mines down
here one second let me just open my file
manager and show you sorry about that
the timer and so basically once it's
done you just have to install the APK
where which where did I keep where does
it save it sorry about this guy's it
saves it to my APK folder I've a lot of
apks that I sideload oops I think I'm
gonna have to search for it so let me
just search for come on go there we are
and it hit install it's already
installed but i'll show you that it
works so just hit install and it's going
to say installing installing you have a
few more seconds and you should be good
to go and make sure you have your
location or gps active for this game to
work obviously och you meant it reality
game so just let it go and hit open and
i think you should be ready to go there
we are the pokemon company lantic give
it a few seconds to load up and into
your location
and yeah so let's just give this lady
and of course I remember remember to be
alert at all times and stay aware of
your surroundings all right I'm just
gonna fast-forward this till it's done
all right guys here we are Pokemon goal
is working officially as you can see my
level forum and we don't play that with
a lot time there we go level 4 so
basically as you can see it Rick it
