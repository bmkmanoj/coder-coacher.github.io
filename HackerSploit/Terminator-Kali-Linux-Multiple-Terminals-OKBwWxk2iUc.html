with another video in this video I'm
gonna be showing you how to download and
install and use Terminator for Kali
Linux now some of you might be asking
yourself why do we need or what the hell
is Terminator well Terminator is a Linux
or terminal replacement or an
alternative and you might be asking
yourself again why do we need a
replacement for the terminal well
Terminator gives you a whole lot of
options that you don't get with the
default terminal and allows you to be a
bit more robust with your operations
using the terminal now I'm going to show
you how we're going to do it
so the first thing we need to do is just
install it and it's really very simple
so I'm gonna open up my normal terminal
the irony there is that I'm going to be
using the terminal to install another
terminal all right so it's really very
simple we're going to use our package
manager apt-get install and terminator
alright so again if you're not intrude
make sure you use the sudo or Super User
I'm already in route so I don't need to
enter so get installed Terminator and
once eight enter it should download it
and install it I already have it
installed because as I said I use it a
lot and this is what I prefer when I'm
doing my you know when I'm doing my work
projects and stuff like that and I'm
gonna show you why in a second
alright so that's done Algiers is
installed you can basically search for
it
so Terminator and it's going to be the
red one right so I'm gonna add this to
my favorites right now and once I launch
it it's going to open up the terminal
let's give it a few seconds there we are
and you might be asking yourself well
what's this you know it just works like
a normal it just works like a normal
terminal and you're right it is a normal
terminal the reason I use it is it
allows me to to have multiple terminals
open up in in this same instance so let
me show you what I mean
alright so if I wanted to if I was
working on a different project for
example let's say I wanted to start
scanning
for let's say I wanted to open up nmap
here whatever and I wanted to open love
the terminal instead of opening another
instance what I would do is I would
split it vertically and it would open
another one for me all right and then I
could let's say open something like
nikto all right and open that up like so
and what if I wanted to open a little
bit more I would split it vertically and
open one more there and again split it
vertically and open another one and I
guess you guys can see why this is so
cool and awesome it allows you to view
all your running processes in one which
is awesome zero switching from one
terminal to another so I could be a go
for proxy chains here chains mine I
could say proxy chains Firefox whoops
and like like something like duck Doug
goal.com something like so and it will
start up there and that's good we're
working and open up there and in the
fourth wall we can whoops
msf con so we can open up hoops we can
open up Metasploit there and it should
start up as well and I guess you guys
can see how awesome this is so it allows
you to view your terminal in more of a
robust view and in a split window and
you can see everything running in one
and it's pretty pretty awesome so this
is a little quick tip that I wanted to
show you guys and it hopefully it will
improve your productivity and your
workflow in Kali Linux which is very
very important especially as you move on
to larger and larger projects you need
to you know speed up the process and be
very very efficient at what you do so I
