video we're basically going to be
looking at the else if statement which
is very similar to the if-else statement
but it has some advantages over that so
again to explain this I'm going to be
creating now a program that will ask the
user for their grade their grading for
example for example the result in a test
or their grade in whatever they in a
test you can also use that as well and
then we're going to basically compare it
and give them a rating on their grade so
if they're if they got a certain amount
of marks they would get this grade and
if they got set amount amount of months
they will get that grade so the first
thing we are going to do again is going
to prompt the user print going to say
print please enter your grade all right
and they're going to enter their grade
again now we have to create variables
variable variable grade which is I think
let's use a double in terms of data type
and we're gonna say this is basically
read read line dot - - double alright so
we've converted it to a double now
basically they're going to enter the
grade and we can start by saying let's
start by using a simple if statement and
we say if we know that we cannot grade
agree we cannot give a grade to marks
anything below zero so let's start with
that so say if the grade is less than
zero is less than or equal to zero all
right if grade is less than or equal to
zero we basically say print and we say
please please enter two valid marks all
right but now you might have realized
something right the person who wrote
this mock might have actually got zero
and zero is a valid mock so what we're
going to use now here is you're going to
say if grade is less than or equal to
zero is less than is less than zero
alright then we're going to say
please enter a valid present a valid
mark so anything in the negative will
basically a prompt this to open up all
right then we can say we can also add
something here with the logic operator
so we're going to say end which is a
double + sign and we're going to say end
gray is greater than 100 or X so we know
anything that's greater than less than 0
and greater than 100 cannot be valid
marks so then we're going to say else if
all right that's where you integrate the
else if statement this is where it makes
a lot of sense because we are going to
give it another set of condition so else
if grid let's start off with the 90s so
let's say if grade is greater than or
equal to 90 and let's say greater than
or equal to 90 so that means yeah if
grade is greater than or equal to 90 we
can say print let's say you got an A all
right that's a good statement so someone
got 90 greater than anything greater
than or equal to 90 they got an A and
we've already given the statement saying
that if it's larger than 100 it's not
counted as valid marks all right but
then you might be asking yourself what
if someone got a hundred not great not
more than hundred but you got a perfect
score well for this you're going to use
the order all right so you guys I'm
pretty sure you guys are already
familiar with this these are the logic
operators so it going to use the or
operator when you say or grid we can
basically say grade is actually we don't
need to enter that here so if percent
interpreted grid is good to the network
to 90 then we can say else if we can
create another one and we can say grid
is you can say equal to 100 all right so
I've entered a grade that was equal to
hundred if the enter the grid that was
you can say create less than or equal to
100
then we can say that they got
you can say print you got a perfect
score and you can go on and on until the
person even got something less so no no
no let's enter the last one else we can
use the elf statement knowing it's a
grade is less than or equal to 40 we say
if you got anything less than equal to
40 we bet you basically failed right so
you can say sorry you forgot to add the
F here in section sorry my typing is
really really bad because I'm talking to
the microphone so basically you fail so
now if we enter this and let we're going
to run to three types of grades and
let's see what it returns so let's run
this program and it's going to say
please enter a grade let's say I got 80
we didn't give a condition for that so
it's going to say we got a perfect score
again this is what I was saying if it
says you got a perfect score that means
you've made something so this less than
or equal to 90 and we have to include
some the end grade is greater than or
equal to 90 just to make sure that it
stays in that range all right so let's
try and run this lock again
all right so now let's say right if we
entered 80 it's not going to give us
anything because we don't we didn't give
a condition for Ag but now let's try and
run anything over let's say 92 let's say
someone got 92 in the test it's going to
say you got an a perfect it's working
let's let's try and see if someone got
if someone enters a hundred let's say
someone entered 100 and 100 we've got an
error over there so okay so if grade is
less than equal to grade is greater than
a hundred please enter valid marks all
right so less than or equal to all right
so that's just a small mistake now if we
were to run this program again and say
we someone got less than let's say
someone got thirty which is less than 40
they failed the test
so that's basically it right for this
video so you now understand the if and
the else if statement and the else
eighth statement with Lundy if the elves
and the else if statement so now you
guys should be pretty comfortable with
these conditional statements and that's
basically it for this video guys if you
have any questions just let me know in
the key when a section of the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
