this video I'm basically going to be
explaining a tional operators and how
they're used in scotland so let's get
started and I'm going to create a new
kata line class so I'm going to call
this relational relational operators so
what our relational operators well let
me just create the main function
before we go anything function main augs
array this opens in terms of a string
oops let me actually just correct that
string and then we open this as a
function so you can open that now as I
was saying what is a relational operator
for most of you who have done
mathematics even at the high school
level will understand that relational
operators are basically these operators
right here D greater than less than
alright you then have your equal to and
then your not equal to all right so
these are the basic relational operators
that exist in Kotlin and are very very
similar to the ones that exist in our
other programming languages so you might
be also asking yourself when do I get to
use these well you could get to use
these for example in if statements which
we'll be discussing
so be false to do a simple test program
to explain these three so if we say
variable a is equals to well let's say
ten variable B is equal to 20 all right
so now if we were to say if you were to
say a is greater than B all right that
that's not how you would basically put
it so if you are to use an if statement
and we want to say a is greater than B
so if a is greater than B and this is a
zip and we were basically saying if a is
greater than B which is not if you
basically print out something here so we
will say print a is not
greater than B and this would come out
true because a in reality is not greater
than B the values are not greater than
the value of a is not greater than B and
if you are to run this will basically
get this response right here a is not
greater than B so but you're saying that
it's not getting a response and that's
because you're testing if a is not
greater than B which is not so then it's
not going to print this but if we
reverse this and say B is greater than a
then it should actually respond by
saying a is not greater than B or we can
say a is greater than B I mean B is
greater than a so that's basically the
simple relation or now when talking
about relational operators you have the
greater than or equal to I'm sure you
guys remember this if you have done this
in mathematics is you basically have
your greater than or equal to and that
what basically means if B is is greater
than or equal to a so if B is greater
than 10 or equal to 10 greater than 10
or equal to 10 right but in this case
it's none so this is just to make sure
that if it's equal to 10 or greater than
10 then it should print out the result
you then have your less than and equal
to which works the similar way so if B
is less than to be a which is not or
equal to a which is again it's not so
it's not gonna print this out all right
you then have your equal to which is
basically this is B is equal to a which
it isn't alright so that this is your
equals to operator you then have your
not equals to operator which B is not
equals to a which is true and it will
basically print this out so these are
the operators so if we were just to look
at them we have to say this is greater
than we have the less than alright we
then have your greater than or equal to
you have the less than or equal to you
then have your your equal to and then
you have your not equal to all right so
these are basically your relational
operators that you have come across very
very a lot especially in when
programming for Android it's cotton
so that's basically it guys for this
video if you have any questions just let
me know in the key I section of the
course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
