in this video we can be discussing what
variables are how to declare variables
in Cortlandt and basically how they work
so let's start off with explaining what
a variable is so variables can be used
in programming to store or to manipulate
values so for example if I wanted to
store a mobile phone number for a user
for example on a program I would
basically declare a variable and give it
a value which is the phone number which
can then later be accessed or
manipulated if his his or her phone
number changes that's a very basic
example so let's still continue with the
program that we had opened so we're
going to basically run a mini program
right here that will basically display
information about yourself so get rid of
these two lines all right and the first
thing we're going to do is we're just
going to print we're just going to get
rid of the print statements and let's
get started with how variables work so
in court length to declare variable all
you have to do is just hit var which is
standing 4 which is a short for variable
all right so once you do that you not
want to give it the variable a name so I
can give it for example variable I can
say variable a is equals to I can say a
value of 20 all right so it will
automatically detect this is the beauty
of Kotlin cortland will automatically
detect the datatype of 20 so for those
of you who have learnt about datatypes a
number in Kotlin for example a number
like energy is considered to be an
integer datatype alright so I'll explain
what these datatypes really are but as
I'm saying in Kotlin you don't have to
declare the data type you could declare
the data type but I will get to that in
a few seconds now for example if I said
let me declare another variable let's
say I said variable let's say car
all right variable car is equals to we
can say open your quotation marks and
you can take
Ferrari right we can say Ferrari and it
will automatically detect that the car
is storing a data type of string all
right
so it's automatically going to know
because they've given the variable a
value in string format it will it will
automatically detect that it indeed is a
string so what if you wanted to enforce
the fact that for example the value of a
B variable a can only be an integer what
you could do is enter a colon and just
enter I NP which basically means integer
and it's basically what this does is
basically enforces the fact that
variable a can only be an integer in
terms of value so if I was to basically
go down here and say variable a is
equals to let's say Alexis all right for
example it would not change all right so
basically if I was to update the
variable later in the program let's say
I said the variable is is 20 and then I
for example went and said a is equals to
a is equals to 2 I wrote it as a string
format it would not update because we
have already enforced the fact that it's
an integer datatype
no what we would do is we would say a is
equals to 30 and it would recognize that
a is is to turkey
so let's actually test that so let's
print and with open brackets now since
we are printing a variable all we have
to do is give the variable name so we're
going to say variable a all right so
let's print out variable a without this
a is equals to 30
so let's hit ctrl s if you guys remember
and we're just going to run this this
program and what is going to say now I
can already tell you is it going to say
a is going to print a is equals to 20 as
you can see down here so now if we were
to say let's just add a line before the
print statement and let's say
a is equals to 50 all right now it would
probably print it will probably print 50
so let's actually see that in in
practice and there you go it's going to
say 50 now if we again were to do
something like use a string value and
let's say 20 for example and we try and
save this it's already giving us an
error saying that the required is
integer not a string all right so this
probably will not will not run and not
give us a result in the console so as
you can see it's going to tell you we
have an error so that's basically how to
basically how to enforce a datatype on a
variable right so that's basically
enforcing datatypes on a variable now
what we could do in addition to all of
this is we could say we give a variable
for example variable let's say variable
email and we could say variable email :
we should only accept a string because a
variable is only supposed to be a string
and we give a question mark all right
now what this means what this means is
that this the variable email is going to
wait to be assigned a value by the
programmer or a user so if we run this
the basically the Werdum the variable
email does not have a value at this
moment so we then can go down here and
say email is equals to Alexei Alexis at
gmail.com and basically now if we were
to print we were to print email the
variable email and let's try and run
this we should basically get this email
right here so let's let that actually
just run and there you have it
so it's actually just going to it's
going to wait for a value as you can see
over here it's going to have basically
declared the variable email and we have
used the colon we've enforced the data
type string so has made sure that it's
only going to accept a string data type
and we have left a question mark which
means it's going to wait to be assigned
a value and we have basically given the
value as Alexis at email comm then once
we have assigned the value as that we
have basically printed my email address
which it really isn't my email address
by the way all right now that's
basically worked what it comes to what
it what it comes down to when dealing
with variables again I will discuss a
few other data types in the future but
basically to declare variables to
summarize what we have just done you use
the variable command you then give the
variable a name so let's try a variable
let's actually create a small mini
program that will describe or give you
information about yourself so let's say
variable name is equals to I want you
guys to do this as well variable name is
equals to my name is equal to Alexis so
we know it's a string all right we don't
have to enforce it because it's already
registered and we're not going to be
updating this variable anytime soon so I
want you guys to do the same thing
create a variable with your name Alexis
then go down get another variable with
the another variable with the name age
and give it a value of your age I am 19
years old for example and I'll skip down
below now the next variable we're going
to say variable I want you to give a
variable of your email all right and
basically use the or we can basically
use your variable we can say you can
just say phone right so phone and we
know that phone number is entered in an
integer format so int and we basically
give it a value I want you to give your
value of your of your phone number so
I'm just gonna basically say 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 you can use your phone number if you
want alright and once you're done with
that just go down and I'm going to show
you something really cool as well so one
of the cool things you can do with the
in Kotlin as you can do with any other
programming language is use a Khan
Khattak
operator now what a concatenation
operator is basically it allows you to
to basically print a text and variables
value from variables so let me just
explain this right now so I'm going to
say print line because you want to print
this on its own line so print line open
and we're going to use now we're going
to create a sentence that is explaining
information about us using these
variables that we've already declared so
we're going to say my name is and you
want to give a space and now you want to
exit the speech brackets I mean the
speech marks and you want to use the
plus sign now this is a concatenation
operator this allows you to use for
example a string like this and you can
then add it to a variable so now we have
said my name is and we're going to use
the variable name and we're going to use
another concatenation operator and we're
going to say we're going to open another
we could open another pair of speech
marks and give it a space and say my
name is we've already said name which
will get the value of your name and
whenever I'm going to say and I am give
a space use another concatenation
operator and you want to use your age
variable now and you want to use another
concatenation operator and say my name
is your name and then I am age and then
we want to open another set of speech
box and say years old all right and you
want to give a space and finally we can
use the final set of concatenation
operators and say my name is this eight
years old and my phone number is space
and let me just drag this to the side
right here it's getting a bit long we're
going to the plus sign and we're going
to say fall because that's the variable
and that's it so once we're done with
that we have basically created a
sentence with either use of all the
variables and concatenation to basically
link text and variables we're going to
hit ctrl s and we're going to run this
and let's see what value it gives us all
right so let's you're the program
returns to us and there you go so it's
going to say my name is Alexis I am 19
years old and my phone number is blah
blah blah and that's basically how to
utilize variables how to basically
define variables how they work how you
can use text and variables in
conjunction with each other and that's
basically it for this video guys in the
next video we're going to be looking at
some of the common data types and the
different types of variable declarations
so thank you so much for watching if you
have any questions let me know in the
