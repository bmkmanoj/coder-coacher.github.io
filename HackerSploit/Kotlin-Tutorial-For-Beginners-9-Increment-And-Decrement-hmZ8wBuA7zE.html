this video I'm basically going to be
explaining increment and decrement
operators in Kotlin so you might be ask
yourself what are increment and
decrement operators used or put in place
to increment or decrement the value of a
variable or a variable itself so let me
actually show you this so again let me
just let me create a new class let me
get rid of this old class and let me
create a new class called increment and
decrement so increment in date and
decrement alright so let's actually get
rid of this comment right here let's get
the function string all right there we
are let's open that up now when as I
said it's basically used to increment or
decrement the value of a variable so if
I was to say variable K alright is equal
to let's say variable a is equals to 1
alright variable B is equals to 2 right
now if I was to say variable some
variable sum is equal to a plus B right
if I would be false to say that that
would make sense all right but now what
if I was to say what basically an
increment operator is used is denoted by
let me just comment coming here to see
the increment of rate or rate greater
all right so basically an increment
operator is denoted by two plus signs
all right and what these plus signs mean
in essence is the following all right so
it's very similar to saying the plus
signs mean this they mean a is equals to
a plus 1 all right so it's going to be
the value of a plus 1 the value of 1 so
if a right now is 1 and we add 1 and we
add it to B which is 2
what answer do you think we'll get if
all this makes sense and we have
actually used
increment operator correctly it should
really return the result of some as four
so let's actually print that out as some
and let's let's try let's run this and
let's see whether we get four in theory
it should return four so let's see that
let it run again is taking time because
I'm just started up IntelliJ so let's
just compile the code and here we are
it's going to give us four so pretty
pretty simple to understand what an
increment operator does it adds one to
the original value of the variable so if
we have here if we had if we had four as
a value of a then a would become five
because there's increased the value by
one and the answer would be seven so
let's try and say that just to make sure
everything is working according to our
understanding of how it works all right
there we are seven pretty simple pretty
easy to understand now when you're
talking about decrement operators limit
just comment lists when talking about
your decrement operators my typing is
really really bad alright so when
talking about decrement operators we can
basically do the same thing as we did
over here we can say a variable
difference is equal to a minus B but
with decrement operators it's very very
it's a it's so similar to the first one
that all you have to do is add two
negative signs all right and that means
minus the value so let me just let me
comment that so you understand that it
means a a is equals to a minus 1 all
right and that basically means it's
reducing the value of the variable by
one that's what a decrement operator is
now a one more thing I needed to tell
you is that B increment and decrement
operators are always supposed to be put
before the variable
after the variable before the variable
so let's say we had a unique situation
where we are saying a minus B but we
want to decrement B if you you can even
do it like this and it will still
understand that your decrementing so
let's see what this means right
so if we have decremented B it means the
value of B the new value of B after
decrement ation is 1 all right and a is
still going to be 4 so 4 minus 1 should
return 3 so let's try and print that out
print difference or ink love the song
let me just save this and let's run this
so it should in theory return 3 and
there we are so that's basically
increment and decrement operators so
just to summarize an increment operator
just is just deals with two positive
signs before the before the variable all
right and it increases the value by one
all right for decrement operators it
reduces the value by one and again it
uses the negative signs and again it it
basically comes before the variable so
those are basically equal increment and
decrement operators very very important
for you to understand them and that's
basically it for this video if you have
any questions just let me know in the
