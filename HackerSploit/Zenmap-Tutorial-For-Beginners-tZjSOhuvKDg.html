with another video and today I'm going
to be talking about Zenda so it might be
asking sir what is enna and why am I
doing this video well a lot of people
have asked me I seen nmap and I've also
seen something else called Zen map
well basically Zen map was created by
the nmap team so it's actually a it's a
version it's actually created by the
nmap team and basically what it is is it
provides a graphical user interface
representation of an map so let me
actually show you that right now it's
going to be under information-gathering
just where we where you'll find an map
right so as you can see how fine and map
and all the way at the bottom because
it's arranged alphabetically you can
find Zen map so just grant it
administrator privileges and it's going
to start it now as I mention as I said
this is basically just giving users an
additional way of using n maps so if you
don't like the command the command line
interface and and you really don't like
how the information is displayed you can
actually use this and as you can see
they really made they really made it
user friendly and it's very easy to
understand so let's go over the
interface huh so over here you have your
target now this is basically off your IP
range or IP address your domain or
website whatever you want to target you
Ellie Eugene just enter it right here
you then have your profile which is
basically a group of commands that are
categorized into options as you can see
here an intense can is also an
aggressive scan so and down here you
have your commands which you can
actually enter your own personal
commands and you can personalize what
scan results you want to get NC so let's
actually try with an example so I'm
going to use the our popular scan
windows n lab book or it actually fills
it out for me and I'm going to stick
with the intent scan as you can see
there are others here that you can use
you have your quick scan your ping scan
your trace route and the comprehensive
can which is a bit longer so I'm going
to give a
use the intent scan and empty command is
going to give me what it's going to look
like if I run it in the terminal or the
command-line interface so we have a map
within which is initializing and then we
have t4 we have a we have V and we have
the domain that we actually using so I
haven't talked to you about what t4 is
right so basically what t4 is it's not
really a very important thing to to
learn within map what t4 is if I open
the terminal and I open an map and I run
the help command and I go into timing
and performance you will find a tee or
option here or command that goes 0 to 5
that the range it goes to and this
basically set timing template is faster
this will basically increase the speed
of the scan but it really doesn't make a
difference if you're going to use your
custom you're going to use custom
commands that are filtering of the
results too much whatever you want to
find so this is really not a must to
have but it just increases the speed a
bit more and it gives it actually turned
your it uses more resources from your
computer not really internet but a bit
more processing power so we have n map a
we note a is this is an aggressive
option which is basically getting the OS
version OS the u.s. named US version
some script and performs the traceroute
and then we have V which is the boss and
just gives information about the scan
and the target and we have the domain so
all you have to do is hit scan all right
and it's going to start scanning and
it's going to give you an output all
right so it looks like it's actually
finished scanning I don't see any any
attorneys actually stopped what we're
going to do is on this one I'm just
going to perform a quick scan hopefully
that's going to use the S command let's
actually run that and
one moment let me open terminal and let
me actually just check found in here
oops
Oh actually I'm running it on num lock
excuse me
alright so for some reason it's going to
give no IP addresses open so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to use my
subnet mask over 160 with 168 point 1
point 0 to 255 I'm just going to perform
a quick one and down and let's see what
we get right all right it's going to
start the end website we actually know
it's working right now I'm pretty sure
the nmap team have blocked me from using
their services because the IP is
basically shown as offline because I
over the car the last couple of days
I've scanned that scan me dot n map org
a lot of times and most probably there's
actually just blocked me so I would
really worry about that in fact I just I
think I went a bit overboard so it
finished the scan and it's going to give
you 256 IP addresses 3 host stop scanned
in 6.17 seconds so these are the IPS are
currently active on my network these are
local IPS so when you are in the comment
section who like saying that this is my
IP address please go through networking
again because this is a local IP address
this these are the addresses that are
given to devices on my home network
these are not IP addresses belonging to
the device just wanted to clarify that
because a lot of people hit me up in the
comments saying that I released my IP
when I'm not you know so that this is
actually just a local IP and it given me
the services that are running as a FTP
HTTP in the most popular but real SSH
also running on I think my Windows
machine on my network right now so yeah
that's pretty cool I'm going to show you
some ports here this is just going to
give you the ports for their ports open
you have the Cisco that's probably my
root herb because my root is cisco
I'm not going to go into topology
because that will actually have my IP
detail so I'm going to just skip that
just for my protection and I'm going to
keep the other two because does that
also have some of my real IP address
information but you get the idea this is
basically just an map in a much more
beautiful and convenient way so you can
actually just you know you can you can
really just check out the command
whatever the command is given the hosts
can it just arranges it in a much more
convenient manner you know so if you
really like to have things in a
graphical user interface representation
go ahead and try it it's the commander
the same as nmap and it's just the same
thing just in a command-line interface I
mean in a user graphical user interface
otherwise guys thank you for watching
this video if it helps you leave a like
if you didn't like the video leave a
dislike and let me know in the comment
section in addition if you have any
questions anything really want to ask me
hit me up on my social networks you can
hit me up on my kik and you can hit me
up in the comment section as well
although guys thank you for watching and
have a fantastic day peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
