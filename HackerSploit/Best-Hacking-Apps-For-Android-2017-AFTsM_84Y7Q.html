we're going to be taking a look at the
best hacking apps for Android the first
application we're going to take a look
at his term X and mortar max basically
is a terminal emulator for Android and
you might be asking yourself why do I
need a terminal emulator flacking well
it just makes it a whole lot easier to
configure and install packages on your
Android device just like how you do it
on your Linux computer or operating
system so it's really very simple and it
allows me to install anything so I'm
going to try and install nmap for
example and by the way this it is the
full version of nmap and you can
actually install it and use it on your
Android device with term X so I'm going
to run that and I already have it
installed so I'm just going to try and
launch it and map and I'm going to use
the scan me dot and map dot org domain
for a test and let's see whether we
actually get a result so as you can see
it's actually started the latest version
of nmap 7.4 dot o and it's actually
scanning the nmap dot org domain that n
map gives us for educational purposes so
let's see if it actually returns a
result and as you can see it returned
the open ports so definitely must-have
for any penetration testers or hackers a
really really good application that will
hopefully help you a lot the next
application we have is Santee now Zante
is a penetration testing tool kit that
is really really well developed with a
very polished user interface it features
a lot of penetration testing tools that
we usually find in the penetration
testing distros like kali linux para
torres or black our clinics so the
reason why this is one of the most
popular penetration testing toolkits for
android is as i mentioned again the vast
majority of tools that it does have so
as you can see it has a max changer for
anonymity it has the Zetas for creating
a to go out for creating a hacking
Wi-Fi hotspot' you then can crack the
router username and admin using the
router poll you then have the Wi-Fi
monitor and you can connect to HTTP
server so apart from that once you scan
your Wi-Fi network you can basically
target devices on your network and
perform an nmap scan and find open ports
as you can see here you can perform a
scan that has very different options but
I'm really not going to go into that
into detail in this video however you
can perform an nmap and map scan and you
can connect to a remote port and select
the port that you want to connect to and
it's going to give you options for
username password or you can decide to
crack it whatever works best for you you
then have these password complexity
audits which basically allow you to
crack passwords on different ports and
services open you then have the
man-in-the-middle attacks where you can
actually view the logged requests of the
target and what websites they're
visiting what images they're they're
visited all that websites that they
visited have you then can perform you
can redirect HTTP replace images you can
capture downloads and intercept
downloads as well as intercept your own
HTML into webpages that they're
currently browsing overall a lot of
features and it's free so a really
really good application the next
application is Orbitz and what Orbot is
is basically a VPN application that
allows you to use a free VPN either in
your apps or specifically for what it's
created for which is deep web browsing
it actually allows you to cannot connect
to the onion the onion proxies and
access the Deep Web it has a few options
as you can see here you can actually use
VPN mode with other apps for example
Facebook and actually change your
location or just stay anonymous that's
really really a good feature there you
then have bridges which allows you to
connect to bridges and these are the
actually be tunnels that Onion provides
so you can actually tunnel through or
b.o.b fs4 that is the standard onion
I'm not going to do that right now but
you get the idea you can then change
your location to anywhere in the world
any supported area in the world for
example Romania and all you have to do
is hit start so after you hit start
it'll actually stop the application and
it's going to take a few seconds and
it's going to give you the prompt
connected to the Tor network after this
you can actually browse the Tor network
and install orfox which is basically the
browser that's for connecting to the Tor
network through Android otherwise that's
all for this application a very very
good application for anonymity and for
browsing the Deep Web for the next
application we have net cut and what net
cut is is basically an application that
allows you to control devices connected
to your network a bit like Wi-Fi kill
just better so as you can see it's given
me the current device that's connected
to my network right now it's going to
give you the amount of users connected
and right now my network has 7 users
gives you the IP and the name of the
device and you the MAC address so really
really good stuff right there of course
I'm going to block out my MAC address so
you guys can't see it but it's going to
be there so basically what you do to to
basically a block of devices just tap on
it and it's going to enter the that
device into the jail section which means
that this device will be blocked from
using the internet connection so that's
really really handy and you then have
your your your gateway or report and
this will give you basically a very cool
graph on the actual a pie chart on how
how many of the devices they are on your
network and the percentage of the brands
so Samsung Dell tp-link micro star those
are the current devices in my network
right now the next section you do have
is the option and this is basically just
to fake MAC addresses to Skloot to slow
the scans and to cut the gateway and the
user way so really just a few options
here you then have these speed tests
here which will basically test the speed
of your internet and stuff like that
we done have the Pro Mode which I do not
have right now but you guys can check
that out and what that will give you is
basically access to all the devices
connected your your network and actually
will give you the specific MAC addresses
to the device so if you want to unblock
a device that you've blocked just tap on
it and it'll be unblocked from the jail
so that's that's basically for this
application a really really helpful
application when you have annoying
people on your Wi-Fi network the last
and final application is one of my
personal favorites it's called the geek
app and for its really basic name it
really does a lot more than that so this
is actually a what I would like to call
a manual or a handbook for hackers and
it provides a lot of information for
hackers and really not hackers just
people interested in technology and so
when you open the application up you're
going to get some news some latest
hacking news and as you can see we have
the latest news here from the CIA g v47
release and hacking iphones and mac
books so really really a lot of stuff
here then have your latest geek stuff
which is basically just some tech news
so really good news over there if I
slide on to the left here we have the
geek stuff which is basically as I'll
show you some tutorials for hackers so
let me open begin and stuff and let's
see what they got there so just going to
give you some terminology about hacking
you have the hackers dictionary of the
configurations and tools so really
really a lot of information here as you
can see it gives you a lot of
information that you can access at any
time you then have your progress you
have rewards for whatever for if you go
through all the tutorials so let's go
back to the tools and programs and it's
going to give you the and for example
introduction to key loggers a lot of
information here for people who are
learning about hacking and really
generally all hackers or penetration
testers just has a lot of information so
you have life hacks you have games some
good games as you can see pokemon go
hacks and stuff like that so pretty good
stuff here
overall a really really well-developed
obligation and an application that has a
lot of useful information I highly
recommend this application alright guys
