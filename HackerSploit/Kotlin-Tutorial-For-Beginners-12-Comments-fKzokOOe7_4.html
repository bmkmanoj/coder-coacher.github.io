video what I'm going to be explaining is
comments and commentation and why it is
important in programming so this does
not only apply to the Cortland
programming language for those of you
who are beginners to programming the use
of comments or commentation is very very
important what they're used for is
basically giving a description of what
the code is doing is doing so it's very
very simple to add a comment in Scotland
all you have to do is add a forward
slash to fold slash basically make a
comment so let me explain how this would
basically pan out or work in real life
so let's say you're writing a program to
display someone's name so we would say
variable name and we're going to make
sure that it's a react you can just give
it a value and you can say John all
right now after a while this basically
if you're writing a lot of code you'll
basically understand what I mean we
create another variable for H all right
and the very end the value of H is
actually 20 all right so basically John
is 20 and this this we can basically say
this information so you can give this
section is to be updated every year all
right let's say we're this was
information about someone and we knew
that the the value of H was going to be
updated every year so the system should
update it and if we didn't comment this
we would not know that this is the exact
value so that's what I basically mean so
if we are get again to say let's say
variable d Hoagy which is date of birth
is equals to and we can basically say
12/12/12 for example that's just stupid
your guests they I'm just trying to keep
it simple we can also say this is to be
this is to be updated in Co or
correlation whoops whoops whoops whoops
whoops
oh excuse my my poor little spelling
right there so I'm I don't think you
really need that so you can just leave
that to correlation do I know that's
already wrong so we can just basically
sorry about that so this is to be
updated in relation to to age all right
so this is obviously updated when it is
updated so as you can see it really
helps in making the code understandable
for for you as a programmer and for
other programmers who you may be sharing
your code with so that's basically how
to comment your code and I would
recommend very very highly that you use
comments because it will make your code
understandable and will make your code
very good code will be considered to be
very very good code so thank you so much
for watching this video if you have any
questions just let me know in the
connect section of the course thank you
so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
