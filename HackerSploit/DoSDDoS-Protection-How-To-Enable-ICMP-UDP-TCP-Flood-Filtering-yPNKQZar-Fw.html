another video and in this video I'm
gonna be showing you some of these
security features that your router has
in regards to dose protection or DDoS
protection alright so as you remember in
my Xerxes videos and my other DDoS
videos I talked about the fact that you
can now you can actually block the ICMP
pings etc etc and most of you thought
that I was lying or there isn't
something like that so this is a video
in response to that and for those of you
who are asking me how to do it this
video is also for you so as you can see
i'm i've actually logged into my router
here the router control panel and it's
not there's not gonna be anything
serious here because again it is a
subnet based system so in terms of IP
addresses i don't want people coming and
telling me that you know I saw your IP
address and I'm going to DDoS you you
know that just doesn't work anymore so
if I just go to the security and I go to
advanced security you can see that I
have something called DOS protection now
for those of you who are actually
calling me out and telling me there
isn't something like this what do you
have to say about this all right so if
you just read on the right here where
you have your help or your documentation
you can see that it allows you to enable
or disable the DOS protection function
when it's enabled it the flood filters
will be enabled so again you have your
ICMP flood attack filtering so what this
means is once you enable this performing
a dig dose or DDoS that DDoS attack will
not take down your internet connection
in the sense that it will block the ICMP
floods and when you're talking about for
example stuff like the TCP synchronize a
headers for for the packets you cannot
Nabal that so depending on the type of
dose or DDoS attack you're trying to
perform you know if you have a good
access point or a modern router I would
say it should have this now I'm not sure
if your router doesn't have this
security protocol or security feature
you might you might be looking at you
know selecting a new one if this is what
you're really up
- what you intend to do so by default
you can enable the the DOS protection
and then you can find the enable the
type of packets you'll be sending so you
have your user Datagram protocol UDP
icmp TCP the synchronize flood attacks
which is very very powerful as well you
can increase the threshold depending on
what you have set so that you know
there's no packet loss and then you can
also forbid the pin packets from the
wine port and the LAN port so again you
can forbid it from affecting other
computers on your network all right but
I'm not I don't perform those attacks or
DDoS attacks for that matter so again I
don't need to enable it but this is the
way to do it and for those of you are
calling me out I hope you can see that
it is real if you are telling me that
zexis doesn't work it does work you just
need to know what you're doing with your
router and you need to understand the
flow of packets so again this is a short
video and I just wanted to clear things
up I don't worry you know uploads will
be regular now and the web penetration
testing video should come straight after
this anyway as I said that's a small
little video just to help you guys who
are a bit confused and yeah if you found
value in this video please leave a like
down below if you have any comments
suggest into questions let me know in
the comments section on my social
networks or you can hit me up on my
website and I'll be seeing you in the
next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
