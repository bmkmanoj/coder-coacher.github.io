with another video today we'll be
looking at something a little bit
different and I know a lot of you guys
have heard of it well if you're in the
cybersecurity world you should have
heard of it but if you haven't don't
worry and it is all in regards to
YouTube being hacked now when I say this
of course I'm not really talking about
the fact that YouTube was hacked well
essentially a music video was hacked and
the targeted a channel was vivo or VEVO
depending and on to pronounce it and
essentially what it what has happened is
that the video I think it's called
Esposito which apparently had the
highest view count on YouTube the on
YouTube um
well essentially was hacked in some way
this is what they're claiming now of
course the reality of what happened is
the recovery image was replaced with I'm
not sure if you actually saw the video a
lot of people because that video gets
almost I'm pretty sure it got about 5
million it gets about 5 million views a
day you know that's that's incredible
so essentially what had happened is that
the the videos cover image or the
thumbnail was replaced you know by a
photo of people essentially wearing
masks and pointing and so something
really really weird and it's very very
common with hacktivists all right so now
we know what's happened essentially let
me just explain what happened
furthermore and how it happened in the
black I'll explain what was done so
essentially what had happened is that
the videos thumbnail was replaced and
then the video was taken down
temporarily well this is what was is
being reported by VEVO and YouTube now
of course we can't know the truth and
the hacking group which I'll essentially
give you the name in a few seconds have
not actually told us what they did to
the video whether they plan to delete it
but I'm pretty sure VEVO has a
protection feature you know for that
where it cannot of course they have
backups obviously it would be really
shocking if they didn't have backups but
that's that's not part of the issue
so essentially other
music videos from different artists were
hosted by vivo were affected so for
example a Drake Selena Gomez etc etc I'm
not really focused on the people
attacked I'm I'm really focused on how
they were able to do this
alright so the hacker group or what what
they're calling themselves are Pro socks
and Karoshi kourosh I'm not sure exactly
how to pronounce that but what they're
done is that they replaced the video
titles with you know messages like free
Palestine and you know their own
nicknames now I'm not going to pick a
side or or join any of these any of
these these movements even theoretically
or you know in in terms of an argument
I'm completely neutral here I am focused
on the hack alright so essentially
people started noticing you know some
weird activity on the vevo channels
where you know video thumbnails were
being changed and essentially yeah
people got worried and they were able to
report it firstly on Twitter and that's
how we was actually alerted all right so
what VEVO said is that they were working
to to reinstate although their videos
that were affected on their catalogue
and to you know to restore them to their
full working order and as of when I
checked the the videos affected are
currently back to normal of all the Adam
their thumbnails this time are very very
different
so again yeah it looks like this is this
is really big you know in the larger
context of things and I'll explain why
firstly is they targeted the biggest
host music hosting company which is VEVO
almost all artists you know sign up for
VEVO and essentially what it is if you
don't know it's a company that that it
essentially works like a network where
different artists come together and the
money is distributed dependent on views
and yen traffic I'm sure you get the
idea so it's all it's all about you know
music or artists coming together for a
common cause but in this case as you can
see targeting a hosting company like
VEVO can really cause damage to a lot of
people
and this is what I'm talking about where
you see it with large organizations that
host the data of a lot of people again
something that was previously a problem
or it's still currently problem and was
being discussed tonight I don't have you
guys were watching the discussion was
the Cambridge analytic data breach now
from what Mark Zuckerberg said and that
has nothing to do with hacking but it is
the it is the it is essentially the sale
or the monitor the monetization of human
data okay now I'm really feeling
something huge is coming up in the next
five years you know regarding
cybersecurity and and big data and you
know just human just data regarding
humans and I think that we really have
to start taking care of our data and
information now again I'm not going to
go into all of that that's something
that I'll probably have in another you
know discussion video I just wanted to
make this video to discuss the hack
obviously and and also know want to know
what you guys think about it so again
let me know what you think in the
comments about this attack and you know
furthermore what I was really focused on
was what cybersecurity experts had to
say about this all right so as you can
see one of the things that was very very
curious or important to this is that the
Twitter account that will apparently
belonged to one of the hackers what they
post is a what they posted is it's just
for fun I just use the script YouTube
changed title video and write and I
write hacked alright and then finally he
concluded by saying don't judge me I
love YouTube and well that is something
really really cryptic there because
again is claiming that and the script
was used that would change the YouTube
title of the YouTube video title and
furthermore he wrote hacked and you you
get the idea now again to do something
like that requires something
extraordinary with in terms of
authorization and that's what I was
thinking about and just as I said that
one of the reports were from a very very
well known as cyber security expert from
Surrey University said that you know
that the hacker was this was not a very
easy attack given the fact that you know
these hosting services networks have
some serious security behind their
websites and their channel now of course
when you talk about the channel you're
talking about YouTube so it had to be a
problem with YouTube because as you see
they were able to target the channel
titles and again that means that they
had some sort of authorization and
that's what I was thinking about if you
have a YouTube channel and you go to one
of your videos and you click on the
title it gives you the ability to change
it that's if you're signed in to that
account so again there's an
authorization token I'm not sure you've
heard of it or it's usually it's very
popular in games
if you've ever photos of you here will
play cracked games I don't judge you and
for those of you who buy games on Steam
as I do and you know I've also played
crack games I'm not gonna you know I'm
not gonna hide that the fact there I
play games on Steam and for example the
newer games usually when you log in and
you want to play online games you
usually have an authorization token
alright and that's exactly what he said
is to upload and alter the video content
with code you should you require an
authorization token so again it's
something regarding authorization and
this looks to be a very very big
security bug with YouTube and I'm gonna
research it more and I'll let you guys
I'll let you guys know what I find
because I've noticed recently as YouTube
has been switching from them old
interface to their new interface some
weird things have been going on like for
example YouTube channels haven't been
loading up some people haven't been able
to access their channels for a while so
it's really really it's really really
weird to see what's happening with
YouTube I would expect them to be at the
you know at the bottom of this by now
but it seems like it's a very very big
issue and finding out how these guys
were actually able to inject a custom
script or how to get an authorization
token again it's very very related to
web application hacking and it's
something that also be testing so I'll
let you guys know what I fire
and let me know what you guys are find
again I'm not recommending that you go
and start testing YouTube that's not the
correct way of doing it because again
you're going in you don't you know
whether you're you going in black box
you get the idea it's first of all it's
not legal you've not been hired by
YouTube to do it and it's just not right
anyway but if you you know yeah I don't
I don't believe they have a bug bounty
program but if they do and I'm pretty
sure they will in the coming days or
weeks because it's getting really really
important you know web application
security and protecting the data of
human beings of people you know that's
something that it's it's kind of sad as
when I'm coming back to the Facebook
thing because if you understand the
magnitude of the the data bridge it's
it's unbelievable man how much data they
were you know that was able to be used
to manipulate voting and to be used as
propaganda it's just unbelievable
so again I'm not gonna I'm not gonna go
down that rabbit hole regarding you know
data that's something that I will
discuss later if you guys want me to
make a video on that you know something
that I really go in in-depth into what
what happened with Facebook and
Cambridge analytical to be clear nothing
happened to Facebook but it was all the
the sale of the data from one of the
mobile app developers but again Facebook
let this data slip out of their hands
you know into the hands of an app
developer and that isn't right in terms
of protocols and and ethics but that
being said you know coming back to the
YouTube story so it had to be a in means
of you know an authorization token or a
token of some sorts all right so they're
still looking into it and it's likely
that they were able to achieve some sort
of authorization or they they are not
telling us what happened really so again
we will just have to wait and see and
all update you guys and one more thing
if you're watching the video till now I
just want to say thank you guys so much
for the support we're finally at 60,000
subscribers we're in April now and
target for this year was a hundred
thousand and I'm 100% sure we're going
to hit that target and I'm gonna push
even further and I'm just gonna be
uploading videos now again I just want
to say thank you guys so much for the
support I appreciate it and yeah thank
you so much for watching this video guys
this is just a simple video of me
explaining what happened and you know if
you want to see more more of these video
types of me explaining the different
hacks or you know me explaining concepts
just let me know in the comment section
anyway guys thanks so much for watching
and I'll be seeing you in the next video
