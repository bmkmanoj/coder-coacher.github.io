with another video and in this video I
am going to be showing you guys how to
browse the Deep Web safely and
anonymously so without further ado let's
get to this welcome to the Deep Web
starter guide firstly let's talk about
the operating system to use personally I
would stay away from windows as a client
of the Deep Web because windows is a
very vulnerable operating system when it
comes to viruses and backdoors so with
Windows out of the question there are
two other alternatives and one of them
being the simplest is running a virtual
machine now a virtual machine offers
isolation when it comes to accessibility
as it is being run virtually so you can
use any operating system in the virtual
machine however if you're going to use
Windows on the virtual machine make sure
you have an anti-virus installed it can
be any antivirus as long as it's good
and it can be free as long as doing its
job but again I highly recommend that
you do not use Windows for browsing the
Deep Web now
the virtual machine the couple of
examples of some that you might want to
use our VMware or VirtualBox VM where
being the most secure obviously a
virtual machine isn't all that secure
because basically it's running on your
operating system and you're actually
using the same network connection so if
if you come across a virus that is smart
enough to break through the virtual
machines bridges and enter your prating
system it could be lethal
so again if when using a virtual machine
make sure you have anti-virus installed
and again stay away from windows alright
so now let's take a look at the safest
operating systems to use either on a
virtual machine or by installing them on
a USB flash drive and running them live
personally I would run them on
virtual machine because it's so much
easier and you have a lot of control
over these to the basic installation and
usage so our out love to use any Linux
distro and browsing the beep web but
there are a couple that have been
developed especially for deep web
browsing and anonymity the first one
being cubes or so cubes OS as the
website says is a reasonably secure
operating system so it's a Linux distro
that is offering a great security
obviously now as you can see and a lot
of recommendations by experts now expert
so I know for a fact that one of them is
going to be Edward Snowden as you can
whistleblow and privacy advocate if
you're serious about security cubes os
is the best OS available today
it's what I use and it's free so that's
basically all you need when talking
about anonymity and security if Edward
Snowden is supporting this project I
don't see a reason why so basically it's
a free download the only problem I had
with this is that it's quite large it's
about four gigabytes that's bigger than
Kali Linux I mean come on guys make it a
bit smaller which is not really a
problem but yeah you can just use this
on your virtual machine and or maybe
install it on a USB and you'll be good
if you want a review on this OS let me
know in the comments section and I'll be
sure to make one the next operating
system I recommend is tails OS now tails
voice is similar to cubes us except this
is really focused on a more of a
temporary operating system meaning if
you can't use this as a daily driver
it's just focused more on you achieving
what you're downloading it for which is
browsing the Deep Web or basically for
privacy and protection of your identity
now the thing I like about this
operating system is that it's a fully
live operating system now what this
means in relation to this operating
system is that you basically install it
on a virtual machine or a USB flash
drive and once you use it and you're
done when you shut down the Opera
system it basically wipes the entire
drive that it is installed on or for
example if you install it on a flash
drive it'll wipe the entire flash drive
so that there's literally no trace of
what you are doing now that sounds a bit
shady but really this is really awesome
for guys who just want security and it's
just amazing and as you can see here it
leaves no trace and it uses the
state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to
encrypt your files emails and instant
messaging so this is basically the whole
nine yards and it's a awesome for
anonymity so out of the two tails and
cubes OS I recommend either one
depending on what you guys need now the
final one I would like to recommend I
think most of you guys know if you watch
my channel is Kali Linux now why would I
say Kali Linux um firstly because it
it's so much easier to install Kali
Linux and then using any of these other
operating systems that are that
basically focus on one thing Kali Linux
can be used as a daily driver it can do
it can act as a desktop operating system
and it's just it's just awesome for
basically cryptography and state of the
art and network administration so I
would recommend Kali Linux as well if
you're really looking for something a
bit more permanent in terms of browsing
the Deep Web so that's basically it for
the operating systems and now I'm going
to talk about how to set up tour for
ultimate
privacy and protection so let's set up
tour
so basically tor is a browser that
allows you to connect to the Deep Web
through relays now what does tour stand
for tall stands for The Onion Router and
the reason it's called the Onion Router
is be given the nature of the the way
the Deep Web is structured it's
structured in layers hence the name
onion so you get the point
now tor is a free free browser that can
be downloaded from the website I will
link it down in the description it is a
free browser again all the links will be
in the description section to all the
resources mentioned in this video so all
you have to do is download it on your
appropriate
operating system I'll be demonstrating
this on Windows for the sake of it again
you can see you have a Windows Mac OSX
and Linux obviously if you're going to
be using Linux hit Linux a this a the
64-bit or 32-bit whichever architecture
you're running so once you've downloaded
it it's as simple as just installing it
just run it it's on Linux are you can
basically download the install folder
and you can just run it directly so
basically just let it install and once
it's done installing just hit just open
it up alright let's open it up alrighty
so once tour is done setting up its
going to open what appears to be a
browser now this is running based on one
of the Firefox browsers so this is a
Mozilla based browser but with tor
settings so one thing the first thing I
would recommend is never maximize the
browser as you see if you maximize the
screen it will tell you maximizing the
tor browser can allow websites to
determine your monitor size which can be
used to track you so pretty
self-explanatory
don't ever maximize your toe a browser
window so that's basically that uh so
once you're done here
once you're done once it's open you want
to go to your top left and you want to
forbid the scripts alright you want to
make sure that no scripts are running
like Java scripts alright so once you've
done that you want to go here and you
want hit new identity hit OK and it's
going to open the browser again so once
you have a new identity
you're basically good again the scripts
are disabled now the owner good for tor
network settings and this is where you
basically if your if your ISP block
store you can just check that and that's
one of the settings that only to show
you guys in case you have that problem
alright so you're basically good to go
as I said the first the most important
rule is for bid scripts rule number two
if you're running this off a laptop
please cover your webcam all right I'm
not trying to scare anyone but this is
the reality of be of the Deep Web is
that it's very easy for them to
hack into your webcam and use that to
spy on you so cover your webcam with
tape or whatever you feel like otherwise
I just disconnect your webcam if you're
running on a PC so once you have
disabled scripts you can now start
browsing the Deep Web obviously whatever
you do the on there is up to you this is
just a tutorial on on how to use the
Deep Web I'm not condoning any of the
legal activities on the Deep Web
yeah so that's basically how you browse
on tor you can access the hidden wiki I
think it exists still I'm not so sure it
should be able to access it the other
thing is that the tor browser is going
to be very slow because the connection
is run through a series of relays but if
you only need to make a video on how the
tor or the how the Deep Web works please
leave a comment down below and I'll be
sure to make it so that's basically it
guys for the deep web starter kit this
is all you need to get onto the Deep Web
safely and anonymously if you want more
information comment down below and I'll
be happy to make another video regarding
the topic if this video did help you
please leave a like I hope that you guys
enjoy this video and yeah that's
basically it guys have a fantastic day
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
