again with another video and in this
video we're going to be looking at tales
OS now a lot of you guys have been
requesting this and here it is so let's
get started um tales OS is basically as
I will show you right now is a secure
operating system so what we can do is we
can just Google such tales OS like so
and hopefully it's going to return a
result well my internet is looks like
it's not really working oh there we are
sorry about that umm it's really really
slow today looks like I'm gonna have to
sort that out I really don't know what
the issue is but really really sorry for
this alright so basically tales
previously for anyone anywhere done now
this is most popular for the fact that
it comes pre-installed with the tor
browser bundle and it also uses onion
circuits now what do I mean by this well
they're technically speaking the whole
operating system all connections made to
the internet go through the Tor relay so
for example if you add a like a weather
widget on it it is a Linux distro that
information would actually go through
the Tor the Tor network and basically
through the Tor circuit will go through
the first door node onto the second
random one the third random on and
finally to the exit node which will then
connect to the internet but enough of
that
so basically tails is a live operating
system as it says here that you can
start on almost any computer from a DVD
USB stick USB card now let me explain
what live operating system is well a
live operating system is means it does
not need an install so you don't need to
install anything you basically plug it
in as it says using a DVD USB stick or
SD card a DVD would be quite a foolish
thing to do for the simple fact that
tails will basically wipe wipe itself
once it once you're done browsing so for
example if I installed tail on tails on
a USB flash drive and I basically booted
it up and I was using tails once I'm
done I basically turn tails off and once
it turns off it basically wipes
everything of the flash drive
so that's why they call it a service
it's a very secure in privacy oriented
operating system so as it says over here
em they're preserving your privacy and
anonymity and helps you to AUC beams and
internal anonymously and circumvent
censorship all connections to the
Internet are forced to go through the
Tor network
it leaves no trace on the computer you
you are using unless you ask it to
explicitly so you can ask it not to wipe
not to wipe your system but that would
just basically defeat the purpose since
what this operating system this is what
it's about it gives the state-of-the-art
cryptographic tools to encrypt your
files emails and instant messaging so it
tells PGP and all of that good stuff so
it's really very simple you just have to
install tails right here to get started
and again sorry for my in my slow
internet today and it's going to say
thank you for interesting tales let's
start the journey basically you have to
download tails through torrent I believe
so just hit Windows that the operating
system we're going to be installing it
from if you're using any of the others
be sure to check them out we're going to
say install from Windows since we are
installing it fresh we're not updating
tales don't worry about what it says the
weather you need two USB sticks and two
hours that's all that's all a bunch of
nonsense I just hit let's go and we
should actually it should actually take
us to the download section all right so
it's going to say download it via
BitTorrent and it basically works on
32-bit and 64-bit so it's about one
gigabyte in size I actually downloaded
it and basically it's going to tell you
in terms of installing it you're going
to need the universal USB installer
which is basically when you want to
install it on a USB flash disk which
I'll show you right now in case that's
the route you want to go so just let
that open up and you can download that
file it's about 1.7 megabytes that's
going to take a while so basically you
can install it on your flash drive and
what I'm going to be showing you is my
personal favorite way of running this
operating system and that's through a
virtual machine so I'm going to be using
VMware Workstation 12 player
let me just open that while this
universal USB installer is still
downloading again really really sorry
about my slow Internet today I really
don't know what the problem is so
basically I already have one set up here
but I'm going to take you through the
setup from the beginning some say I'm
going to say create a new virtual
machine and I'm going to say install a
disk ISO so I'm going to browse for my
ISO file which is on my desktop it's
here tales i386 2.1 - that's the latest
version as of this recording and I'm
going to select the ISO file once I
select the ISO file it's going to give
you an error could not detect which
operating system is in this disc image
file don't worry about that just ignore
that we're gonna hit next and it's going
to say guest operating system of course
it's Linux and you can just select other
linux 2.6 kernel either 64-bit or 32-bit
depending on what architecture your
computer is running when hit next
basically where you want to save the
files I want I usually save mine in my
own folder the virtual OS folder and you
really don't need any files whoops one
second you can save it anywhere I'm just
gonna save mine in tales test let's just
call it tails test you can name your
folder whatever you want and you can
give it a name so I'm going to give my
tails OS test doesn't matter if it looks
really bad but that's what I want to
call it anyway I want you hit you want
to have selected your location for the
files and your name for the virtual
machine hit next it's going to ask you
what's the size of the disk that you
want to give it basically for storage to
act as a virtual hard drive I really not
going to use anything ever leave about
two gigabyte in case I'm downloading
files most probably from the Deep Web or
the darknet so basically this is all
dependent on you how much space you want
in case you will be downloading files I
want to store it as a virtual disk as a
single file I'm going to hit next I'm
going to say customer
hardly and now this is basically this
comes down to personal preference and
what your computer can handle I usually
find about two gigabytes enough for four
tens OS because it's basically focused
on browsing for processes I have four
cores so I'll just give it to two cause
to use and that's basically to just if
close and finish and finally we can get
started since it requires no
installation this should be really
really quick so let's plate and let's go
by the way if you're using VirtualBox it
should be pretty pretty much be this
simple the same thing so just let it
auto start tails it's going to auto
start it you really don't need to press
anything or if you're in a hurry press
the Enter key correctly it it should
actually just start really really
quickly
and just let's give it a few seconds by
the way guys um I forgot to mention this
the deep web browsing or the darknet
browsing episode is going to be coming
every weekend Friday or Saturday
depending on when you guys are
comfortable so leave that down in the
comment section what which date is more
comfortable for you I then want you to
leave to basically send me a tweet on
Twitter basically giving me ideas for
what type of websites you want me to
visit on the Deep Web but I'm not going
to get in too much into that right now
let's actually just focus on tails OS
right now so just give it a few seconds
if it gives you this weird little pause
or this frozen little of loading menu
don't worry about that it should just
get started immediately all right so I
know I mean once I see this blue screen
so it's going to say welcome to tails
tails is very very simple as you can see
it's going to ask you whether you want
more options I'm going to hit the yes
and I'm going to show you what options
are included so let's hit forward it's
going to ask you for an administrator
password this is basically your sudo
password or for a root I'm not going to
be using root on this disturbing
anything serious really it's going to
ask you for MAC address
this is a really really really cool
feature that they've included here where
they allow you to spoof your MAC
addresses to hide the serial number of
your network cards I already discussed
this user MV max changer video by the
way there it should the link to that
video should come on up it should be up
on your screen right now anytime so
basically it's going to spoof your MAC
addresses for your network card for your
network card and basically that will
just pick your geographical location so
I'm going to keep that on make sure it's
greyed out and network configuration
this is basically all to do with doe
it's going to ask you what their
computer's internet connection is clear
of obstacles if it is make sure you
check this if it's if you're going
through proxies for example if you're
running this on your school computer or
at your at your office for example just
hit this one right here but I'm using a
direct connection I'm good and I'm
guessing that's what you guys are using
too so I'm going to hit login
until selected all the options again you
could have chosen your own administrator
password but I really don't so just let
it start up you shouldn't take too much
time and we have to actually sort out
this resolution which I'll show you how
to do in a short amount of time we're
just waiting for this to load up all
right so there we are
so immediately once you start the
operating system it's going to be very
very simple and it's going to tell you
that it's synchronizing the clock no
let's start off with firstly changing
our resolution so what I'm going to go
is into system tools and we're going to
go into settings give that a few seconds
to start up shouldn't take that long
alright so we're going to go into
hardware and displays and we're going to
select your display - just called
unknown display and I'm going to select
a comfortable resolution for myself I
think this would be fine for me it's
going to obviously crop to the aspect
ratio I'm going to keep the changes and
let's get started on basically reviewing
a tales OS so starting off you'll notice
that is a very very simple Linux distro
and it's very user intuitive from the
from the simple fact that if you're
coming from Windows
or macaws this will feel right at home
because you have your application
launcher here but you basically access
your Start menu for those more
accustomed to Windows you then have your
places which is basically a file
explorer we can just open your computer
that's going to show you all the files
they can access you download your
documents music videos etc etc now I
think most of you will really really be
paying attention to the fact that this
comes it comes integrated with the core
browser
so let's actually get started with that
right now you're going to notice this
very little cute onion logo right here
and this basically our onion circuits
and these are the onion circuits that
basically integrated and I'm going to
show you that what what which ones are
currently active so as you can see right
now has this one right here which this
IP address is through the United States
basically this will give you information
about what what nodes are currently
running and the bandwidth that they are
operating at so basically we have this
one right now in Panama which is running
at a very very nice speed of 148
megabits per second but I'll get in I'll
get to this in a few seconds so if we
basically check the tor browser a bit
before we actually go into the table
browser you notice that you can perform
a variety of other tasks on this it's
like a fully fully functional distro you
can basically browse the Internet you
can perform a basically image
manipulation with gimp give these there
so that's pretty awesome you have the
office you have Libre Office or Libre
Office that's pretty cool you have your
programming packages just one ID poedit
which is basically a very very simple
text editor here's a song and video
audacity is included you have Pitre
which is a screen recording video editor
pretty cool stuff sound recorders and
you have your tales documentation right
here so basically let's go into
favorites and tor browser which is what
we've come here to do straight out of
the box I could just start up
immediately without any hitches or
granted that this this destroy is
basically designed to work fully with
tor
it's taking quite an awful lot of time
this should just be the first time you
start this again if you're if you're
running this on a virtual machine I
would recommend that because you really
if you're running this it would only
make sense to use a USB flash drive if
you were and you're basically running
this on a computer that's not yours
right so it's basically whoa all right
we just enlarge that there's basically
going to open the default tales oops
I've got a comment over there excuse me
oh sorry about that guys so basically
it's it's going to open the DES browser
but we want to check whether tor is
working so to do that we're going to
basically hit check but for project.org
and this is basically going to check
whether we're connected to the Tor
network and indeed I think we are
because this onion is basically showing
a clear logo if it doesn't show a clear
logo that means it's still synchronizing
and we will take a basic you have to
wait for that to synchronize all the
loads so just give that a bit of time
and it should start up depending on what
on what node you are using so just give
that time alright so basically I can see
some activity here in the detour onions
and the onions circuits so I don't know
why that's giving me that let's just hit
that again check the Tor project I don't
why it's basically referring me to the
w2 website that's weird alright so we
can basically just test this by running
an onion site so firstly let's forbid
scripts that's always good practice here
now let's check for the hidden wiki and
by default tor is basically going to use
DuckDuckGo a search engine so let's just
let you search for the hidden wiki so
there we are choosing none javascript
site that's always a good precaution to
have I know this video is taking longer
than usual but let's just make sure that
it everything is working
basically this is what this operating
system is targeted at as you can see not
it doesn't come with a lot of tools
pre-installed but it comes with enough
to get you by whatever you're trying to
do again really really sorry for my
internet connection here I don't know
why it's taking so long this is really
really a gun izing for me right now so
basically let's open the hidden wiki
let's find the hidden wiki org hopefully
it gives us alright so we have an onion
site here right here as you can see dot
onion site hopefully loads up and
basically proves that we are connected
to the Tor network yeah there we are so
this is an onion site and there you are
basically this is what tabe is all about
it's a very very simple operating system
that will basically give you tours
straight out of the box this has been a
very basic overview of the operating
system but that's basically what it can
do I'm not really taking anything away
from it and yeah that's basically it for
this video guys if you like this video
if you enjoyed this video please give a
like if you have any comments or
suggestions or any questions let me know
in the social on my social networks or
in the comment section below or you can
