with another video and in this video
we're going to get started with Python
for ethical hacking so in this series
I'm gonna be taking you from a beginner
to an intermediate or an advanced with
Python and we're going to be creating
ethical hacking tools and network tools
with what we've learnt so I hope you
guys are excited now before we actually
begin this series I just want to point
out a few changes that have I'm going to
be making to the content of the channel
now the changes do not have are not
going to affect the actual content but
short content but rather the structure
and the uploading of of the content so a
lot of you guys have given me some
fantastic video suggestions and again
series suggestions and one of them was
Python for ethical hacking and here it
is now as as long as there are a lot of
videos videos and series that you guys
want me to create I can only focus on
one at a time so what I'm gonna be doing
is I'm going to be completing one
completely and then I can move on to the
next one because the the channel really
loses its structure when I upload one
video from one series and the other one
from the other so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna complete this one and then
gonna complete the Linux one and then we
can move on to many in the middle
attacks and our spoofing and stuff like
that so let's get started here
so as I said this is Python for ethical
hacking and the operating system of
choice is going to be Kali Linux and
that's for you know that pretty much is
self-explanatory the reason we're using
Kali Linux is because it is a pentesting
distro and we are going to be creating
network tools and ethical hacking tools
or scripts for that matter in addition
you can use this on parrot OS so any
other pentesting distro that you want
that already has Python pre-installed or
you can install it on your own it's
pretty simple so let's get started
the first thing I'm gonna want to do is
obviously check what version of Python
I'm running oh my god wrong spelling let
me run that again alright so as you can
see we are running Python 2.7 point 1 3
I am pretty sure you guys will be run
a similar version I'm also sure you'd be
running version two and that's because
Kali Linux does not come with version 3
don't worry about that we're going to be
using version 2 for this series so
there's really nothing to worry about
that I'll also be showing you how to
convert your code from version to
version 3 and vice and you know back and
forth really so you really don't have to
worry about that so you can test out
your Python installation to make sure
it's working so we can try something
like 20 plus 30 and maybe something like
name we can try and create a variable
here with the value of Alexis and oops
and if I just point out name there we
are so we know that python is working
and if let me just close this up now and
we can get started with the purpose of
this video so first things first we have
made sure that python is running we know
that python is on version 2 so we're
pretty much good to go now now one more
thing that we're going to be using for
the purpose of this series is we're
going to be using pre-built Python
modules or packages okay now the reason
we're going to be using these is because
as I said a lot of these you YouTube
videos or tutorials you'll find out
there on Python are really really poor
quality in the sense that they just
teach you the basics of Python and they
teach you the syntax so for example as
you can see here is created a fruits
array and the values are there as you
can see they basically teach you that
they don't teach you how to apply this
into a more realistic scenario for
example that's what we're going to be
doing here we're actually going to be
what we're going to be using what we've
learnt to create Python scripts and
tools that you will be using personally
on kali linux so you know that on its
own is pretty cool now as I said we're
going to be using the pre-built Python
modules or packages and you can find
them at p IP ypi alright oops that's the
wrong spelling altogether let me just do
that again
so py p i
and the website is going to be PYP i dot
Python org all right so this is the
official website and what it stands for
is this is the Python package index all
right so the Python package index is a
repository of software for the Python
programming language all right so you
there are currently a hundred and
seventeen thousand two hundred seventy
four packages here and you can use these
packages forever you want they actually
perform something and I said we're going
to be using them to learn so it's gonna
be awesome this is fantastic for
learning so you can look you can look at
the packages already available here and
there are plenty of them so do not be
shy to test any of them of course it
would be pretty cool if you try
something that worked but we're going to
be looking at in future videos so for
now I just under just just know that the
py P I is the Python package index and
we're going to be using these modules
and packages for learning in addition if
you want to get one of these packages
you can just click on them and download
the tar file but well we're going to be
using the pip install package to the
terminal so as you can see it's gonna
say to use a package from this index
either use pip install package or get
pip but in this case we're going to be
using pip install and the package name
all right so let's clear that and I'm
going to enter root let's let me enter
root sorry about that
all right and now I just go to my
desktop and pip install and we can give
the package name one of the packages
that you can find is the google package
and if I just hit Google it's going to
take a few seconds to load and it's
going to say collecting google and it's
going to say downloading Google and it's
gonna tell you that is installed the
Google Python but we're going to be
looking at how to utilize these packages
and modules in the next video so what
we've looked at here now is how how
we're gonna go through this so we
already have Python installed an
operating system we're going to be using
the Python modules
the next thing we're going to be setting
up is our integrated development
environment which in this case is gonna
be by jump which I'm sure most of you
who are already familiar with Python
already know so yeah that's basically it
for this video guys in the next video
we'll get started installing Python
PyCharm excuse me and we can get started
with some basic Python commands and yeah
I hope you guys found value in this
video if you did please leave a like
down below if you have any questions or
suggestions let me know in the comments
section down below or you can hit me up
on my social networks or on my clique in
addition you can check out my website it
is ployed h esprit calm for let the
latest news and hacking resources so you
can find news hacking resources ebooks
there's a whole lot of stuff on there so
go ahead and check it out and in
addition I've created a discord server
for discussion where you can leave me
your video suggestions and you can have
just have a good discussion of what's
going on and what we can work on in the
future otherwise guys thank you so much
for watching and we'll be seeing you in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
