this video we're going to get started
installing IntelliJ which is basically
an ide that we are going to be using for
Kotlin now you can use IntelliJ 4 and
many other programming languages but
it's very very well suited for korklan
programming so an IDE basically means an
integrated development environment and
it just makes working with Kotlin a lot
easier it allows the installation of
plugins and so much more and will just
make your learning experience and your
usability of Cortlandt a whole lot
better so it's very very simple to
download it's free so just fire up your
egg your favorite browser like usual and
we can get started immediately so just a
google search for in 10 li j which is
basically intelligence but with you
without the intelligence and basically
IntelliJ very nice name they're used for
it and it's going to be the first one
right here so IntelliJ the java ee d for
professional developers as i said it
works with a lot of other programming
languages and it's well very well suited
for Kotlin in fact it is the recommended
ide for Colin so just click on the first
lick and hit download it's a very very
beautiful website as you can see and
yeah just click download and basically
you have your you have two versions of
IntelliJ you have your the Ultimate
Edition and the Community Edition which
basically have a few differences as you
can see the license is commercial and
with the community license here is open
source Apache 2.0 the supported
languages are for the community and the
ultimate version are both Cortland Java
groovy Scala he also have Android
support you have you have Marvin Gradle
SBT you have get and you have basically
perforce which the rest of these which
are more specific specialized so
basically specialized programming
languages for example you have
JavaScript you have SQL which really you
don't really need well all we need
basically right here is Java and
Cortland which I would recommend
IntelliJ IDE for basically it performs
really well with Java and of course
so you can basically buy the ultimate
version if you want but it's going to
work perfectly with the community
version which is what I have so just go
down right here and download if you're
running Windows it's going to
automatically detect the system you're
running on and give you the exe file
extension version right here but if
you're using you don't want to download
a set up you can download the zip file
which is basically a portable version
you can just run it without installing
you then have your macros dot dmg file
you have your Linux dot R the GZ file
and Linux right here so all you have to
do is just hit download it's quite a big
file and it will basically take you
through the installation process so I
want to hit download it should
automatically say IDE is ready to
download and 343 megabytes which I do
not need to download since I already
have it installed the installation
process is very very simple all you have
to do is just run through the setup it's
a simple setup wizard and it's going to
just finish installing and you're good
to go
so once it's finished installing it's
going to give you this right here the
IntelliJ shortcut you can basically run
it from there I already have mine pinned
to my taskbar I can just open it up and
it should open up quite fast rather
there we are so it's going to say
IntelliJ IDEA community 20 17.1 so let
this start up shouldn't take that long
and voila
she'll open up nice and fresh looking
now yours might be slightly different
yours might not be have the dark theme
and what we can do is I can just show
you the basics right now so you wanna
create a new project all you have to do
is hit create new project you want to
import one pretty self-explanatory just
import or you can open files of your
choice now you can basic configuration a
looks and how the Java JDK interacts so
we're going to get started with that so
go into configure and settings just
click on settings and it should open up
quite quite fast and it should this
should be minimized like so and you'll
if you want to change the appearance
just open the appearance menu right here
and go into the appearance section I'm
currently using the Dracula theme you
can use beam delegating which is a white
theme you can then switch back to
Windows which is a classic theme and
I'll switch back to Dracula which is a
dark theme and that just easier on my
eyes so in here you can basically change
your font size which I will increase
adjust for the readability of my code
when running through this set of
lectures so you can also adjust that to
whatever you feel is comfortable now
you only have to do is just hit apply
once you are done making the necessary
changes now you are not going to editor
all right now in editor you are not
going to general open up general and it
when it comes to code completion if
you're looking for code completion you
can basically look it up here for those
of you who are already familiar with how
code completion work if you're not
familiar don't worry I'll get into that
later so you don't need to really really
look into that
now go into your system settings under
appearance and behavior let me just
close editor and you are go to pass
variables now in your path variable
section right here this is basically
just to check whether your pocket line
and your mouth and repositories are
there but basically we are just checking
for Courtland and if you have been
already installed IntelliJ it comes pre
bundle with Kotlin so you're pretty much
good there but just make sure you check
this to obviously make sure that it's
working all right now once you're done
with that you can basically you can go
in - hold on let me just check this I
think that's basically it in terms of
what you need to check when coming down
to your compiler you might want to take
a look at your java compiler if you if
you probably followed the previous
tutorial and you made sure that java is
already running you should be good so
just hit OK and you should be good to
get started if you want to check out
other settings you can look at the
settings repository and that will
probably open up a browser or it will
open up a hyper
texts a markup page but we really don't
need to do that right now so let's get
started and we can basically do that in
the next video so thank you so much for
watching this video you have any
questions leave them in the Q&amp;amp;A section
of the course otherwise I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
