another video and in this video I'm
going to be showing you how to ddos with
your Android device and this is going to
be the updated video and this is going
to be talking about the problems you
guys experienced in the previous version
of my tutorial where I was also showing
you how to ddos on android but with
another application called an boss ID
with and I realized that that
application is not compatible with all
Android devices and Android versions so
here it is have another new tutorial
with an application that I know most of
you if you if you are all network
backers and stuff like that are familiar
with them like I'm going to show you how
to use Lloyd which is low-orbit ion
cannon now this application is available
on Google Play Store but the applicant
now version on the Google Play Store
does not really work so I downloaded the
one that really works and I have it here
don't worry I will put the link down in
the description for download
so once you have it downloaded and
installed and just open it Alice you can
see you will have a great a great armor
of of tools here you can lock onto URL
which is a website and an IP and now so
let me just test let me end my routers
IP point 168 point zero point one and
lock-on now once it's locked on you can
into your timeout and the port and you
can also enter a message now this is I
think one of the coolest coolest
features of these applications that you
can send a message so for example you
got you got hacked bro and then yeah and
then just make sure this is on TCP when
you're using an IP address when using a
website and make sure it's hit gtp or a
UDP depending on the website security
and then threads is the number of times
you want to send the attack from one out
of 50 times you can enter as many times
as you want and you have this slider so
you can you can increase the speed in
which you send the attacks I'm just
going to keep it about there then the
red fire as you can see you're getting
all of these hits and sending packets
per second about 40 average and you're
getting so much so this is absolutely
amazing this application is basically
gonna do the job for you
now for sure this is going to work so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and if
you did please leave a like if you have
any questions leave them in the comments
