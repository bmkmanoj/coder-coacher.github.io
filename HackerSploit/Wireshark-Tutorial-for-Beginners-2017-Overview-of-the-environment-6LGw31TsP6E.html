with another video now this is the
second story of Wireshark so in the last
lesson
I actually I do tonio start capturing
magazine Wireshark and what these
actually mean so let's start off from
that so again I told you that these are
the network interface cards that are
actually going to be calculating a be
basically a tea packets or the data
that's being transmitted on the networks
so now I'm giving is one point because
that's what I want to actually capture
my packets with so just click on that
and then it's not capturing so what I'm
going to tell you now is how to
basically analyze these packets in terms
of what they are and what they carry so
as I told you this is to stop capturing
packets and restart or start it so I'm
going to stop it and let's look at what
we have so you basically have three
sections over here in workshop view of
this section you have this one here and
you have this last section here on this
section is basically the packets that
are being scanned and have been actually
scandal as you can see there's something
that it's encrypted now this second
portion of the screen here is giving
more information about the packets as
you can see it gives more into
information about what the packet is
always being transmitted and the and be
basically the manufacturer of here the
device that's transmitting it so if you
can see tp-link that's my router tell me
the source as always pretty much you can
work on hospital is not really useful
packet capture but so busy in this
screen we are giving the packets that
being sent is on using more information
about the packets and this screen here
is probably the least used in Wireshark
you can basically be long transmission
between your computer and the router and
what this means this is how your router
and computer basically communicating
with each other so you can see it in
bits and bytes and you can shake every
that as this
we show it as Bonnie so this is
basically it now the other thing I
wanted to show you how you can easily
edit this interface to your education so
we are going to edit and you're going to
preferences now these preferences are
focused more on Wireshark as they as for
the Wireshark layout so we have layout
there and as you can see enhancer the
different types of layouts you have one
two three which is what we have now one
two one two three one two three
but what I like to have is this one
cause it is basically you put it in a
very nice way we can read the package is
alone a long type of far away and you
can basically minimize that one to the
bottom and there's a row which will be
split equally and you have more screen
real estate for the viewing
so again we're going to prison says it's
just the basic layout of all of how you
want workshop to look and how you want
it work for you let's begin the layout
and lock each of these panels to now I'm
going to talk about the toolbar action
in so as you can see we have a few quite
a few thing you can use on this toolbar
so as we know that this is to start
capturing packets so let's start
capturing any baggage and you get stop
capturing both packets and then you can
restart the current capture and you have
your capture options now the capture
option is something I will it in the
next video because it's quite of
advanced to go to the next one where
I'll be showing you how to actually
specify what package you want to scan so
we leave that for now you then have open
a capture file which is if you already a
safety a capture file which you can do
by the way you can actually save
whatever is captured the next one is to
basically open you can save the capture
file that the one we already have close
is captive file we load the capture file
find the package so for example you want
to find a packet that in disc and I'm
just going to use the basic protocol
HTTP let's fight and we didn't get any
because it did not scan for any HTTP
but we'll get to that you know in the
next video so here you have the previous
packet here you have the next packet and
as you can see it's close to the packet
in the list that area scan then
you have go to specific packet and you
again you can scan by the number by the
number of the ID here so we can take
multi packet and it's going to scan like
that the next one we have here and I saw
it here I go to the first pilot and go
directly to the list and here we have go
to the bottom packet to take directly
downwards the next two we have automatic
school to the last packet using a live
capture that obviously we know is this
one right here you think II then can
zoom in interface if you have further
problems reading so that's very very
useful and you can zoom in and out so
basically that's what it is and this
will repeatedly apply the defaults to
the default of size and it will just
restore whatever your change or zoomed
in or out the next thing is besides the
packet column with this pretty
self-explanatory you can just resize
these little these columns here to your
tier liking all right so that's
basically each later by actions don't
worry about in the leaflets tools up
here please adjust for another tutorial
becoming for them but you don't really
need them right now so that's basically
for the second tutorial
the next tutorial will be showing you
how to actually scan for package and how
to study for packets you can get so you
can actually make some sense of what
you're scanning and how to get valuable
information from them so yeah thanks for
watching guys if you this video helped
you please leave a like following in my
social networks they will be in
description on the screen right now
anyway guys thanks for watching and
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
