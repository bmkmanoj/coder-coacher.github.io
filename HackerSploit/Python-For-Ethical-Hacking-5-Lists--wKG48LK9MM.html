with another video and apologize feelin
too well and yeah I'm back now and I'm
feeling great so welcome back to Python
for ethical hacking and in this video
we're going to be looking at lists now
I'm currently working on my Windows
computer and the reason being is that I
figured why not just use a normal Python
editor on a normal operating system
until we learn all the basics and a bit
of object-oriented programming and then
we can move on to Kali well where would
actually be importing the modules etc
etc but for now I'm just going to be
using Windows to record the these
lectures or videos so let's get started
so as I said we are going to be looking
at lists now lists are very very simple
to understand as they probably say or
are self-explanatory
they they are essentially a list of
items numbers strings etc etc and it's
really very simple to you know to create
a list all you have to do is start off
with a variable I'm just going to be
using a variable and called numbers and
that's because the list is going to be a
list of numbers and then you open up
your square brackets all right not your
curly curly brace brackets just open up
your square brackets and in here you can
start adding numbers to your list so
let's check how to do that so let's say
I wanted to add a number like 23 and
then I use the comma as a separator and
then I can add as many other numbers
that I want thirty four fifty sixty
seven eighty seven one hundred and two
all right so really really that that's
how to create a list and if we are to
just display the list the content of the
list then we just save this and let me
just run as you can see it does display
everything in the list now what if I
wanted to change a value of one of these
positions in the list all right that's
quite interesting
now one thing I wanna just say is that
in computer programming the location of
a variable or the values are usually in
positions of 0 1 2 3 4 all right
so that's the order in which they are
stored it's never stored in one from one
to all the way you know to 100 or 200 it
goes from zero and then one
alright so I just want you guys to
understand that so for example 23 will
be 0 34 will be 1 67 will be 2 and you
get the idea and I will explain just now
so let's say I wanted to change the
value of 34 how would I do that
well I would do that simply by you know
using the list name numbers and then I
would use the square brackets and then I
would specify in here the location of
the value in that I want to edit or
change so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to just use the 0 1 all right so
the location is going to be 1 and then
that's going to be equal to the new
value the new value which in this case
is going to be 4 45 or 456 let's just
add that and then I can just print out
the entire list and see whether the
changes are made let me just print that
out and there you go it did change it to
456 I'm not sure whether you can see
that but that indeed is the answer or
the result now what if I wanted to add
new I wanted to add new numbers to the
list how do I go about doing that that's
a very interesting question
and it has a very interesting answer so
let's say I wanted to add a few more
numbers here the first thing I'll do is
out same numbers obviously and then I
would use the square brackets am i right
no that is incorrect because we are not
selecting any specific value we want to
create a we want to give the list some
new values and to do that we would use
the plus or addition operator which is a
mathematical operator and then I would
use the square brackets and now in here
I can I can add whatever I want all
right so let me try and add something
like 39 and 321 all right and I just
want to print something out right here
and I just want to show you what's going
to happen so I'm gonna print out numbers
and see whether the changes have been
made whether these two numbers have been
added to the list and you'll find the
answer quite surprising so if you look
at it nothing has been done and that's
because this this will essentially what
it does it does not change any of the
values order does not add any of the
values permanently it's a temporary
operation here and we'll be looking at
and why that is in the future but for
now let's just focus on actually adding
some values in there and the way we do
that is very simple so we have already
seen that this will not add any new
numbers or to the list and as I said
I'll be explaining that but for now
let's just get rid of this and let's
look at the real way of doing it the
real way of doing it is by using
functions and in this case we are going
to be using the append function the
append function so we'll just choose the
list name numbers dot the dot operator
which allows us to use a function of
some sort append alright and it's going
to give us the suggestion and in here we
can add a value so 120 for example and
what happens now is if we save this and
if we run we're not gonna sorry about
that
let me just print out numbers no and
let's run that there you go so it
actually has added it in the last
position there because you have appended
it we'll be looking at changing
locations but for now let's just focus
on that so as I said you can have a list
of as many items and you can really pull
data from the list you know change data
you can also add more data to the list
and I guess you can see where this is
going to and coming from so let's look
at slicing lists no no this is quite
interesting and the reason I'm showing
you is because this is going to be very
very important so let's let's take a
scenario of I wanted to slice three
which essentially means splitting so
what I would do in
here is I wanted to split it from zero
one two three till there sounded those
four numbers so what I will do is I will
use the colon alright so that means this
starting point is zero and in this case
the ending point is three and that's
what I want to split right but if I was
to run this and I would say numbers and
I run this as you can see they're going
to be the same what I mean by split by
splicing or slicing lists is this is a
temporary operation and I'll explain
what that is when we look at
object-oriented programming so what this
means is if I was to print them right
now they're a single line okay so let me
print that full command in there and you
will see that indeed it will slice the
list as you can see it did slice these
three numbers 1 2 0 1 2 3 yeah so as you
can see it did do that now what we have
to do now that's essentially just
slicing up as long as you want what if
we wanted to change the values of the
first 3 into something else hmm how do
we do that so let's print it out again
and we were to say numbers right numbers
and we'll split the or slice the ones
that we did so let's use four this time
and now we want to change the values in
here of these ones into something like
let's say let's say 2 4 6 8
all right so as simple as that but you
can see that we're getting an error here
and you might be asking yourself why are
we getting this error and the reason
we're getting this error as I said this
is a float statement and it will not run
if we are printing it so the parentheses
will count and will act part of the
operation so we don't want that so once
we've done this we can now go ahead and
print out here numbers
for all right and if were to run this
now you can see it has changed right
here two four six eight so pretty cool
they follow each other in terms of
operation statements again this may seem
a bit complicated and this is entirely
very very important in Python but for
now just keep on practicing this let's
look at what if we wanted to empty the
entire list that's also a possibility
that you might need to do at some point
during a control flow statement so what
do you do is we would we would do
something like so so we would say
numbers and that's going to be
everything all right what what are we
gonna change that into into a null value
okay we're going to change everything
into a null value which is which
essentially makes the entire list null
which means it has no values or no items
no content really so if you ought to
print this out and we say in here
numbers right and if we save this you
will see something there we are the
values are now and do not have anything
so that's pretty pretty interesting and
as I said strings are very important in
Python and you'll come to be using them
a lot more than you think
but that's basically it for this video
guys a bit of an introduction to lists
we'll be looking at them more in
object-oriented programming but for now
just keep on practicing on this and
you'll get better and better otherwise
thank you guys so much for watching if

and hacking resources and yeah thank you
so much for the support guys we've hit
12 K subs amazing amazing milestone but
now we have to push 420 that at least
the goal I have
for this year and yeah that's basically
it guys have a fantastic day and I'll be
