with another video and finally the next
twenty 17.2 is finally out and this is
gonna fix a lot of problems that existed
in Kali Linux 20 17.1 so this is amazing
and everything has just become a whole
lot better and much more stable so this
is like a quick review of Kali Linux 20
17.2 not a lot has changed obviously in
terms of the interface but a lot has
changed in the back end and a lot of
updates have been made to the different
frameworks and I've got something I will
be but first let's start off with the
new packages that they have added and
some of them are for example let me just
open up my terminal they've added some
like the beaver although I'll be linking
the changelog in the description so you
could can go ahead and check it out for
yourself as I said they haven't changed
anything really to do with the interface
everything is has got to do with the
packages and obviously - they're fixed
all the dependencies so one of the
packages that they did that they have
added they've added quite a few new
packages that you can you can obviously
install because they've been added to
the repository one of them is D beaver
alright I've already installed the
beaver because I've used it before and
finally know it's officially supported
by Kelly so I've started it and as you
can see it's a free Universal database
manager I'm sure a lot of you guys are
familiar with deep beaver it's really
it's it's nothing to do with hacking but
it's a very good database manager so
just let that start up as you can see it
does rely on eclipse obviously and yeah
so you can select a connection type and
if you're familiar with databases you
know what this is but I'll just showing
you that that it does not officially
support the beaver which is awesome it's
good to have a database manager
especially in a penetration testing dist
or a distro pardon me
alright so let's have a look at what
else they've added one of the things
that they've added is the apt to or apt
to which is an automated pen testing
tool which we can just install now so
what I'm going to do is
gonna enter route like so and apt to
actually hold on we have to install this
apt - so let's install this and yeah
there we are it's working so I'm just
gonna hit download bear with me i am
using proxy chains which is something
i'm really excited to show you because
proxy change is finally working in 2017
point two without any problems which
i'll be showing in a few seconds so let
let that finish setting up if the apt -
or apt - depending on how you want to
pronounce it there's a lot of different
ways of pronouncing it there we are so
we can now run it like so and as you can
see it's an automated penetration
testing toolkit written by Adam come and
Austen Lane and I'm wondering where the
other commands are maybe it's starting
up I haven't used this quite a lot there
we are alright so you have your modules
and you basically it works with all the
Metasploit and both frameworks that you
can use and you can see it does have
some dependencies that you might need to
install for example you have to make
sure you've started Hydra and a lot of
stuff by the if you guys want me to make
a video on this please let me know
because this is actually quite a
powerful tool but for now let's just
let's just exit that let's see what
other packages that they did add that
are pretty cool they add they added
fishery I believe that's one of the
packages that's pretty cool let me check
that out with you guys are so apt I'm
just so excited because they seem to
have fixed everything now and Khalil
Knox is finally stable so this will at
least give us another good good usage
until the next version is released
hopefully with even better features so
let's see if this is the actual name if
I remember correctly fishery hmm that
doesn't seem to be the I think I've
spelled that wrongly woops like so
alright there we are so that's fishery
and let it just open up
as I said excuse my internet connection
it isn't the fastest in the world so
just let it that let that complete and
we can just check that out in a second
one second let me just make sure that's
working there we are so we can test out
all right so this is essentially a
fishing tool that you can use
obviously for fishing it really acts as
a framework for fishing one of the new
packages that you can just try and
install that is supported but as I said
I'm gonna be leaving the changelog in
the description so you can check it out
for yourself right the other updates
that they did make to existing
frameworks are the DNS enumeration tool
we have the WordPress can they have also
updated burp suite if I'm not wrong
whether or not using the free edition
free edition or not you can however
choose to incorporate the professional
Edition if you're going to use that that
license so yeah they have updated it the
latest version as you can see an update
is available and you can update it now
and obviously because this is a
standalone type of package it's gonna
take you to the burp suite website but
I'll do that later
so they have made updates to a burp
suite and WordPress can that being the
most the largest frameworks that the
updates have been made to so WordPress
can is an information gathering tool I'm
sure most of you guys have seen it I
forget what section it folds into it's
probably in in vulnerability so web
application analysis here the area
that's what press can let's check it out
I know it is not going to be much change
in WordPress can by the way if you guys
want me to make a video on WordPress can
please let me know because it is a very
powerful tool for WordPress websites yes
it is updated as you can see from here
oh you can check the change log as well
to see what changes they've made in
WordPress can now as I said they have
fixed a lot of things in the back
regarding the backend of the whole
operating system and one of them which a
lot of you guys had issues with was
proxy chains alright and I can confirm
that proxy chains works so you have to
make sure you have tor enabled right and
one second if you want to install torque
apt-get install twrp alright I already
have tor installed so it's probably just
gonna overwrite as you can see zero
upgraded zero newly installed and zero
to be removed now once you have tor
installed you want to check if it's
running service tor status and yeah mine
is active so what you can do is you can
if you want to start it service or start
like so and you can also stop it but if
it's running any other issues you
basically use service to restart
oops sorry story start and once you have
it all installed and is running now you
can start your proxy chains again you
can configure your proxy chains so etc'
proxy proxy changed or conf and you can
edit whatever proxies you want but now
it does work with the Tor relays so
everything works and it works really
fast so I kind of made sure that I have
no DNS data that's been leaked very very
important and as you can see I'm using
the Sox 5 proxy for the entire I'm using
the tour proxy as you can see one twenty
seven point zero point zero point one
with the port being ninety or ninety or
five zero and I'm just gonna exit and we
can try it out so I'm going to clear
that out sorry let me just zoom in here
so whoops
proxy chains and obviously they have
updated Firefox that's just one little
small thing which is always good to see
that they update every package that they
support so proxy chains and Firefox and
we're gonna open duck duck go calm
hopefully that opens and it works now on
video all right as you can see it's
already showing you that it's working
there we are so that everything's
working perfectly we're using a random
chain and all the proxies are coming in
as okay and there we are we are
currently using dr. Coe so we're gonna
check for DNS leaks for DNS leaks again
it's always a good test because this is
the most important test changing your IP
is really not that important
oops that's the website is not that one
again the speed is not going to be the
best but you know you're basically
anonymizing your entire system excuse my
voice guys it's a little down today
there we are and I can tell you I'm not
from Cambridge in the United States and
I can check the DNS leak to see if we're
leaking any DNS information hopefully
we're not and you guys will be able to
see this and there we are we are using a
New York level blah blah blah that's the
DNS we're using and indeed it is working
because I'm not in the United States as
at least not now so yeah that isn't
working and we can finally use proxy
chains wow that is a relief because a
lot of you guys had been commenting
saying it isn't working and that my
video is irrelevant well I can tell you
it isn't relevant and if you want to
check out how to set it up I will link
that video in the description section or
you can check it right right now it'll
be on the screen through an annotation
so that's basically it for this video
guys that's Kali Linux 20 17.2 not a lot
of changes but as I said now everything
seems to be working really well and
kudos to Kali for fixing all the
problems and we're finally we have a
very stable version right now of course
I'm gonna be testing it more and I'll
let you guys know if there any changes
and by the way we are continuing the
Python for that called hacking series as
you can see the folder lets you know
that I'm still working on it so new
videos will be coming out soon so I hope
