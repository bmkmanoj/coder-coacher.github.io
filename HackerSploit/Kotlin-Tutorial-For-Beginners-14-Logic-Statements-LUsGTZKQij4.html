this video I'm basically going to be
explaining the logic statements and
Cortlandt and these are basically very
Universal when it comes to any other
programming languages so let's get
started so I'm going to create a new
quadlin class and I'm going to call it
logical statements or let's just call it
logic state mints all right logic
statements and let's create that and
let's get rid of this comment right here
let's break the main function args array
let's call that a string and then let's
open this as a function now for those of
you have done mathematics and physics
you may already have an idea of what the
logic statements are and they exactly
what you think they are we have the end
all right you have your and you have
your or and you have your not all right
and these basically have their own
they're basically integrated in Kotlin
very very easily and it's very very
Universal as to how these work even with
other program programming languages so
your end a basically or end statement
how it would look like in Portland is
basically two enzymes alright that's
basically your end when talking about or
it's the key way of backslash lights if
you use the shift key and that you get
the combination of these two little
lines right here these are you or this
is your or statement two little lines
and for your knot statement that is just
an exclamation mark so pretty simple but
now you might be asking yourself how do
i integrate these well I can show you
this using maybe a simple program so
let's create a variable let's go to
variable a is equal to 10 let's create a
variable beats oops
I thought house in Java they're verbal B
is equal to 20 is equal to
oops sorry about that is equal to 20 and
now let's use a gate mint alright and
the if statement will basically roll it
basically revolve around the value of a
and B basically relating to each other
so let's you'll be a segment so if if a
is greater than is greater than or equal
to B all right
we're going to use the end statement or
let me explain first of all what's going
on so you basically go down and you put
in the whatever you want to run when
using this statement so let's say print
if a is greater than B which it isn't
right now we say a a is greater than B
but it's not so let's actually change
these values let's invert these let's
make this let's give that a 20 and let's
keep this at 50 all right so when I'm
keeping this at 50 we are basically
comparing these two so if a is greater
than or equal to B print a is greater
than B all right so we all obviously
know that this is going to be the case
so if we run this is going to print a is
greater than B so let's run this and
let's see what it gives us is indeed
wanna give us a is greater than B now we
can say in addition to a being greater
is you in addition to running the
condition a if a is greater than equal
to B both also run and a to make sure so
these are running in conjunction with
each other so if a is greater than or
equal to B and a is let's say less than
100 or let's say a is greater than or
equal to 40 you can basically say and
then say is print a is greater than B
and a is greater than 40 all right so
you can basically run by that then this
will basically work so if we say this so
let's say let's run this right and this
going to say a is greater than B a is
greater than 40 but what if we change
this to let's say 10 back to what its
original value it's not going to return
anything because we haven't give it an
else statement but these are this is
basically how the the logic statements
would work so now if you were to use the
the or statement so now it's going to
run through any of these two so it's
going to test the first one is a greater
than or equal to B no or is a greater
than or equal to 40 no and
probably print the same thing right here
so now I'm going to run an interesting
test right now so we're running it's not
going to print out anything so if we
changed B to 40 and we change the
actually we change this to 50 and we
change this to 40 we know that a is not
going to be greater than B because a is
40 and be 50 but or a is greater than or
equal to 40 which it is so hopefully it
should return it should return this line
right here it doesn't make a lot of
sense but if it returns that we know
that it worked so indeed is going to say
that now in talking and when talking
about not that's very very simple you're
basically using 4 for things like if a
is greater than or equal to B or if a is
is not equal to B you basically get the
idea it's very very simple to use and
that's basically how you integrate these
two with each other so I can just get
rid of these two and I'll just leave it
like that so those are the basic logical
statements that are there in Catalan and
are also available in other programming
languages that's basically it for this
video if you guys have any questions
just let me know in the connect section
