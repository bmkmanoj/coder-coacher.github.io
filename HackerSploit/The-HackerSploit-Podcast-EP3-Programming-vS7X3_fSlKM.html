to the official hackers ploy podcast
this is episode three and for today's
topic we're going to be talking about
the best programming languages now this
is a question I get asked a lot and for
a good reason
programming is looked at as a very
lucrative very unique type of job
opportunity or a industry that one wants
to get into especially in the IT field
we feel where it's really popular but
we're seeing something really
interesting happening and I've been
getting this question for for the
longest time and I also used to ask
myself this question and it's to ask
other this question and the question is
what is the best programming language to
learn or to start learning and the
honest truth through that after all my
experience and trying different things
out and you know learning different
programming languages is that there
isn't a perfect language to start
learning any language is the best
language to start learning and I get
this question so much it's just it
honestly annoys me had said you know to
a certain extent where people are just
asking me the perfect programming
language and they expect me to give them
an answer I might give you an answer
that you maybe don't agree with and
that's what I tend to find is that
people have certain they have their mind
set to one program programming language
and they just want my approval but the
truth is I don't I personally have a
list of my favorite languages but I
cannot say that I cannot tell you to
choose this language over the other as a
beginner I believe every programming
language has their own of the achiever
specific task and they have their own
advantages over the other you know so of
course you can understand when when when
you people say that different
programming languages have their own
market value that's a separate topic on
its own you know some languages are more
valuable there than the other or some
languages are more you have less
programmers in that field so therefore
the job there are more jobs in that
feel and the pay is higher but that's
not when look what we're looking at I
think the way we have to approach this
is from a very simple perspective and
I'm guessing most of the people who are
getting started in programming now are
in the ages of you know 12 maybe 13 14
15 16 even up to your early 20s you know
it's never too late to start anything
and I was in a similar situation believe
it or not where I was I loved computers
and I you know learning about operating
systems or strange things out I was
doing gaming and you know all of a
sudden I came across this thing called
programming and you know at first it
looked very difficult because you're
writing funny things down that don't
make any sense you essentially typing
stuff that doesn't make sense to the
human being but when I saw what it could
do it could really make the computer do
whatever you know you wanted it to do
that that's what really attracted me and
it was just an immediate connection and
the truth is the honest truth is I
started my first programming language
that I started with C++ now for any of
you who know C++ that is probably one of
the worst languages to start with know
when I say the worst languages this is
what a lot of people had told me at the
time when I told them that I am learning
C++ they told me it's one of the hardest
languages and I said well that's that's
my opinion you know I'm gonna try and
learn it and the reason I wanted to
learn it was I wanted to learn how to
create backdoors as you you know I've
told you many times I got into ethical
hacking very very early on in pen
testing really that's where I went into
and C++ is one of them you know since
it's a very low-level language in the
sense that it's a if you are to create
something like a key logger or a
backdoor very few anti viruses would
detect it so that's why I wanted to
learn C++ so very low level languages
and not a language like Python with
which at the time was not popular at all
at that time Python was like
it was like a peasant language when no
one was really paying attention to it
and the big programming language was
Java C++ objective-c what else did we
have we had the you know at that time
JavaScript was was really at the
pinnacle of all languages because
websites were getting more advanced and
this is the point I'm trying to make if
you're going to learn a programming
language I'm going to ask you a question
all right if you're new to programming
and and you're asking this question to
yourself or to others what's the best
programming language to learn I'm gonna
ask you a question I'm gonna ask you
what do you want to do with the
programming language what is your end
goal you know what do you in but what do
you intend to achieve with this newfound
skill if you can't answer that question
you're never gonna learn a programming
language let me just make that as clear
as possible and this may seem a bit
harsh or shocking to you but I'm gonna
tell you that and I'll explain because I
also experienced this so let me go back
to my story I was trying to learn C++
because I wanted to build a keylogger
all right and that's quite an advanced
thing but that was my goal I didn't want
to learn the language I wanted to build
a keylogger and from my interest of
building a keylogger
you know I was going on Stack Overflow I
was looking at code that I could not
even comprehend you know I was looking
at classes functions just things that I
really did not understand and once I saw
an example of a keylogger
I tried to recreate it but I what I
would do is out copy I would type down
what the code that I saw and then I
would try and understand what each each
line is doing and from that I would
research a node check what is a function
what does it do what does a class do you
know a class is a collection of
functions
what's a function you know a function
performs a certain task what are
parameters you know what are variables
all the basics you know so that was all
done manually and I found it to be
really enjoyable where I was not
watching video tutorials at that time
there were a couple of video tutorials
on
plus plus but it wasn't really enough to
to say you know that you can learn
everything from once from a certain set
of tutorials and that's you know what I
was coming to in this current year 2017
I mean it's incredible how much
information is out there the amount of
resources available out there for you to
use to advantage but again people or
individuals all want to focus on
learning the language and you're never
going to learn the language if that's
the goal it's like saying I want to
learn French you know just to learn
French alright the reason people learn
French and the people will succeed in
learning French learn it is when they
want to or are going to France or to a
french-speaking country and want to use
the language or as they say how do you
learn how to speak a language by going
to that country and just listening to
people speak and trying speaking
yourself so that applies to programming
any other thing you want to do in life
you know you have to have an end goal to
all of that are you planning on getting
a job are you planning on building a
website yeah are you planning on
building an Android or iOS application
you know what are you trying to do with
that programming language that's the
question you should be asking yourself
alright so I'll give you an example I
was approached by by someone on Facebook
all right and they want to become he or
she I'm not going to specify or um it
was a he and he wanted to become a pen
tester all right so he asked me what is
the best language and this was a very
good question it's the first that I've
heard what is the best language for pen
testers and this is a question that I
can answer because pen testers have very
narrow you know very narrow spectrum of
languages that are useful so I told him
learn Python learn a very low-level
language like C++ and also learn Java
you know and out of both of them what
are you focusing on in pen testing are
you focusing on building your own
scripts so if you are doing that I would
recommend Python and you know get to
know Linux a bit better and I was
recommending and he understood that and
he started working on that and that's
the way
I don't like people coming and asking me
I want to learn programming because oh I
even got another crazy question from
someone telling me he wants to learn
every programming language available
like everything and I told him well ok
let's say somehow you learn every
programming language then what and that
question I think you should really ask
yourself all right you you cannot master
a programming language you cannot learn
I in my opinion you can learn up to ten
programming languages and be good at
them if you do that you're a fantastic
person because in order for you to learn
and understand and completely master ten
programming languages that will you know
by the time I meet you and have a big
long white beard all right the point
being is that you can't learn everything
let me just throw that out you cannot
learn everything please understand that
even the biggest or the best experts in
any field do not know everything there's
always something that they don't know
you look at different you look at
different how do we put this home I put
this occupations in the world or
professions you know for example pilots
pilots don't know everything about
aviation they do know what their what
their their job requires for example we
have the commercial pilots who know how
to fly commercial planes they don't know
how to fly jet jets or you know the the
Air Force you know so I'm not saying
that you you can't come across a pilot
who does who doesn't know how to fly a
jet aircraft but most of them focus on
commercial on commercial aircraft and
that's what they're good at
my point is focus down on what you want
to learn if you're an IT you choose a
sector you want going to software
development you want going to ethical
hacking and pen testing you want to go
into web development Android app
development or iOS app development just
pick a sector and start off with that
once you're good enough at that and you
want to learn something else then move
on to that telling me that you're gonna
learn all programming languages is
firstly it made me laugh for for a few
minutes because that person didn't
understand that there well over hundred
programming languages and again learning
all of them is a waste of time you know
learn the language that you find most
comfortable with or the language that
you feel is gonna help you advance in
your career or result being you achieve
a specific a specific goal that's the
most important thing that you need to be
focusing on right now as I said I'm
judging this by the age the age gap or
the age bracket that that I've seen is
very this question is very popular in
and that is from the ages of fourteen to
your early 20s you know and yeah so
generally speaking if you want to learn
programming you're interested in
programming I'm gonna ask you a question
programming is not is not a profession
all right let me just clear that out
okay programming or development is about
solving problems okay it's not about
writing code it's about solving problems
you must be able to solve problems and
the way that your you have chosen to do
that is by programming so your job is to
help solve problems it's not to program
or to write code the way you want it's
to actually solve the problem and I'll
keep on repeating this because many
people skip over them and I asked them
you know okay after you've learned this
programming language what you intend to
do then like I just want to know it okay
that's fine you know but remember you've
got to practice your skills you know
programming is not something that will
last with you forever
and trust me you will forget things
about in that language if you don't if
you're not practicing on a daily basis
really because programming that's
another tip bound to tell you
programming is a daily exercise all
right you have to be doing it on a daily
basis for you to improve and to make
sure that you know this stays with you
for life
but then that brings me on to another
question that I'll ask you is fine you
know you want to learn programming and I
ask them why you want to learn
programming why of chosen this sector
and they'll say because it looks fun or
it looks very rewarding let me just
clear that bubble I know I'm sorry for
bursting your bubble but the glory days
of the IT sector are over you know it's
done you know it's not gonna it's not
one of those things where you're gonna
you know just learn how to make an
Android app and you're gonna create an
Android app and it's gonna explode you
know in popularity and you're gonna make
a few billion dollars you know that
really is is out of the picture
completely and I think that's very
important because it's getting the day
dreamers out of this industry the day
dreamers are the people who call
themselves IT experts you know in
quotation marks IT experts and who
really have a very very basic
understanding of the sector they don't
even know what they're doing in there
and they did they're just there you know
for name sake so that they can get I
think a bit more respect and the truth
is if you're an IT expert you should
have at least 10 years of experience in
the in that industry I can't call myself
an IT expert yet you know because there
is so much for me to learn and it's
really you know I know a lot of people I
just hear a lot of people saying that
there are hackers and stuff you know you
can't call yourself that if you if
you've just installed Kali Linux you
know please understand that you know
tell you first of all hacking I remember
I was telling you before Kali Linux no
one was talking about hacking all of a
sudden now since Kali Linux is free and
it's easy to download and install on a
virtual machine everyone's going into it
and they think the hackers just by
running a few Metasploit exploits you
know or on their home network they think
that the hackers or pen testers you know
I'm gonna ask you I'm gonna challenge
you if you think you're a pen tester I
dare you to go to a big company and tell
them I'm gonna find vulnerabilities and
I'm gonna fix them in your system that's
the job of a real white hat or grey hat
hacker I'm not gonna talk about
the black attackers because that is a
that's a different topic altogether and
I think we've covered that you know the
decision is yours whatever you choose to
be and you know I think we're getting
off topic here but the point is the
point is if you want to learn
programming make sure it's for the right
reasons the IT sector is not gonna
guarantee you a good salary of $100,000
a year I'm being honest it really
doesn't you know the top the top line
developers and ethical hackers or pen
testers are really really good at what
they do and the only reason they're
there is because of passion okay passion
is very important in any in any area or
sector of your life if you're not
passionate about something and your
motivation is you know from money or
something like that you're never gonna
be at your best so even if if you find
that programming is something that you
really really you like or you find is
very passionate for you then by all
means go ahead you know if that also
applies to ethical hacking or pen
testing if this is something you really
enjoy and have a passion for then just
just follow you just follow that but
what I'm trying to put across is stop
pondering over what is the best language
you know what should I do next just do
it you know that is that is the way it
should be you know if you see a
programming language that you you find
your you see is valuable for yourself
not for money let's just keep that clear
you find that you can solve problems you
know like you learn Java to develop
Android apps or you learn Kotlin to
develop Android apps if you find that
that is going to be useful for your long
term goal of creating Android apps that
will you know help the world or change
the world then by all means you know
learn that language but learn it with
the goal of making an app don't learn it
with the goal of learning the language
or mastering the language you know it's
like saying you want to learn karate or
you know you want to learn boxing just
to know how to you just to know it you
know we already know that when learning
self-defense or fighting it only comes
in handy
you only become the best if you practice
it you know and that's what you have to
understand practice is very important so
you know that's what I wanted to say and
I would love to hear what you guys have
to say and what you think of the whole
programming industry because as I said
it's beginning now to shape up into a
very into a very good industry but as I
said it's over crowded with people who
are really not serious and are just
claiming to be in that industry and
they're not producing anything great for
the world all they're doing is they're
just pondering over which programming
language is the best and the fact that
they're going to learn it and they never
actually do so I challenge you if you
want to become a programmer I challenge
you to learn the programming language
and to solve a problem with that
programming language once you have done
that then I will consider you a
programmer and before you've done that
before you've created anything with that
programming language please don't call
yourself a programmer I know that sounds
harsh but that's the honest reality of
it so that's basically it for this
podcast those were my thoughts you know
it's it's a it's very very important
that I help you guys you know in
achieving whatever you want to achieve
in this sector the whole IT sector
because as I said it's taking it's
beginning to plateau into a very good I
would like to say it's becoming more of
an of a hard of a more hardened industry
now where the you know just like with
any other industry at the beginning it's
beautiful because it's a new industry
there's a lot of money in it but right
now it's beginning to take shape into a
very good industry and if you want to
get into it you're going to have to
prove yourself to be very good at what
you do you can't be mediocre at anything
so again I would like to hear what you
guys have to say if you have any
suggestions you know questions any
discussions you want to talk about just
let me know in the comments section you
can connect with me on my social
networks if you have any personal
questions you can hit me up on kik or
there is a discord server that you guys
can use for discussion the link will be
in the description section if you found
this helpful
I would really appreciate you support if
you left or like if you're watching this
on YouTube and yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this and I'll be seeing you in
the next podcast thank you so much for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
