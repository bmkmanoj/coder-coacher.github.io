with another video and in this video
we're going to be looking at password
cracking most specifically password
cracking with John the Ripper alright so
a lot of you guys have been asking me
for this and this is probably a very
very important section that I realized
that I haven't covered before and
obviously this section is password
cracking more specifically possible
cracking using John the Ripper
alright so John the Ripper is a
fantastic password cracking utility that
is used to crack in all our passwords
system passwords etc etc it's also very
very good for password hash cracking now
for those of you asking for the more
advanced videos on the channel do not
worry at all I was planning this for a
long time and I've really really
listened to what you guys have had to
say and yes on the channel and you know
until now I haven't covered a lot of
advanced videos and that's because I
wanted to fully cover the beginning of
videos so that anyone watches the
channel can go through the beginning
tutorials and then get competent enough
to move on to the advanced series now
for those of you already advanced enough
in this field you want to see advanced
videos don't worry about that I've been
working on the web penetration testing
series and some other advanced series
and I will scheduling to upload the
videos at the beginning of March but
since you want since you want them early
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start
uploading them from this week from one
day onwards okay so I've actually
recorded and edit them edited them and
now I'll move on to actually uploading
them so again thank you so much for
waiting you know I just wanted to make
sure that I covered all the basics first
and obviously I can cover both sides of
the spectrum where you know beginners
can find value on the channel and also
the advanced users can find value on the
channel I really value both both both
experience levels if that's what you
what you want to call it so you know
beginners should not feel intimidated at
all and the advanced users should not
feel like the channel is becoming very
very basic in terms of the types of
videos I'm uploading so you don't have
to worry about that I'll be uploading
the advanced videos so I'm gonna try and
get a balance anyway
as I
I have not really covered the password
cracking section and today we're going
to be looking at how to crack these zip
and raw passwords with John the Ripper
all right so the surprising thing is not
many people or people actually find this
really really complex because you know
they don't understand the password the
password hash cracking processes and how
deep the cracking process works
all right so essentially John the Ripper
is a fantastic tool that you know in its
full power is great for cracking
password hashes and once you crack a
password hash you essentially get the
password now in this case I have an
encrypted zip file here that is
encrypted behind a password I created
that on my Windows operating system and
I just give it a I don't even remember
what password I gave it I probably gave
it a very very simple password and
that's because again depending on the
complexity of the password you are
cracking the the the process can take
you know a short short time to a longer
time if deposit is more complex is going
to take longer if it's less complex in
terms of the character set that you're
choosing to use then obviously it's
going to take a less amount of time if
the amount of characters is is limited
or you know you have more characters and
it's the you have the use of numbers and
symbols then obviously the process is
gonna be longer but enough said let's
get started with John the Ripper right
so John the Ripper is pre-installed on
Kali Linux which is awesome and as you
can see I have the test file on my
desktop so I'm just going to browse to
my desktop here so change desktop change
directory into my desktop
and clear that out and now we can get
started with the process so the first
thing we need to do is we need to get
the password hashes and that can be done
by using a tool called zip - John it is
part of the the John the Ripper package
so let me just show you what it's used
for it's used for getting the password
hashes now depending on whether or not
you're using a zip file or a RAR file
the process is still the same or it has
a utility for both of these processes so
if you're using a zip file or you want
to and you want to get the password from
a zip file the first thing we need to do
is we need to use zip - John alright so
zip - John sorry about that
zip - John and then after that we
specify the file and then if we hit
enter it's going to give us the password
half
or we can output the file into a txt
document which is the the preferred way
of doing so once you go into becoming a
penetration tester it's very very
important that you save all of the
results that you're getting in
everything that was involved in the
process so again this is why I was
talking about you know really really
covering the basics so that people learn
you know penetration testing the right
way all right so as I said if you're
using a zip file you can use zip to John
if you're using a RAR file you can use
rar - John all right so the process is
relatively simple in this case you're
using a zip file so I'm going to use zip
- John and then now I'm going to specify
the file name which in this case is
called test dot zip so I'm just gonna
test dot zip whoops sorry about that
test dot zip and once I've specify the
file if I hit enter now it's gonna
whoops for some reason we've got an
error there oh there is a space in there
so let me just see if I can rename this
and get rid of the space between there
there we are let me just rename it
fantastic okay so now we can go zip -
John tests towards it now once I hit
enter it'll give me the password - don't
worry if it gives you the error that the
the file is not encrypted irregardless
the passo - starts with the dollar sign
and ends with the dollar sign that is a
a hash so it ends here or actually here
alright so it starts with a dollar sign
and ends with the dollar sign that's how
you know what they password hashes so
now we need to crack this but first I
want to export it into a txt document so
to do that we just use the output de
notre which is the greater than sign and
we give the name of the the document in
this case we're using we are storing it
in a text document so I'm just gonna
call it hash oops
hash dot txt and minute enter and it's
gonna save the hash for us in here there
we are fantastic and now we can get
started with the password hash cracking
process I'm just gonna clear the
terminal now and we can use John so now
we have to use John and we now need to
select the format of the of the file
that we are trying to crack and then
specify the hash or the document that
contains the hash so we say John and
then we use the format denoted
so that is the format command and that
is denoted by a double dash and format
all right so after that we then say
format is equal to zip now again if your
file is a rar file the process is the
same you just need to change this into
our a rar
alright so in this case mine is just zip
and then now you have to specify the
hash so if you have copied the hash you
can just paste it in yet yeah directly
in this case we have saved it on
document so I'm just gonna specify the
document name
so hash dot txt and I'm gonna hit enter
and that the the password hash cracking
process is there as you can see it was
performing the cracking process and it
caught it in a few seconds and as you
can see the password is really really
simple 1 2 3 4 5 6 now the reason I
chose this is because again I did not
want something very complex otherwise
iterative it would have taken a longer
time and that is the thing you need to
understand about password cracking even
when you use tools when you're cracking
you know logins like the SSH locking and
you're using tools like Hydra the
process is quite quite a while you know
I remember you cracking passwords when I
was learning or when I was you know on
my first job the process the password
cracking you know took almost probably
about 12 vowels so yeah it's going to
take a while and that is the probably
the thing about password cracking
whether you're performing a brute-force
attack or you're you're trying to crack
against passwords logins you know or
even if you're using a dictionary attack
you know it's it's pretty much just
about time all right so that is how you
crack a zip file or a rar file the
process is still the same and there's
your password so now we know deposit is
1 2 3 4 5 6 let us confirm that by
actually trying to extract our file here
so I'm gonna hit extract here I'm going
to extract to my desktop there we are
extract and I'm just going to the
password and I'm gonna it ok and there
we are extraction completed successfully
fantastic we can close that up and in my
test file I just had some really basic
files yet there's a set up there just
for synergy which is awesome
all right so one more extra thing I'm
gonna give you guys an extra bonus I'm
gonna show you how to crack Linux
passwords with John alright so with the
the thing about Linux passwords is Linux
posts are stored in a in Det C and the
shadow folder
right so I'm pretty much most of you are
familiar with that those of you were
advanced users should be familiar with
the file structure of the the Linux file
directories and where they passed with
the stored but the thing about them is
that the file is encrypted so you need
to crack it so by default what I'm going
to do is I'm just gonna create a user so
user add and I'm just gonna say the user
username should be let's just call it
user user - all right I'm gonna hit
enter and it's going to add the user now
I'm gonna change the password of user to
some essentially I what I'm doing right
now is I'm just creating a user and a
password and I'm gonna show you how to
crack it
obviously the Linux user names ID
password so you can actually crack the
passes that belong to all the accounts
on the Linux operating system so I'm
gonna give it a password so it's gonna
ask me to enter a new UNIX password so
again I'm just going to enter a really
really simple password 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
let's make it a bit complex so 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 and I'm gonna enter and there we are
password updated successfully so to
crack the to crack the the the shadows
file the shadows finally exist in the
dtc and as you can see if you specify
the shadow file like this dtc shadows
file you will essentially that that
israel apostles are stored so we can use
john and we can say ET cie shadow if i
just open that up there we are shadows
there's the shadow file again by the way
it is a file so we just did shadow and
once we enter it's gonna start cracking
the password hash and it's gonna give us
the results as you can see a 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 so that was really really quick now
let me explain the results that we've
got here because it may feel a bit a bit
confusing so as you can see detected
that the hash type was a sha-512 of five
one two so that is an encryption
protocol or an increase encryption
algorithm sorry about that very very
powerful and again it was able to crack
it really quickly now by default is
telling me something here that it loaded
three password hashes with three
different salts so what this means is
yes i have performed this cracking
before and it found the password hashes
and they were correct so what it's
I had three accounts that were cracked
before and it will
they've already corrected the hashes so
it's not going to crack those the
password hashes for those accounts it
only corrects the ones that do not bill
that have not been cracked yet in this
case which was user two and it caught
the password there which was awesome so
that is essentially how to crack Linux
bosses they're really very simple and
said people just you know really over
over they just they just make things a
bit too complex for themselves and the
the process if you understand the
process the then performing their
techniques you know to exploit a system
or two in this case cracker passwords
are really very simple it's just about
time patience and prudence all right so
I'm just going to clear this up and what
we're gonna do now is I'm just going to
delete the user that I created user
delete well I'll do that later anyway
