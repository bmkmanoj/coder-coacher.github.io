with another video and in this video I
am going to be showing you how to use an
T on Android which is a network
penetration and testing toolkit
application that gives you a whole suite
of applications or tools for ethical
hacking and penetration testing now this
application is going to be part of the
playlist that I started called turning
your Android device into a hacking
machine um so without any further
shunter let's get started
alright guys so Santi is a free
application I will leave the download
link in the description it'll take you
to their website and all you have to do
is enter your email and they'll send you
the download link of the application
whenever there's an update they will
send you the update email so that's
pretty pretty awesome so what you have
to do is make sure your Android phone is
rooted and it has busybox installed just
as a precaution but you do need root for
this application to work as I said in
the first video on this series so all
you have to do is just open it up and
it's going to be it's going to give you
this
this device is found on your network
when you obviously install this for the
first time you will get this all you
have to do is hit refresh which is what
I will do I will say map your network so
this is basically mapping all the
devices connected to your network so you
can also click on clear logs delete all
the scan results and intrusive scan so
I'm going to also turn on intrusive scan
which is going to scan for
vulnerabilities when you're testing any
network that you're supposed to be
testing so hit OK and it's going to say
it's going to say it's going to ask for
root permissions and obviously you have
to grant it through permissions and it's
going to say devices for Nannette
network and mapping in network so it's
actually mapping the network now give it
a few more seconds and yeah alright so
once the scan is done it will give you
this this prompt will say networks can
complete send tweets so you can actually
send a tweet to you when it's done if
you're doing it remotely but I'm not
going to do that I never do that it's
kind of stupid actually but anyway if
you want to do it go ahead no thanks
so it's going to give you the devices on
your network as you can see and their
IPs and the OS it's running if if it can
detect it so basically here you have
your default gateway which is the entire
network the first the top the top top IP
which is your network gateway then you
have other devices connected here and as
you can see you have an Android device
which is saying this device you then
have the Windows device which is my
laptop are you running Windows obviously
and you have at the bottom the router
now I have two routers on this network
one is actually boost
the network because miles is quite quite
quite big asshole it has to boost the
the signal from the first router onto
the other side of the house so yeah -
just in case you see two routers um so
yeah so the first thing I'm going to
show you is if for example if you select
a target so I'm going to click on my
laptop for example and it's going to say
the IP and the MAC address and the ports
open now what you could do first
as you can see you have operative
actions you have you can scan you can
pro man advanced scanning on your target
so I'm going to make that full and you
can hit a regular so you have all of
this is so cool guys you can actually
run a script you can do an intense scan
and you can also run a pinks and os
detection quick trace route i IP i ICMP
scan UDP TCP scan transmission control
scan a RP scan and all that good stuff
so I'm just going to do a small pink
scan for example and you can actually
execute a script discovery DNS
geolocation so geolocation Ned your
bytes your NSC I'm going to click that
and I'm going to leave smart scanning
off that's just gonna check for fund
abilities well they're going to be
hardly any because my laptop has a
firewall I'm gonna hit go and it's going
to see manual scan completed and you can
see the scan log and it's going to give
you all of this all of the information
that you want pretty pretty amazing guys
I really love this application it's one
of the best you then can actually
connect to a remote port now this is
very very very uncommon in Android
applications but finally we've got it so
you can actually hit connect to remote
port and you can connect the Microsoft
DES and actually login to the computer
and remote control it you have DWS dpa
you actually have to download an
application from there but yeah you have
all the NetBIOS and it's just amazing
what you can do this application but
that's the pretty pretty normal stuff
you could do when doing some penetration
testing you then have my favorite the
attack options so you can actually check
for weak passwords so I'm going to click
on that and cracking
methods mall dictionary obviously the
bigger the dictionary the better so huge
dictionary I'm gonna eat go for example
and there's going to start and this is
going to obviously take a while so I
highly recommend that you don't do this
and wait for it like over a few seconds
won't take more than that someone's just
going to close that and and yeah now for
the thing we've all been waiting for
mile in the middle attacks this is where
this application really really stands
out and I really love it for this so man
in the middle and you just hit on on the
target and you can actually view the
logged requests so you can hit log
request and you can see BBC all the
websites that I visited or I am visiting
and actually tells you is it has
passwords so you can actually see that
is something my network is vulnerable to
MIT M or man-in-the-middle attacks
that's because my router does not have a
firewall those are pretty expensive
routers so I'm just gonna hit okay but
I'm not going to do anything right now
but I'm going to do something I'm going
to go to my laptop and I'm gonna I'm
gonna open a website I'm gonna open my
website to show you that it actually it
actually works so just let me try and
open my website right there and as you
can see hackers Floyd let needle let
that's my website so it does work as I'm
saying
pretty pretty awesome man pretty awesome
so yeah the view logged requests are
logged images you can view the logged
images BBC BBC a lot and you can
actually edit packets on the websites
you can use and edit the packets that's
pretty advanced feature I'll be
explaining these features as we move on
you gonna have money in the middle
method you have i ER P and is ICMP I'm
not going to cover that in this video
because it's pretty advanced you then
have reconnect Li read redirect the
websites to a HTTP which is not a secure
protocol you can then replace images on
the website whatever you want which is
so amazing you wanna troll guys on your
Wi-Fi you then can capture the downloads
and save it on your debt
so that's premium like someone is
downloading files they can actually you
can actually capture them and save them
on your device pretty pretty awesome
guys you can also insert HTML into
specific websites and maybe add some
flash code or something like that to
mess with a person that's basically how
the basic features of Zante it's pretty
pretty awesome guys I wouldn't lie I
mean like this is one of the must have
applications for a penetration tester an
ethical hacker like on your Android
device so yeah guys I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did leave a
like down below and you can find the
documented tutorial of this document
version of this tutorial on my website
if you guys want more for me subscribe
and have a fantastic game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
