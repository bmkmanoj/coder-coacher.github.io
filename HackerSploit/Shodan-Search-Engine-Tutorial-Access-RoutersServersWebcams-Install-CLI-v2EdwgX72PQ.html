with another video in this video I'm
gonna be showing you how to use shorten
that IO or show down the search engine
and how to install it a search engine
and how to install it on your Linux
terminal so you can access it from there
as well so let's get started
now for those of you who have never
heard of shorten or shorten is a very
very powerful search engine that I'm
sure if you've watched mr. robot you
probably already know it's a search
engine that exposes vulnerabilities the
problem is that not many people know how
it works and how to fully utilize it to
its maximum potential now I've been
using it for quite a while now and I've
actually learnt a lot about it I've read
a few books on it and it is extremely
powerful so let me explain to you what
it is really because many other
youtubers seem to ignore the fact that
you know in order for you to utilize it
correctly you need to understand how it
works
all right so should' is a search engine
that will allow users to search the
internet of things alright so it's such
as the the network that is created by
devices connected to the Internet
alright and then will gather information
you know like the operating system being
used or the service that's running on a
port alright so it in in essence what
it's performing is it's performing
banner grabbing all right so it's
performing service banner grabbing that
will it'll grab all information it that
it can about any devices that is
connected to the Internet all right so
it performs full service banner grabbing
from servers or any other devices
connected to the Internet and it'll
it'll scan for different ports now one
of the most popular pots that'll it will
scan for is the port 80
alright other pots that it can scan for
are the SSH port which is port 22 you
have your FTP port port 21 your telnet
which is port 23 I don't know if anyone
has a telnet running on their server if
they do they should probably be sent to
jail for that because that is just
unbelievably insecure or unsecured
alright so it is used for 4
forming banner grabbing and it goes it
searches every device connected to the
Internet and you know it scans for ports
and these services and the operating
system that is running on each of these
devices all right so it can be used you
know to access web servers network
devices and web cams you know routers
etc etc you know scatter systems a lot
of systems that are going to be online
obviously and you know you can take
advantage of them now when I say this
I'm going to throw out a bit of caution
please do not do this and use this
information for any illegal purposes I'm
not going to be held responsible that is
my disclaimer to you guys all right so
let's look at how to use shodhan alright
let's get started so I've just opened up
the link on my browser I'm using Firefox
you know the standard stuff you guys can
use whatever browser you want to use so
the website is shodhan dot io now I'm
sure most of you have actually tried
this out but again it's really really
there is no starter guide on how to use
it so hopefully this will help you guys
understand how it works a little bit
more alright so the first thing you want
to do the most probably the most
important thing to get you know the
maximum effectiveness from this website
or this search engine is to create an
account alright so just go ahead and
create an account you can do it right
over there but I've already created mine
so I don't have to do that it's really
very simple you can even login with your
Google account directly and you don't
have to create a separate account all
right so it's pretty simple the website
again tells you the search engine for
the web cams for web so it'll say
shorten is the world's first set engine
for the internet connected devices so
the Internet of Things really alright
so you know we can search for anything
in the search bar right yes and you know
whatever comes to mind so some of the
easiest and the most common searches
that most people will do as they saw on
mr. robot is something like webcams all
right now if I search for webcams indeed
webcams will show up so let's actually
see that right and here we have a webcam
in Ireland alright so I'm just gonna
click on one of them and it's going to
open up and as you can see we can
says get direct access to the webcams
right now we have one in Italy we have
another one in Sweden
live cameras maybe updating every you
know three to five frames I'm not sure
about the frame rate we have one in the
United States blah blah blah we have all
collection of webcams here so it looks
like it's a server setup for looking at
different webcams from different places
and straight off the back you can see
how useful shouldn´t is now again
whatever you want to do thick to the IP
address you know that's up to you we
also have one from Iran pretty
interesting there now going back again
that's just one search that we have done
for webcams let's look at the second one
which is in Cologne in Germany
all right let's click on it let's see
what it does give us I probably should
have opened it up on in another tab but
I'm just gonna give you some I'm just
going to open it up in another tab
hopefully the search is not it's not
loaded so let that try and open up here
now meanwhile well that's loading up I
think it's very very important to
understand what information that it's
given you right now all right so we have
made a search for webcams
and it's gonna give you here total
results 293 not bad at all
and then it's gonna say the top
countries so we can see United States
Germany Canada Russian Federation Japan
right now it's gonna give you these
services alright so we have the HTTPS
which is port one to anyone we have the
NASA HTTP blah blah blah all these
services that are running top
organizations these are the
organizations that who are behind or own
these webcams we have cyber box blue
gravity Comcast Verizon blah blah blah
and then we have the operating systems
being used which are you know q TS Linux
3 obviously that's fantastic that is
running Linux then the products you have
Apache web cam X people are you know
still using X Windows XP for reason I
don't know you know god be with them and
yeah well as I was saying that that
didn't open up so it's probably locked
or it's down so let me open this other
IP right here and we
a webcam xp5 and apparently this is some
sort of livestream and yeah we are
getting a live stream of someone's
window I believe nothing about the well
it looks to be United States so yeah
this is a webcam that's currently
running and it looks like it's running
about two to three frames per second you
have different sources let's try source
to JavaScript you can also we have
another camera
another webcam so we have the we can
also use motion which is I think a
little bit faster and double with all
the frames are rendered but there you go
that's how to access webcams using
shodhan let's look at some other such
such options one of the other popular
ones is the traffic signals
alright so signals and you can imagine
that damage that this can do you know an
engine that gives information that
you're looking for and whoops currently
right now we only have one well that's a
bit scary but you know what let's just
go for it I'm gonna try and access it
welcome all right so this has nothing to
do with what we're looking for so that
such option did not give me anything
really so let's look at some other such
options that we can use or other
examples so as I said you can search for
ports which is awesome now some of the
search filters that you can use are like
you can search for ports you can search
for port now the syntax for this is let
me try and zoom in I'm sure a lot of you
guys can see what's going on
so port alright and then use a colon so
these are the this is the string format
so you have to actually make your
searches in string format if you're
looking for the most results so let's
say we're looking for anything that
could be running port let's try port 22
alright so let's try that right now
which you know 422 is SSH all right so
port 22 and immediately we get we know
we're correct because it's gonna display
about 13 million results freaking
awesome man alright so most of them are
in the United States about 4 million we
have China
and the funny thing is sorry for
interrupting what I was about to say
there it'll give you the service so it's
running SSH to OpenSSH then point to key
type Diaz's hrs a and it gives you the
actual key here which is freakin awesome
now if you open it up right here hope I
know it's probably not going to open up
to the direct connection because we have
to use the SSH service I don't know if I
should actually try and connect to it I
was just looking at the ESS H key and
you can basically have a good idea of
what's going on here now there are
plenty of these servers that you can
look to exploit and as you can see most
of them are running open SSH which is
awesome
some are running OpenSSH on debian but
mostly you've tried you'll try to see
that it's running on Linux which is
awesome nothing running XP being the
last one but again you know
experimentation and whatever you guys
decide to do with this you know it's up
to you you can also use the port one
seven two three or you know both
specific ports that the operating system
would use so client operating systems
like you know three three eight nine
let's try and use that port
let's see what we get here this should
probably return some remote desktop
controls you set up by computers the
port thirty eight nine is used by
operating system for remote remote
access I believe or there we are we have
one allows us to connect someone's
computer let's try that out we probably
have to connect to the IP address
directly this is a screen shot as well
someone did take a screenshot there we
are so we have Windows 10 someone's
running Windows 10 let's look at what we
can get from here so it is indeed
running the port the port one three
eight nine
so let's actually turn access that what
I'm going to do is three to eight nine
paste that whoops did I copy that copy
t-38 nine let's see if we can get access
there oops I used eight
let me go back there service and
available probably block
all right so let's look at some other
services so that's how to use you know
scan for operating systems that could be
life again you can use whatever you feel
you want to access but it's pretty
pretty awesome you know pretty pretty
awesome the amount of stuff that you can
do let's look at some other search
filters that you can use you can also
search for simple things like routers
all right so let's say I was to say
Netgear and you know this will probably
give us access to the the admin panels
or the control panels for the different
routers so you can you can see we have
the Netgear let's see what what which
one of them we can access here let me
try and open that one up whoops there we
are that's the Netgear let's try and
connect to this one here all right
doesn't look like it has any credentials
such oops what am i doing searching
google for that my bad sorry about that
guys let's paste that and go probably
give us an error given the fact that
this is a router but let's see what we
get and the reason most of these are
giving us access you might be wondering
is why the hell are routers giving us
you know access to to the admin panels
and that's because they've been set up
for remote access which means you know
you can control your your router from
you know any way in the world really as
long as you have an internet connection
and your route has an internet
connection so here we have you know some
Cisco devices running Cisco which is
also awesome as well so there's a lot
you can do with shorten and say you can
search for a lot of vulnerable devices
but the real beauty of Jordan is
combining these search filters that we
know all right so let's say we wanted to
search for different services like there
are a lot of search filters I'm just
going to be showing you some of them
let's say we search for an OS alright so
OS and we can say OS
and we can save Windows XP right so OS :
Windows XP in string format whoops
actually did not use the correct syntax
there I believe it's OS with a capital
I'm not sure or we can just search for
Windows probably the XP is used using a
colon there we are alright so we can
immediately see that there's a lot of
services here that are running and
they're running different services so
you know not a lot of devices which is
always a good thing to see not a lot of
people running Windows XP but you can
see that the different information
shared is the the amount of devices
connected so you have your this one
looks pretty vulnerable from my point
but we're not going to look at that you
know in depth so that's one of these
search filters the other one is you can
use something like the city so you can
say City and we give the name of the
city so in double quotes you can specify
something like let's say let's search
for a city let's say Florida I know
that's a state but let's see what
services are running in Florida let's
see
sometimes it's obviously gonna take a
while trying to index it you know into a
specific location yeah there we are
United States Florida we do have a
Florida in Argentina apparently mmm and
yeah you can really see how you can sort
out information in terms of the devices
connected to the Internet and this
basically allow you or give you access
to such as much as you want you know
this we have looked at the search
filters like pots countries cities
operating systems we can also try and
search something like for services
directly so let's say Apache Apache
service version two point two point
three the research for that this will
probably give us servers that are
running Apache and more specifically
that one and then you know you could
probably find exploits for that version
and try to break through you know
whatever you want to do that's that's up
to you man do
whatever you want to do it's really up
to you
whoops stablishing it's apparently
turning WordPress so you can see this is
probably the hack hackers or a pen
testers well a blackhat hackers you know
this is probably their dream come true
the amount of devices that you could get
access to here really really easily I
mean some of these computers are running
ancient pieces of software that have
multiple exploits and I have to come
back to Windows XP you know that that
that is something that is so exploited
it's unbelievable that people are still
running that said it should be legal to
run but enough of the jokes about
Windows XP let's look at how to install
showdown on your terminal so to do that
just go on developers all right and it's
gonna say leverage the power of show
then you it's basically using the should
and API alright so get started alright
that should probably give us that really
quickly and it's gonna give you all
these options that you can use to get
started with the API these are specific
to languages alright now if I go back
here those are specific for for
languages so if you want to you know
include the API in your mobile
application or something like that the
API is available to install it on your
your command line just go to the command
line friendly and install the CLI it's
really very very easy to install it so
it says it's gonna say get showdown
command-line interface just easy
installed showdown so let's do that
right now so let's go into my terminal
alright let it open up I don't know why
it's taking so much time there we are
so let me just zoom in so easy install
showdown
alright easy install show then it's
going to search and then soon after
install it for us all right there we are
searching for show done downloading
should then there we are it's done and
now we have to get the API key all right
so it's gonna ask you for your API key
so let's get our API key and it's gonna
give you a Pik in your account overview
so just copy that or you can use your
your QR code scanner but that will
probably defeat the purpose so pissed in
your API key
whoops you have to use the shortened
command pardon me so we can actually use
the help options here so show them and I
believe it does have have a help menu
here so show then help there we are so
show done we need to set the we need to
set the initialize it so show then I
think it should an initialize so show
done whoops
initialize and we paste in our API key
right here and if we hit enter oops oh
oh yeah sorry about that I believe I
thought it had short key sorry about
that it's still not giving us that sure
so then initialize and we paste in that
API key place that back in alright so
successfully initialized actually
believed I thought it had short key
because it was giving us the options
right here but that's weird anyway so we
can now go ahead and use shorten and if
you go back to the website let's go back
and as you can see the command overview
is pretty pretty simple you can perform
example such as like show then count
Microsoft blah blah blah that's an
example search so let's try and perform
one of the services that it does give us
here which is show then host and then it
gives us an IP so let's try that out so
clear so show then host did I actually
copy that entire entire command post and
is that in there yeah I did sorry about
that guys apologies apologies
so show then host and if we search for
this it's going to automatically use the
search engine which is awesome there we
are let's try and find another IP that
we
in search or again search for showed
them short them port 22 you know hmm
this is weird I thought the oh they must
have changed the command types because
their words were shorthand alright so
show then host apparently you have to
look this there's it's limited in what
you can search for so you can check Oh
so this is for exploits awesome so this
is mainly targeted at you know searching
the specific target that you've got in
terms of the IP which is awesome so if
you had got an IP on showdown which we
had we could just perform here if we
went back to show them sorry up there
and we performed a search for something
like we search for port 422 you know an
SSH port and we searched for it right
there there we are
it would give us some SSH ports and you
probably get the IP address and then see
if you could log in or you know look at
whether there's a honeypot which is also
also awesome here that it does provide
you with that option with the API for
the command line interface so that's
going to be it for this video guys I
