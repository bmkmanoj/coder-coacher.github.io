with another video
and finally the coast is all I have
finally completed making course that's
why I haven't uploaded in almost a month
now I was working on this course so this
is the ethical hacking course this
course continued from a beginner to
advanced in terms of ethical hacking or
if you're just learning penetration
testing so here we are so welcome
everyone to the course the first lesson
in the course there'll be a video every
day so hopefully in a month you can
actually reach an advanced level so my
name is Alexis and yeah let's get to
this so moving on to the next slide what
is hacking so basically we have before
we even start we need to understand what
hacking in now aking is being attempt to
gain or gaining unauthorized access to
data in a system now if your white hat
hacker which I'll talk I'll talk about
in a few minutes a white hat hacker is
basically authorized to hack the system
but a black hat is unauthorized so you
can look at it in both ways so that's
basically what hacking is now types of
hackers you'll know the black hats black
hats are individuals with extraordinary
computing skills that you'll be a
skillful malicious or destructive
activities so they're really using the
skills for wrong and offensive purposes
you know white hack snow white hat our
professional hackers similar normal
similar skill set to black hat but they
use the skills for security analyst
analyst and they basically use it for
the defensive side of the spectrum we
can upgrade apps and perhaps all these
are basically the hackers were in the
middle of the playing field and are just
on the fence they are both black hat and
white attackers and finally we have the
fourth one which are many of you
notified in our teen suicide hackers so
suicide actors are individuals who just
aim to bring down critical
infrastructure for a call and they'd
really don't care or the consequences
so all they care about is completing the
hack destroying the system or stealing
data and they don't care if they get
arrested so that very many type of
hackers now the next thing i want to
talk about are these phases of hacking
now this are very very important points
here this is basically these steps that
you need to follow here for a successful
hack so step one reconnaissance or
footprinting now this is basically
getting information about the target
this can be done actively opacity
actively meaning you can go into the
offices and you can see what computers
they're running what operating systems
their own what server they have and
perfectly can be done through social
engineering so yeah that's basically
getting information about the target now
step two is scanning scanning is getting
some more information about above the
target using tools like port scanners
nslookup and think just getting some
details about how these servers or the
connection is now step three is gaining
access which is where you actually
hacked the system to gain access alright
so this way you perform in the hack so
in step 4 we have maintaining access
this is just maintaining a position in
the system when you're stealing all my
manipulating the data so this is just
making sure that you stay in the system
while you're performing whatever you
wanted to do and the files is one of the
most important parts of back covering
your tracks to make sure that you are
untraceable and we hacked cannot be
traced back to you so this is the first
lesson I just wanted to give you guys an
overview of firm or basic overview of
hacking and the types of hackers and the
sales of hacking in the next lesson I
will be setting up the hacking
environment so yeah hope you guys like
this video if it did
you leave a like comment below other
videos you want me to make and thank you
so much for watching goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
