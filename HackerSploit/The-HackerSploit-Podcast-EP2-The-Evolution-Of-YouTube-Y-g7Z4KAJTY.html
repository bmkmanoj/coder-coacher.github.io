with another podcast and welcome to the
hacker sploit podcast episode two in
today's podcast we are going to be
talking about the evolution of YouTube
and how YouTube has changed and how it
is constantly changing and what
basically what's what's happening really
on on this platform so let's start off
really simply and let's look at the
water the current changes that we're
seeing on YouTube I mean you know
YouTube if you were to look at it from a
linear perspective has changed quite a
bit actually from what type of you know
the type of content that they wanted and
the fact that monetization was enabled
and copyright in the like that content
creator is able to copyright their
content basically and make a decent
amount of money on YouTube it's a really
really huge platform right now and the
reason I'm making this is the topic of
the podcast is because over the last I
think over the course of this year we
have seen that YouTube has changed him
in terms of the popular content creators
that you will see now and the fact that
after we experienced the ad pocalypse so
to speak when advertisers pulled out of
basically monetizing or advertising
their products on YouTube because of
issues that dealt with what type of
content they were they were monetizing
they didn't find it appropriate so they
backed out but I'm from from what I know
I expect them to come back especially
around the the end of the year during
the holiday period as again people need
to advertise their products but that's
besides the point so there's been a huge
Fiasco on YouTube over the whole Jake
Paul and Logan poll and the fact that
they're actually the biggest channels
right now not in size but in terms of
the amount of views and the amount of
money that they're making
which is you know a feat on their own no
I mean this is not a video about Jake
and Logan Paul they're you know they're
great youtubers doing their stuff and
they have managed to build an audience
around what they do you know so what I'm
trying to talk about here basically is I
think in my perspective I think YouTube
has had a generational system for
content creators now just hear me out
I want you guys to focus at the start of
YouTube where we basically YouTube was
just a video sharing platform there's no
monetization and in fact the channels
were very basic in terms of
functionality you had some of the older
creators can't really this is at the
start of YouTube so I can't really
actually remember some of the older
content creators but they basically were
creating content that people watched and
the whole purpose of YouTube was to
amass a following right there was
nothing to do with there and there was
no incentive for money and stuff like
that and then all of a sudden once I
think in 2011 when they advocate of
started making it a platform friendly
for content creators of all kinds they a
lot of people joined and started doing
all of their you know just experimenting
and doing whatever they wanted and you
also form the rise of gamer gamer
channels where people were uploading
them playing again so it was really a
wonderful time and then YouTube had a
fantastic model that is still working to
this day and that was to advertise
content beside advertise advertise
basically products from advertisers
beside your content and you basically
share you have a revenue split so that
worked great and you'll see a lot of
people once the the current content
creators started making a living on this
and actually started making money a lot
of people saw this as an opportunity to
maybe have a career change or just
change the way they change what they do
really so a lot of people
jumped on the boat on the YouTube boat
back in 2012 I think that was the
highest amount of channels being created
at the time and you can see that that
was the second generation of youtubers
those who came in in 2012 when basically
monetization was enabled not to say that
the incentive was money but they just
found it as a more it basically made
more sense to go in then so um when you
look at it that way you see that we
actually are in the third generation now
as of this year and I think you can see
that the currently the big channels that
we have that were created quite a while
ago
like for example PewDiePie ksi just to
name a few and there are too many more
don't don't hate if I if I didn't
basically give the name of your favorite
youtuber that's those are the only ones
I have at the top of my mind but let me
explain exactly what I think is going on
if you look at Jake Paul and Logan
Paul's videos they are basically getting
a few million views per video in a day
now that is extremely extremely
successful it's basically what everyone
wants for their channel is to basically
have their subscriber base giving them
an accurate amount of views basically
judging by the amount of subscribers
they have now what I mean is let's say I
had two million subscribers and I
uploaded a video and I get maybe a
hundred thousand views in a week that
means that my channel isn't doing very
well because the subscriber base isn't
watching my videos but with Jake Paul
and Logan Paul you're basically seeing
that they're uploading they have about 8
million or I'm not sure I haven't
checked for a while I could be wrong and
basically when they upload a video they
get about 2 to 5 million views in a day
or even two days and I'm not sure about
these metrics but it's what they're
doing is awesome and I'm not I'm not
really not going to take side this to
say what I hate them or like them I just
feel that they are doing whatever they
are doing and they are give they're
getting rewarded for it for it you know
so these are the type of channels that
you'll see now and you can see it with
the older channels for example PewDiePie
who has 55 million subscribers but if
you compare his metrics to Jake Paul
he's great he isn't really doing that
much and you would expect him just
before to say let's say only 50% of the
subscribers watch these videos that's 25
million people so and you see that ease
and getting that that's just an example
and you'll see that all the youtubers
now have basically they've they've been
getting not a lot of support from the
subscriber base and I think that is a
problem on its own but let's start off
with the evolution here so we have a
generational system we had the first
content creators sort of the pioneers of
the platform you then have the second
generation which is people like
PewDiePie and ksi and CaptainSparklez
and smosh and those type of guys you
know the Minecraft the gamers and stuff
does mostly it was mostly dominated by
gamers and now you can see that their
channels are slowly moving out of the
picture not to say that they are not
getting views but in terms of metrics
they are not doing very well and I think
as of the start of this year you are
seeing new youtubers I don't know who
else is in the in the ranks especially
the Viners the people who moved over
from vine and onto YouTube and started
uploading their content there they have
gained massive popularity so you tend to
ask yourself why is this happening why
are we seeing this generational switches
well you also have to understand that
the audience the audience also is aging
and they are going through a
generational switch now let me explain
let's say in the second generation with
PewDiePie let's say you started watching
those channels when you are 12 years old
right and you basically you basically
grow up it's 20 70 now you're basically
you have aged about five years more so
you're 17 now 17 or 18 now does that
content still appeal to you that's the
question you know because you could have
been watching and subscribe to their
channels when you're 12 but as you have
grown up
you've had to go to school you have
basically I've had to you've gone
through high school on guessing and you
probably start in college and what
happens when you start college you
basically you lose interest in these
types of things you spend depending on
what degree you're doing but what about
crime the point I'm trying to put across
is that people maybe at that time when
were watching K size videos or PD PI's
videos I'm just using these three
channels as an example because they are
the most I think they had the most
powerful subscriber base at one point
not anymore go you're starting to see
that the audience is ageing the audience
and when I say aging I don't mean
they're becoming old they're just
growing up and they they therefore have
basically prioritize things in their
life and YouTube isn't a priority from
the content creators point of view it's
a huge problem it really is a huge
problem because as I'm saying I'm for
example I could have started watching
case I had 15 maybe during the summer
holidays on weekends every day every
afternoon after school but then you
understand that okay I move into my
final year of high school I have to
start focusing more on studies so I
stopped watching it all together and
maybe I just I just lose interest on
YouTube you know as a as a as a
basically as a as a member of the
audience you know of a specific camera
so I stopped watching his channel for
some reason I don't have the time or I
just forget about it you know really I
just don't pay attention to it that much
and you're starting to see this with
channels you know that have you can see
a very niche type of audience of let's
say 12 to maybe 18 years of being the
most prominent demographic there whether
it's male or female
at one point these the the audience is
going to grow up and it's probably going
to get a job you know and are you trying
to tell me that they're going to be
watching your videos all day no they
aren't but the silver lining is and this
is the point I was going to make is that
there is a newer they're newer children
coming up also the you know of just turn
12 or 11 and they are basically being
targeted or have been targeted by
channels like Jake Paul and Logan Paul
you see that's the thing you always have
to appeal to the newer generation as
they come in because you can't stick
with your current generation and say you
know what these guys are fantastic
because it doesn't matter they're going
to grow up and you know maybe your loyal
fans will stay with you but for most of
the other people you just forget about
it you know you're not paying for a
subscription so it's really not
something you'd be obliged to watch so
you know you just forget about YouTube
and you start working on your career and
things like that so basically the appeal
of new audiences is I really haven't
nailed down what it is who you know what
oh really what do you think the younger
audience likes I have because I've tried
to understand it and I can't I my age
group I would consider myself a I was
born in the 90s so for me I think the
content that I'll be more interested the
most interested in was technology gaming
and maybe a bit of entertainment in
terms of comedy channels and stuff like
that but now you can see that there is
actually I've actually noticed this
gaming is actually lost a lot of
popularity not to say that people have
stopped playing games but the popularity
of the gaming on YouTube has decreased
you can see channels like as I said
captain sparkles who are doing minecraft
videos that has faded out and minecraft
videos aren't a very good way of getting
views nowadays so you're starting a new
type of video
and what I think this type of content is
is vlogging alright now that's not the
reason why I said I'm going to start
vlogging the reason I said I'm gonna
stop vlogging on the channel is because
it increases my interaction with you
guys that's the purpose of me basically
deciding to do that but you have to ask
yourself why does this appeal to the new
audience and again you also have to look
at why they only watch Logan and Jay
Paul's videos because I've met younger
kids and they basically what look and
Paul and Jay Paul because that's the
life they want to live you know the may
be the life of Lamborghinis and you know
fast cars and that type of lavish type
of lifestyle and I think that's a
problem because if you come to look at
it and you're starting to see these
young impressionable kids because I'm
guessing nowadays a ten-year-old kid
probably has a smartphone that has the
YouTube app on it probably as a laptop
probably has an access to the Internet I
am NOT saying that made me apply for
countries that are you know in a lot of
issues right now not forget that that
you know as fortunate as we may be to be
to actually have these these commodities
and luxuries some people don't have that
but that's beside the point
the problem that I think we're seeing
here is that the younger audience now we
are looking at these youtubers as role
models and when you end you have a role
model and you start following someone
you're basically trying to emulate what
they do now the thing is that the
lifestyles object and Logan Poehler I'm
going to use these two channels as an
example because I think it it it what
defines exactly what's happening now
you'll find that kids really like what
Jay Paul and Logan Paul are doing
probably because of the lifestyle
they're living you know the hassle-free
lifestyle without you know school
studying she working every day on a
career not to say that they aren't
working but their work is more in tune
with basically just documenting what
they're doing throughout the day
so you know you really have to ask
yourself you know what really is
appealing to this newer generation and
that's a tough question at the moment I
think as far as I know or what I've been
able to deduce there they are very keen
on these vlogging channels and maybe you
can say pranks and stuff like that
again that was another epidemic very
very very very recent in fact behold
it's just a prank bro epidemic which I
would say started in late 2014 maybe
even 2013 with big journals like vitaliy
and stuff like that anyway so basically
when it comes back to the older content
creators you're starting to see them
experience problems you know in terms of
because they have created a business or
they are making a living of their
YouTube channel and now they aren't
getting any views and it's not their
fault you know the audience has probably
grown up or just has no interest in that
type of content anymore so my advice to
those older creators is basically they
have to update their content so that it
appeals to the newer generation is they
can do that I think they have they still
have a good chance of doing YouTube
either as a business or for their
personal you know as as a form of living
- Turner
to earn a living really so yeah you know
they really have to understand that
there's a new audience coming in and you
have to start understanding what they
like so yeah that's something really
interesting that we have started to
notice again these are my opinions you
know this this is not what I'm trying to
say is the opinion of everybody but
please let me know what you guys think
as well I would love to hear your
thoughts on this whole youtube you know
the evolution of YouTube and the fact
that YouTube has become a platform that
so diverse in terms of its content and
again the content creators all doing
unique type of things but
yeah that's basically it I mean YouTube
has grown so much over the years it's
really changed as a platform I think
from any perspective you look at it from
an advertisers perspective it's a
perfect place to advertise your product
because of the huge user base of viewer
base or the amount of views they get per
day you know from a content creators
perspective it's the perfect place for
you to start uploading videos and trying
to reach as many people as you can and
from from a viewers perspective it's the
perfect place to get really any debt any
type of video that you're looking for
whether you're looking for tutorials
you're looking for football videos
you're looking for music you're looking
for technology you're looking for
vlogging it's such a diverse platform
that I think a lot of people fail to
understand this actually really really
has been there for quite a while now and
a lot of changes happening but probably
you're Bill oblivious to it and you may
be sitting there and asking yourself you
know what happened to that YouTube I
used to watch I can't remember the name
I used to watch these videos but it just
got boring and yeah there are newer
youtubers who appealed to me so YouTube
is that's the type of game it is you
know you really as a content creator
from a content creators perspective you
really have to be adaptable to the
audience and just make sure that your
you know your your content is
appropriate for the current audience on
YouTube anyway guys that was it for this
